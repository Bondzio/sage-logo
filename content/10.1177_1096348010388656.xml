<abstract>
<p>To better understand seniors’ intentions in visiting casinos, this study proposed an extension of the theory of planned behavior (TPB) with casino gaming motivation. The results of this study suggest that among motivations for seniors to visit casinos, winning and enjoyment directly and positively affected behavioral intentions, and all predictable variables of TPB positively affected seniors’ casino visiting intentions. Contrary to our expectations, past casino visits did not have a moderating effect on the relationships between the major TPB variables (attitude, subjective norm, and perceived behavioral control) casino motivation and behavioral intentions. The overall study results suggest that the proposed extended model is a useful tool for explaining seniors’ casino visiting intentions. Some theoretical and practical implications for casino operations are also discussed.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Much of the senior leisure literature reports the growing popularity of casinos as an attractive leisure outing and entertainment for seniors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1096348010388656">T. L. Moore, 2001</xref>). With an increasing number of legalized casinos in the United States, more seniors visit casinos, especially with incentives (e.g., free bus transportation, inexpensive or free buffets, and discounted hotel accommodations) tailored to the senior age group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1096348010388656">Gosker, 1999</xref>). Despite the harsh casino environment of loud noise and crowds, many older people still sit in casinos for extended hours and spend significant amounts of money in casinos. Why do some seniors visit casinos often? What are the important determinants of seniors’ casino visiting intentions? These questions are very important in understanding the senior market more precisely, but as of yet they have not been clearly answered.</p>
<p>Previous studies in senior gaming have explained some of seniors’ gaming behaviors by exploring their gaming motivations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1096348010388656">Cotte, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1096348010388656">Hagen, Nixon, &amp; Solowoniuk, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1096348010388656">Hope &amp; Havir, 2002</xref>). These qualitative studies and observational reports have identified seniors’ motivations, which may indeed critically influence seniors’ casino visitation. However, most of these studies were descriptive and generally not tested statistically to gauge the actual influence of seniors’ motivations on future casino visiting intentions or behavior.</p>
<p>To comprehend human behaviors, various behavioral theories have been applied in past studies. Among them, the theory of planned behavior (TPB) has successfully explained a wide range of behaviors based on behavioral intention (BI). The three key determinants of the theory attitude, subjective norm, and perceived behavioral control, can also be useful for understanding senior gaming behavioral intentions. A positive senior attitude toward casino gaming should lead to more participation. The subjective norm refers to support from other people important to seniors. Even with the improved image of traditional casino gaming, what others think of the activity might significantly influence seniors’ decisions to play casino games. Because not every gaming behavior is volitional (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1096348010388656">Evans, 2003</xref>), applying perceived behavioral control is necessary to investigate different levels of gaming behaviors. For instance, seniors who play casino games mainly for leisure would have more volitional control, whereas seniors playing more seriously or habitually would not have complete volitional control. However, the TPB model does not take motivation into account in measuring behavioral intention or the context of the actual behaviors. Because motivation prompts individuals to act on a given behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1096348010388656">Petri, 1981</xref>), it has a direct and specific influence on behavior. In an effort to understand senior casino gaming behavior, it seems logical to combine motivation and the three predictable variables in the TPB to investigate these behaviors more inclusively. To the best of our knowledge, this comprehensive approach to understanding senior casino gaming intentions has not been explored.</p>
<p>Moreover, past experience is another important variable in understanding seniors’ casino visiting intentions. Many human behavior theorists have stated that the frequency of pertinent past behavior is the best predictor of behavioral intentions and future behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1096348010388656">Triandis, 1980</xref>). With repetition and practice of a behavior in a given setting, people tend to repeat behavior without paying much attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1096348010388656">Quellette &amp; Wood, 1998</xref>). Habitual casino goers usually do not evaluate the consequences of participating in casino gaming before they act (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1096348010388656">Quellette &amp; Wood, 1998</xref>). If a senior habitually engages in casino gaming, that person has no need to perform evaluations or reasoning; he or she can just participate in gaming. Many empirical studies have supported including past behavior as a predictor of behavioral intentions and future behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1096348010388656">Bagozzi, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1096348010388656">Bentler &amp; Speckart, 1981</xref>) in the TPB. However, including past experience as a direct predictor may weaken the predictive power of the three determinants (attitude, subjective norm, and perceived behavior control), a concern that has merit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1096348010388656">Trafimow, 2000</xref>). When repeated past casino behavior is the strongest variable in the model, the other variables do not add much further information. Accordingly, the literature has suggested that including past experience would improve the predictive power for more habitual behaviors, but not for novel behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1096348010388656">Conner &amp; Armitage, 1998</xref>). Thus, seniors’ past casino gaming experiences might explain regular casino goers’ actions. However, seniors’ past casino gaming experiences could still provide additional explanations of gaming behaviors, so it is important to include it in the model as well. Investigating how differences in the major antecedents affect behavioral intentions based on the level of a senior’s past casino gaming experience would provide more meaningful insight into seniors’ casino gaming intentions without reducing the predictive power of the major antecedents. Thus, this study will test the moderating effect of past casino gaming experience between the predictor variables and intention to determine the role of predictor variables relative to intention and gain a more accurate understanding of the role of seniors’ past casino experiences.</p>
<p>In light of the significance of the senior segment to the casino market and the lack of theory-based literature on seniors’ behavior toward casinos, this study attempted to fill the research niche by proposing and testing an extended TPB model. More specifically, the objectives of this study were (a) to investigate the important antecedents of senior casino visiting intention by combining senior casino motivation and the determinants of the TPB (attitude, subjective norm, and perceived behavioral control) into an extended model and (b) to explore the moderating effects of seniors’ past casino experience on the relationships between each determinant variable (the three previously listed and motivation) and behavioral intentions.</p>

<title>Senior Gaming Motivations</title>
<p>In the past few decades, casino gaming has gained exposure as a new form of recreation and entertainment for the senior population; as a result, many researchers and marketers have initiated studies to learn more about this market. While profiling the older casino gaming market, researchers have debated the underlying motives of senior casino gamblers. Motivation has been recognized in the literature as an important driving force encouraging participants to engage in different types of behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1096348010388656">Jang, Bai, Hu, &amp; Wu, 2009</xref>). Motivation is the key element influencing seniors’ decision-making processes in patronizing a casino and, thus, a better understanding will help casino operators meet senior casino visitors’ diverse needs.</p>
<p>Several senior gaming motivations can be identified from the existing literature. Escaping from their ordinary routine is one motivation for seniors to participate in gambling. Seniors have reported that they want to get away from their normal living environment, such as retirement communities or senior care facilities. Lifestyle changes that often accompany aging (widowhood, declining health, and learning to live on fixed incomes) can act as catalysts for negative feelings. Seniors can also be lonely and bored with uneventful living environments or a lack of social involvement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1096348010388656">Sullivan, 2001</xref>). They might be attracted to casino gaming as a release for some of their negative feelings and boredom. In fact, casinos can be a perfect platform for temporarily forgetting negative feelings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1096348010388656">Smith &amp; Abt, 1984</xref>). Relieving feelings of isolation, loneliness, and boredom is cited as the number one reason middle-aged and older women gamble (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1096348010388656">Chrostowski, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>The biggest attraction for older adults visiting casinos is the fun and excitement of the casino experience. The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1096348010388656">Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority (1996)</xref> claimed that casinos could provide a special form of excitement and entertainment. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1096348010388656">Hope and Havir (2002)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1096348010388656">McNeilly and Burke (2001)</xref> found that casino gaming has become a popular form of entertainment for most senior participants. Other studies have found similar results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1096348010388656">American Gaming Association, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1096348010388656">National Opinion Research Center, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1096348010388656">O’Brien Cousins, Withcer, &amp; Moodie, 2002</xref>). Just being in a casino can be fun. Something is always happening in gaming halls. Watching people win or just passing time can be very entertaining for seniors. The bright lights in the gaming halls and sounds from game machines can provide a multisensory experience for seniors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1096348010388656">Loroz, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Seniors might also participate in casino gambling for the opportunity to interact socially with others. Most elderly female participants from Michigan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1096348010388656">Tarras, Singh, &amp; Moufakkir, 2000</xref>) and elderly Detroit residents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1096348010388656">Zaranek &amp; Chapleski, 2005</xref>) considered going to casinos an opportunity for social activity. In relation to the first motivation, trips to a casino provide seniors with a chance to meet and talk to other people outside of their daily routines. Interestingly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1096348010388656">McNeilly and Burke (2001)</xref> found that many seniors take more day-trips to casinos than any other social activity, such as trips to shopping malls, local libraries, zoos, theaters, or restaurants. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1096348010388656">Hagen et al. (2005)</xref> also found that among the participants in their study, gambling was viewed as a “pleasant social activity.” The social aspects of gambling also helped participants combat loneliness.</p>
<p>Life experiences may further explain seniors’ attraction to casino gambling. Many seniors 65 years and older were raised during the Great Depression, and casino gambling was something they could not afford to enjoy. They had nothing to waste, and they worked hard for their money. Spending money on any type of entertainment or recreation was unimaginable when they barely made enough to make ends meet. Not only did they have little money to spend on gambling, it was also not legally available or acceptable when they grew up. Gambling was also considered sinful under the cultural norms of the time. Socially and personally, the situation is now very different. Casino gaming is viewed as a pleasant and legal leisure activity. After providing for all the needs of their families, and with more time and income at their disposal, seniors can now afford an interest in casino gaming. With the availability of casino gambling in their later life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1096348010388656">Hope &amp; Havir, 2002</xref>), seniors may be curious about this leisure activity, making curiosity another major motivation for casino activity.</p>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1096348010388656">Hope and Havir (2002)</xref>, the prospect of winning money is not a major motive for seniors playing casino games. However, they also found that men tended to be more curious and more likely to go to win money than women, who were more likely to go for fun. The money seniors spend on their gaming (money lost) at the casino is viewed as entertainment expenses, just as they would spend money on any other type of leisure or recreational activity. Most of these seniors are fully aware that the odds are always against them and set their limits for responsible gambling. However, some older adults go to casinos to win money, and it is difficult to entirely disregard winning money as a reason seniors play casino games.</p>
<p>In sum, the five most common senior motivations for visiting casinos extracted from past studies include escaping, enjoyment (fun, excitement, and entertainment), socializing, curiosity, and winning. These five motivation dimensions were thus used for further analysis in this study.</p>

<title>Theory of Planned Behavior</title>
<p>The main concept of TPB is that most human behavior is under volitional control. People engage in actions because they want to act in a certain behavioral way, and their conscious motives trigger them to engage in that action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1096348010388656">Ajzen &amp; Fishbein, 1980</xref>). Volitional behaviors are influenced by behavioral intention, which is the likelihood to act (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1096348010388656">Fishbein &amp; Ajzen, 1975</xref>) and the immediate determinant of a behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1096348010388656">Ajzen, 1985</xref>). Senior casino gaming behavior and behavioral intentions can be expressed in the following algebraic equation:</p>

</disp-formula></p>
<p>where <italic>B</italic> is the expected casino gaming behavior and <italic>BI</italic> is senior casino gaming (behavioral) intention. The approximate sign (≈) between <italic>B</italic> and <italic>BI</italic> indicates that measuring gaming intention can predict seniors’ gaming behaviors only when the intention does not change from the predictors of intention. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1096348010388656">Fishbein and Ajzen (1975)</xref> suggested that the proximal cause of a behavior is the intention to enact the behavior. This means that researchers need an accurate measurement of casino gaming intention to fully understand senior casino gaming. The antecedents of intentions are better understood than the antecedents of behavior, so this study aims only to accurately measure senior casino gaming intention, not the behavior itself. <italic>AT</italic> in the equation is thus seniors’ attitudes toward casinos, <italic>SN</italic> is the subjective norm, and <italic>PBC</italic> is perceived behavioral control. The signs <italic>w</italic><sub>1</sub> through <italic>w</italic><sub>3</sub> are empirical weights indicating the relative importance of the three terms in the model.</p>
<p>TPB claims that attitude toward a behavior is, at the most basic level, a function of behavioral beliefs and outcome evaluations. Attitude thus derives from behavioral beliefs, referring to the subjective probability that a person’s behavior will lead to a certain consequence. This also includes outcome evaluations, which refer to a person’s evaluation of each consequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1096348010388656">Ajzen &amp; Fishbein, 1980</xref>). The value of the outcome evaluation contributes to the attitude toward the behavior. Applied to senior casino patronage, a senior who perceives the consequences of going to casinos as positive and considers these consequences important would have a favorable attitude toward visiting casinos. He or she might evaluate playing casino games as an activity that provides fun, excitement, and the opportunity to meet people and may thus view these as important outcomes of going to a casino. Thus, this individual holds a positive attitude toward casinos and is more likely to intend to visit a casino (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1096348010388656">S. Moore &amp; Ohtsuka, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1096348010388656">Oh &amp; Hsu, 2001</xref>). On the other hand, a senior who believes that casinos are sinful places and a way to take people’s money, outcomes they consider negative, will hold a negative attitude toward casinos. Thus, he or she is less likely to visit a casino to play games.</p>
<p>Subjective norm refers to the perceived social pressure from important others to perform or not to perform a behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1096348010388656">Ajzen &amp; Fishbein, 1980</xref>). People are more likely to perform a behavior when they get support from their referents than when they do not get support from their referents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1096348010388656">Ajzen &amp; Fishbein, 1980</xref>). Subjective norm is also determined by an individual’s normative beliefs and motivation to comply with the beliefs of others who are important to them. Normative beliefs are based on perceptions of other people’s preferences about whether an individual should or should not perform a behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1096348010388656">Ajzen &amp; Fishbein, 1980</xref>). In terms of casino gaming behavior, normative beliefs can be measured by rating the statement “my spouse thinks that I should/should not participate in casino gaming.” The motivation to comply is the individual’s tendency to conform to the expectations of people who are important to them. It is the level of a person’s willingness to act in accordance with the ways in which their referents want them to act. For example, one can measure the level of motivation to comply by rating the statement “I want to do what my spouse thinks that I should do.” Here, the individual’s decision to play casino games relies heavily on the referent’s (spouse) approval or disapproval of casino gaming. When a senior believes that his or her most important referents (e.g., spouse, children, and friends) approve of casino gaming, then he or she is more likely to go to a casino to game.</p>
<p>Perceived behavioral control is the degree to which an individual feels that the performance or nonperformance of the behavior in question is under his or her volitional control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1096348010388656">Ajzen, 1985</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1096348010388656">1988</xref>). It is “the person’s belief as to how easy and difficult performance of the behavior is likely to be” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1096348010388656">Ajzen &amp; Madden, 1986</xref>, p. 457). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1096348010388656">Ajzen (2002)</xref> asserted that, all else being equal, having a high level of perceived control reinforces an individual’s intention to perform a behavior and increases his or her effort and determination to act on the behavior. Perceived behavioral control is determined by control beliefs, referring to a person’s beliefs about the presence of factors that may facilitate or impede performance of the behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1096348010388656">Ajzen, 2001</xref>). Perceived behavioral control is measured by multiplying the strength of their beliefs and the power of the control factor to facilitate or inhibit the performance of a behavior; the resulting products can then be summed up across all control beliefs. Seniors’ casino patronage decisions could be influenced by various perceived constraints and barriers. Inhibiting factors could be either internal (e.g., skills, abilities, poor health) or external (e.g., time, transportation, insufficient financial resources). For instance, even if someone has a positive attitude toward casino gaming and approval from important referents, if the individual does not live close to a casino or does not have transportation to a casino, casino gaming will be perceived as a difficult activity. Therefore, the intention to participate in casino gaming will decrease. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1096348010388656">Oh and Hsu (2001)</xref> studied the role of perceived behavioral control by measuring four control factors (budgetary affordability, time availability, self-control, and gambling skills) and found that all control factors except budgetary affordability significantly affected gambling behavioral intention.</p>

<sec id="section5-1096348010388656">
<title>Past Experience</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1096348010388656">Trafimow (2000)</xref> claimed that when a person engages in novel behaviors, the variables (attitude, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral controls) used in the TPB will predict the intention well. However, when a person engages in a behavior out of habit, the predictive power of the variables will be reduced. Accordingly, many empirical studies include past behavior as a predictor of behavioral intentions and future behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1096348010388656">Bentler &amp; Speckart, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1096348010388656">Quellette &amp; Wood, 1998</xref>) in the TPB. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1096348010388656">Triandis (1980)</xref> first suggested including past behavior in the TPB, noting that learned behavior from repeated performance is another cause of behavior. This line of theoretical development posits that if an individual habitually engages in a particular behavior, that person has no need to perform the evaluations and reasoning assumed by the TPB. For example, seniors who have already participated in casino gambling might not go through the cognitive evaluations (attitude, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral controls), making their decision based on past experience instead. They will be more familiar with various facilities, services, types of machines and games, and even people in the casinos than seniors who have not visited casinos at all or do not go to casinos regularly. Behaviors that are more habitual than planned can be measured directly from the repeated past performance of the behavior. The direct effect of past casino experience on intentions means that seniors who have been to casinos in the past and who are regular casino goers are more likely to visit casinos without hesitation.</p>
<p>This research investigates whether attitude, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral controls, along with motivation, influence seniors’ casino patronage intentions differently based on whether seniors perceive themselves as regular or irregular casino patrons. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1096348010388656">Ajzen (1991)</xref> explained, the relative importance of attitude, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral controls in predicting behavioral intention should vary across behaviors and situations; thus, investigating the moderating effects of seniors’ past casino experiences in the model should enhance our understanding of senior casino patronage behaviors. In summary, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1096348010388656">Figure 1</xref> exhibits the extended TPB model to explain senior casino gaming intention.</p>

<title>Measurement of Variables</title>
<p>We set up a questionnaire with three parts. The first part assessed the TPB model based on three levels, behavioral intentions based on the three predictor variables (attitude, subjective norm, and perceived behavioral control), each rooted in a relevant belief (behavioral beliefs for attitude, normative beliefs for subjective norm, and control beliefs for perceived behavioral control; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1096348010388656">Ajzen, 2002</xref>). For attitude, respondents assessed their attitude toward casino gaming based on the statement “All things considered, for me, going to a casino would be _______ . . .” A set of six bipolar adjectives were provided for respondents to complete the sentence: not enjoyable/enjoyable, unpleasant/pleasant, bad/good, boring/fun, harmful/beneficial, and foolish/wise. The attitude construct is based on a behavioral belief, the sum of the belief strength multiplied by the outcome evaluation (∑<italic>bb<sub>i</sub></italic> · <italic>be<sub>i</sub></italic>). Thus, two questions were asked for each of the four items based on a 7-point Likert-type scale. For behavioral beliefs (<italic>bb<sub>i</sub></italic>), respondents evaluated their belief strengths based on four benefits of visiting casinos. For the outcome evaluations (<italic>be<sub>i</sub></italic>), respondents evaluated four salient beliefs about visiting casinos.</p>
<p>Subjective norm was tested by asking respondents to rate a relevant referent’s level of approval of the respondent patronizing a casino. Three relevant referents were extracted from leisure literature on older adults: spouses, children, and friends. Both 7-point Likert-type and semantic differential scales were used. Next, subjective norm was represented by a normative belief construct, which is the sum of normative beliefs (<italic>nb<sub>i</sub></italic>) multiplied by the motivation to comply (<italic>mc<sub>i</sub></italic>) with each referent group (∑<italic>nb<sub>i</sub></italic> · <italic>mc<sub>i</sub></italic>). The normative beliefs (<italic>nb<sub>i</sub></italic>) were measured by asking respondents to rate on a 7-point scale the level of influence each referent group has on the respondent’s decision to visit a casino. Motivation to comply (<italic>mc<sub>i</sub></italic>) was measured by a respondent’s general motivation to comply with his or her referent’s opinion, using a 7-point scale.</p>
<p>Perceived behavioral control was tested, using both 7-point Likert-type and semantic differential scales, by asking questions about respondents’ confidence in visiting casinos. This was determined by testing respondents’ self-efficacy for and control over going to casinos. The point of determining self-efficacy was to measure how easy or hard it was to get to a casino. The point of determining controllability was to measure how much personal control respondents have over going to casinos. The control belief is the basis for perceived behavioral control. Three control belief items (transportation, proximity to a casino, and health conditions) were identified from the senior leisure literature. Control beliefs reflect perceived behavioral control and consist of two parts, control beliefs (<italic>cb<sub>i</sub></italic>) and perceived control power (<italic>pp<sub>i</sub></italic>). Control beliefs (<italic>cb<sub>i</sub></italic>) were measured by asking respondents to rate how much each of the control belief items influenced their decision to go to a casino using a 7-point Likert-type scale. Perceived control power (<italic>pp<sub>i</sub></italic>) was measured using a 7-point Likert-type scale by asking the respondents the level of self-control they believed they had over each of the control beliefs. The control belief construct is also the sum (∑<italic>cb<sub>i</sub></italic> · <italic>pp<sub>i</sub></italic>) of control beliefs (<italic>cb<sub>i</sub></italic>) multiplied by perceived control power (<italic>pp<sub>i</sub></italic>).</p>
<p>The questionnaire also asked respondents to evaluate the level of their motivation to go to a casino. A statement, “If I were to go to a casino, I would go there to _______. . .,” was presented. Thirty-four items drawn from existing gaming motivation studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1096348010388656">Chantal, Vallerand, &amp; Vallières, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1096348010388656">Lee, Lee, Bernhard, &amp; Yoon, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1096348010388656">Neighbors, Lostutter, Cronce, &amp; Larimer, 2002</xref>) were provided to complete the sentence.</p>
<p>Respondents’ intentions to visit casinos in the future were measured using three questions that probed their likelihood of visiting casinos in the near future. These three questions were all modified from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1096348010388656">Ajzen’s (2002)</xref> study: “I would like to visit a casino in the near future”; “I intend to visit a casino in the near future”; “I plan to visit a casino in the near future.” Respondents’ past casino visits were measured by asking whether they regularly visited casinos. The respondents’ demographic information, gender, ethnic background, education, and annual income, was also collected.</p>

<title>Data Collection</title>
<p>In this study, seniors are defined as those who are 65 years and older (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1096348010388656">Jang &amp; Ham, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1096348010388656">Jang, Ham, &amp; Hong, 2007</xref>).The target population for this study was a consumer database of U.S. citizens who are 65 years or older. An online survey was administered using an external market research firm that maintains a by-invitation-only panelist database. Each person invited to be a panelist had to answer a list of questions sent by the research firm. The online questionnaires were distributed to the panelists via e-mail invitations. A soft launch was conducted to ensure the proper functioning of the survey and e-mailing system. Sixty one completed responses were collected in the soft launch and were used in a pilot test of the study. All Cronbach’s alphas ranged from .95 (intention) to .72 (behavioral beliefs), which is sufficient for internal consistency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1096348010388656">Nunnally, 1978</xref>). The main launch went out to 5,000 e-mail addresses, and a total of 681 participants filled in the survey questionnaire. The response rate was 13.62%. Of the 681 respondents, 61.1% were female (<italic>n</italic> = 418) and 38.5% were male (<italic>n</italic> = 263). Most respondents (92%, <italic>n</italic> = 629) were Caucasian/White, highly educated (53.2%, 4-year college or graduate degree), and married (72.1%, <italic>n</italic> = 493). A total of 66% of the respondents reported a household income of more than $40,000 in the previous year (64.4%, <italic>n</italic> = 440), owned their homes (90.4%, <italic>n</italic> = 618), and were retired (54.1%, <italic>n</italic> = 370).</p>

<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>The data were screened for any violations of underlying assumptions by conducting descriptive statistics using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS v. 17). The multivariate and univariate outliers were checked. All cases were retained for further analysis. The data were then analyzed according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1096348010388656">Anderson and Gerbing’s (1988)</xref> two-step approach, which involves a preliminary step of confirmatory factory analysis (CFA) to test whether the measured variables reliably reflect the hypothesized latent variables using AMOS (analysis of moment structures), a statistical analytic software used in implementing structural equation modeling (SEM; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1096348010388656">Arbuckle, 2007</xref>). First, construct reliability and validity of the construct measurements were tested, as well as the overall fit of the measurement model. Then, the structural model was tested to investigate the relationships among the constructs. Finally, metric invariance (i.e., measurement and structural invariance) tests were conducted to assess the moderating effect of seniors’ past casino experiences.</p>
<p>Before doing the two-step analysis, the motivation measurement items were purified, and the scale’s psychometric properties were examined using various tests, such as item analyses, exploratory factor analyses (EFAs), CFA, assessments of scale reliability, and unidimensionality, as well as convergent and discriminant validity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1096348010388656">Anderson &amp; Gerbing, 1988</xref>). Seven items exhibited low correlations (.5 or less) and were deleted after careful consideration. An EFA with varimax rotation was carried out using the 27 remaining motivation items. Six more items with low communalities, high cross-loadings, and low loadings were deleted. At this point, 21 motivation items remained, representing five motivation factors, which are Winning, Socializing, Enjoyment, Curiosity, and Escaping. The cumulative total variance explained approximately 67.93% of the factors. The Kaiser–Meyer–Olkin measuring of sample accuracy was .90, well above the recommended threshold of .60 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1096348010388656">Tabachnick &amp; Fidell, 2001</xref>). All five factors had Cronbach’s alphas higher than .70, indicating good reliability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1096348010388656">Hair, Anderson, Tatham, &amp; Black, 1998</xref>). A confirmatory factor model using the maximum likelihood method was estimated to improve measurement properties in the proposed scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1096348010388656">Anderson &amp; Gerbing, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1096348010388656">Bagozzi, 1980</xref>). The model fit indices from the initial CFA did not show an acceptable threshold, χ<sup>2</sup>(121) = 487.58, <italic>p</italic> = .000; normative fit index (NFI) = .88; comparative fit index (CFI) = .91; root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) = .082. Three more items were deleted after inspection of item squared multiple correlations and modification indices. The results of the second CFA using 18 items showed improved model fit, χ<sup>2</sup>(117) = 383.01, <italic>p</italic> = .000; NFI = .91; CFI = .93; RMSEA = .07. The result of the final CFA indicated that each observed item on the latent constructs showed high loadings from .64 to .83. The Cronbach’s alpha estimates ranged from .70 to .87, and all average variances extracted (AVE) ranged from .51 to .60, indicating acceptable reliability. We also compared the AVE with the squared correlations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1096348010388656">Fornell &amp; Larcker, 1981</xref>) and found that the squared correlations (ranging from .12 to .28) between each pair of constructs were all less than the AVE (ranging from .51 to .60), providing evidence of discriminant validity. More detailed information about this process can be found in a study done by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1096348010388656">Phillips, Jang, and Canter (2010)</xref>.</p>
<p>To make the model more parsimonious, senior casino visiting intention was regressed against all five motivation factors (Winning, Socializing, Enjoyment, Curiosity, and Escaping). The test showed that the dimensions Socializing (β = 1.17, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) and Escaping (β = .99, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) did not significantly influence casino visiting intention. Thus, two motivation constructs, Socializing and Escaping, were deleted from the model and only Winning, Enjoyment, and Curiosity were included for further analysis in testing the model.</p>

<title>Measurement Model</title>
<p>A CFA for the proposed model using 10 constructs (attitude, behavioral beliefs, subjective norm, normative beliefs, perceived behavioral control, control beliefs, Winning, Enjoyment, Curiosity, and Intention) was then conducted, and the model showed an acceptable level of fit indices, χ<sup>2</sup>(355) = 1230.9, <italic>p</italic> = .00; NFI = .93; CFI = .95; RMSEA = .05. Overall, the measurement model showed a good fit for the data. Convergent validity was assessed by the significant loadings between the observed variables and each latent variable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1096348010388656">Anderson &amp; Gerbing, 1988</xref>). All observed variables were loaded at least .50 on their delegated latent variables and were statistically significant (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1096348010388656">Table 1</xref>, all AVE were more than the recommended threshold value of .50 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1096348010388656">Fornell &amp; Larcker, 1981</xref>), ranging from .55 to.88, which supported adequate internal consistency. Next, the composite reliabilities of all constructs exceeded the cutoff value of .70 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1096348010388656">Hair et al., 1998</xref>), ranging from .71 to .96. Thus, the multiple item scales were acceptable for measuring each of the constructs. Comparing the AVE with the squared correlations between constructs tested for discriminant validity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1096348010388656">Fornell &amp; Larcker, 1981</xref>). The squared correlations between each pair of constructs were all less than the AVE. Thus, discriminant validity was satisfied. Overall, the measurement model showed good fit to the data.</p>

<title>Structural Model</title>
<p>A structural model was estimated to examine the hypothesized relationships in the extended TPB model with external constructs of senior gaming motivations.

<p>The unexpected significant negative relationship between Curiosity and intention can be explained by a suppressor variable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1096348010388656">Horst, 1941</xref>). To determine if the negative relationship between Curiosity and intention was affected by a suppressor, a series of regression analyses was conducted. The analysis showed that two other motivation factors, Winning and Enjoyment, had something to do with the suppression effect. When these two variables are combined with Curiosity, Winning makes the relationship between Curiosity and intention insignificant (β = −.04) and Enjoyment makes the relationship even more negatively significant (β = −.25). This is a negative suppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1096348010388656">Darlington, 1968</xref>), which occurs when a variable (Curiosity, in this case) has a negative weight after being included in a regression equation where all the variables have positive intercorrelations. This negative suppression could be caused by a variable in the regression equation that has a negative correlation with the dependant variable or a variable that has a high correlation with another predictive variable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1096348010388656">McNemar, 1945</xref>). However, neither of these cases seems relevant to this study. None of the variables showed a negative correlation with the criterion variable, and the primary independent variables within the TPB model have acceptable correlations (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1096348010388656">Table 1</xref>). The multicollinearity among independent variables does not seem to have caused the negative suppression either.</p>

<title>Measurement Invariance and Structural Invariance Test</title>
<p>The moderating effects of past casino experience were examined by testing the measurement invariance. First, the sample was split between regular casino visitors and irregular casino visitors. Of the 681 total samples, 533 considered themselves regular casino visitors, and 148 considered themselves irregular visitors. Measurement invariance was accessed by conducting chi-square difference tests. A model is invariant, and full invariance is supported, when no significant chi-square difference exists between the nonrestricted model and the full metric invariance model (restricting factor loadings across two groups; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1096348010388656">Yoo, 2002</xref>). The moderating effects of past casino visits between predictor variables (attitude, subjective norm, perceived behavioral control, and motivations) and intention were the focus of this study. Therefore, attitude, subjective norm, perceived behavioral control; three motivation factors (Winning, Enjoyment, and Curiosity); and intention were included in the chi-square testing model.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1096348010388656">Table 3</xref> shows the results of the measurement invariance test. The chi-square difference was significant between the freely estimated base model and the fully restricted model, Δχ<sup>2</sup>(16) = 46.5, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01; full metric invariance was not supported. This means that the factor loadings between casino visitors and nonvisitors were not the same. When full metric invariance is not supported, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1096348010388656">Yoo (2002)</xref> recommends a partial invariance test. After a careful examination of the modification indices and changes in parameter, four of the invariance constraints across two groups were relaxed, and a partial metric invariance model was supported, Δχ<sup>2</sup>(12) = 17, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .01.</p>

<p>A structural invariance test assessed whether the parameter estimates were equivalent across the two groups. The test was performed much like the measurement invariance test. First, to create the base model, a structural equation model (partial metric invariance) was simultaneously estimated across regular visitor and irregular visitor groups. A chi-square difference test was conducted between the base model (the partial metric invariance of CFA) and a full metric invariance structural model in which all proposed causal paths were fixed to be invariant across the groups. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1096348010388656">Table 4</xref>, both models fit the data well. The results showed that the chi-square difference between the partial metric invariance SEM and the full path invariance model was insignificant (<italic>p</italic> &gt; .05), indicating that the paths across regular casino visitors and irregular visitors were not different.</p>

<title>Discussion and Conclusions</title>
<p>This study proposed and tested an extended TPB model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1096348010388656">Ajzen, 1985</xref>), adding senior motivation as another predictor variable to explain seniors’ casino gaming intentions. The motivation variable adds more predictive power (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = .25 without motivation and <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = .33 with motivation) because it acts in parallel with attitude, subjective norm, and perceived behavioral control as determinants of intentions. The results showed all causal paths in the TPB model other than the paths between control beliefs and perceived behavioral control were significant in the context of senior casino gaming. The extended model also showed that two of the three motivation factors (Winning and Enjoyment) significantly influenced senior casino gaming intentions. Metric invariance tests tested the moderating role of casino past experience in forming an intention to participate in casino outings in the future. The structural invariance test indicated that past casino experience did not moderate the effects of the predictors (attitude, subjective norm, perceived behavioral control, and motivation) on future intention. This means that the effect of seniors’ attitude, subjective norm, perceived behavioral control, and gaming motivation on gaming intention does not really change, whether seniors have regularly visited casinos or not.</p>
<p>The results have some meaningful implications. From a theoretical viewpoint, this study extends the TPB model by adding senior gaming motivation components, as well as testing past casino experience as a moderator between the major predictors and intention. The significant positive influence of the three major predictors (attitude, subjective norm, perceived behavioral control) of TPB on senior gaming intention might hold true for other age groups as well. Comparing this study’s results to those of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1096348010388656">Oh and Hsu’s (2001)</xref> study, based on the three predictors senior gaming intentions and behaviors do not seem to differ much from other age groups. However, the effect of seniors’ attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control on gaming intentions should still be interpreted differently than for the other age groups. In the past, seniors have viewed casinos and casino gaming more negatively than positively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1096348010388656">Feeney &amp; Maki, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1096348010388656">Hope &amp; Havir, 2002</xref>), possibly because casino gaming was illegal and, therefore, not available during their younger years. Thus, they had little chance to explore casino gaming until recently. Younger generations do not follow the same pattern, because casino gaming has been legal, and an acceptable leisure activity, for three decades now. This might have influenced them to create more positive attitudes toward casino gambling. Studies have reported that casino gambling is more acceptable to younger age groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1096348010388656">Mok &amp; Hraba, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1096348010388656">National Opinion Research Center, 1999</xref>). With the legalization of casino gaming and more casinos available, seniors’ attitudes toward casino gaming have become more positive, although some individuals may never change their early perceptions about casinos. Hence, life experience may shape seniors’ attitudes.</p>
<p>The senior subjective norm should also be read differently than for other age groups. Reference groups do change as people age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1096348010388656">Ryff, Stinger, &amp; Seltzer, 2002</xref>). After their children have left home, most seniors either live with their spouse at home or in senior community homes. If their closest companion is a spouse, after retirement social activities tend to be more limited, and seniors generally spend more time with their spouse enjoying shared leisure activities. Thus, seniors may regard their spouse’s opinion of certain types of leisure activities highly, and they are more likely to enjoy an activity that both spouses approve. In contrast, younger people might place more weight on the opinions of other important people in their lives, such as their peers and colleagues.</p>
<p>Perceived behavioral control should also be viewed differently for senior casino gaming behavior. Older people are challenged by both internal and external changes that may influence their sense of control. Seniors might perceive physiological and physical changes that come with aging (including reduced income, increasing health concerns, and limited social activities and independence) as uncontrollable stressors. This lack of control over many aspects of their lives may restrict seniors from many leisure activities that younger people enjoy. Thus, seniors may choose leisure activities that make them feel in control and competent. Casino gaming may allow seniors to exercise some control and independence. Casino gaming does not require much physical strength, skill, or knowledge, unlike other extreme leisure activities younger people enjoy. For this reason, slot machines are more popular for seniors than table games, which require a certain level of skill and knowledge.</p>
<p>In addition, this study attempted to explain senior casino intentions by adding gaming motivation as another direct predictor of behavioral intentions in the TPB model. Including gaming motivation should help explain senior casino behaviors more comprehensively. This study found that enjoyment was a main motive for senior casino gaming intentions. Casinos and casino gaming might provide seniors with enjoyment, fun, and entertainment. Seniors’ often have a different perspective from younger people on what is entertaining and fun. Seniors’ fundamental enjoyment may come from things they can do to fill up their leisure time, to overcome negative feelings stemming from poor health or grief from losing a spouse or friends, to increase social relationships, and to increase self-confidence and independence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1096348010388656">Jang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1096348010388656">Jang &amp; Wu, 2006</xref>). Casino gaming can induce more positive psychological well-being, which can then lead to overall life satisfaction for seniors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1096348010388656">Searle, Mahon, Seppo, Iso-Ahola, &amp; Sdrolias, 1995</xref>). Younger people, however, might focus more on the short-term fun and excitement available in casino gaming.</p>
<p>This study is also unique in that it tested the moderating effect of past casino experience on the relationship between predictors and intention. The study examined how the strength of each predictor variable (attitude, subjective norm, perceived behavioral control, and motivation) on behavioral intentions changes based on past casino experience. Although other extended TPB studies traditionally included past experience as another direct predictor of behavioral intentions, the results of this study did not support the proposed hypothesis. However, this idea is worth pursuing in future studies as a way to test the original predictors–behavioral intentions relationships and investigate the influence of past experience on these relationships at the same time. However, the dichotomous measurement of past experience in this study may be an issue. Other forms of measurement, such as casino trip frequency, might provide different results.</p>
<p>From a marketing viewpoint, casino hotels can still enhance their marketing based on the findings of this study. Attitude, subjective norm, perceived behavioral control, and senior gaming motivation might differ for seniors and younger groups. Although the casino industry has worked hard to build a positive image in the past few decades, many seniors’ attitudes toward casinos remain negative. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1096348010388656">Feeney and Maki (1997)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1096348010388656">Hope and Havir (2002)</xref> reported that most of their study respondents believe that they are not likely to obtain any benefit from casino gambling and gambling should be illegal. To address this, the industry needs to provide various help programs for problem and pathological gambling in a continuing effort to build a positive public image.</p>
<p>Casinos can implement promotions that use existing senior customers as a marketing tool. Given that current senior customers can influence spouses and friends, casinos can create and emphasize programs or activities that senior couples can enjoy together, so that participating spouses can invite their partners to the casino. Promotional programs, such as couples bingo night or special banquet dinners for two, can at least bring spouses or partners who do not usually patronize casinos in the door. This would be a useful tactic since seniors view social norms as important in deciding whether to visit casinos for leisure. When seniors’ important referents (spouses and friends) spend time in casinos, they most likely will also consider visiting a casino, despite any negative opinions of casinos. The easier it is, and the more perceived control they feel, the more likely it is that seniors will visit casinos. Accordingly, casinos could create a more senior-friendly atmosphere to ensure that senior customers feel in complete control at the casino. Additionally, casinos can offer smaller betting table game opportunities or designate some tables exclusively for senior customers so that seniors can learn more about table games and enjoy more time in casinos. Creating these types of opportunities can boost seniors’ overall sense of control in participating in casino gaming.</p>
<p>This study also found that winning money and enjoying the casino experience are additional factors that motivate seniors’ decisions to participate in casino gaming. Given these results, casinos can provide chances for senior players to win more frequently. Again, frequent and smaller payouts can create the perception of more chances to win, and publicizing these more frequent winnings might encourage more players to participate.</p>
<p>Although this research is important to the hospitality field, the study still has some limitations. First, the sample may not be representative of the general U.S. senior population because the data were collected through an online survey. That is, the sample may represent seniors with more education, so interpreting the results of this study requires caution. However, seniors’ Internet and computer usage continues to increase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1096348010388656">Guynn, 2002</xref>), particularly as younger baby boomers start entering the senior market. For future studies, we suggest combining web-based and traditional paper-based questionnaires to include people in the sample who do not have computer and Internet access.</p>
<p>Second, although the cause of the negative suppression is not obvious from the suppressed effect tests and correlations assessment, the unexpected negative significant coefficient between the motivation Curiosity and intention should be interpreted carefully. Removing those variables (Winning and Enjoyment) that might have influenced the negative relationship seems to be the simplest way to tackle the issue. However, the associated risks with discarding the predictors, especially since the exact cause is unknown, means this may not be a good option. Recognizing possible suppression effects is important in trying to determine the meanings of the significant negative relationship between the independent and dependent variables. The negative relationship between Curiosity and behavioral intentions means that the more curiosity a senior has, the less likely he or she is to intend to visit to a casino. One possible explanation is that 78% (<italic>n</italic> = 533) of the respondents perceived themselves as regular casino visitors. Visitors who are already familiar with various aspects of casino gaming have less curiosity to satisfy. This might also relate to the level of confidence or comfort in going to casinos. Having less curiosity means that the individual is not new to the environment and, thus, is comfortable being in the environment. This might lead to a high intention to visit. On the other hand, more curiosity means that the casino environment is new, and seniors, in accordance with issues with the results on perceived behavioral control, may not be very comfortable there. This discomfort could lead to a lower intention to visit. From this interpretation, the Curiosity motivation did not influence seniors’ intentions, contrary to what this study expected. Thus, the Curiosity factor of the senior casino dimension must be carefully examined in future studies.</p>
<p>Third, the findings of the metric invariance testing indicated that seniors’ past casino experiences did not moderate between predictor variables and casino visiting intention. Two things may explain this finding. First, most respondents (78%) perceived themselves as regular casino visitors. Thus, the study results better represent regular casino visitors rather than more irregular visitors. The results may have been different if the sample sizes of the two groups (users and nonusers) were more balanced. Future studies should test the model with more balanced sample sizes to examine the differences between the two groups more accurately. Furthermore, the dichotomous form of measurement (regular or irregular visitor), instead of a continuous variable (e.g., frequency of casino visits in the last 6 months) may explain the results. Using the frequency of casino visits as a measurement of habit strength (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1096348010388656">Verplanken et al., 1998</xref>) might provide different results for the moderating effect.</p>
<p>Fourth, this study also found that perceived behavioral control is not derived from beliefs about factors that could facilitate or impede seniors from engaging in casino activities. Many of these items were extracted from the senior leisure literature, so they might not specifically explain the control beliefs of seniors engaging in casino activities. A summative measurement approach between control belief strength and power can sometimes be problematic, since each control belief item measures different aspects of the control belief (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1096348010388656">Oh &amp; Hsu, 2001</xref>). If a senior has transportation but is not in good health or does not live close to a casino, this suggests a reason for the low reliability. To establish a better baseline model and avoid the reliability issue, each measurement item needs to be assessed separately, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1096348010388656">Oh and Hsu (2001)</xref> suggested. The insignificant low correlation between control belief and perceived behavioral control might also be related to the low variance explained in perceived behavioral control by control belief (1%), indicating no association between the two constructs. More elicitation studies should identify salient control beliefs for senior casino outing behaviors. Literature in gerontology claims that age-related changes in control beliefs also influence the psychological well-being of the elderly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1096348010388656">Perrig-Chiello, Perrig, &amp; Stahelin, 1999</xref>). Considering more specific life topics is necessary to measure the control belief of senior citizens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1096348010388656">Beisecker, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1096348010388656">Lachman, 1986</xref>). In these studies, control belief does not necessarily become more external with aging, but it does become more topic specific. More research would refine the definition of perceived behavioral control and allow developing more reliable measurement items for control beliefs.</p>
<p>This study attempted to take a more comprehensive approach to exploring senior casino gaming behaviors by applying an extended TPB model. Both senior leisure and human behavior studies will benefit from this. In addition, future senior casino research would have a theory based framework with which to measure seniors’ casino activities. Specifically, researchers of human behavior could include additional empirical evidence of the applicability of the TPB and the value of added variables of motivation components. Casino operations can also use the information on antecedents and their effects on seniors’ casino gaming intentions. Based on this information, casinos can modify their current marketing strategies or develop new marketing to better target senior populations.</p>
