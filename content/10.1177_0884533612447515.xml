<p>The theme for this issue of <italic>Nutrition in Clinical Practice</italic> is “Cardiovascular and Critical Illness.” The issue includes articles addressing nutrition implications of cardiovascular and circulatory problems that arise in critical illness as well as nutrition therapies for specific cardiovascular conditions such as cardiothoracic surgery or congestive heart failure. Dr Van Way, a surgeon and nutrition specialist, contributed an Invited Commentary highlighting his thoughts and viewpoints on the articles published this month. There are several excellent reviews in this issue. Muller and colleagues authored a succinct tutorial on invasive hemodynamic monitoring, focusing on the “how and why” of central venous catheters, pulmonary artery catheters, and arterial pulse-wave analysis. Dr Allen provides an excellent overview of inotropes and vasoactive substances; the article includes a helpful table on various vasoactive drugs used in the intensive care unit as well as the indications for their use and common gastrointestinal side effects. Dr Allen also includes a section in the article on enteral nutrition and vasoactive substances. An article by Cresci, Hummell, Raheem, and Cole focuses on nutrition and its role in acute myocardial infarction and coronary artery bypass surgery. The authors discuss mechanical circulatory support, gut perfusion, and nutrition support recommendations. Montgomery et al devote their entire article to the discussion of ventricular assist devices. The authors provide an informative overview of these devices and the circumstances in which they are used, in addition to nutrition assessment and nutrient delivery suggestions for these patients. Azizi-Namini and colleagues review heart failure and the specific role of each of the B vitamins in the management of heart failure. Drs Johnson, Driscoll, and O’Leary review protein-losing enteropathy associated with a specific cardiac surgery (Fontan procedure). The article summarizes nutrition, pharmacologic, and surgical therapies for protein-losing enteropathy. Finally, Dr Mullin’s CAM Corner highlights dietary treatments for cardiovascular diseases.</p>
<p>This issue should provide you with valuable background information as well as practical tips for nutritionally managing patients with cardiovascular and critical illness.</p>
