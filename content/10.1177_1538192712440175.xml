<p>The disparity between the educational attainment of Mexican heritage and White individuals illustrate a need for research on factors associated with the high educational attainment of some immigrant and first-generation students of Mexican descent. Using autobiographies, student interviews, and family interviews as data sources, this article explores one prominent theme that emerged: Students’ desire to honor parental struggle and sacrifice with academic achievement—<italic>Ganas</italic>. The implications and recommendations for further research are discussed.</p>

<body>
<p>One of the strongest and most consistent predictors of social mobility in the United States is educational attainment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1538192712440175">Chapa &amp; De La Rosa, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1538192712440175">Spring, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1538192712440175">Teachman, 1987</xref>). For students of color, and more specifically Latino/a students, there is significant disparity between their educational achievement and that of their White counterparts. Latino/a students have the lowest levels of educational attainment at every point in the educational pipeline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1538192712440175">Burciaga, Pérez Huber, &amp; Solorzano, 2010</xref>) and the highest dropout rates of any major ethnic group in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1538192712440175">American Council on Education, 2008</xref>) with only 8% of the population going on to earn graduate degrees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1538192712440175">Castellanos &amp; Gloria, 2007</xref>). Given the increasing number of Latino/a students in our public schools coupled with continued reports of dismal high school graduation rates, it is critically important to understand the factors that influence, motivate, and drive Latino/a students’ academic success.</p>
<p>To better understand the factors that motivate academically successful immigrant and first-generation Mexican heritage students, data were collected through autobiographies (<italic>N</italic> = 115) written by Mexican heritage students enrolled at a prominent Western university, student focus groups (<italic>N</italic> = 33), and family interviews (<italic>N</italic> = 8). To help readers understand the obstacles for these students, first, we provide a brief review of the factors that have contributed to the poor school performance of Latino/a students in our public school system. Next, we examine related literature focusing on factors that contribute to educational attainment for Latino/a students. Finally, we delineate the present study and outline our research findings followed by a discussion of implications for research and practice.</p>
<sec id="section1-1538192712440175">
<title>How Schools Fail Latino/a Students?</title>
<p>The enduring and potent connection between low educational attainment and low-income status in the United States does not bode well for Latino/as. According to the National Poverty Center, in 2010, 26.6% percent of Latino/a families were poor, compared to 9.9% percent of non-Hispanic whites. Furthermore, Latino/as who have low-incomes are more likely to attend high-poverty schools that have higher dropout rates and fewer resources than other U.S. schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1538192712440175">Suárez-Orozco &amp; Páiz, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>In their review of unequal educational opportunities for Latino/a students, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1538192712440175">Burciaga et al. (2010)</xref> discuss numerous ways in which Latino/a students are disadvantaged by our public school system. Among these is lack of access to (a) early childhood education; (b) qualified, credentialed, and experienced teachers; and (c) advanced academic programs and courses. Simply stated, “Many Latino/a students experience limited opportunities to learn at every level of the educational pipeline. The unequal access to educational opportunities for Latino/a students are cumulative, long lasting, and undermine college preparedness and eligibility” (p. 429).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1538192712440175">
<title>Indicators of Increased Educational Attainment</title>
<p>One indicator of educational attainment is family background. A large body of research on indicators of postsecondary matriculation focuses on some aspect of family background. The most frequently cited correlate to increased postsecondary enrollment is family socioeconomic status (SES). More specifically, the higher a child’s SES the more probable she or he will attain a postsecondary degree.</p>
<p>Although we have evidence that certain variables contribute to educational achievement, we know very little about the factors that Mexican heritage students attribute to their own educational success. Thus, the present study investigated possible explanations for the extraordinary academic achievement of immigrant and first-generation students of Mexican heritage at a prominent Western university.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>This study is a qualitative study conducted through the transcendental phenomenological approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1538192712440175">Moustakas, 1994</xref>). According to Moustakas, transcendental phenomenology is a qualitative research technique where the researcher focuses on the descriptions of the participants’ experiences, while attempting to view the data through a new lens. To increase legitimation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1538192712440175">Denzin &amp; Lincoln, 2005</xref>) of the results, after the first wave of data collection, interviews and focus groups were conducted to verify the findings. These data are part of a larger study examining factors that contribute to the educational attainment of Latino/as (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1538192712440175">Easley, 2007</xref>).</p>

<title>Procedure</title>
<p>There were three types of data collected for this study. First, students at a prominent Western university who enrolled in a course on Latino/a identity and immigration (<italic>N</italic> = 103) completed an autobiographical account of the factors that brought them to the university. The specific prompt can be found in Box 1. Second, 10 focus groups, consisting of 33 students, were conducted with Mexican heritage students at the same university whose papers were not included in the preliminary analysis. Focus groups consisted of two to five individuals, and lasted 1 hr to an hour and a half. The questions for the focus groups emerged from the themes that were obtained from the analysis of the autobiographies and are listed in Box 2. Finally, six parents and two siblings of focus group participants were interviewed. These interviews were designed to further triangulate findings from the autobiographies and the focus groups. Respondents were encouraged to discuss ways that their family member’s precollege experiences led them to the university they were attending.</p>
<boxed-text id="boxed-text1-1538192712440175">
<label>Box 1.</label>
<title>Prompt for Students’ Autobiography</title>
<p>Each student will be responsible for a minimum 15-page paper, typed, and double-spaced, tracing her or his family’s immigration to this country. Discussion must focus on the intersection between your family’s experience and the broader issues and themes discussed in this course: How did local and national conditions in their home country (or countries) give rise to your family’s emigration? Once here, what social, cultural, educational, economic, and linguistic conditions did they face and how did they respond to these? How did their experience help to shape your life, your values, and your beliefs? In addition, in forging your own identity, how are you responding to what they have passed on to you and to what you are encountering and experiencing in the broader society? Use the reading to help structure your paper theoretically. The paper must be both personal and academic. It will require that you interview key members of your family, reflect on and analyze their experiences, and relate those experiences to course readings and to your research.</p>

<sec id="section6-1538192712440175">
<title>Analysis</title>
<p>Analysis of the data was conducted in five phases. As these data are part of a larger study examining the educational attainment of Latino/as (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1538192712440175">Easley, 2007</xref>), the first four phases incorporated multiple research questions: The present study focuses on one of these research questions. During Phase 1, the 103 autobiographies were read to gain an overall sense of the voice of the participants. In Phase 2, using a deductive approach, the autobiographies were analyzed using constant comparison analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1538192712440175">Glaser &amp; Strauss, 1967</xref>) to investigate the occurrences of 15 predetermined categories (see Box 3) that were derived from the literature review. Data were broken down into meaningful units, and each unit was coded with either the appropriate predetermined code or a new code that was created and used. All codes were then grouped into themes. Phase 3 consisted of analyzing the data from the focus groups and interviews using constant comparison analysis. Phase 4 included comparing and combining the emerging themes from Phase 3 with the themes from Phase 2 to assess legitimation of the data. Seven prominent themes were identified. Phase 5 included identifying one theme to further investigate (i.e., Ganas) and to identify quotes throughout the data that had been coded for this theme. These quotes were read and emerging subthemes were identified.</p>

<sec id="section7-1538192712440175">
<title>Results</title>
<p>Our research question asks, “What are common factors to which immigrant and first-generation Mexican heritage students attending a prominent Western university attribute their educational success?” Data analyses yielded a powerful finding that was not predicted in the review of literature. <italic>Ganas</italic>, a deeply held desire to achieve academically fueled by parental struggle and sacrifice, is evident in 46% of the autobiographies and 48% of the interviews. The significance of this finding cannot be understated as the researchers found no mention of this phenomenon in the literature.</p>
<sec id="section8-1538192712440175">
<title>Ganas—The Desire to Succeed</title>
<p>By far, Ganas is the most frequently cited trait that participants held in common, evident in 46% of the autobiographies and 48% of the interviews. For some participants, their parents’ traumatic, and in some cases life threatening, immigration experience was their source of Ganas; for others, it was their parents’ painful struggle for survival while in the United States. Others attributed their desire for success as an obligation to honor their family’s sacrifices with their own achievement. For most of the participants, however, it was the combination of these factors that spawned Ganas. The data revealed multiple components of Ganas, including (a) acknowledgement of parental struggle and sacrifice, (b) strong value of family and family’s history, (c) parental admiration and respect, (d) a desire to repay and pay forward, and (e) resilience and willingness to persevere. Each component is described and illustrated with students’ quotes.</p>
<sec id="section9-1538192712440175">
<title>Acknowledgement of parental struggle and sacrifice</title>
<p>Nearly all participants’ acknowledged their parents’ painful struggles and tremendous sacrifices as the motivation for their own academic success. As one participant clearly stated, “My parents’ struggle has also been the impetus for my desire to obtain a higher education and to give back to my community” (Participant 1). Another participant recognized his father’s struggles as the building blocks and foundation for his success: “My father has laid the foundation for my future by setting the example and it is now up to me to design and build brick by brick the structure that will show through me, his much appreciated sacrifices” (Participant 2). Other participants were hesitant to take credit for their own success; instead of attributing this to their effort, they viewed their accomplishments as a direct result of the sacrifices and support they received from their parents:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>In retrospect, my efforts had little to do with [my educational success]. It was greatly due to the financial sacrifices, difficult struggles, undying support, and strong determination of my parents who made a concerted effort to make sure I had every opportunity and open door to pursue an education . . . As an adult, I recognize and honor those struggles and sacrifices and attribute them to my own academic achievements and successes. (Participant 3)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Another student expressed this same sentiment when she said, “I did not get here on my own, I am here because of the hardships of my parents, of the illusions and hopes for a better life . . .” (Participant 4).</p>
<p>Students also recounted vivid images of their parents’ daily struggle and used these images as a source of motivation:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>I see my father, working full time as a ranch foreman and a handful of little jobs on the side . . . without complaining. I also see my mother, who continues ironing our neighbor’s clothes and making tortillas to sell, despite . . . arthritis in her hands, in order to give her daughters a few extra things. Images like these encourage me to succeed in life and have become the foundation of everything I put my mind to. (Participant 5)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Similarly, another student calls on images of her mother’s sacrifice and hard work cleaning houses as a reminder of her newfound social mobility and escape from generations of oppression:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>Every time I remember I am in [this university], I see my mother cleaning houses in order to help me be here. I am continuing my education because I understand how important it is, and I know that it will help me escape the economic and cultural gender perceptions that women in my family have endured and continue to face. (Participant 6)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>It was important for some students to make comparisons between their current statuses as university students with what their parents were doing at their age. For example, as illustrated by one participant, the comparison is drawn and with it brings a sense of gratitude:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>to think where my dad was before, picking food from a trash can to feed his brothers and singing on the bus for quarters. This makes me feel really happy to be where I am today. That’s why I don’t take it for granted. (Participant 7)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Acknowledgement of parental sacrifices not only fueled students’ motivation for academic success but also provided an avenue for them to measure their parents’ success. In other words, if they succeeded, so did their parents.</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>Because my dad sacrificed his education first for his siblings, and then for me . . . to eave his country and sacrifice his dream to go to college, sacrifice his dream to be a better man. . . . if I succeeded at school, he succeeded at school too. It was something that I had to do for him too. It was beyond me. (Participant 8)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Students shared conversations with their parents in which the notion of carrying their family’s stories with them on a daily basis provided additional motivation to succeed:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>In a way you carry [your family] with you as you are going through college, or going through grad school. . . . [My father used to say] “You know what mija, ultimately you graduated from junior college, good job. We accomplished something.” I said what do you mean we accomplished something? He said “Yeah, we accomplished something. You, your mom, and me. We are right there with you. You are carrying us while you are going to school.” And when I got to [to this university], they were crying more than me. They were like ‘Mija whatever happens, don’t forget us. Don’t forget where you come from. Don’t forget who you are. (Participant 9)</p>
</disp-quote>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1538192712440175">
<title>Strong value of family and family’s history</title>
<p>In addition to acknowledging parental sacrifice as a motivator for academic success, participants frequently shared how their need to honor their ancestors’ legacy provided additional encouragement. Being able to honor generations of family history with their success, students felt a sense of pride, gratitude, inspiration, and self-empowerment. As one student said, “It was not until I acknowledged and valued my family’s sacrifices that I gained self-empowerment to take control of my life and my own experiences. This self-empowerment provided the strength to gain ownership of my education” (Participant 10). Another student identifies her ancestors’ history as a source of inspiration when she said, “I have found that my ancestry and the struggles of my family and people have provided me with inspiration and immense pride in who I am” (Participant 11).</p>
<p>Students expressed fighting the battles’ of generations by achieving academic success:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>Their triumphs are my inspiration and my reason for getting up every morning with the intent of earning a college degree. Seeing my parents before me, as my mother grinds the fish . . . and my father cuts other people’s lawns in the hot sun, I am fully aware that they are much more than this. They are part of the legacy started by my grandparents and one that I will continue for future generations to come. I am especially conscious of the fact that my success in life is the battle my parents have been fighting for all their lives. I will make sure it is a battle they will win. (Participant 12)</p>
</disp-quote>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1538192712440175">
<title>Parental admiration, respect, and gratitude</title>
<p>Participants frequently mentioned their deep admiration, respect, and gratitude for their parents. This provided an additional layer of Ganas—or desire to succeed. Parents were called <italic>heroes</italic> as students recounted the pain, suffering, sacrifices, and risks undertaken by parents for their children. Participants admired their parents for the many sacrifices made, as expressed by this student: “I have deep admiration for my parents who have given me so much. They have suffered only so I would not” (Participant 12). Participants viewed their parents as heroes and role models. Their parents’ determination to provide their children with an education and a better life often meant working very long hours under deplorable conditions.</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>It was . . . working side by side with my father, that I learned the definition of hard work. It was there, with sweat, pain and blood running down my hands that I realized what a great sacrifice my father had [made] . . . . He sacrificed . . . to give his sons the opportunity of getting an education. I then realized who my heroes were, my family members. At all levels, my Mother, my Father, and my brother, were all working really hard to succeed despite their limitations. . . . It was then that I realized that in order for me to succeed, I needed to go back to school again. (Participant 13)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Another participant shares her story of sadness and shock when she visited her mother at work and saw firsthand her mother’s working conditions.</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>I was so excited that my mother had a job that I wanted to go surprise at work with flowers. When we finally got to the factory we saw that she was working under at a horrible place. It was mid-July and they had no air conditioning inside. It exceeded 120 degrees in that building! There were cockroaches and ants all over the walls in the lunchroom. (Participant 14)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Other participants discussed admiration for their parents and viewed their families’ stories as a source of internal strength and motivation to succeed.</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>I admire the valor and determination of my father. . . . It is . . . that determination that keeps me going day after day. Even when I feel my strength fails me, I reflect on the lives of those generations that have gone through many obstacles in order to provide me with the lifestyle that I currently lead. (Participant 15)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Many participants looked forward to a day when they could have a concrete way of demonstrating their gratitude for the painful sacrifices made on their behalf.</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>My father’s voice softened. The tears in his eyes and the sadness that washed over his face was enough to tell me how difficult times were for him as a son looking for work to help his family in any way he could. My father hardly shows any emotion, much less cries, so this expression was powerful, enough for me to feel his pain. I can only imagine what it felt like. This experience touches my heart because one day, I too may know what it feels like to send my parents my first paycheck but as a professional. (Participant 12)</p>

<title>Desire to repay and pay forward</title>
<p>Another noteworthy phenomenon related to Ganas was the existence of a social consciousness or feeling obligation to help others with similar stories as a source of motivation. For many participants, the desire to “repay” their parents was an additional source of motivation to be successful in school. In some cases repayment took the form of a long-standing desire to purchase something special for their parents; for others it was the desire to succeed in school as a form of repayment and demonstration of gratitude. Other participants looked to the future and wanted to break a cycle of poverty for the generations ahead of them while others wanted to contribute to their community as a form of paying it forward.</p>
<p>Several students grounded their motivation with the hope of purchasing a home for their parents. This seemed particularly true for students who had experienced homelessness as evidenced in this statement:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>. . . in my mind, I knew that I wanted to buy a house for my parents, because at one point in my life we were homeless. And knowing that we had to live in a garage. . . . They put newspapers to keep the cold from coming in, and they would sleep without blankets, because the only two blankets they had they’d give . . . to us. Knowing all [these] sacrifices, the least that I could do was to pay them back with good grades and a degree. (Participant 16)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Being able to take care of their parents was another source of motivation to succeed for some students.</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>Once again we were destitute but my mom would not give up. That was absolutely out of the question. That inspired me to do what I could to do well so that when I grew up I could take care of her. That’s what really inspired me to go to college. (Participant 17)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Many students articulated a strong desire and sense of duty to give back to their community as a way to pay it forward. This is illustrated in the following quote: “I feel that if I had this opportunity it is my duty to ensure that those who will come after me will have it too” (Participant 18). Another participant stated it this way, “Their sacrifice is a debt I will never be able to repay and, yet, I know that I am expected to pay it forward to my own children” (Participant 19).</p>
<p>Participants frequently viewed their education as an opportunity to make a difference in the lives of others with similar histories as expressed in the following statements: “Inspired by the struggles of my parents as undocumented immigrants and presently as permanent residents, I seek to become an immigration lawyer” (Participant 20). Another participant put it in these words:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>I want to use my education as a tool to change history within my family and also within the Latino community. I want my children as well as other Latino children to be the first generation in their family to have higher education expected of them. (Participant 12)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Lastly, for some, being successful allowed them to put a name and face to their families’ numerous sacrifices:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>My response has been to cross both academic and professional borders of which they were unable to reach. It is my responsibility to give their experience a face, name, value and most importantly a place in history. It is my obligation to add to their legacy of strength and integrity. (Participant 21)</p>
</disp-quote>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1538192712440175">
<title>Resilience and willingness to persevere</title>
<p>Participants were in agreement regarding the source of their resilience and motivation to continue their education; this component of Ganas was derived from their parents’ persistence in the face of the most adverse conditions. They viewed their resilience and persistence as a triumph—a victory to be shared. “In my opinion, my grandfathers’ and parents’ struggles, dedication, and hard work is [<italic>sic</italic>] still very much in my sisters and me. Theirs is not a story of failure, but of triumph” (Participant 22). Some students referenced their legacy of oppression as a source of resilience as expressed in this statement: “I come from a resilient people, who have gone through a legacy of struggle and oppression. If I get knocked down, which I have, I get back up” (Participant 23).</p>
<p>Another student reflects on how his mother’s persistence not only motivated him to succeed but also influenced his two brothers in their success stories.</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>My two older brothers who used to search trash containers for recyclable aluminum cans and were constantly hungry have become well-educated professionals—one holding a degree from UC Berkeley, the other from Harvard. My mother’s continual struggle has motivated me to pursue my education. . . . Her burning desire to overcome adversity and her unyielding persistence in improving our lives had become an inspiration to me. (Participant 24)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Other students reflected on their parents’ dangerous journey as a source of strength: “My father’s journey has been tough, dangerous and sometimes unbearable. These experiences and struggles have not only made me stronger, but they have allowed for my personal growth” (Participant 25).</p>
<p>Anger and resentment provided fuel for other students’ motivation. The anger, born from resentment, inspired the Ganas for success. “Watching my father live under these conditions inspires anger inside me. It makes me even more dedicated to going to school, get good grades, and graduating so one day I would be able to help my strong [father]” (Participant 26).</p>
<p>Finally, for some students, it was reflecting on words of wisdom passed down from their mothers and fathers as a source of inspiration. “My mother always tells me ‘knowledge is power, knowledge is power’. And I think that is one of the reasons I had so much ganas” (Participant 27).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Ganas—cited as a source of motivation, may be a significant reason that individuals, like many of the students in this study, excel when statistically they are supposed to fail. Ganas seems to result in a commitment to succeed and a refusal to see failure as a viable option. As we have illustrated, students expressed multiple aspects of Ganas. Together, these attributes appear to have transformed participants’ disadvantaged circumstances into a source of motivation that is seemingly an important component of their extraordinary academic achievement. Alone, any one of these attributes could lead to increased academic achievement. However, together, they culminate in Ganas, a very strong source of motivation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-1538192712440175">
<title>Implications and Recommendations</title>
<p>This study revealed that, despite statistical odds and extraordinary adversity, Mexican heritage students can and do excel and succeed. This research also revealed the complexity of Ganas—students’ motivations for academic achievement. The literature abounds with research related to the negative effects of being an immigrant or first-generation Mexican heritage student. With the exception of resilience theory, there are rarely research studies focused on the strengths that disadvantage can produce. Perhaps among the most noteworthy implication of this finding is that for some students who are placed at risk of school failure, especially immigrants and the children of immigrants, Ganas is a strong source of internal motivation. Hence, it is important for educators to learn about the backgrounds of their students and engage them in discussion of how their family stories can shape their habitus. Findings from this study have important implications for researchers, teacher educators, P-12 classroom teachers and parents.</p>
<sec id="section16-1538192712440175">
<title>Implications and Recommendations for Researchers</title>
<p>For researchers, one of the most powerful findings of this research is the existence of Ganas. Given this finding, an obvious question is whether it is present with other immigrant and nonimmigrant graduate students at other universities. For this reason, we suggest developing and administering a survey instrument for students focused on learning more about the extent to which Ganas played a role in their enrollment.</p>
<p>Great attention in the present-day American media is given to the negative characteristics of undocumented Mexican immigrants in the United States. During this research, however, it became apparent that there are many positive attributes of Mexican immigrants that are left out of the current discourse. Specifically, a significant number of the participants in this study were brought to United States without documentation and despite incredible odds, these students entered a prestigious university. Given a scarcity of research related to undocumented students in higher education, we recommend duplicating this study with undocumented students of any nationality currently attending universities throughout the country.</p>

<sec id="section17-1538192712440175">
<title>Implications and Recommendations for Teacher Educators</title>
<p>Teacher educators are well positioned to use these finding to help teacher candidates, and in some cases, themselves, move away from deficit perspectives of their Latino/a students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1538192712440175">Valencia, 2010</xref>). When classroom teachers view their students through a deficit lens, they are likely to see what students cannot do rather than the possibilities of success and academic achievement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1538192712440175">Valencia, 2010</xref>). This is particularly significant as teacher educators prepare teachers for working in high-poverty schools within communities with large immigrant populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1538192712440175">Sleeter, 2008</xref>). Teacher educators should encourage future teachers to challenge deficit-based assumptions and recognize the funds of knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1538192712440175">Moll, Amanti, Neff, &amp; Gonzalez, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1538192712440175">Valencia, 2010</xref>) and numerous strengths students and families bring with them and find ways to engage parents and families in meaningful, culturally responsive ways. Based on the results of the current study, teacher educators should consider including readings and assignments that focus on the level of sacrifice parents make in order for their children to have an education. Perhaps these stories would counter the commonly held deficit assumptions regarding lack of parental care or involvement in schools.</p>

<sec id="section18-1538192712440175">
<title>Recommendations for P-12 Public School Teachers</title>
<p>Our findings, we believe, are most important for public school teachers across the country-teachers who have their own Ganas to challenge deficit assumptions about the students they teach and the families who raise them. Classroom teachers can use these findings to help students explore their own motivations for success. The narratives presented in this article can help inspire teachers to create thematic learning units exploring family histories, including in-depth exploration of the struggles and sacrifices their families have endured to provide a better life for their children. By putting young children in touch with their stories and their ethnic identity, perhaps teachers can induce the kind of Ganas experienced by the participants in the current study.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-1538192712440175">
<title>Implications and Recommendations for Parents and Families</title>
<p>Finally, parents and families can use these findings to support the oral tradition of passing down family history from one generation to the next. Family stories of triumphs and tribulations, coupled with connection to ethnic identity and images of ancestors’ legacy, provided the most powerful source of motivation and desire—Ganas—for all the participants in our study.</p>
