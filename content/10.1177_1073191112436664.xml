<abstract>
<p>In this study, the authors evaluated aspects of criterion validity and clinical utility of the grandiosity and vulnerability components of the Pathological Narcissism Inventory (PNI) using two undergraduate samples (<italic>N</italic> = 299 and 500). Criterion validity was assessed by evaluating the correlations of narcissistic grandiosity and narcissistic vulnerability with established indices of normal personality traits, psychopathology and clinical concerns, and pathological personality traits. Overall, the pattern of correlations supported the convergent and discriminant validity of grandiose and vulnerable conceptualizations of pathological narcissism as measured by the PNI. Clinical utility was assessed by evaluating the extent to which clinicians without specific training in pathological narcissism as well as clinicians with expertise in pathological narcissism could accurately predict the correlates of PNI grandiosity and vulnerability with normal and pathological personality traits and psychopathology. The <italic>r<sub>contrast-cv</sub></italic> coefficient provided a global index of accuracy in clinicians’ predictions that was more fully elaborated by examining systematic discrepancies across groups. Overall, novice and expert clinicians were generally able to predict criterion correlations, with some exceptions (e.g., counter to predictions, pathological narcissism was negatively associated with treatment resistance). These results provide further evidence regarding the validity and utility of the narcissistic grandiosity and narcissistic vulnerability constructs as measured by the PNI.</p>

<p>The assessment of narcissism has been complicated by inconsistent definitions across areas of clinical psychology, social/personality psychology, and psychiatry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1073191112436664">Cain, Pincus, &amp; Ansell, 2008</xref>). For instance, some elements of the most commonly employed measure of narcissism in social/personality psychology, the Narcissistic Personality Inventory (NPI; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1073191112436664">Raskin &amp; Terry, 1988</xref>), reliably show weak or even negative correlations with indicators of dysfunction (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1073191112436664">Rhodewalt &amp; Morf, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1073191112436664">Watson, 2005</xref>), suggesting potential limitations of the NPI for clinical conceptualizations and assessment of narcissistic pathology. Furthermore, both the NPI and the current <italic>Diagnostic and Statistic Manual of Mental Disorders, text revision</italic> (<italic>DSM-IV-TR</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1073191112436664">American Psychiatric Association, 2000</xref>), tend to focus primarily on grandiose aspects of narcissistic personality pathology, although vulnerability has clinically been considered a prominent feature of narcissism since the construct’s inception (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1073191112436664">Cain et al., 2008</xref>). The Personality and Personality Disorder Workgroup for the upcoming <italic>DSM-5</italic> has maintained the relatively exclusive focus on grandiosity in representing narcissist personality disorder (NPD). Specifically, the diagnosis of NPD will be made when individuals meet general criteria for personality disorder and have specific elevations on two maladaptive traits: grandiosity and attention seeking.</p>

<title>The Pathological Narcissism Inventory</title>
<p>To more fully account for the clinically observed phenotypic variation in pathological narcissism, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1073191112436664">Pincus et al. (2009)</xref> developed the Pathological Narcissism Inventory (PNI), a 52-item self-report measure focusing on maladaptive expressions of narcissism. The PNI consists of seven subscales that serve as markers for two higher order factors reflecting grandiose and vulnerable aspects of pathological narcissism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1073191112436664">Wright, Lukowitsky, Pincus, &amp; Conroy, 2010</xref>). Narcissistic grandiosity is conceptualized as a strong motivation to self-enhance, a tendency to repress negative aspects of the self and to view oneself as superior, and to behave in an exploitative, exhibitionistic, and unempathic style interpersonally. Narcissistic vulnerability is conceptualized as a fragile self-concept with limited capacities for self- and affect regulation, associated with a tendency to experience shame and/or rage when personal needs are not met, sensitivity to perceived threats to self-esteem, and an avoidance of relationships for fear of not being admired (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1073191112436664">Pincus et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Accumulating evidence supports the reliability and validity of the PNI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1073191112436664">Pincus, in press</xref>). For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1073191112436664">Pincus et al. (2009)</xref> showed in the initial validation study that that the theoretical structure of the PNI fit data from a large sample of undergraduates and that the PNI scales had acceptable internal consistency coefficients (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1073191112436664">Wright et al., 2010</xref>) and that the PNI total score had expected correlation patterns with measures of self-esteem (<italic>r</italic> = −.37), empathy (<italic>r</italic> = −.14), shame (<italic>r</italic> = .55), primitive defenses (<italic>r</italic> = .60), identity diffusion (<italic>r</italic> = .62), impaired reality testing (<italic>r</italic> = .47), aggression (<italic>r</italic> = .36), and low moral values (<italic>r</italic> = .45) in student samples. Within a clinical sample (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1073191112436664">Pincus et al., 2009</xref>), the PNI was predictive of treatment-relevant variables, such as medication use (<italic>r</italic> = −.35) and suicidal behavior (<italic>r</italic> = .43).</p>
<p>Several recent studies have extended the nomological net of the PNI. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1073191112436664">Tritt, Ryder, Ring, and Pincus (2010)</xref> replicated the structural validity of the PNI and showed that its scales relate systematically and predictably to depressive temperament. Specifically, in regression models PNI vulnerability related strongly to depressive (β = .61), anxious (β = .53), angry (β = .38), aesthenic (β = .38), and cyclothymic (β = .55) temperament, whereas PNI grandiosity was not related to these variables in analyses controlling for narcissistic vulnerability. Conversely, grandiosity related positively (β = .56) and vulnerability related negatively (β = −.35) to hyperthymic (e.g., energetic/adaptive) temperament. Overall, these results were interpreted as relating to the core affective content of the PNI scales: “Vulnerability items tend to reflect negative affects when a narcissistic need is not met, whereas grandiosity items tend to reflect positive affects associated with narcissistic self-enhancement strategies” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1073191112436664">Tritt et al., 2010</xref>, p. 282). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1073191112436664">Miller et al. (2010)</xref> showed that the vulnerable PNI scales relate to the Hypersensitive Narcissism Scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1073191112436664">Hendin &amp; Cheek, 1997</xref>), another measure of vulnerable narcissism (range <italic>r</italic> = .34-.55) as well as indicators of borderline personality disorder (range <italic>r</italic> = .28-.48), which overlaps theoretically with vulnerable aspects of pathological narcissism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1073191112436664">McWilliams, 2011</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1073191112436664">Maxwell, Donnellan, Hopwood, and Ackerman (2011)</xref> showed that the PNI correlated significantly with a measure of <italic>DSM-IV</italic> NPD (<italic>r</italic> = .35) and self-esteem (<italic>r</italic> = −.34). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1073191112436664">Ackerman et al. (2010)</xref> reported a relation between the PNI total score and psychological entitlement (<italic>r</italic> = .28). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1073191112436664">Ziegler-Hill, Green, Arnau, Sisemore, and Meyers (2010)</xref> reported systematic relations between PNI scales and early maladaptive schemas. In particular, in regression models the PNI grandiose composite was predicted by mistrust (β = .31), insufficient self-control (β = −.14), entitlement (β = .12), self-sacrifice (β = .18), and unrelenting standards (β = .13), whereas the PNI vulnerable composite was predicted by mistrust (β = .20), subjugation (β = .19), dependence (β = −.16), abandonment (β = .23), and entitlement (β = .13).</p>
<p>Taken together, this initial research attests to the validity of the PNI as a measure of pathological narcissism, but this evidence is also preliminary in that a wider net of criterion variables would be desirable. Researchers have tended to focus on variables that are theoretically linked to narcissism, resulting in limited information concerning how narcissistic grandiosity and vulnerability relate to more general measures of normal and abnormal personality and psychopathology. Correlating the grandiose and vulnerable composites of the PNI with such variables would permit tests of the measure’s discriminant validity, expand the nomological net of pathological narcissism, and provide further evidence for its construct validity.</p>

<title>Investigating the Clinical Utility of the PNI</title>
<p>Traditionally, researchers have placed greater emphasis on evaluating the reliability and validity of newly developed measures than on ascertaining the clinical utility of these measures. Clinical utility is a broad element of psychological assessment that encompasses clinicians’ ability to use data in a way that facilitates their understanding of their clients, predicts clients’ future behaviors, and engages with the scientific community. We define clinical utility more narrowly throughout this article as clinicians’ ability to articulate expectations regarding patterns of convergent and discriminant relations of the PNI with various criterion measures. Ultimately, a psychological instrument is made more useful or less useful based on clinicians’ clear understanding of the underlying constructs it assesses and the wider array of constructs and functioning to which it relates. Thus, it is important to evaluate how well clinicians’ expectations match empirical patterns of convergent and discriminant associations. This point is increasingly salient with the impending publication of <italic>DSM-5</italic>, particularly as some have suggested that more could be done to enhance the clinical utility of the <italic>DSM-5</italic> personality disorders. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1073191112436664">First (2010)</xref> specifically describes four types of clinical utility that should be considered in revising the <italic>DSM</italic>, stating that the manual should ultimately (a) facilitate communication; (b) aid in selecting effective interventions; (c) assist clinicians in predicting course, prognosis, and future needs; and (d) differentiate disorder from nondisorder. Our study is somewhat broader in that it focuses on narcissistic personality pathology in general rather than the <italic>DSM</italic>-5 definition per se. Within this framework, however, it focuses on how well clinicians can use a measure of personality pathology to make clinically relevant predictions and in this way overlaps with First’s third type of clinical utility.</p>
<p>In examining clinical utility in this way, it is informative to quantify the clinical utility of measures using approaches that move beyond simple qualitative impressions. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1073191112436664">Westen and Rosenthal (2003)</xref> discuss a method that provides a single number reflecting how well the empirical pattern of correlations for a measure and a set of criterion variables match with a priori expectations. Using this procedure, point estimates are made about how a given scale will relate to an array of criterion variables. The consistency of these estimates with the observed correlations is then correlated to evaluate the accuracy of these a priori predictions. This procedure results in a single coefficient (<italic>r<sub>contrast-cv</sub></italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1073191112436664">1</xref></sup> that provides an overall and readily interpretable index of accuracy that can be compared across varying raters, measures, and subsequent studies. Quantitative indices such as the <italic>r<sub>contrast-cv</sub></italic> are an improvement over approaches in which researchers largely “rely on subjective estimates and eyeballing of complex patterns” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1073191112436664">Westen &amp; Rosenthal, 2005</xref>, p. 409).</p>
<p>Despite the intuitive appeal and apparent utility of <italic>r<sub>contrast-cv</sub></italic> and related approaches such as alerting correlations, concerns have been raised about the uses and interpretations of these coefficients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1073191112436664">Westen &amp; Rosenthal, 2003</xref>). Specifically, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1073191112436664">Smith (2005)</xref> notes that “because both indices [<italic>r<sub>contrast-cv</sub></italic> and <italic>r<sub>alerting-cv</sub></italic>] quantify predictive accuracy with a single number, their method does not aid in the formal identification of which correlations fail to support . . . construct validity” (p. 404). Given this limitation, in the current study we further evaluate discrepancies between obtained and predicted correlations at the scale level.</p>
<p>A second criticism of <italic>r<sub>contrast-cv</sub></italic> is the degree to which it is an accurate reflection of <italic>construct validity</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1073191112436664">Smith, 2005</xref>). To be clear, the <italic>r<sub>contrast-cv</sub></italic> metric provides a test of the accuracy of predictions more so than an evaluation of the actual validity of an instrument. However, we believe that quantifying the agreement between empirical patterns and a priori predictions can provide important insights about how constructs are understood by clinicians. An alternative methodology that has not been used in previous research is to evaluate clinicians’ predictions, rather than expert researchers’ predictions, of how a measure of interest will correlate with other constructs. Our approach can therefore provide a global index of <italic>clinical utility</italic> (as we have defined it in this article) and sidestep the thorny issue of whether such a coefficient actually quantifies <italic>construct validity</italic> per se. Accordingly, we computed <italic>r<sub>contrast-cv</sub></italic> using clinician predictions and consider the coefficients in our study to represent a quantitative estimate of one important aspect of the clinical utility of PNI grandiosity and vulnerability rather than construct validity per se or clinical utility in general. In estimating clinical utility as it pertains to the ability of clinicians to understand the criterion validity of assessment measures, it is important to discern how well both experienced and novice clinicians perform in this task. We therefore examined the accuracy of predictions made by clinicians without particular expertise in pathological narcissism as a proxy of the global utility of the PNI for clinical psychologists as well as the accuracy of predictions made by experts in pathological narcissism as a proxy for the ceiling of potential clinical utility of the PNI as it is currently understood.</p>

<sec id="section3-1073191112436664">
<title>Study Aims</title>
<p>We have two primary aims in this study. The first is to further evaluate the criterion validity of narcissistic grandiosity and vulnerability by establishing their patterns of convergence and divergence against a variety of personality and psychopathology measures. Accordingly, we correlated the PNI grandiosity and vulnerability composites with measures of normal personality, abnormal personality, and psychopathology in two samples. The second aim is to evaluate the clinical utility of the PNI by quantifying the agreement between clinicians’ predictions and actual empirical correlations for the suite of criterion variables we evaluated. We examined the consistency of predictions across clinician raters with and without expertise in pathological narcissism and quantified the accuracy of these predictions using the <italic>r<sub>contrast-cv</sub></italic> coefficient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1073191112436664">Westen &amp; Rosenthal, 2003</xref>). Given criticism regarding the possibility that a single coefficient might obscure critical discrepancies at the scale level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1073191112436664">Smith, 2005</xref>), we also examined differences between obtained and predicted correlations for each scale. This study is novel in that it evaluates clinical intuitions about the nomological network of narcissistic grandiosity and vulnerability and thus evaluates both the empirical correlations of the PNI with criterion measures as well as the predictability of the obtained patterns of convergence and divergence using clinician ratings.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1073191112436664" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>We used data from two samples of undergraduate students attending large, public universities to compute criterion correlations. Participants in both samples completed the PNI (all scale α’s &gt; .70).</p>
<p>Data from the first sample were used in a previous study, which did not report PNI criterion validity correlations of interest in the present study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1073191112436664">Hopwood et al., 2011</xref>). This sample contained 299 students, most of whom (&gt;80%) were White and 194 (65%) of whom were women. In addition to the PNI, they completed the Big Five Inventory (BFI; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1073191112436664">John, Naumann, &amp; Soto, 2008</xref>) and the Personality Assessment Inventory (PAI; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1073191112436664">Morey, 1991</xref>). The BFI is a 44-item self-report measure of the big five domains: neuroticism (sample Cronbach’s α = .81), extraversion (α = .84), openness (α = .79), agreeableness (α = .82), and conscientiousness (α = .78). The PAI is a 344-item self-report measure of personality, psychopathology, and other clinically relevant constructs. The PAI clinical and treatment consideration scales were used as criteria. All αs across the 14 PAI scales used in this study were &gt;.70.</p>
<p>The second sample included 500 students who were primarily White (&gt;80%) and balanced on gender (251 male, 50.2%). In addition to the PNI, participants completed the Schedule for Nonadaptive and Adaptive Personality–Second Edition (SNAP-2; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1073191112436664">Clark, Simms, Wu, &amp; Casillas, in press</xref>). The SNAP-2 has three normal temperament scales (negative temperament, positive temperament, and disinhibition) and 12 pathological trait scales (mistrust, manipulativeness, aggression, self-harm, eccentric perceptions, dependency, exhibitionism, entitlement, detachment, impulsivity, propriety, and workaholism). All αs for the SNAP-2 scales were &gt;.70.</p>
<sec id="section5-1073191112436664">
<title>Procedures and Analyses</title>
<p>We computed bivariate correlations between the PNI grandiosity and vulnerability scale scores and each of the criterion variables in both samples. Because of the large number of correlations, we provided benchmarks for statistical significance at a conservative <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01 value.</p>
<p>We also obtained predictions for these correlations from two sets of clinician raters: “nonexperts” and “experts” in pathological narcissism. Five advanced graduate student clinicians (in their fourth or fifth year of graduate training) without specific expertise in pathological narcissism or prior familiarity with the PNI served as our “nonexpert” clinician raters. These clinicians were provided brief descriptions of narcissistic grandiosity and vulnerability as measured by the PNI as well as brief descriptions of each criterion scale. Clinicians were told that high scores on the PNI grandiosity scale indicate that an individual would be “strongly motivated to self-enhance in most contexts, have a tendency to repress negative aspects of self, feel entitled, have an inflated self-image, engage in fantasies of superiority, and to be interpersonally exploitative, exhibitionistic, and to lack empathy.” They were told that high scorers on the PNI vulnerability scale would likely have</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>fragile self and affect regulatory capacities, a tendency to experience shame or rage when narcissistic needs are disappointed, to be sensitive to perceived threats to self-esteem, to avoid showing others faults or concerns, and to shy away from relationships for fear of not receiving desired admiration and recognition.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Similar descriptions were provided for the scales of the criterion measures. Brief descriptions of the BFI scales were written by the study authors and descriptions of the PAI and SNAP scales were each obtained from book chapters describing the measures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1073191112436664">Morey &amp; Hopwood, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1073191112436664">Simms &amp; Clark, 2006</xref>, respectively).</p>
<p>Each clinician independently provided a point estimate, to one decimal place, of the correlation between the grandiosity and vulnerability composites and each criterion scale. Four clinical experts on pathological narcissism<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1073191112436664">2</xref></sup> who have previously conducted research using the PNI, though not in conjunction with the specific criterion measures assessed in the present study, independently provided “expert” ratings by also supplying a point estimate of the correlation between the grandiosity and vulnerability composites and each criterion scale. These raters were given the same brief descriptions of scales on the criterion measures as nonexpert raters were given.</p>
<p>The global accuracy of these predictions across raters can only be meaningfully interpreted to the extent that clinicians tended to agree in their ratings. Therefore, we first computed interrater reliability for nonexpert and expert ratings using two-way random effects, absolute agreement intraclass correlations (ICCs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1073191112436664">Bombel, Mihura, &amp; Meyer, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1073191112436664">McGraw &amp; Wong, 1996</xref>). These values, presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1073191112436664">Table 1</xref>, were generally acceptable across both nonexpert (median ICC = .72) and expert (median ICC = .87) clinician raters. Accordingly, we averaged ratings across each set of clinician raters and computed a global indicator of clinical utility, <italic>r<sub>contrast-cv</sub></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1073191112436664">Westen &amp; Rosenthal, 2003</xref>), for PNI grandiosity and vulnerability in each sample. This value is based in contrast analysis as commonly employed in an analysis of variance framework and therefore provides a single overall index of the extent to which the experts correctly predicted criterion-related validity correlations. This index also takes into account the intercorrelations of the criterion measures with the variable being considered and the absolute values of the observed correlations (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1073191112436664">Westen &amp; Rosenthal, 2003</xref>, for computational details for deriving this coefficient). This overall index can be interpreted as a correlation coefficient and tested for statistical significance against the null hypothesis that <italic>r</italic> = .00.</p>

<title>PNI Criterion Validity</title>
<p>Correlations between the criterion scales and the PNI grandiosity and vulnerability composites are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1073191112436664">Tables 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1073191112436664">3</xref>, respectively. These composites correlated .51 (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) in the first sample and .55 (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) in Sample 2, as would be expected given that they are presumed to arise from the core construct of pathological narcissism. Thus, it is not surprising that grandiosity and vulnerability showed similar patterns of convergence and discrimination with some criterion variables. Specifically, both composites positively related to neuroticism and negative temperament, although vulnerability correlated more strongly with these traits, indicating a general propensity for individuals high in ratings of pathological narcissism to experience negative emotions. This was further evidenced in their association with symptoms of anxiety-related disorders. Grandiosity and vulnerability were also both positively associated with the tendency to behave without regard for consequences or social norms (SNAP-2 disinhibition), to manipulate others and derive pleasure from capitalizing on others’ weaknesses (SNAP-2 manipulative), to value reputation and appearance over personal comfort (SNAP-2 propriety), to invest significant time in goal-directed activities (SNAP-2 workaholism), and to possess a unique worldview relative to others (SNAP-2 eccentric perceptions). Neither grandiosity nor vulnerability was associated with BFI openness or with substance abuse.</p>

<p>In addition, both grandiosity and vulnerability were positively related to paranoia, interpersonal mistrust, borderline personality functioning, and a desire to change (negative relation with PAI treatment rejection), although these associations were stronger with vulnerability. Both composites also displayed positive relations with exhibitionistic tendencies and feelings of entitlement, but these associations were higher for grandiosity. These patterns are largely consistent with theories of pathological narcissism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1073191112436664">Pincus et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Curiously, grandiosity and vulnerability showed discrepant patterns across two different measures of aggression drawn from the PAI (Sample 1) and the SNAP-2 (Sample 2). One explanation for this discrepancy could be related to differences across the two samples. A second possibility is that pathological narcissism is more strongly associated with becoming easily angered and provoked by perceived insults (items represented in SNAP-2 aggression) but less so with overtly aggressive behaviors (items represented in PAI aggression). Further research exploring differences between these aggression scales would be useful to better understand this divergence with respect to the PNI. Consistent with theoretical expectations, this association with provoked aggression was particularly strong for vulnerability.</p>
<p>Despite some overlap, the grandiosity and vulnerability composites were distinguished by several correlations. Consistent with theoretical expectations for the construct, grandiosity was associated with high levels of manic behaviors, cognitions, and affect, including manic grandiosity (PAI mania), as well as features of antisocial personality. This composite also related to a tendency to view oneself as active and energetic and one’s life as exciting (SNAP-2 positive temperament). Though these correlates are among the highest observed between grandiosity and other constructs, the magnitude of these associations is still somewhat weak. In contrast, vulnerability was uniquely associated with internalizing problems (PAI anxiety and depression), social isolation (SNAP-2 detachment), low extraversion (BFI), relying on others for approval (SNAP-2 dependency), suicidal ideation (PAI suicide), and self-harming and impulsive behaviors (SNAP-2 self-harm and PAI borderline). Notably, the vulnerability composite was significantly associated with all pathological personality traits (as assessed by the SNAP-2) and generally showed stronger associations with other indicators of psychopathology than the grandiosity composite.</p>

<title>PNI Clinical Utility</title>
<p>The clinical utility of the PNI grandiosity and vulnerability composites, as represented by <italic>r<sub>contrast-cv</sub></italic> values, are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1073191112436664">Table 1</xref>. Overall, these values were all significant, with a mean <italic>r<sub>contrast-cv</sub></italic> value of .65 for both grandiosity and vulnerability. Examination of the values indicates that predictions tended to be better for how vulnerability would relate to normative traits (BFI), whereas predictions for grandiosity were higher relative to psychopathology and clinical concerns (PAI). Comparing clinician raters yields no differences in the overall accuracy of predictions made from experts and nonexperts (mean <italic>r<sub>contrast-cv</sub></italic> = .65 for both groups). Although these results suggest that clinicians can make fairly accurate predictions regarding the array of clinically relevant personality and psychopathology constructs with which grandiosity and vulnerability are associated, it is important to examine discrepancies between predicted and obtained values given the limitations of <italic>r<sub>contrast-cv</sub></italic> for evaluating specific inferences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1073191112436664">Smith, 2005</xref>). These data can be gleaned from the “Difference” columns in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1073191112436664">Tables 2</xref> (grandiosity) and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1073191112436664">3</xref> (vulnerability), which simply display the difference between predicted and obtained correlations, with negative values indicating that raters estimated the correlation to be more positive than was observed.</p>
<p>Predictions were generally accurate for both nonexpert and expert clinicians regarding the positive associations between grandiosity and mania, positive temperament, and entitlement. In contrast, both sets of raters underestimated the degree to which grandiosity would correlate with neuroticism/negative temperament and associated dysfunction (e.g., anxiety disorders). Nonexpert clinician raters overestimated the degree to which grandiosity would correlate with externalizing pathology (i.e., antisocial, drug, alcohol, and aggression), whereas expert raters did not anticipate the association grandiosity displayed with eccentric perceptions. The largest discrepancy between predictions and observed correlations for both nonexpert and expert raters was the expectation that grandiosity would be highly positively associated with treatment rejection, when in fact this correlation was found to be significantly negative. Notably, any differences between predicted and obtained values could be the result of either inaccurate clinician predictions or, alternatively, could indicate that the PNI is not measuring these constructs in a way that would be anticipated based on clinical theory. In either case, discrepancies suggest potential problems in the clinical interpretation of the PNI vis-à-vis treatment rejection.</p>
<p>With regard to vulnerability, both sets of clinicians accurately anticipated the association between vulnerability and internalizing psychopathology (i.e., anxiety, anxiety disorders, depression, and self-harm), as well as introversion, detachment, dependency, and impulsivity. Nonexpert clinicians incorrectly anticipated a moderately positive correlation with alcohol problems, drug problems, and treatment rejection. Both nonexperts and experts anticipated slightly negative correlations between vulnerability and exhibitionism, but the observed correlation between these scales was positive. This may relate to an important distinction between overt and covert expressions of narcissism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1073191112436664">Pincus &amp; Lukowitsky, 2010</xref>), in which individuals with narcissistic vulnerability experience feelings of entitlement but may express these feelings covertly making them more difficult for others to detect or anticipate.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study evaluated both the convergent and discriminant validity and clinical utility of the PNI, a recently developed self-report measure designed to capture both grandiose and vulnerable aspects of narcissistic personality pathology. We evaluated bivariate correlations between PNI grandiosity and vulnerability composites and a host of criterion variables as an index of validity and compared clinician-predicted correlations to observed criterion correlations using a method of contrast analysis as an index of clinical utility. Overall, our results extend evidence for the validity and utility of the PNI as a measure of pathological narcissism. The grandiosity composite related to exhibitionistic, entitled, and manic behaviors, whereas the vulnerability composite tended to relate more specifically to negative emotions and interpersonal dysfunction. In short, the current results support and extend previous research related to the validity of the PNI (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1073191112436664">Pincus et al., 2009</xref>) and suggest that this instrument is a clinically useful self-report measure of pathological narcissism.</p>
<p>Results from the present study indicate that narcissistic grandiosity and narcissistic vulnerability share features associated with behavioral disregard for consequences (disinhibition), cognitive disregard of normative worldviews (eccentric perceptions), and interpersonal disregard for the rights of others (manipulativeness). Our results also provide further support distinguishing grandiose and vulnerable expressions of pathological narcissism. The overall pattern of results indicated that grandiosity was more strongly related to indicators of pathological positive emotionality (mania, exhibitionism, and entitlement), whereas vulnerability was more strongly related to indicators of negative emotionality (depression, negative temperament, and self-harm) and interpersonal dysfunction (paranoia, social detachment, mistrust, and aggression).</p>
<p>It is interesting to consider these results in light of the forthcoming <italic>DSM-5</italic> and specifically the proposed representation of NPD. As mentioned above, NPD has been reformulated for the <italic>DSM-5</italic>, in that it will now be represented by symptoms involving dysregulation of self- and interpersonal functioning and two traits, grandiosity and attention seeking. Initial evidence suggests that traits beyond these two, such as hostility, deceitfulness, and callousness, are strongly related to <italic>DSM-IV</italic> NPD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1073191112436664">Hopwood, Thomas, Markon, Wright, &amp; Kreuger, 2012</xref>). Furthermore, as in the <italic>DSM-IV</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1073191112436664">Pincus &amp; Lukowitsky, 2010</xref>), traits that represent vulnerable aspects of narcissism are missing from the proposed <italic>DSM-</italic>5 representation of the disorder although they may be represented in other traits in the <italic>DSM-5</italic> system. Further work is needed to evaluate the ability of the proposed <italic>DSM-5</italic> system to capture the breadth of phenomena considered relevant to narcissism in the theoretical model underlying the PNI.</p>
<p>In addition to providing further evidence for the criterion validity of the PNI, this study also evaluated clinicians’ ability to predict validity coefficients a priori. Clinicians were, on the whole, consistent and generally accurate in their predictions about the nomological network of narcissistic grandiosity and narcissistic vulnerability. Furthermore, clinicians who are not experts in pathological narcissism were as accurate in their predictions as clinicians with expertise in pathological narcissism when accuracy was assessed at a global level. In considering this finding, it is important to note that each predicted correlation was based both on clinicians’ understanding of the psychometric properties of the PNI grandiosity and vulnerability composites (in which experts had an advantage) <italic>as well as</italic> the psychometric properties of the criterion scales (in which experts had no distinct advantage). The overall accuracy of clinician predictions, as reflected in the <italic>r<sub>contrast-cv</sub></italic> values, indicates that if a clinician is privy to an individual’s PNI grandiosity and vulnerability scores, she or he can infer more than just grandiose and vulnerable tendencies. For instance, someone with a high score on PNI vulnerability and a low score on grandiosity is likely to experience a host of negative emotions, an absence of positive emotions, interpersonal dysfunction, and strong treatment motivation. The finding that clinicians without prior experience using the PNI were as accurate as the clinicians with expertise in pathological narcissism also suggests that most clinicians would be able to make important clinical inferences based on scores from the PNI. Importantly, for any given client these inferences would need to be tested using additional clinical or empirical data, but they can nonetheless guide clinicians by pointing toward potentially relevant avenues of consideration.</p>
<p>It is important to acknowledge that there are no benchmarks for evaluating the magnitude of <italic>r<sub>contrast-cv</sub></italic> coefficients. Because few studies have been conducted using the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1073191112436664">Westen and Rosenthal (2003)</xref> method to test the validity of psychological measures, it is difficult to judge when <italic>r<sub>contra</sub></italic><sub>st-cv</sub> values are unusually high or unusually low. Accordingly, we evaluated and presented specific discrepancies between obtained and predicted values to obtain more nuanced information regarding the accuracy of clinicians’ predictions. Overall the values reported here are similar to or higher than the levels of <italic>r<sub>contrast-cv</sub></italic> coefficients in a previous, analogous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1073191112436664">Bombel et al., 2009</xref>), suggesting that these data support the clinical utility of the PNI with regard to clinicians’ ability to anticipate a wide range of personality and psychopathology associations between grandiosity and vulnerability.</p>
<p>There were, however, some notable discrepancies in predicted values that merit further consideration. Nonexpert clinicians tended to inaccurately predict that grandiosity would associate with externalizing pathology, such as substance abuse and aggression, whereas in our study grandiosity was better accounted for by associations with pathological aspects of positive emotionality, such as mania, exhibitionism, and entitlement. This distinction will be important to continue testing and articulating in future research, particularly in order to clarify whether this is a (perhaps common) clinical misconception or whether the PNI is not accurately assessing associated features of externalizing pathology. Despite the association between grandiosity and pathological manifestations of positive emotionality, the PNI was uncorrelated with a normal expression of positive emotionality (BFI extraversion). This finding was inconsistent with clinician predictions and research with some narcissism instruments (e.g., NPI; cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1073191112436664">Holtzman, Vazire, &amp; Mehl, 2010</xref>), though meta-analytic research has identified only a modest relation between narcissism and extraversion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1073191112436664">Samuel &amp; Widiger, 2008</xref>; weighted effect size = .09).</p>
<p>Another prominent inaccurate prediction across both sets of raters was anticipating a positive correlation between grandiosity and treatment rejection. Grandiosity is marked by inflated feelings of self-worth; therefore, assuming this scale would relate to treatment rejection makes conceptual sense. Thus, this finding might reflect an inability of the PNI grandiosity composite to capture resistance to change. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1073191112436664">Pincus et al. (2009)</xref> found that grandiosity was positively associated with increased psychotherapy appointment cancellations and no-shows and negatively associated with adherence to medication regiments and contact with hospital staff. Notably, however, these outcome variables are features of <italic>treatment utilization</italic>, whereas the PAI scale measures <italic>treatment rejection</italic>, or a lack of desire to understand and change oneself. Consistent with this discrepancy in findings across studies, research is mixed regarding whether or not the PAI treatment rejection scale is significantly associated with nonmutual therapy termination—for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1073191112436664">Charnas, Hilsenroth, Zodan, and Blais (2010)</xref> found that it was; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1073191112436664">Hopwood, Ambwani, and Morey (2007)</xref> found that it was not. Another factor that could account for this distinction is that features of treatment utilization were measured based on actual behaviors where treatment rejection is a self-reported indicator. Taken together, these results suggest that individuals with high levels of grandiosity may indeed express a desire to change but, given their pathology, may have difficulty following through with treatment. This intriguing possibility indicates the need for additional research, but for now it suggests that clinicians should be aware of the distinction between a desire for change and treatment utilization and strive to find ways to engage clients with narcissistic grandiosity.</p>
<p>Another systematic discrepancy across both nonexpert and expert predictions was the positive association between grandiosity and neuroticism/negative temperament. Recent research indicates that the zero-order association between grandiosity and negative emotionality may be accounted for by vulnerability, as this association dissipates when controlling for vulnerability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1073191112436664">Tritt et al., 2010</xref>). Similarly, additional analyses in the present study indicated that the partial correlation between grandiosity and both (BFI) neuroticism and (SNAP-2) negative emotionality were null after removing the association between grandiosity and vulnerability. Clinician raters in the present study may have been making predictions based on the pure grandiosity construct and not considering the overlap between grandiosity and vulnerability. This is an empirically important distinction; however, it is also clinically important to know that pathological narcissism tends to correlate with indices of negative emotionality. Furthermore, there is generally a negative manifold among most clinical constructs such that indicators of psychopathology tend to correlate with one another, even when the constructs are conceptually distinct. This negative manifold was often unanticipated by clinician raters, indicating that clinicians may overestimate the discriminant validity of psychological measures.</p>
<p>All in all, we believe that the contrast analysis procedure developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1073191112436664">Westen and Rosenthal (2003)</xref> represents a promising method for quantifying the clinical utility of a measure when predictions are made by clinicians and when supplemented with specific information regarding inaccurate predictions, as we have demonstrated in the present study. This method provides a much stricter test of understanding the network of associations for a given construct than the typical procedure of describing, post hoc, patterns of correlations or, more problematically, focusing only on those correlations that support the validity of the measure being evaluated and discarding the rest. Indeed, this approach aids in establishing the clinical utility of measures. In practice, clinicians must make a priori predictions about how a measure will work and the other constructs to which it will relate, and those predictions must be accurate, for that measure to be useful. We recommend that future studies examining the criterion validity of psychological measures employ a range of criteria and use the <italic>r<sub>contrast-cv</sub></italic> procedure in conjunction with examining the accuracy of specific predictions in greater detail.</p>
<p>This study has several limitations. First, all measures were self-report and all participants were college students. It has often been suggested that the use of self-report assessment and nonclinical samples for studying personality pathology can be limited, particularly regarding response validity and generalizability. Accordingly, future research should investigate the validity of the PNI in other kinds of samples, particularly those that oversample individuals with pathological narcissism. We used a sampling strategy whereby we were likely to identify individuals with high levels of narcissism who might not present these problems in a clinical setting. An important question for future research is to ascertain whether the patterns we obtained in this study are generalizable to typical treatment-seeking individuals. Researchers should also investigate pathological narcissism using different methodologies, such as interviews, informant reports, clinician reports, performance-based measures, and lab tasks, as well as different analytic techniques (e.g., person-centered approaches).</p>
<p>A similar limitation is that seven of the nine clinician raters were graduate student clinicians, representing a limited range of practicing clinicians. This may have provided a more conservative test of the utility of the PNI. Additionally, nonexpert clinician raters ranged in their area of expertise, treatment orientation, and preferred treatment populations, providing heterogeneity to this group of student clinician raters. A final limitation with regard to generalizing the clinical utility of the PNI observed in our study is that we provided raters with a description of the primary and criterion scales, whereas practicing clinicians may not always have this information readily available. This highlights the importance of clinicians familiarizing themselves with scale descriptions of the measures they use in their practice.</p>
<p>In conclusion, these data provide evidence for both the validity and clinical utility of the PNI by showing that the grandiosity and vulnerability composites demonstrate a pattern of correlations with a wide range of criterion variables that was largely predictable by theory and by practicing clinicians. These results add to the growing evidence for the validity of this promising instrument, point to its research and clinical utility for measuring narcissistic personality pathology, and build confidence in the accuracy of predictions made using the PNI.</p>

<p>Our four expert raters included Mark Lukowitsky, Joshua Miller, Aaron Pincus, and Aidan Wright. Given that Dr. Miller is the only expert rater who was not affiliated with the development of the PNI, it was possible that his ratings may have systematically differed from the ratings provided by the three experts who were affiliated with the development of the PNI. To evaluate this possibility, we computed correlations between the predicted correlations provided by each expert rater and the average predicted correlations provided by the three remaining expert raters, excluding that rater. Results indicated that Dr. Miller’s ratings demonstrated higher correlations with the group average (excluding himself) than any other expert’s ratings correlated with the group average (excluding himself). Given the consistency between ratings provided by Dr. Miller and ratings provided by experts involved in the development of the PNI, we chose to present the predicted correlations provided by our four expert raters as a uniform group.</p>
