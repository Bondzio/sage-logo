<abstract>
<p>Although the main responsibility for informed consent of medical procedures rests with doctors, nurses’ roles are also important, especially as patient advocates. Nurses’ preparation for this role in settings with a hierarchical and communal culture has received little attention. We explored the views of hospital managers and nurses regarding the roles of nurses in informed consent and factors influencing these roles. We conducted a qualitative study in a private, multispecialty hospital in Indonesia. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with seven managers. Two rounds of focus group discussions with nurses (n = 27) were conducted. Constant comparative approach was used in the analysis. Nurses can act as manager, witness, information giver, and advocate in the informed consent process. These roles are influenced by nurses’ preparedness, hospital culture and policy, patients’ understanding, family involvement, and cost-related issues. In preparation for these tasks, nurses should acquire communication skills, clinical knowledge, and legal and ethical knowledge.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The purpose of informed consent in health care is to ensure that patient autonomy is respected in decisions about their health care. Since effective informed consent depends on patients being able to make decisions about treatment free of pressure and based on logical reasoning, patients should receive adequate information about the nature, alternatives, risks, and benefits of the proposed treatment.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0969733012468467">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0969733012468467">2</xref>
</sup> Obviously, real autonomy is impossible to achieve, and the process may be more appropriately characterized as “mutual dependence.” However, in order to reach an informed agreement about treatment, it is of vital importance that this mutual dependence should be acknowledged in dialogue.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0969733012468467">3</xref>
</sup> This implies that shared decision making by professionals and patients is called for with professionals providing the necessary medical information and patients informing professionals about their medical condition and illness perception.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0969733012468467">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0969733012468467">4</xref>
</sup> When informed consent is based on appropriate sharing of information, it can protect the safety of both physicians and patients.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0969733012468467">5</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>We studied the nurses’ roles in the informed consent process in clinical care in Indonesia. Informed consent is required by law for every medical procedure. Physicians are expected to explain to patients the diagnosis, the procedure, the purpose, the risk, the alternatives, and the prognosis of the disease and proposed treatment. When patients have received and understood this information, they can give consent in writing or orally, but written consent is mandatory for procedures that are considered to be invasive.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0969733012468467">6</xref>
</sup> Similar requirements are reported for other settings: adequacy of information, competence of decision makers, and voluntariness.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0969733012468467">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0969733012468467">2</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Practices related to informed consent and nurses’ roles in the process are strongly influenced by the pattern of relationships among the different stakeholders: patients, their families, and health professionals. This is particularly relevant in Indonesia and in other parts of the world where the culture is characterized by a strong hierarchy and communality.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0969733012468467">7</xref>
</sup> A culture is considered hierarchical when large power distances between people are generally accepted, in other words, when there is a large power differential between people of “higher” and “lower” status in the hierarchy, such as old and young people, seniors and juniors, and doctors and patients. “Communality” refers to the role of the community in people’s lives and personal decisions. In a strong communal culture, there is a strong involvement of the whole family and even the wider community in decisions relating to individual members of the community.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0969733012468467">7</xref>
</sup> A hierarchical and communal culture tends to be reflected in health care by low patient involvement in the communication between patients and health professionals,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0969733012468467">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0969733012468467">9</xref>
</sup> in a hierarchical relationship between doctors and nurses<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0969733012468467">10</xref>
</sup> and in a strong engagement of the family in the decision making about a patient’s health care.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0969733012468467">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0969733012468467">8</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Although in Indonesia, it is the doctor’s responsibility to give information about and obtain consent for treatment,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0969733012468467">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0969733012468467">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0969733012468467">12</xref>
</sup> it is observed that this task is also delegated to nurses. Another way in which nurses sometimes become involved in informed consent is when they notice a patient’s need for more information to help them decide about their health care.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0969733012468467">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0969733012468467">13</xref>
</sup> This can encourage nurses to act as patient advocates.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0969733012468467">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0969733012468467">15</xref>
</sup> Nurses, who have intensive interaction with patients, family, and doctors,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0969733012468467">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0969733012468467">17</xref>
</sup> can ensure that patients’ right to make an informed decision is respected.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0969733012468467">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0969733012468467">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0969733012468467">18</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0969733012468467"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0969733012468467">20</xref>
</sup> This role is in concordance with the ethical code of nursing in Indonesia,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0969733012468467">21</xref>
</sup> which strongly reflects the International Code of Nursing Ethics.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0969733012468467">22</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>In daily practice, it remains unclear whether nurses perform these roles in concordance with their professional domain, or whether it is more doing the task of assisting doctors in providing patient care. Despite literature arguing that nurses should be advocates and this role is often assumed to be embedded in nursing curricula,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0969733012468467">23</xref>
</sup> there is limited evidence that nurses are sufficiently prepared for this role.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0969733012468467">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0969733012468467">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0969733012468467">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0969733012468467">25</xref>
</sup> In hierarchical and communal cultures, like that of Indonesia, the role of nurses as patient advocates is even more complicated.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0969733012468467">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0969733012468467">13</xref>
</sup> Although our study was conducted in one South East Asian country, this type of culture is shared by many nations,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0969733012468467">7</xref>
</sup> and due to growing global mobility, health-care providers are increasingly likely to encounter intercultural challenges related to the informed consent process in their health-care practice.</p>
<p>In order to identify what preparation nurses need to be able to participate skillfully and with confidence in the informed consent process in a strongly hierarchical and communal context, we explored the following two questions: (a) How do nurses and managers perceive nurses’ roles in the informed consent process? (b) What factors influence whether and how nurses will actually perform these roles in daily practice? We used Indonesia as an example of a country with a hierarchical and communal culture.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section3-0969733012468467">
<title>Study context</title>
<p>The study was conducted in a private 300-bed (above average) hospital providing multispecialty services in a metropolitan city in Indonesia. Most patients are from middle and upper class socioeconomic backgrounds, and while some of them have health insurance, “out-of-pocket” payment is the predominant method of payment, and costs are calculated based on the service provided (fee for service).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0969733012468467">26</xref>
</sup> The hospital subsidizes health care for a limited number of patients of low economic status.</p>
<p>The hospital staff consists of around 50 home physicians (general practitioners and specialists), 100 guest doctors (consultant specialists), and 400 nurses. Specialists are in charge of patient care in the wards, but when they are not available, patient care is mostly provided by nurses, who report to and consult with specialists by telephone.</p>
<p>In the hospital where the study was conducted, informed consent is regulated by a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) based on national regulations on informed consent. The hospital has published a list of medical procedures that require written informed consent. It is the responsibility of the doctors to provide information to patients, and this usually takes place after the doctor has made a diagnosis and planned a treatment. When a patient agrees with the planned treatment, the doctor proceeds to make preparations for the procedure. In this phase, patients do not necessarily sign a consent form, but their consent may be implied, for example, when they are admitted to the hospital or registered for surgery. At a later stage, before the actual performance of the procedure, a nurse obtains signatures from the patient or family members, from attending doctors, and from witnesses, as required in the informed consent form. The Medical Record Department checks whether the informed consent form has been duly completed and files the form in the patient’s medical record.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0969733012468467">
<title>Data collection</title>
<p>After semi-structured interviews with hospital managers, we conducted focus group discussions (FGDs) with nurses.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0969733012468467">27</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0969733012468467"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0969733012468467">29</xref>
</sup> The hospital managers were key persons in different managerial positions in the hospital, and the interviews were conducted to elucidate the working environment of the nurses.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0969733012468467">30</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>For the semi-structured interviews, the primary researcher (A.P.S.) prepared an interview guide based on the research questions, which was reviewed by the co-authors (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0969733012468467">Appendix 1</xref>). All the interviews were conducted by A.P.S., in the Indonesian language. The guide was refined after the English translation of the transcript of the first interview was reviewed by the co-authors. The participants were aware of the exploratory nature of the interview and of the interviewer’s role. The interviews lasted 45–100 min and took place in the hospital. Each participant was interviewed once.</p>
<p>The FGDs were conducted in two rounds in the hospital’s meeting room. Each group met in two sessions, lasting 60–90 min each. The FGD guide was prepared by A.P.S. and reviewed by the co-authors (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app2-0969733012468467">Appendix 2</xref>). A.P.S., Y.P., and N.E. took turns as moderator, observer, and note-taker in different FGDs. All FGDs were conducted in the Indonesian language. The second FGD included “member checking”—a measure to ensure trustworthiness in qualitative research—by presenting the preliminary analysis of the first FGD to the participants and asking them to confirm that the analysis was an accurate reflection of the discussion. In the second FGD, participants additionally explored issues that had not been fully dealt with in the first FGD or which they wished to contribute.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0969733012468467">31</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Typical qualitative methods of data collection are interviews and FGDs. The former is appropriate for obtaining rich information from individuals and the latter benefit from the exchange of views between group members. We selected the method that best fitted the characteristics of the professional tasks of the participants. Holding different positions within the hospital, the managers clearly did not constitute a coherent group,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0969733012468467">32</xref>
</sup> and individual interviews seemed the method of choice for these participants, the more so, since we felt that group discussions, instead of offering added value, might introduce irrelevant noise due to the dynamics among the participants. Due to their engagement in the same task of providing nursing care to patients, the nurses, on the other hand, formed a cohesive group, whose opinions were best explored in FGDs. Moreover, FGDs offered the opportunity to include more nurses in the study, and interactions in the groups were expected to stimulate consideration of different views during the discussions.<sup>

</p>

<sec id="section5-0969733012468467">
<title>Sampling</title>
<p>In qualitative research, samples are drawn from a population to ensure the participation of particular groups of people with characteristics that are considered to be of relevance to the social phenomenon being studied. Consequently, we used nonprobability sampling and did not aim for statistical representativeness.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0969733012468467">33</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>The interviewees were key persons involved in developing policies for informed consent in the hospital, in defining the roles of doctors and nurses in this process, and in decision making to ensure that hospital staff have the appropriate skills for these tasks. We refer to them as “managers” in this study.</p>
<p>We purposively selected seven key informants to ensure variety of manager roles. The managers were members of the hospital Board of Directors, the medical committee, or the nursing committee, and they managed a training division, medical records unit, and the hospital’s professional nursing organization. Their professional backgrounds were in nursing and medicine, and one was a medical records expert.</p>
<p>Twenty-seven nurses participated in the FGDs. They were purposively selected to represent three groups of nurses: junior nurses, intermediate level nurses, and senior nurses. To do justice to their different degrees of exposure to professional experience, managerial tasks, and hospital culture<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0969733012468467">28</xref>
</sup> and to prevent adverse effects of hierarchy issues during the discussions, we composed three groups of nurses of similar seniority. To ensure maximum variation,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0969733012468467">34</xref>
</sup> each group consisted of nine participants from different departments: general inpatient wards, maternity ward, pediatric ward, surgery, intensive care, emergency, and outpatient ward. Details of the ethical aspects are provided in the “ethics statement.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0969733012468467">
<title>Data analysis</title>
<p>The interviews and the FGDs were audio-recorded and transcribed. We used a constant comparison method of analysis guided by the research questions. The field notes were used to check the transcripts. In order to maintain all subtle information that would otherwise be lost in translation, the analysis was conducted by Indonesian speaking researchers. After reading the transcripts several times, the researchers applied open coding and developed coding categories to serve as the framework for the analysis. Emerging themes were discussed by the researchers.</p>
<p>The FGD transcripts were analyzed independently by A.P.S., N.E., and Y.P. and discussed until consensus was reached. As no new information was seen to emerge after six transcripts were analyzed, saturation was considered to have been reached. The themes identified in the analysis of the interviews were compared with the themes from the analysis of the focus groups. In this way, trustworthiness was enhanced<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0969733012468467">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0969733012468467">33</xref>
</sup> through triangulation of findings based on information from different methods (key informant interviews and focus group interviews), from different participants (managers and nurses), and analyzed by different researchers.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0969733012468467">28</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Member checking was conducted in the second round of the FGDs, and again after completion of the analysis by presenting the results of the analysis to the participants, asking them if they recognized our interpretation in their daily practice.<sup>

<sec id="section7-0969733012468467">
<title>Ethics considerations</title>
<p>Ethical acceptability was assessed by the local research ethical review body. Along with their recommendation, the local Hospital Board of Directors granted permission to conduct the study (Letter No: 277/SDM/IV-2007). No physical risk was identified in this study. The participants were informed about the goal and the procedure. A.P.S. approached the managers in person and sent written invitations to the nurses. It was explained to the participants that participation was voluntary, that refusal would have no consequences, and their input would contribute to the improvement of the hospital. All those invited agreed to participate in the study. The managers gave written consent prior to their interview, and the nurses did so before the first focus group session. Confidentiality was ensured by several measures. Only participants and researchers were present at the interviews and the FGDs. At the start and the end of every FGD, we underlined confidentiality, and therefore, we requested participants not to disclose any part of the discussion to maintain the confidentiality of their colleagues. We ensured anonymity in the transcripts and reports of the study.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>The results relating to the two research questions are presented consecutively. For each research question, we present the combined themes identified in the analysis of the interviews and the FDGs.</p>
<sec id="section9-0969733012468467">
<title>Nurses’ roles in the informed consent process</title>
<p>Four roles were identified: manager, patient advocate, witness, and information giver.</p>
<sec id="section10-0969733012468467">
<title>Manager</title>
<p>In their role as manager of the informed consent process, nurses should ensure that the process is conducted properly. Nurses’ tasks in continuing patient care were considered to include the responsibility for preparing informed consent forms, requesting patients to complete the form, and keeping the completed forms in the patients’ medical records. One of the preoperative tasks of nurses is to make sure that the patient signs the informed consent form before the procedure, and that it is also signed by the doctor.
<disp-quote>
<p>Without informed consent, we cannot continue the work ... Nurses notice this continuity ... If they don’t do it (asking for signatures), this continuity will be disrupted. (Manager 5)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0969733012468467">
<title>Witness</title>
<p>This role requires nurses to attend a meeting of doctors, patients, and the patient’s family members and record what they have witnessed. Nurses also sign the informed consent form as a witness. Participants suggested that these tasks are an important precautionary measure against legal action.
<disp-quote>
<p>The doctor, the nurse, the patient, and the family should sit down together and talk about the procedure. Thus, the nurse and the family can witness the process. (Manager 3)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0969733012468467">
<title>Patient advocate</title>
<p>Our participants were aware that appropriate provision of information and voluntariness are key elements of informed consent. They indicated, however, that patients did not always express their need for further information and were afraid that unless they signed the form, the doctor would not provide optimal treatment. In the words of one participant:
<disp-quote>
<p>Some professionals just tell the patient: if you want surgery, please sign. Otherwise, don’t sign and there will be no surgery. (Manager 4)</p>
</disp-quote> As patient advocates, nurses can mediate between the different parties: patients and their family, other health professionals, and the hospital. Nurses can encourage patients to express any unspoken concerns or to bring questions to the doctor’s attention. They also facilitate meetings of doctors, patients, and family to ensure adequacy of information. This role is illustrated in the following citation:
<disp-quote>
<p>There was a patient with metastatic cancer and deteriorating consciousness. The doctor said that without surgery she might die. The family did not have adequate financial means or insurance. Besides, they had three teen-age children needing education. Knowing that the family was confused, a nurse explored the family’s understanding and concern. She discovered that family members had not received a full explanation of the patient’s condition, including the prognosis with or without the surgery. The surgery would save the patient’s life, but it was not a curative measure. The nurse discussed this issue with doctors and proposed that the case be reviewed by the ethical committee. In the end, the family decided to cancel the surgery despite the possibility of some financial support from the hospital. The nurse wondered if she had infringed on the doctor’s privilege, but she also felt that it was her responsibility to give the patient and her family an informed choice.</p>

<title>Information giver</title>
<p>Participants thought that nurses could give explanations to patients about the preparations for a procedure, such as fasting before anesthesia. They could also recapitulate what the doctor had explained, when requested do to so by a patient. For, although doctors explain about treatment, some patients do not understand the information and afterward ask the nurse to explain it again.

<title>Factors influencing whether and how nurses perform their roles in relation to informed consent</title>
<p>Whether and how nurses perform their roles in informed consent in daily practice is influenced by their preparedness to perform the roles (nurse factor), by hospital policy and culture (hospital factor), by patients’ understanding of information, by family involvement, and by cost-related issues (patient factor).</p>
<sec id="section15-0969733012468467">
<title>Nurse factor: nurses’ preparedness to perform the roles</title>
<p>The nature of their professional tasks in patient care means that nurses are accessible to patients, which enables them to act as patient advocates.
<disp-quote>
<p>Nurses stay beside the patient for 24 hours. The doctor only appears for fifteen minutes per day, frequently in a hurry. When patients don’t understand the doctor’s explanation, they ask the nurse. (Manager 5)</p>
</disp-quote> However, nurses do not always feel comfortable approaching doctors or giving information. Nurses may question their own knowledge about the disease in question and the management options, or be afraid that they will be accused of overstepping their professional boundaries.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-0969733012468467">
<title>Hospital factor: hospital policy and culture</title>
<p>Participants were not aware of the existence of the hospital’s informed consent policy. Nurses learned, usually informally, about the rules from senior nurses or ward managers. They observed that different hospital divisions held different views regarding the informed consent policy and perceived this to be confusing.
<disp-quote>
<p>With serial chemotherapy for cancer, I don’t know if we need to ask for a signature every time the patient comes for treatment, or only at the first chemotherapy. (Nurse 2—intermediate)</p>
</disp-quote> The role division in informed consent was not clear to participants. Consequently, nurses were hesitant to give information if they did not know whose task this was.</p>
<p>Relations between nurses and between doctors and nurses were also considered to be influenced by the “hospital culture.” If relations were problematic, nurses were likely to play safe and refrain from playing their part in informed consent. Junior nurses, for example, might feel reluctant to manage difficult cases if they did not feel comfortable with their senior nurse supervisors or with some doctors.
<disp-quote>
<p>It is not always easy to propose something, we feel not comfortable to “tell” the doctor. It is not nice to push them. If the doctor is “easy,” then it is no problem. (Nurse 14—junior)</p>
</disp-quote> To avoid infringement of doctors’ authority, nurses could restrict the provision of information to repeating information they had witnessed doctors explaining to patients.</p>
<p>Additionally, nurses felt overloaded with different tasks in the hospital. Participants expected that if nurses had more time, communication with patients would improve:
<disp-quote>
<p>When a patient refuses a treatment, we know that we should explore their reason for the refusal and try to negotiate. However, we are too busy for that and so we often just ask them to sign the refusal form. (Nurse 6—junior)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-0969733012468467">
<title>Patient factor: patients’ understanding, family involvement, and cost issues</title>
<p>Participants were concerned that patients’ varying abilities to understand information added to the complexity of the informed consent process.
<disp-quote>
<p>People are getting smarter due to globalization. When patients know more, they tend to sue more easily. (Manager 5)</p>
<p>Some patients speak only the local language and then it is even more difficult to explain things. (Nurse 5—intermediate)</p>
</disp-quote> Participants also thought that the strong role of the family in decision making about a patient’s health care had a detrimental effect on patient autonomy and patients’ competence to make decisions. It was remarked that decisions were discussed by the doctor and the patient’s family, even if the patient was an adult and conscious.</p>
<p>Participants were concerned that family dominance could give rise to misperceptions among professionals concerning the informed consent process. This is illustrated by the following citation:
<disp-quote>
<p>Once I got a midnight call from an emergency nurse. An adult patient, conscious and in good mental health needed an emergency procedure. The nurse asked who should sign the consent form, since no family members accompanied the patient. (Manager 2)</p>
</disp-quote> When many relatives are involved, decision making tends to be very time consuming. When all family members demand to be informed, explanations and negotiations have to be repeated several times over. Matters are even more complicated if patients and the family choose traditional treatment as an alternative option, or if the cost of treatment is high.</p>
<p>As most patients have to pay for their own health care, cost was considered a crucial factor in decisions about treatment. Participants were aware that informing patients about cost was a difficult task, especially in an emergency situation when the patient and the family are in a panic. In their role as manager of the informed consent process, nurses tend to consider these factors as troublesome and a cause of delay in the delivery of care.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We explored the roles of nurses in the informed consent process and factors influencing these roles. Different roles were identified: manager, advocate, witness, and information giver, all requiring adequate preparation. Considering the complexity of the factors affecting nurses’ performance of these roles, it seems important that preparation should go beyond “training the nurses” to include efforts to change hospital policy and culture.<sup>

</sup>
</p>
<p>Previous studies have highlighted the different roles of nurses in informed consent. Some studies emphasize the role of nurses as advocates<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0969733012468467">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0969733012468467">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0969733012468467">20</xref>
</sup> and witnesses.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0969733012468467">13</xref>
</sup> Another study shows that nurses as information givers in an interventional radiology setting helped improve patients’ understanding.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0969733012468467">24</xref>
</sup> In our view, these roles are interrelated and require specific professional competence. Since our findings imply that a sound informed consent process is not easy to achieve, we argue that the role of patient advocate should be emphasized, the more so, since this role fits within the professional domain of nursing<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0969733012468467">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0969733012468467">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0969733012468467">37</xref>
</sup> and is desired by nurses.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0969733012468467">13</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>While being eager to promote the provision of adequate information and ensure patient autonomy, nurses can be inhibited in their actions by concerns about crossing the boundary between doctors’ responsibilities and their own. A similar finding was reported in Korea.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0969733012468467">13</xref>
</sup> Nurses are often in a position where they have to act as patient advocates in making an appeal to doctors and collaborate with them, but they should be able to undertake this role without jeopardizing the relationships among patients, doctors, and nurses.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0969733012468467">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0969733012468467">38</xref>
</sup> Another study found that doctors held various views. Some perceived nurses’ advocacy roles as helpful, but others felt that nurses might interfere with patients’ decision making.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0969733012468467">5</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>The challenges faced by nurses in performing their role in informed consent can be explained by the prevailing hierarchical culture in the setting of our study,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0969733012468467">7</xref>
</sup> where patients tend to feel uncomfortable in addressing their doctor, because doctors are perceived to be higher in the social hierarchy.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0969733012468467">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0969733012468467">9</xref>
</sup> Nurses may be reluctant to act as patient advocates due to the strong paternalistic culture among health professionals.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0969733012468467">10</xref>
</sup> A strong blaming culture can be an additional challenge. Afraid of having to take the blame, health professionals may tend to protect themselves rather than their patients.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0969733012468467">5</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Another cultural factor is the strong involvement of the family, which can interfere with patient autonomy. Other studies in Asia<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0969733012468467">11</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0969733012468467"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0969733012468467">13</xref>
</sup> have confirmed that this is a “complication” of a communal culture.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0969733012468467">7</xref>
</sup> When health professionals and family members fail to include the patient in the decision-making process, patient autonomy may suffer.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0969733012468467">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0969733012468467">8</xref>
</sup> This threat to patient autonomy highlights the importance of the role of nurses as patient advocates. In this role, nurses can promote patient autonomy by helping to determine whether a patient is competent to make an informed decision, by exploring the patient’s preferred role in decision making, and by communicating to the family whether or not the patient is competent to make an autonomous decision.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0969733012468467">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0969733012468467">39</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Finally, when health care is predominantly financed by out-of-pocket payments and costs are based on fee-for-service, financial considerations can become a major factor in patients’ decision making.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0969733012468467">26</xref>
</sup> This cost-related issue is an example of the influence of national policy on the microlevel of informed consent.</p>
<p>Since our results indicate that patient autonomy is under threat from various factors in the practice of informed consent, we would argue that nurses have an important contribution to make to a sound informed consent process by safeguarding patient autonomy.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0969733012468467">20</xref>
</sup> For proper performance of their role as patient advocates, nurses should be well prepared, free of fear of being blamed, and supported by the hospital.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0969733012468467">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0969733012468467">23</xref>
</sup> Based on our findings, we have mapped the educational elements required to prepare nurses for their roles in informed consent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0969733012468467">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<p>This model is in line with the “UK consensus statement on the content of communication curricula in undergraduate medical education” presented by Von Fragstein et al.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0969733012468467">39</xref>
</sup> as a framework for communication skills training for health-care professionals. The authors of the consensus statement argue that communication skills training should prepare professionals to go “beyond the patient” and also communicate with patients’ families and other professionals with diverse cultural backgrounds.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0969733012468467">39</xref>
</sup> Communication skills should be integrated with the development of legal and ethical knowledge and evidence-based practice as reflected in clinical competence.<sup>

<title>Rigor and constraints</title>
<p>The rigor of our study is ensured by several measures underpinned by quality principles in qualitative research.<sup>

</sup> To increase reliability, the researchers first analyzed the data independently before reaching consensus by discussing the results of their respective analyses.</p>
<p>Additionally, we used triangulation, which is a measure to achieve validity in qualitative research by collecting data from different stakeholders (managers and nurses with various working domains and levels of experience) and using different methods (FGD and interviews). Moreover, we conducted “member checking” to ensure that our interpretation of the data was shared by the participants.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0969733012468467">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0969733012468467">33</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it is a limitation of the study that it was conducted in only one setting. This limits the transferability of the results to different settings, as transferability is inevitably context dependent. However, our aim in conducting the study was primarily to provide insights into the role of nurses in informed consent rather than to offer generalizable results. Further research in different settings would be needed to determine the generalizability of our findings, but for now we leave it to the readers to judge whether and which particular aspects of our findings they deem to be relevant to and suitable for adoption in their particular settings.</p>
<p>Although the role of nurses as patient advocates is frequently mentioned in different studies, the feasibility of our recommendation will depend on the degree of nurses’ involvement in informed consent. Further studies are recommended among larger populations in different settings and cultures. The views of other stakeholders, including patients, also deserve exploration. With the increasing importance of interprofessional collaboration, it would be interesting also to investigate how the advocacy role is applied by other health professions.</p>

<title>Practical implications</title>
<p>The overall findings of the study will be used to inform strategies to improve education and policy, especially in the setting of the study. Furthermore, we think that our findings may offer some insights that can be of use to a broader audience. The results relating to the effects of paternalistic relations and family involvement, for instance, seem to be transferable to hierarchical and communal cultures, such as those found in many countries in Asia, Africa, and South America.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0969733012468467">7</xref>
</sup> Also, our findings seem to be transferable to settings where “out-of-pocket” payments for health care are dominant and where decision making by patients is likely to be complicated by cost considerations.</p>
<p>Our arguments in support of training for the advocacy role as one of the central roles in the nursing professions are relevant for settings where nurses’ and doctors’ roles are not viewed as complementary and equal. Finally, our educational recommendations, which underline the importance of an integrated approach, can be translated to both undergraduate and postgraduate nursing education.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section21-0969733012468467">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Our exploration of the perceptions of hospital managers and nurses appears to support the following preliminary conclusions: (a) nurses play essential roles in the informed consent process as manager, patient advocate, witness, and information giver; (b) whether and how nurses will perform these roles depends on their preparedness, hospital culture and policy, patients’ understanding, family involvement, and cost factors. Communication skills training, improvement of clinical knowledge, and education in legal and ethical perspectives are needed to ensure that nurses are adequately prepared for their roles. It should be emphasized, however, that training alone is not sufficient. Changes in hospital policy and culture are also required.</p>

<p>Participants are requested to read this following scenario:</p>
<p>A surgeon asks you to obtain informed consent from a patient who is scheduled to have a surgical procedure. The patient has some questions regarding the risk, the cost, and the benefit of the surgery. You try to tell the surgeon that the patient has some questions. The surgeon asks you to get the signature and says that he will be back later to talk with the patient. Based on the past observations, you are doubtful that the surgeon will return.</p>
