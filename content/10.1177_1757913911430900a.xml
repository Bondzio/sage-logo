<title>Arts and Wellbeing: Recent Developments, Future Challenges</title>
<p>Throughout the UK, health professionals and creative artists have worked together for over 25 years in using the arts to support healthcare and health promotion. Given the current uncertainties over reforms to the NHS and public health, and the Big Society agenda, it is timely to examine the achievements of arts and health collaborations to date and look forward to new challenges and opportunities. Speakers will look at the growing evidence-base for the value of involvement in creative activity for wellbeing and health – both in the UK and internationally. Workshops will provide opportunities for participants to learn about current arts for wellbeing projects from leading arts for health practitioners.</p>

<title>Obesity limits the effectiveness of flu vaccines</title>
<p>A study from the University of South Carolina (UNC) has found that obesity may make annual flu shots less effective.</p>
<p>The study found that influenza vaccine antibody levels decline significantly in obese people compared to healthy weight individuals. The research also found that the response of a certain type of white blood cell, which plays a key role in the body’s immune system (CD8+T) are defective in overweight people.</p>
<p>Researchers studied people at the university clinic who had been vaccinated with the common flu vaccine in late 2009. They found that whilst obese, overweight and healthy weight individuals all developed antibodies to flu viruses within the first month, the antibody levels in the blood declined more rapidly in obese and overweight individuals over time.</p>
<p>Around 50% of obese participants had a four-fold decrease in antibody levels at 12 months compared to one month post vaccination. However, less than 25% of healthy weight participants had a four-fold decrease in antibody levels.</p>
<p>Melinda Beck, Professor and Associate Chair of Nutrition at the UNC Gillings School of Global Public Health and senior author of the study, said: “These results suggest that overweight and obese people would be more likely than healthy weight people to experience flu illness following exposure to the flu virus. Previous studies have indicated the possibility that obesity might impair the human body’s ability to fight flu viruses. These new findings seem to give us a reason why obese people were more susceptible to influenza illness during the H1N1 pandemic compared to healthy weight people.”</p>
