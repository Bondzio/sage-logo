<abstract>
<p>The aim of the present experiment was to investigate the extent to which the orientation of objects drawn in side view is a function of culture, age, and manual dominance. Right-handed French and Syrian children aged between 6 and 10 years and right-handed adults from the same cultural groups were asked to produce side views of faces, vehicles (car and airplane), self-centered tools with a handle (mug and toothbrush), object-centered tools with a handle (jug and hammer), and animals (dog and fish) using their dominant and nondominant hands. The French participants exhibited a leftward directional bias, whereas their Syrian counterparts displayed a rightward bias. However, no differences between the two cultural groups were observed in the 6-year-olds, who did not present any systematic directional bias in their drawings. Furthermore, regardless of culture, the children did not modify the orientation of the objects in their drawings as a function of the hand used, whereas the hand effect was strong in adults. Finally, despite their directional bias toward the right, the Syrian participants tended to draw the self- and object-centered tools facing leftward. These results are discussed with reference to the current literature on this topic.</p>

<body>
<p>A large body of research has revealed that when participants are asked to produce drawings of familiar objects in side view, they tend to draw them in a preferred orientation, usually with the objects facing to the left. According to some authors, this directional tendency constitutes a stable perceptuo-motor bias that appears to be cerebrally lateralized, at least in right-handers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022022111435098">Alter, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022022111435098">Dreman, 1974</xref>). As a special type of visuo-spatial task, drawing is thought to preferentially activate the right hemisphere, thus inducing an attentional bias to the left (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022022111435098">Kinsbourne, 1970</xref>). However, as cogently argued by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022022111435098">Vaid (2011)</xref>, the fact that this directional bias has been shown to be sensitive to various endogenous and exogenous factors casts doubt on whether the directionality bias in drawing can be considered to be a genuine indicator of cerebral lateralization. Among these factors, it seems particularly important to determine how sensitive the directional bias is to cultural influences in order to demonstrate the necessity for cross-cultural studies, which will lead to a comprehensive understanding of the various determinants of behavioral performance. However, as we explain below, many questions relating to directionality in drawing remain unanswered.</p>
<p>The decision to draw an object facing either to the left or the right seems to be related to a number of different factors. Handedness is one of these factors. Right-handed individuals are known to present a greater degree of hemispheric asymmetry than left-handers, thus inducing a greater leftward directional bias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022022111435098">Dreman, 1974</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022022111435098">Shannon (1978)</xref> reported that right-handers drew faces with profiles looking to the left in around 80% of cases, while this percentage fell to 45% in left-handers. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022022111435098">Alter (1989)</xref> reported clear differences between dextral (predominantly left-directed) and sinistral (prominently right-directed) adults and discovered that the leftward bias increased in strength after 40 years of age in dextrals. In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022022111435098">Karev’s (1999)</xref> study, the leftward bias was much more pronounced in right-handers than in left-handers, who, however, exhibited no contrasting rightward directional bias of the type observed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022022111435098">Alter (1989)</xref>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022022111435098">Picard (2011)</xref> reported observing this difference between right-handers and left-handers at 9 years of age but not before. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022022111435098">Vaid (1995)</xref> observed that right-handed Hindi girls aged between 9 and 13 years exhibited a leftward figure orientation, while the left-handed girls in the study tended to orient their drawings toward the right. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0022022111435098">Vaid, Singh, Sakhuja, and Gupta (2002)</xref> confirmed this finding in adults by analyzing stroke movement direction rather than object orientation. However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022022111435098">Scheirs (1990)</xref> did not find any preferred orientation in the drawing of face profiles by either right-handers or left-handers (approximately 50% left-oriented). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022022111435098">De Agostini and Chokron (2002)</xref> failed to observe any directional preference in the drawing of profile views of faces in left-handers, although they reported a leftward bias in right-handers. These authors also mentioned that children (7 to 10 years of age) primarily produced right-directed profiles.</p>
<p>Some of the differences between right-handers and left-handers may also be due to the differential impact of biomechanical constraints on the movements performed with the right or left hand, regardless of laterality. A small number of studies have investigated the role of hand use in the directionality of side view drawings. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022022111435098">Alter (1989)</xref> did not highlight any impact of hand dominance, finding that a great majority of the observed adults (80%) oriented their drawings in the same direction whether they employed their dominant or nondominant hands. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022022111435098">Taguchi and Noma (2005)</xref> asked right-handed Japanese preschool children and adults to produce drawings of fish with their dominant and nondominant hand. They reported that the children and adults drew fishes facing to the left when they employed their dominant (right) hand in 77% and 100% of cases, respectively, while these percentages decreased slightly to 59% and 83% with the nondominant hand. However, the very restricted type of drawings required from the participants (only drawings of fish and only one trial per hand) makes it difficult to interpret these findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022022111435098">Karev, 2006</xref>). Finally, Vaid and Chen (2009, as cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022022111435098">Vaid, 2011</xref>) failed to report any hand use effect in right-handers. By contrast, a stronger leftward facing bias was observed in lefthanders when they drew with their right hand than with their left hand.</p>
<p>The role of cultural reading and writing habits on drawing directionality has been investigated in only a very small number of studies. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022022111435098">Vaid (1995)</xref> reported that Hindi participants (who read and write from left to right) drew figures such as faces, elephants, or bicycles facing to the left, whereas Arab participants (who read and write from right to left) exhibited a clear rightward bias for the elephant and bicycle drawings and no bias for the face profile drawing. However, these latter participants produced left-oriented face drawings in 54% of cases—that is, at a significantly lesser level than Hindi participants (89%). Interestingly, Urdu participants, who differed from Hindi individuals only in their writing and reading directionality (right to left, in the same way as the Arab participants), drew faces with a leftward orientation but produced left-oriented elephant and bicycle drawings significantly less often than their Hindi counterparts. The same finding was observed in children between 9 and 13 years of age, with the Hindi children being more likely than Urdu children to orient their drawings toward the left. This cultural effect interacted with handedness, with no differences being observed between left-handed Hindi and Urdu children, who all oriented their drawings toward the right. However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022022111435098">Shannon (1978)</xref>, in a comparison of American and Hebrew adults, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022022111435098">Jensen (1952)</xref>, who compared Norwegian and Egyptian children, did not find any relationship between face profile orientation and cultural habits, with all the groups involved in these studies producing left-facing profiles. Unfortunately, the authors did not ask their participants to produce drawings of objects other than faces.</p>
<p>Finally, a small number of authors have observed that the directional bias depends on the type of object depicted. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022022111435098">Karev (1999)</xref> asked participants to produce a side view of a bicycle, an airplane, a lorry, a dog walking, a face, and a jug. The largest discrepancies between right-handed and left-handed individuals were observed for the drawing of the face and the jug. In the latter case, a “direct handedness effect” emerged, with the right-handers drawing the jug with the handle on the right (left-facing drawing), and the left-handers drawing it with the handle on the left (right-facing drawing). This means that in both cases the handle was drawn pointing toward the dominant hand. This effect had already been reported in an earlier study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0022022111435098">Van Sommers (1984)</xref>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022022111435098">Karev (1999)</xref> concluded that directionality seems to be guided by an autonomous cerebral mechanism that has evolved to facilitate the participant’s perceptuo-motor relationship with the environment. However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0022022111435098">Viggiano and Vannucci (2002)</xref> did not report this direct handedness effect. They observed that right-handers drew vehicles and animals facing leftward far more frequently than left-handers, while they did not differ in their drawings of tools, vegetables, and furniture.</p>
<p>Clearly, there are contradictions in the literature. The role of hand use has not been sufficiently studied. Nevertheless, it seems likely that this factor has an impact on drawing directionality. Because outward tensor movements are preferred to inward flexor movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022022111435098">Dreman, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0022022111435098">Van Sommers, 1984</xref>), the functioning of the two hands may be expected to be mirrored if biomechanical constraints act upon directionality, independently of hemispheric organization (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022022111435098">Reed &amp; Smith, 1961</xref>). Indeed, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0022022111435098">Van Sommers (1984)</xref> has shown that the final orientation of drawings is the result of an interaction between the direction of the sequence of movements (preferentially left to right with the right hand, right to left with the left hand) and the tendency to begin a drawing at the front of an object. However, the biomechanical factor is in competition with cultural habits: In right-handed individuals who are used to reading and writing in a right-to-left direction, this is the case when they employ their right hand, whereas the reverse is the case for individuals used to reading and writing left to right. Furthermore, the type of object depicted may directly interfere with both the cultural and the biomechanical effects if the hand directedness effect reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022022111435098">Karev (1999)</xref> is confirmed. Finally, none of the studies cited above has examined the combined effects of culture and age over a large range of ages. However, cultural influences relating to reading/writing habits may take time to shape an individual’s drawing behaviors. In our study, French and Syrian participants were compared because their reading/writing systems have opposite directionalities. Furthermore, it has been shown that the critical variable affecting directionality in drawing is the directionality used for writing single letters, not the overall directionality of the writing script (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022022111435098">Goodnow, Friedman, Bernbaum, &amp; Lehman, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022022111435098">Lieblich, Ninio, &amp; Kugelmass, 1975</xref>). The Arab writing system is directed right to left both in terms of the morphonetic component (letters) and the topokinetic component (movements along the horizontal lines). However, the two cultural groups are comparable on two important factors. Systematic literacy instruction is introduced when children are 6 years old in both countries, while some pre-formal instruction also starts during the kindergarten period in the two education systems. Furthermore, until recently, Syrian children have not received tuition in a second (Western) language, thus minimizing influences due to exposure to a directionality opposite to that used in their own language.</p>
<p>We asked French and Syrian right-handed children aged between 6 and 10 years and right-handed adults to produce side views of faces, vehicles (car and airplane), self-centered tools with a handle (mug and toothbrush), object-centered tools with a handle (jug and hammer), and animals (dog and fish), with their dominant and nondominant hand. The object-centered tools took the form of artifacts that elicit actions directed toward an external object (e.g., we use a jug to fill a glass), whereas the self-centered objects corresponded to artifacts that elicit actions related to one’s own body (e.g., we use a mug to drink). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0022022111435098">Viggiano and Vannucci (2002)</xref> suggested that self-centered tools might elicit a stronger handedness effect than object-centered tools. In line with the cross-cultural studies conducted by Vaid et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022022111435098">Vaid, 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022022111435098">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0022022111435098">Vaid et al., 2002</xref>), we expected that the leftward directional bias would be more pronounced in French individuals than in Syrian participants, at least as of the age at which reading/writing habits are sufficiently established in children. In line with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022022111435098">Braswell and Rosengren’s (2002)</xref> results reporting that the shapes produced by adults, but not by children, were mirrored across hands, we expected to observe a greater hand dominance effect on directionality in adults than in children. Finally, in the light of the direct handedness effect, Syrian participants should draw the objects with a handle facing leftward, in the same way as the French individuals, at least when using their dominant hand.</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>Seventy-two children and 48 adults participated in the study. The participants were divided into two groups consisting of 60 participants each (30 male, 30 female) as a function of their culture: a Western group (native language French, living in France) and a Western Asian group (native language Arabic, living in Syria). Across both the French and Syrian groups, the children were subdivided into three age groups (6 years, first primary grade, <italic>N</italic> = 24, half French, half Syrian; 8 years, third primary grade, <italic>N</italic> = 24, half French, half Syrian; 10 years, fifth primary grade, <italic>N</italic> = 24, half French, half Syrian). All the children were right-handed. Manual dominance was verified on the basis of three items drawn from a test developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022022111435098">De Agostini and Dellatolas (1988)</xref> for assessing manual dominance (hand used for handling a pen, a hammer, and scissors). The best single predictor of hand preference has been shown to be the hand used for hammering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022022111435098">Annett, 1970</xref>). We selected children who employed their right hand for the three tools. We were also careful to select children from similar socioeconomic levels (middle-class) in both countries. The experiment was run at the very beginning of the school year in order to minimize the potential effect of systematic reading and writing instruction in the 6-year-olds. Written parental consent was obtained for each child. The French adult group consisted of 24 right-handed participants (mean age = 27 years and 2 months). Some of the participants were attending university, whereas others belonged to a sports club. None of them had experience of a language with a right-to-left directionality. The Syrian adult group also contained 24 right-handed participants (mean age = 25 years and 4 months). We did not select any participants attending university in order to reduce potential influences coming from Western culture. More specifically, we also checked that none of them had learned a Western language. Manual preference was assessed in the adults using the same procedure as in children. All adults provided informed consent.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0022022111435098">
<title>Material and Procedure</title>
<p>Each participant was given a small booklet consisting of 20 unlined sheets of white paper (A5 format) stapled to the left, together with a pencil or ballpoint pen. They were asked to produce the drawings on these sheets of paper, with each drawing being produced on a separate sheet.</p>
<p>The participants were informed that they had to imagine different kinds of objects as if they were located in front of them, in a side view, in order to then produce a rough drawing using their right or left hand. The instructions made it clear that they were required to draw a side view of the object. Only a small number of the children in the first grade of primary school had difficulty understanding the term <italic>side view</italic>. In such cases, the experimenter illustrated this perspective using objects different from those used in the experiment. The participants were asked to produce 10 drawings belonging to 5 different categories using each hand: 2 vehicles (car, airplane), 2 faces (man and woman), 2 animals (dog and fish), 2 self-centered tools with a handle (mug and toothbrush), and 2 object-centered tools with a handle (jug and hammer). Thus, each participant produced 20 drawings presented in random order (however, we eliminated the cases of immediate alternation between the right and left hand for the drawing of the same object). A hand order effect may indeed be expected, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0022022111435098">Van Sommers (1984)</xref> reported that individuals are reluctant to modify their drawings in case of repetition. When an ambiguous drawing was produced, the experimenter asked the participant where a specific component of the object was located (for example, the lights or the pilot) in order to facilitate the coding of its orientation. The experimenter then added this information to the drawing.</p>
<p>Two judges who were unaware of the purpose of the experiment independently coded the orientation (leftward or rightward) of the drawn objects (100% interjudge agreement). A directionality index was computed as proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022022111435098">Alter (1989)</xref>: number of right-oriented drawings minus number of left-oriented drawings divided by the total number of drawings. This index can vary from –1 (consistent left orientation) to 1 (consistent right orientation). The proportions of left-facing drawings were also analyzed to investigate the effect of the type of depicted object. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022022111435098">Figure 1</xref> reproduces some of the illustrations of left-oriented drawings produced for the different categories. Local stroke direction was not coded because, in children below 10 years of age, development at this level undergoes an independent dynamic related to the hierarchical relations between the different graphic rules. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0022022111435098">Vinter (1994)</xref> has shown that, in Western children, left-to-right directionality is correctly adhered to at stroke level in kindergarten children, but decreases in strength between 5 and 8 years of age because of the increasing prevalence of threading in drawing behavior as of 6 years of age. It is only at 9 years of age that children start favoring left-to-right (and top-to-bottom) movements over threading in the same way as adults.</p>

<p>A significant Age × Culture interaction indicated that the drawing orientation of the youngest children did not differ as a function of culture, whereas that of the oldest children did, <italic>F</italic>(3, 112) = 3.7, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, η<italic><sup>2;p</sup></italic> = .09. More precisely, no directional bias was observed in the drawings produced by the 6-year-olds (the various mean directionality indexes did not differ from chance at this age, <italic>t<sub>s</sub></italic>(11) &lt; 1, <italic>ns</italic>, irrespective of culture and hand). On average, 48.75% of the drawings produced by the Syrian 6-year-olds and 53.3% of those produced by the French 6-year-olds were oriented leftward. By contrast, the directional bias, leftward in the French participants and rightward in the Syrian participants, increased strongly between 6 and 10 years of age. Indeed, 72.5% of the drawings produced by the French 10-year-olds displayed a leftward bias, while the corresponding value for Syrian 10-year-olds was 27%. Furthermore, while the cultural effect was similar in adults and children when they used their right hands, it completely disappeared in adults when the left hand was used, as the significant Age × Culture × Hand interaction indicates, <italic>F</italic>(3, 112) = 3.84, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, η<italic><sup>2;p</sup></italic> = .10. The mean directionality indexes of both the French and the Syrian adults did not differ from chance when the nondominant hand was used, <italic>t<sub>s</sub></italic>(23) &lt; 1, <italic>ns</italic>. More precisely, when they employed their right hand, French adults displayed a leftward bias in 71% of the drawings, whereas Syrian adults did so in 39% of their drawings. However, when the left hand was used, the corresponding percentages were 45% for the French group and 42% for the Syrian group.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0022022111435098">Figure 2</xref> suggests that the impact of hand dominance was especially strong in the French adults. However, we decided to perform a complementary analysis of this hand effect at the individual level because of the possibility that the directionality index might be unchanged (for instance, equal to 0, thus indicating that five objects were drawn to the left and the other five to the right) even though the participants systematically reversed the direction of each object when depicting it with the right and left hand, respectively. Thus, to gain a more thorough understanding of the effect of manual dominance at an intra-individual level, we coded whether or not the directionality of the drawing changed as a function of the hand used for each object and participant. We then analyzed the mean number of cases in which the two hands produced drawings oriented in the same direction (manual congruency) as a function of age, culture, and object. The ANOVA revealed a clear age effect, which was independent of culture and is depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0022022111435098">Figure 3</xref>, <italic>F</italic>(3, 112) = 10.3, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01, η = .22.

<p>The tendency of the participants to produce similar performances with the two hands increased slightly between 6 and 8 years of age in the Syrian group and between 6 and 10 years of age in the French group (although Newman-Keuls post hoc tests revealed that these trends were not significant, <italic>p<sub>s</sub></italic> &gt; .20) and decreased significantly in the two cultural groups between the age of 8 or 10 years and adulthood (Newman-Keuls post hoc tests, <italic>p<sub>s</sub></italic> &lt; .05). Both the French and Syrian adults tended to reverse the direction of their drawings when they shifted from one hand to the other much more often than the children did.</p>
<p>These results indicate that directionality in drawing, as assessed by the orientation of the depicted object, is a complex function of culture, hand, and age. We also considered the question of whether the type of object drawn in our study also had an influence on this directionality. To gain a coherent view of how directionality was modified by the nature of the depicted object, we performed an initial analysis only on the drawings produced with the right hand. An ANOVA was run with age and culture as between-subjects factors, and objects as a within-subjects factor. The objects factor reached significance, <italic>F</italic>(4, 448) = 12.9, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01, η<italic><sup>2;p</sup></italic> = .10, and also interacted with culture, <italic>F</italic>(4, 448) = 8.1, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01, η<italic><sup>2;p</sup></italic> = .07, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0022022111435098">Figure 4A</xref>.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0022022111435098">Figure 4A</xref> shows that the French participants produced a significantly higher number of left-oriented drawings than the Syrian participants for all categories of objects apart from two: the self-centered tools (Newman-Keuls post hoc test, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .90) and, to a lesser extent, the object-centered tools (Newman-Keuls post hoc test, <italic>p</italic> = .11). The Syrian participants produced left-oriented of the data for the object-centered category reveals that while the Syrian participants also drew the jug with the handle on the right, the handle was less frequently located on the right in the case of their hammer drawings. It should be noted that there was a significant Age × Culture × Objects interaction, which indicated that there was no difference between the French and Syrian 6-year-olds in terms of the orientation of the other three categories of objects: vehicles (rightward in the two groups), faces, and animals (tendency toward a leftward orientation in the two groups), <italic>F</italic>(12, 448) = 2.4, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01, η<italic><sup>2;p</sup></italic> = .06.</p>
<p>It was then necessary to determine whether these results were confirmed by the performances obtained with the nondominant left hand. We conducted an ANOVA on the proportions of left-directed drawings produced with the left hand, with age and culture as between-subjects factors and objects as a within-subjects factor. A significant Age × Culture × Objects interaction, <italic>F</italic>(12, 448) = 3.8, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01, η<italic><sup>2;p</sup></italic> = .09, revealed that the cultural differences observed in the orientation of face and animal drawings (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0022022111435098">Figure 4B</xref>) were essentially attributable to the 8- and 10-year-olds, while the performances of the young children and the adults in the two cultural groups were quite similar. Moreover, Newman-Keuls post hoc tests confirmed that the two cultural groups did not differ on the drawing of the self-centered and object-centered tools (<italic>p<sub>s</sub></italic> &gt; .50). However, it is worth pointing out that the self-centered and object-centered tools again tended to be drawn with a leftward orientation (or without preferential directionality) even though a reversal of direction might have been expected for these objects when drawn with the left hand.</p>
<p>Finally, the analysis of the degree of manual congruency at an intra-individual level did not provide any additional information. It simply indicated that the lowest level of manual congruency was observed for the face drawings in the French group, regardless of age.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In line with the results reported by Vaid et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022022111435098">Vaid, 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022022111435098">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0022022111435098">Vaid et al., 2002</xref>), our study revealed that the directionality of objects drawn in side view is associated with cultural reading and writing habits. Our right-handed French participants displayed a leftward bias, while their right-handed Syrian counterparts exhibited a rightward bias. This result is consistent with the results of cross-cultural studies that have investigated adults’ aesthetic judgments regarding the orientation of drawings of familiar objects and found that individuals who used either left-to-right or right-to-left writing and reading systems report opposing aesthetic preferences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022022111435098">Chokron &amp; de Agostini, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022022111435098">De Agostini, Kazandjian, Cavézian, Lellouch, &amp; Chokron, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022022111435098">Nachshon, Argaman, &amp; Luria, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022022111435098">Palmer, Gardner, &amp; Wickens, 2008</xref>). More generally, cultural influences related to directional scanning habits have been noted in a variety of nonlinguistic tasks involving perceptual, motor, and memory processes (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022022111435098">Fagard &amp; Dahmen, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022022111435098">Nachshon, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022022111435098">Singh, Vaid, &amp; Sakhuja, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0022022111435098">Vaid &amp; Singh, 1989</xref>). This indicates that the directional bias revealed by drawings of side views of objects should not be thought of merely as an indicator of the hemispheric specialization of cerebral organization but is instead multidetermined, as argued by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022022111435098">Vaid (2011)</xref>. It would be important to confirm these results with lefthanders from the two cultures: Considering that Western lefthanders exhibit a weaker leftward bias than Western right-handers, we could expect less cultural differences between left-handers than between right-handers. Note that contrarily to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022022111435098">De Agostini et al. (2010)</xref> in a study of visual aesthetic preferences, we failed to report any significant gender differences in directional bias, which also contributes to reduce the importance of biological influences on directionality in drawing. However, the number of females and males per age and cultural group in our study was low. Further research is certainly needed to make this issue clearer.</p>
<p>If the directional trends in drawing are related to writing and reading habits, then they should increase with age, at least during the period when children receive in-depth formal instruction. This is exactly what our results revealed. The drawing behavior of the 6-year-old children did not differ as a function of culture, and unlike the older children and adults, these children did not exhibit any systematic directional bias. We observed a directional bias in the drawing of side views of familiar objects at between 6 and 8 years of age in both the French and Syrian children and for drawings produced both with the right and the left hand. When this bias became evident at 8 and at 10 years of age, it was dependent on culture. The French children displayed a clear-cut leftward bias and the Syrian children a strong rightward bias. This finding is consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022022111435098">Vaid’s (1995)</xref> finding that Hindi and Urdu children aged between 9 and 13 years oriented their drawings differently as a function of their cultural reading and writing habits. By contrast, we did not replicate the findings reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022022111435098">Jensen (1952)</xref>, who observed that children produced left-facing profiles regardless of culture, nor those reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022022111435098">de Agostini and Chokron (2002)</xref>, who found that Western children aged between 7 and 10 years drew faces looking to the right. Given that we tested our 6-year-old participants at the very beginning of their school careers, just before the commencement of broad-based instruction in reading and writing abilities, our results suggest that a certain amount of exposure to left-to-right or right-to-left scanning and writing activities seems to be necessary in order for a clear preferential directionality to emerge in the drawing of side views of objects. At the local level of stroke direction, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022022111435098">Lieblich et al. (1975)</xref>, for example, have revealed a massive decrease in left-to-right directionality in Arab children between kindergarten (between 68% and 75%) and first grade (between 30% and 39%). One object of further research might be to examine the period between 5 and 7 years of age in greater detail in order to assess the quantity of exposure to right-to-left directionality that is required in order to bring about a significant reversal in drawing directionality in Arab children.</p>
<p>Interestingly, our results suggest that when directional biases emerge in drawing during childhood, the hand used for drawing does not affect them. Similar findings are reported in Vaid and Chen (2009, as cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022022111435098">Vaid, 2011</xref>). This absence of a hand dominance effect in children of different cultures, even at 10 years of age, casts some doubt on the hypothesis that biomechanical constraints, related to the outward tensor and inward flexor movements, act as a major determinant of the directionality of objects drawn in side view. However, our results also showed that this biomechanical determinant did have an effect in our adult participants. Indeed, the analysis of manual congruency yielded results similar to those reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022022111435098">Braswell and Rosengren (2002)</xref> in a task involving the copying of geometrical shapes. In this study, adults were found to be much more susceptible to biomechanical influences than children. In around 40% of cases, the Syrian and French adults reversed the orientation of their drawings as a function of the hand used, whereas the Syrian and French children tended to keep the orientation of their drawings constant regardless of hand. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022022111435098">Braswell and Rosengren (2002)</xref> have suggested that cognitive determinants exert a stronger influence on drawing behavior than biomechanical ones during childhood and this assertion finds some support in the drawing literature (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0022022111435098">Vinter, 1999</xref>). To sketch the various familiar objects that they had to produce in our task, it is likely that the participants had recourse to graphic schemas associated with their internal mental representations of the objects as if these objects were physically located in front of them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0022022111435098">Van Sommers, 1984</xref>). These mental representations are often described as canonical representations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022022111435098">Freeman, 1980</xref>), since they contain the prototypical characteristics that make it possible to identify both the objects themselves and the spatial orientation of their features. Children would be less flexible than adults both in their use of these mental representations and in their graphic procedures—starting point, direction of movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022022111435098">Picard &amp; Vinter, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0022022111435098">Vinter &amp; Marot, 2007</xref>)—with the result that there is little scope for biomechanical influences on these procedures. The greater flexibility available to adults would allow them to take advantage of the motor facilitation associated with the execution of outward movements by each hand.</p>
<p>We also found that the impact of the hand used was greater in the French than in the Syrian adults and that the performances of the two groups were quite similar when they employed their left hands. Cultural differences in directionality between adults were found when the participants used the dominant right hand but not when they used their nondominant hand. The recent study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022022111435098">Taguchi (2010)</xref> comparing Japanese and German adults on circular drawing movements came to a similar conclusion. This result provides a clear illustration of how culture and biomechanical effects interact in adults. In effect, the way in which the Syrian participants drew with their right hand played a crucial role in revealing the cultural impact of reading and writing habits, while the way in which the French participants drew with their left hand clearly indicated the role of biomechanical influences. These two forces shape drawing behavior in adults and led the Syrian adults to produce right-facing drawings with their right hand and the French adults to produce right-facing drawings with their left hand.</p>
<p>Finally, both the Syrian and French participants exhibited a leftward bias when drawing the self-centered tools (the mug, the toothbrush) with their right hand and there was also no difference between the groups when drawing the object-centered tools (jug, hammer). These results provide evidence in support of the direct handedness effect mentioned by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022022111435098">Karev (1999)</xref>, at least as far as the self-centered objects are concerned. The effect also seemed to be clear-cut in the case of the jug drawing but not in the case of the hammer drawing in the Syrian group. Although the effect might be related to the frequency with which this tool is used, we possess no objective data that might provide support for this hypothesis. This effect was observed at all age levels in the two cultural groups. Interestingly, and in contrast to the performance reported in left-handed adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022022111435098">Karev, 1999</xref>; Martin &amp; Jones, 1999), our participants did not reverse the orientation of these objects when they employed their nondominant left hand. Instead, it was very noticeable that these were the objects most frequently depicted facing leftward by the participants in the Syrian group. The drawing handedness effect can be interpreted as indicating that the canonical representation of an object used by individuals when drawing includes sensorimotor properties that specify the orientation of the relevant features of an object in a way that facilitates the actions associated with it—for example, right-handers position the handle of a cup on the right because, for them, this configuration is easier to hold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022022111435098">Karev, 1999</xref>; Martin &amp; Jones, 1999; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0022022111435098">van Sommers, 1984</xref>)—making this effect a nice example of embodied cognition. This representation is presumably built progressively on the basis of the many occasions on which individuals have to hold this object. Right-handers will only rarely have held an object such as a cup with the left hand. Our results suggest that it is unlikely that there is any immediate online updating of this sensorimotor canonical representation. Further experiments involving left-handers from the two cultures asked to draw object-centered and self-centered tools with their left and right hands might make it possible to provide evidence in support of this view.</p>
<p>With regard to the other types of objects, we partially replicated the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0022022111435098">Viggiano and Vannucci (2002)</xref> results: The dog (animal) was frequently drawn facing leftward in the French group; the car and the airplane (vehicles) were more frequently oriented toward the right in the Syrian group. However, these categories of objects did not differ significantly from the other categories in our experiment. It is, nevertheless, worth pointing out that a number of significant methodological differences make it difficult to compare the present experiment with the Viggiano and Vannucci study. For example, there is an enormous difference in the number of drawings produced by the participants in the two studies (the participants had to produce 246 drawings in two sessions in the Viggiano and Vannucci study, 20 in one session in ours).</p>
<p>In conclusion, the present study revealed that directionality in drawing is a complex function of culture, drawing hand, age, type of object depicted, and as indicated by other studies, laterality. Further research is still needed to get a full understanding of the intricate effects of all these factors. In particular, the role played by the type of object depicted as a function of laterality, hand used, and culture appears to be important to test. In virtue of the direct handedness effect, objects with a handle should be drawn with the handle located at left by left-handers employing their dominant hand, regardless of culture. Because lefthanders were reported to present a stronger leftward facing bias when they used their right hand than their left hand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022022111435098">Vaid, 2011</xref>), they may reverse the orientation of the objects, whatever their category, more systematically than right-handers when they move from one hand to the other in the drawing task. A careful analysis of the graphic syntax employed by participants (by older children and adults in particular) when they depict each object would also be useful to carry out, to get more insight into the variability that affects the production of the drawing of side view objects across the type of objects drawn. The precise geometry of the object may indeed also affect its privileged orientation in drawing. Finally, because they are currently scarce and contradictory, further studies investigating whether directionality in drawing is affected by gender would also be important to carry out for a better view of the complex interactions between biological and cultural determinants on this behavior.</p>
