<abstract>
<p>The aim of this article is to show how a suspect’s statement travels through two stages of the criminal law process: the police interrogation and the trial, exhibited by two modes of production: talk and writing. I first discuss how the suspect’s statement is elicited and written down by the police in the police report; next I consider how the police report is made to form part of a legally adequate case-file; and finally I investigate the ways in which the judge quotes and refers to the police report in his questioning of the suspect during the trial. This step-by-step inspection of the trajectory of the suspect’s statement shows processes of de- and recontextualization. The suspect’s statement is written down so as to enable it to be taken out of one context (the police interrogation) and inserted into another (the trial). This means that old meanings are removed from the suspect’s statement and new meanings are added. In the courtroom, however, the judge treats the suspect’s written statement as his own individual production, irrespective of the interactional environment in which it was elicited. The suspect’s statement is taken out of one context, inserted into another context and treated as independent of context.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>What distinguishes the inquisitorial Dutch court proceedings from those in adversarial criminal law systems is the active role of Dutch judges, and their reliance on the case file (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1461445612457486">Komter and Malsch, 2012</xref>). An important component of Dutch trials is the judge’s questioning of the suspect. During these examinations judges summarize or read from documents that have been drawn up by criminal law functionaries in earlier stages of the criminal law process. They often read to the suspects fragments of their own statements to the police (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1461445612457486">Komter, 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1461445612457486">2002</xref>). The following text from a police report is what the judge actually read to the suspect in a robbery trial: ‘You ask me if it is right that I had my hand in his coat pocket and took 5 Euros. Yes that is right.’ In this article, I shall investigate the history of this quote. I shall show what was actually said in the police interrogation, how it was written down in the police report, and how this report is quoted by the judge in his questioning of the suspect.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1461445612457486">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>It has been observed that the construction of a written record from spoken interaction inevitably involves selection, deletion and transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1461445612457486">Garfinkel, 1967</xref>). Comparisons between the talk in police interrogations and the written text of the police reports show a number of substantive and stylistic differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1461445612457486">Coulthard, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1461445612457486">Eades, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1461445612457486">Jönsson and Linell, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1461445612457486">Komter, 2002/2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1461445612457486">Rock, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1461445612457486">Shuy, 1998</xref>). These differences have been found to be related, among other things, to differences between spoken and written language, between dialogue and monologue, and to institutional routines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1461445612457486">Jönsson and Linell, 1991</xref>). The written report is not just a reflection of the talk that it allegedly represents, but also a document that anticipates the uses to which it will be put in the future (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1461445612457486">Garfinkel, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1461445612457486">Hall et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1461445612457486">Jönsson and Linell, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1461445612457486">Komter, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1461445612457486">Ravotas and Berkenkotter, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>Differences between the talk in the police interrogation and the text of the police report will be examined here in order to discover processes of <italic>entextualization. Entextualization</italic> refers to ‘the process of rendering discourse extractable, of making a stretch of linguistic production into a unit – <italic>a text</italic> – that can be lifted out of its interactional setting’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1461445612457486">Bauman and Briggs, 1990</xref>: 73). This <italic>entextualization</italic> involves <italic>decontextualization</italic> and <italic>recontextualization. Decontextualization</italic> refers to the extraction of a text from its original context of production; <italic>recontextualization</italic> to its subsequent insertion into a new surround through quotation, paraphrase, etc. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1461445612457486">Bauman and Briggs, 1990</xref>). This ‘lifting out of its setting’ of a text involves changes in the interpretation of the text (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1461445612457486">Linell, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>In order to study processes of de- and recontextualization, we need to ask what aspects of context play a role in these processes. Roughly speaking, there are two main ways in which <italic>context</italic> can be perceived (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1461445612457486">Goodwin and Duranti, 1992</xref>). In the first place <italic>context</italic> can be seen as part of larger social structures. For example, the ways in which statements are written down by the police and quoted by the judge can be understood in the light of institutional requirements and workings of the criminal law process. Second, <italic>context</italic> can be seen as part of the activities and orientations of the participants themselves. That is, context is created in and through talk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1461445612457486">Bauman and Briggs, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1461445612457486">Heritage, 1984a</xref>). The participants themselves exhibit in their talk what aspects of context are relevant and, in so doing, create the contexts for the production and interpretation of further talk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1461445612457486">Schegloff, 1991</xref>). For example, a question creates a context for what happens next, and an answer is understood by reference to the preceding question.</p>
<p>This dual view of context is related to the ways in which de- and recontextualizations can be studied. A global way of understanding the operation of entextualization is to say that the transformation of the fluidity of the talk in the police interrogation into the fixed materiality of the police report enables it to be lifted out of the context of the police interrogation; the judge’s quoting or summarizing the written statement in the courtroom incorporates it in the context of the trial. Thus, the suspect’s statement is decontextualized from the context of its production in the police interrogating room, and recontextualized in the context of the trial.</p>
<p>However, if we look more closely at conversational details of the police interrogation and the trial we can discover more subtle ways of de- and recontextualizations, depending on the sequential organization of the talk. If we consider the example from the robbery case presented above, we can conclude that the suspect’s statement is written down as a first person monologue. This means that the original interaction in the interrogation is removed from the written text. At the same time, a question of the interrogator appears to be restored in the written text (‘You ask me if it is right that I had my hand in his coat pocket and took 5 Euros.’). It is unlikely that a suspect would talk to the police like this.</p>
<p>In this article I follow the ‘career’ of the suspect’s statement from its construction by the police to its use by the judge, by taking into account the dynamics of de- and recontextualizations. The case to be discussed concerns a robbery. According to the alleged victim – an adolescent boy – he had just been shopping. When he came out of the supermarket a group of six or seven boys closed in on him, and one of them took 5 Euros and keys from his pocket. The next day the alleged victim’s father went to this boy’s house and got the money back. The alleged victim reported it to the police and identified two of the boys. The 16-year-old suspect was picked up together with a friend.</p>
<p>I shall first describe how the suspect’s statement is elicited and written down in the police interrogating room; next I consider its contextual framing in the police report; finally I discuss how the judge quotes or refers to fragments of the suspect’s statement as written down in the police report.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1461445612457486">
<title>The police interrogation</title>
<p>The legal rules for conducting a police interrogation in the Netherlands are that the police must inform the suspect of his right to silence at the beginning of the interrogation, that they must record this in the police report and that the suspect’s statement must be written down ‘as much as possible in the suspect’s own words’ (Code of Criminal Procedure, section 29). At first sight, this looks like an instruction to record verbatim what the suspect has said. In practice, it appears that judges are satisfied with a police report that contains a factual representation of what the suspect told the police. In this section I shall first investigate similarities and differences between the interrogation and the police report. Then I shall examine these differences and similarities in terms of de- and recontextualizations of the suspect’s statement.</p>
<sec id="section3-1461445612457486">
<title>The talk and the text</title>
<p>The interrogation is conducted by two police officers; one of them, a man, asks the questions, the other one, a woman, types up the police report as they go along. The interrogating police officer starts the interrogation by telling the suspect that a boy called Dan Hertog,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1461445612457486">2</xref></sup> has pressed charges against him. He asks the suspect if he wants to make a statement about it, which the suspect refuses. On further questioning the suspect refuses to mention the names of the other boys in the group. The police officer then summarizes the events in the report of the complaint and asks the suspect if these are correct. The suspect confirms this.</p>
<p>The following fragment shows the continuation of the interrogation (the left-hand column contains the talk; the right-hand column shows the text that is written down simultaneously in the police report<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1461445612457486">3</xref></sup>):</p>
<graphic id="img1-1461445612457486" position="anchor" xlink:href="10.1177_1461445612457486-img1.tif"/>
<p>The fact that the interrogating police officer (P) already appears to know what happened makes his line of questioning recognizable as ‘verifying’. He inquires after the details of the accusations as written down in the report of the complaint. He asks a number of yes/no questions starting with ‘did you . . .’ (lines 1, 7, 10, 14 and 17). As these yes/no questions formulate the terms of the required answer, they restrict the suspect’s scope for saying things in his own terms (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1461445612457486">Edwards, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1461445612457486">Raymond, 2006</xref>). The suspect avoids a direct answer to the first question (lines 4–5), denies the accusation about the keys (line 16), but confesses to the theft of 5 Euros (line 19). In the meantime, the other police officer is typing up the talk. She interrupts the typing because she has not heard the suspect’s answer to the second question (line 11). After this problem is solved she resumes her typing.</p>
<p>A conspicuous difference between the talk and the text is a difference in style. The first person monologue style is a common way of reporting police interrogations in the Netherlands. A result of this style is that the interrogator’s questions and other activities become invisible. To remedy this, police interrogators sometimes reintroduce their actions into the report as ‘recontextualization phrases’ (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1461445612457486">Komter, forthcoming</xref>). These are descriptions of the interrogator’s speech actions (mostly ‘telling’ and ‘asking’) that appear to be produced by the suspect (‘you tell me . . .’, ‘you ask me . . .’).</p>
<p>If we compare the substance of the talk in the interrogation with the text in the police report, a notable difference is that the suspect’s non-committal answer to the first question is taken as a confirmation in the written report (‘we stood in front of the supermarket’ becomes ‘yes that is right’, lines 4–5). This could be explained by the constraints of the creation of a coherent text. Once the reporting officer has written down the sentence ‘you ask me if we closed the boy in’, this sentence acquires its own momentum that affects the writing of what comes next. For the rest there is a lot of similarity between the substance of the information in the talk and that in the writing. But when we consider who produces the talk, it is notable that the writing resembles the talk of the police interrogator rather than that of the suspect. The interrogating police officer has said:
<disp-quote>
<p><italic>Did you close that boy <underline>in</underline> with all of you, or stood a<underline>round</underline> him</italic>,</p>
<p>In front of the supermarket.</p>
<p>Did you have your hand in his coat pocket,</p>
<p>Yes. Did you take five-</p>
<p>Yes coat pocket</p>
<p>Did you take 5 Euros and keys from it?</p>
<p>No key- but did you take 5 <underline>Eu</underline>ros from his pocket,</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The police report says:
<disp-quote>
<p>You ask me if we closed that boy in. Yes that’s right. You ask me if it is rigt that I had my hand in his coat pocket and took 5 Euros. Yes that is right. I saw no keys. I took 5 Euros.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>However, the suspect’s utterances in this episode of the interrogation are:
<disp-quote>
<p>We stood in front of the supermarket. Yes. Yes. Saw no keys. Yes.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The only contribution of the suspect that survived the recording process is ‘saw no keys’. The rest of the text is provided by the interrogating officer (most of the nouns and verbs are his) and the reporting officer (stylistic particulars such as: ‘you ask me . . . yes that’s right’ are hers). These differences are related to the transformation of the talk into the writing: the dialogue becomes a first person monologue that seems to be produced by the suspect. As the interaction is written down as a first-person monologue the suspect appears to use the words contained in the questions.</p>
<p>The first-person monologue style suggests that the suspect’s statement is volunteered; the ‘recontextualization phrases’ make the suspect’s utterances recognizable as answers, instead of as volunteered statements. In this episode we see two ‘recontextualization phrases’ in the police report (lines 1 and 8–9), but the interrogator asks four questions (lines 1–2; 7–8; 14–15; 17–18). Two questions (lines 7–8 and 14–15) are reformulated as one. The question about the keys is not written down. As a result, the suspect’s utterance ‘saw no keys’ (line 16) appears to be volunteered in the written report, whereas in the interrogation it was an answer to a question. S’s confession to taking the five Euros is reported twice: the first time as an answer to the ‘recontextualized’ question (‘yes that is right’, line 17), the second time as a volunteered statement (line 19). Thus, a consequence of the first-person monologue style of the police report is that it becomes difficult or impossible to establish who said what in the interrogation; a consequence of the introduction of ‘recontextualization phrases’ is that, while a certain transparency is created about the question–answer format of the interrogation, this transparency is selective and sometimes inaccurate.</p>
<p>After having established what items of the accusation the suspect is prepared to admit to, the police officer inquires after his motives:</p>
<graphic id="img2-1461445612457486" position="anchor" xlink:href="10.1177_1461445612457486-img2.tif"/>
<p>When the suspect asserts that he cannot give the explanation P asks for, the police officer repeats this assertion (line 3); after this he proceeds with a question about the events with the alleged victim’s father, who retrieved the money from the suspect. Then P returns to the topic of the suspect’s motives:</p>
<graphic id="img3-1461445612457486" position="anchor" xlink:href="10.1177_1461445612457486-img3.tif"/>
<p>This time P is less accepting of the suspect’s inability or unwillingness to disclose his motives. He offers a candidate answer (line 5), which is rejected by the suspect, who chooses to bring up the outcome of the events (he got it back) rather than his motives. After a six second pause P makes another suggestion for a possible motive (lines 11–12), which once more gets a non-committal answer.</p>
<p>In contrast with the series of yes/no questions asked before (excerpt 1), in these episodes two why-questions are asked. The distribution of knowledge is different: this time P does not know the answers, as the suspect is supposed to have privileged access to what has motivated him. However, when the suspect claims he cannot answer the question about his motives, P takes recourse to another source of knowledge. His candidate answers are based on his common-sense knowledge about how adolescents normally behave (lines 5 and 11).</p>
<p>After this episode the other police officer, who has been typing up the police report, suggests to the suspect that the boy would not have got his money back if his father had not retrieved it. S replies that he had intended from the start to give the money back. This is then taken up by P who proceeds:</p>
<graphic id="img4-1461445612457486" position="anchor" xlink:href="10.1177_1461445612457486-img4.tif"/>
<p>The ‘oh’-prefaced utterance of P (line 1) conveys the fact that the suspect’s prior utterance is news for him and that his state of knowledge has changed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1461445612457486">Heritage, 1984b</xref>). The suspect confirms P’s proposal and, after a long pause, P rounds off with a conclusion (line 8), showing that he now has enough information to draw inferences from the details of the situation. This conclusion could be taken as an observation, or as an assessment of the suspect’s actions. The suspect’s first response ‘yes’ appears to agree with P’s conclusion, but he follows this with a more harmless alternative (‘fooling around’), downplaying the potentially negative connotations of ‘pestering’ (lines 8–9). This enables him to agree with P, while at the same time mitigating his actions.</p>
<p>Also in this exchange about the suspect’s motives there is a lot of similarity between the information in the interrogation and what gets written down in the report. As we have seen, the episode has yielded the following text in the report:
<disp-quote>
<p>You ask me why I did it.</p>
<p>I cannot say. I don’t understand why someone files a complaint when you already got your 5 Euros back. It was foolishness. We were going to give it back.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>What the suspect has said in the course of the exchange is:
<disp-quote>
<p>No I cannot explain.</p>
<p>What.</p>
<p>I don’t know what I ( )</p>
<p>No but uh he did get those 5 Euros back he-</p>
<p>I don’t know why he files a complaint when you’ve got it back.</p>
<p>(°I don’t know°)</p>
<p>We would give it back.</p>
<p>Yes we were going to give it back anyway.</p>
<p>Yes it was just fooling around.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This time the suspect’s contributions show up more prominently in the written report. Every item in the report (except the first) can be traced back to an utterance of the suspect. A notable difference is the changing of the suspect’s description ‘fooling around’ (line 9) into ‘foolishness’.</p>
<p>What the report does not show, however, is the interactional embeddings of these utterances. The question about the suspect’s motives is asked twice, but reported once. The suspect’s expression of incomprehension of the victim’s filing a complaint appears in the police report as an addition to his negative answer about his motives, but he utters it in support of his mitigation of P’s remark that he took the 5 Euros (example 3, lines 3–8). The report does not show that P offers three candidate answers to the question of ‘why you did it’ (example 3, line 5: ‘showing off?’; line 11: ‘would that boy have been scared of you’; example 4, line 8: ‘so this actually has been a pestering’). Nor does the report show that the first two of these suggestions are rejected by the suspect, and that the third is downgraded (‘pestering’ becomes ‘fooling around’).</p>
<p>A result of these differences between the talk and the text is that the actions performed by the talk are no longer recognizable. The report suggests that the police officer asked a question about the suspect’s motives and that the suspect answered this question. The report does not give insight into the work the police officer did to elicit the answer, nor into the accusatory implications of the policeman’s questions (e.g. the idea that the suspect is invited to explain a theft, whereas the suspect does not consider it a theft), nor into the defensive elements of the suspect’s responses (e.g. his downgrading of the harmful implications of ‘pestering’ into ‘fooling around’).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1461445612457486">
<title>De- and recontextualizations of the suspect’s statement to the police</title>
<p>The most notable de- and recontextualizations of the suspect’s statement are related to the distribution of speakership or authorship exhibited by the adoption of the first-person monologue style, and to the reinsertion of some of the police interrogator’s questions within this style. The interaction in the police interrogation is decontextualized by filtering out most of the interrogator’s questions in the police report. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1461445612457486">Jönsson and Linell (1991)</xref> have called this a ‘blurring of source distinctions’.</p>
<p>As a result, the actions of the police officer become invisible, and the suspect’s contributions are no longer recognizable as answers or as the actions performed by the answers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1461445612457486">Komter, 2002/2003</xref>). The insertion of ‘recontextualization phrases’ may appear to address this problem but, because they are used selectively, they only offer the appearance of transparency. In the police report the suspect appears to be producing his own text, but a comparison with the actual talk in the interrogation shows that he is using a combination of his own, the interrogator’s and the reporting officer’s words. In short, the suspect’s statement is decontextualized from its interactional environment, and recontextualized as a series of actions different from the ones that were originally produced.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1461445612457486">
<title>The police report</title>
<p>There are not many legal requirements for the format, style and substance of police reports. Police officers should include the fact that they have told the suspect that he has the right to silence and, as mentioned earlier, that they write down the suspect’s statement as much as possible in his ‘own words’. How police reports look and what information they contain appear to result largely from bureaucratic and practical considerations (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1461445612457486">Garfinkel, 1967</xref>).</p>
<p>In the previous sections we have seen how part of the suspect’s statement was elicited and written up in the police report:</p>
<p>(5)</p>
<p><bold>You ask me if it is right that we closed the boy in.</bold></p>
<p><bold>Yes that is right.</bold></p>
<p><bold>You ask me of it is rigt that I went with my hand into his pocket and took 5 Euros.</bold></p>
<p><bold>Yes that is right. I saw no keys. I took 5 Euros.</bold></p>
<p><bold>You ask me why I did it.</bold></p>
<p><bold>I cannot say. I don’t understand why someone files a complaint when you already got your 5 Euros back. It was foolishness. We were going to give it back.</bold></p>
<p>For a reader who has no knowledge of how this text has come about, it looks as if three questions have been asked. The suspect appears to confess to the first two questions about the facts; he appears to downplay the seriousness of his acts implied in the last question about his motives.</p>
<p>In this section I shall describe how the suspect’s statement is incorporated in the record and how it is framed within the context of the writing. I first point out how legal and bureaucratic requirements provide the resources for turning the suspect’s statement into an authoritative document and a valid piece of evidence. Next I discuss the more immediate contextual framing of the suspect’s statement within the speech of the police interrogators and of the suspect himself. And finally, I consider the de- and recontextualizations involved with the creation of a self-contained document that can function on its own, independently of the setting in which it was produced.</p>

<title>Legal and bureaucratic requirements: Form filling</title>
<p>Many of the items in the police report are pre-programmed. The reporting officer has a form-filling screen in front of her; the items automatically appear on the screen when the officer fills in the required information in the slots (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1461445612457486">Van Charldorp, 2012</xref>). The police report under consideration here is two pages long. It begins with a heading that is standard for police reports, indicating that it is a police report of a suspect interrogation, and identifying the police district, the police report number, the names of the reporting officers and of their area teams. This is succeeded by the following text:
<disp-quote>
<p>(6)</p>
<p>On Wednesday the 4<sup>th</sup> of March 2008, around 12.00 o’clock, we, reporting officers in the police station Xxxx in Xxxx, heard a man as suspect of violation of section 312/2/2 Criminal Code in conjunction with section 310 Criminal Code.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1461445612457486">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>The suspect claimed to be: . . .</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In this text the reporting officers start their account of the interrogation. It is a first-person narrative that shows some of their professional requirements, indicating the date, time and location of the interrogation, and the relevant sections of the Criminal Code.</p>
<p>The report continues with an enumeration of the personal details of the suspect (name, date and place of birth, address, etc.). The next item is:
<disp-quote>
<p>(7)</p>
<p>After we informed the suspect that he was not obliged to answer and about what we wished to hear him he stated: “</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>As mentioned before, a legal requirement for the police report is that the police officer writes down that the suspect has been informed of his right to silence. This is the last obligatory item of the form-filling procedure before the introduction of the substance of the suspect’s statement. The colon and the opening of the quotation marks anticipate a change of speakership. This is the slot for the substance of the suspect’s statement.</p>
<p>When the interrogation is completed, the police officer prints the report and invites the suspect to read it. This is exhibited in the following text in the police report:
<disp-quote>
<p>(8)</p>
<p>After the suspect had read through his statement, he persisted in it and signed it.</p>
<attrib>Xxxx</attrib>
<attrib>(suspect)</attrib>
</disp-quote>
<disp-quote>
<p>This report has been drawn up by us under oath of office and pledge of office respectively, completed and signed on the 4<sup>th</sup> of March in Amsterdam 2008.</p>
<p>The reporting officers,</p>
<p>Xxxx (oath of office)</p>
<p>Xxxx (pledge of office)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1461445612457486">7</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This is the last entry in the report. The signatures of the participants and the police officers’ oath of office make this a valid piece of evidence. In combination with the entries at the beginning of the document (see excerpts 6 and 7), these texts frame the suspect’s statement as embedded in the appropriate legal and institutional procedures.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1461445612457486">
<title>The contextual framing of the suspect’s statement</title>
<p>The contextual framing of the suspect’s statement is further accomplished in the texts immediately surrounding it. The two sentences introducing the suspect’s statement concern the articulation of the right to silence and its acceptance; the two sentences following the suspect’s statement mark the completion of the statement:
<disp-quote>
<p>(9)</p>
<p>After we informed the suspect that he was not obliged to answer and about what we wished to hear him he stated: “</p>
<p>“I understand that you wish to hear me and that I am not obliged to answer.</p>
<p>....</p>
<p>....</p>
<p>....</p>
<p>I have nothing further to state.”</p>
<p>After the suspect had read through his statement, he persisted in it and signed it.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>From the start, the report is written from the perspective of the police officers, as evidenced by the first person monologue style (see excerpts 6 and 7). They are the ‘authors’ of the text (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1461445612457486">Goffman, 1981</xref>), who introduce the suspect’s contribution by using a quotative (‘he stated’), followed by a colon and opening quotation marks. In accordance with the conventions of writing, the colon and the quotation marks introduce a change in speakership and anticipate a text written as direct reported speech.</p>
<p>The first sentence of the suspect’s statement (‘I understand that you wish to hear me and that I am not obliged to answer’) is as formulaic as the sentence preceding it. It is the first sentence that the reporting officer writes down freely, that is, not in response to the requirements of the form-filling format of the police report. The direct reported speech makes the current words appear as exact replica of the words spoken in the original context of the police interrogation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1461445612457486">Matoesian, 1999</xref>). However, the formulaic and artificial style of the sentence makes it unlikely that a suspect would say something like that. In fact, an inspection of the materials reveals that such sentences occur in most police reports, and that most of these sentences are not, or only slightly, related to what was said in the interrogation. The inclusion of this first sentence in the police report serves to establish the suspect’s acceptance of the legal setting in which his statement is embedded, and to cast his statement as given voluntarily. The formulation of this as a direct quote makes the suspect accountable for this stance.</p>
<p>The last sentence of the suspect’s statement is also relatively standard. It is not part of the form-filling format of the police report, but in most of the reports the suspect’s statement is made to end in this fashion. ‘I have nothing further to state’ conveys that the suspect has been given the opportunity to add further information, and that he himself has decided that his statement is now complete. The quotation marks close, and then speakership or authorship is returned to the police officers.</p>
<p>The sentence following this (‘after the suspect had read through his statement, he persisted in it and signed it’) indicates that the suspect fully approves of this rendering of his speech in writing. The phrase ‘he persisted in it’ reveals two possible readings of the document: first, it casts the suspect’s statement as potentially contestable, and second, it makes the suspect accountable for this text. From this moment on, the suspect has become the ‘author’ of his statement to the police.</p>
<p>In sum, there are three kinds of framing of the suspect’s statement, made visible by the types of text surrounding it. First, the suspect’s statement is framed by the police officers’ form-filling activities that show an adherence to the proper legal and bureaucratic procedures. This makes the police report an example of ‘good work’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1461445612457486">Zimmerman, 1969</xref>) that contributes to its authoritative and official status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1461445612457486">Benson and Drew, 1978</xref>). Second, the suspect’s statement is framed by the police officers’ expressions that underline the voluntariness and completeness of the suspect’s statement. And finally, the suspect’s statement is framed by his own expressions of understanding and acceptance of authorship of what has been written down.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1461445612457486">
<title>De- and recontextualizations in the police report</title>
<p>Earlier, we saw the de- and recontextualizations involved in the transformation of the talk into writing. Here, de- and recontextualization refer to the preparation of the police report to operate independently of the circumstances of its construction. When all the bureaucratic and legal requirements have been met, the document has become an object that can be lifted out of its interactional setting to serve as information and as a piece of evidence in the further criminal law process. The police report has been decontextualized from the interrogation in that the life has been taken out of the interaction; it has become a fixed, inanimate object, a document that does not talk back.</p>
<p>The police report has been recontextualized as a document that can serve as a valid piece of evidence. The document has been drawn up to exhibit legal and bureaucratic adequacy, and to show the suspect’s acceptance of the conditions of the interrogation and his responsibility for the text of his statement. This involves a reorganization of speakership or authorship. The police officers present themselves as authors of the document in which the suspect’s statement is introduced as a ‘story-within-a-story’, surrounded by quotation marks. What could be called ‘the tyranny of the quotation marks’ determines that everything between the quotation marks has to (appear to) come from the suspect’s mouth. Thus, the suspect’s statement is written down as direct reported speech, or more accurately, as ‘direct reported speech-in-writing’.</p>

<sec id="section9-1461445612457486">
<title>The trial</title>
<p>By the time the case reaches the trial stage, the case file contains all the pieces of evidence that the public prosecutor deems necessary to bring the case to court.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1461445612457486">8</xref></sup> In this sense, the police report has undergone another kind of recontextualization. It is now part of the completed case file, which also contains the charges and the evidence for five other offences of robbery for which the suspect stands trial, together with his friend. This places the offence discussed here in a different light: a seemingly trivial offence, the temporarily taking away of 5 Euros from a boy’s pocket, can now be seen as part of the suspect’s history of robberies.</p>
<p>As mentioned before, an important part of Dutch trials is the examination of the suspect by the judge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1461445612457486">Komter, 1998</xref>). The case file is the basis for this examination. The law requires that judges must base their verdict on evidence (from the case file) that has been brought up in the trial. Thus, judges typically examine suspects by referring to the case file, by quoting or summarizing it, and by reading parts of what the police wrote down as the suspect’s statement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1461445612457486">Komter, 2002</xref>). In the following sections I shall show how the text of the case file is recontextualized and incorporated into the judge’s management of courtroom business.</p>
<sec id="section10-1461445612457486">
<title>Invoking the case file</title>
<p>The next example shows how the judge starts the examinations after the public prosecutor has read the indictment. According to the indictment the suspect is accused of theft or violent theft.</p>
<graphic id="img5-1461445612457486" position="anchor" xlink:href="10.1177_1461445612457486-img5.tif"/>
<p>Judges often begin the examinations by asking suspects what they think of the accusation, or whether they agree with it (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1461445612457486">Komter, 1998</xref>). Here the judge asks for the suspect’s perspective on or evaluation of the case, which the suspect provides. He reiterates what he also told the police: that they were just fooling around, that it was a joke and that the boy got his money back. This leads him to conclude that they had not stolen it (line 8). Both the sequential position and the substance of the suspect’s response show its defensiveness: it is uttered as response to the accusation, and it contains a mitigation and a denial (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1461445612457486">Atkinson and Drew, 1979</xref>).</p>
<p>The beginning of the judge’s response (line 10, ‘so you say’) seems to indicate that he is going to quote or summarize the suspect’s prior talk. However, the substance of his subsequent quote (‘it is right that I’ve done that’) is in contradiction with the suspect’s prior utterance (‘it is not so that we have stolen it’). The ambiguity is solved when the judge adds that the suspect also said that in the case file (line 11). This shows that he is now referring to prior talk that was said on a former occasion (in this case to the police), distinct from the ongoing interaction.</p>
<p>The judge’s response shows how important the case file is as his primary source of knowledge. His first question (line 1) appears to yield epistemic priority to the suspect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1461445612457486">Heritage and Raymond, 2005</xref>), who is given the opportunity to express his views on the case (lines 2–6). Yet this is overruled by the judge’s reliance on the information in the case file. He supports the authenticity of his quotation of the suspect’s confession (line 10) by indicating the page number of the case file (line 11). Thus, ‘on page 20 in the case file’ is presented as concrete proof that the suspect said he did it, irrespective of what the suspect just told him.</p>
<p>The judge’s way of questioning the suspect shows a distinctive difference with the suspect’s interrogation by the police: in the police interrogating room the issue is what the suspect <italic>did</italic>; in the courtroom this is also relevant, but an additional – and perhaps more important – focus is on what the suspect <italic>said he did</italic> to the police. The reported event is not any longer the offence, as it was in the police report, but the police report itself; the location of the reported event is no longer ‘in front of the supermarket’, but ‘on page 20 in the case file’.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, the police report (see excerpt 5) suggests that the suspect confessed to the theft but downplayed its seriousness. This shapes the way the judge now listens to the suspect. He monitors the suspect’s talk (lines 3–8) as verification and corroboration of the information in the case file. The judge confirms the correspondence of the information in the case file with what the suspect just said, in slightly different wording: ‘it is not so that we have stolen it’ (line 8) becomes ‘it was not a robbery’ (line 13) and ‘fooling around’ (line 6) becomes ‘foolishness’ (line 13, the term used in the case file). He also confirms ‘he got it back’ as something that he has read (line 15), rather than as something the suspect has just said (line 5). The judge concludes by describing the victim’s view on the interpretation of the incident as ‘not . . . foolishness’.</p>
<p>His use of the modal adverb ‘apparently’ suggests that this conclusion is not based on his direct knowledge of the state of mind of the complainant, but on common-sense inferences he draws from the particulars of the situation. The idea is that people do not go to the police to report an act of ‘foolishness’. After the judge has drawn this conclusion he leaves a five-second pause. When the suspect does not respond, the judge utters a prompt (line 19) after which the suspect utters an agreement token (‘Yes’, line 20). However, the suspect adds ‘you could see it like that’ to his agreement. This signifies in the first place that the suspect too has drawn his inferences on the basis of common knowledge about why people complain to the police. Yet he shows his epistemic independence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1461445612457486">Heritage and Raymond, 2005</xref>) in that he uses a different uncertainty marker (‘you could see it like that’) from the judge’s ‘apparently’. Moreover, because this uncertainty marker is used in second position, it also reflects back on the position taken by the judge. The judge’s conclusion can then be viewed as just one way of looking at it. In this sense, ‘You could see it like that’ can be taken both as a confirmation and as a challenge of the judge’s conclusion. It allows the suspect to agree with the judge without contradicting his own prior position that the complainant knew it was a joke (line 5).</p>
<p>In this fragment the judge quotes the suspect three times (lines 10, 11 and 13). The quotes are all introduced by a quotative, or ‘verbum dicendi’ (line 10: ‘you say’, line 11: ‘you also say’ and line 12: ‘only you said like’), but their form and content differ. The first quote (‘it is right that I’ve done that’) is formulated as direct reported speech, as is indicated by the judge’s use of the personal pronoun. The assumption behind direct reported speech is that it is an accurate representation of the original utterance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1461445612457486">Clift and Holt, 2007</xref>). However, the style of the reported speech (‘it is right that I’ve done that’, line 10) resembles the particular style of the case file. Thus, although it must seem unlikely that the suspect has actually expressed himself in these terms to the police, the judge treats him as if he has.</p>
<p>This quote does not stand on its own. It is followed by another quote, in indirect reported speech (‘that you did it’, line 11), supplemented with the identification of the location of the source of the information (line 11: ‘page 20 in the case file’). So, whatever the (lack of) authenticity of the first quote (line 10), its claim that the suspect has confessed is substantiated by concrete proof of what the suspect has said according to the case file. The third quote (line 13) is a specification and mitigation of the preceding quotes. It is again in the direct reported speech style, but this time the judge shows a more obvious shift in ‘footing’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1461445612457486">Goffman, 1981</xref>). Prosodic features of the judge’s talk, such as the prolongation of the vowel in ‘Yea::h’ followed by a slightly rising intonation, and the emphasis in ‘<underline>rob</underline>bery’ and ‘<underline>fool</underline>ishness’, show he is exhibiting his relationship to the text he utters: he is ‘enacting’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1461445612457486">Holt, 2007</xref>) or ‘animating the voice’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1461445612457486">Galatolo, 2007</xref>) of the suspect. In doing this, he not only voices the suspect’s presumed words, but he also replays the suspect’s position towards the accusation and depicts the suspect as committed to mitigating the charge of robbery.</p>
<p>If we consider the global direction of the interaction in this fragment we see that, as a reaction to the accusation as formulated in the indictment, the suspect defends himself by downplaying and denying the charges. This is then countered by the judge, first by quoting the suspect as someone who said that he did it, then by drawing logical conclusions from the fact that the victim filed a complaint. Thus, the judge’s references to the case file acquire added meaning and significance from their sequential position: after the suspect’s defensive actions the judge’s quotations counteract the suspect’s mitigation and denial. At the same time, the judge retains his appearance of objectivity by his references to the case file: by repeating the words or actions of the suspect, and by explicitly mentioning the official source of his information, he avoids taking a position himself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1461445612457486">Holt, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1461445612457486">Matoesian, 2000</xref>). This is underlined by the five-second pause following his conclusion (line 18). He refers to the victim’s evaluation of the events rather than to his own, and he invites the suspect to draw his own conclusions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1461445612457486">
<title>Setting up an argument</title>
<p>A few moments later the judge initiates the following line of reasoning:</p>
<graphic id="img6-1461445612457486" position="anchor" xlink:href="10.1177_1461445612457486-img6.tif"/>
<p>The judge starts to generalize the actions of the suspect as something that everyone might do, but he does not finish his line of reasoning. He checks himself mid-sentence by stating ‘for that’s what you say you did’ (line 3). This establishes the connection between ‘everyone’ (line 2) and the suspect, and marks the relevance of what is to come. But when he continues with his line of argumentation, he checks himself again and starts reading from the case file. He introduces this with: ‘for you also say uh’ (line 5). These references (lines 3 and 5) provide the judge with accountability for what he is about to quote, and they prospectively justify the judge’s position of taking as a fact that the suspect felt in someone’s pocket. It does not just show the importance of the case file for the judge’s management of courtroom business, but it also reveals one of the effects of the ways in which the suspect’s statement was recorded by the police: the suspect is treated as ‘author’ of his statement.</p>
<p>This quotation is different from the ones we have seen earlier. The judge is reading the literal text of the police report, a text that clearly does not represent the actual words spoken by the suspect to the police. However, the artificiality of the text that he reads underlines the judge’s neutrality: he is not paraphrasing it from his own perspective, but he is reading the literal text from the case file. He acts as a mere ‘animator’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1461445612457486">Goffman, 1981</xref>) who treats the text as authored by the suspect, in spite of the obvious stylistic differences between the police report and ordinary talk.</p>
<p>It has been observed that direct reported speech lends the quotation an air of objectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1461445612457486">Galatolo, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1461445612457486">Holt, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1461445612457486">Matoesian, 2000</xref>). This seems to be all the more so in cases where the judge quotes the suspect by reading aloud the literal text of the police report. The materials presented above show that what the judge reads is identical with the police report, but not identical with what the suspect actually said to the police.</p>
<p>After the interaction represented in example 12 there is a short discussion about the keys, after which the judge resumes his original project:</p>
<graphic id="img7-1461445612457486" position="anchor" xlink:href="10.1177_1461445612457486-img7.tif"/>
<p>The judge develops the line of argument he started before, but this time it is supported by his prior quote of ‘the suspect’s own words’ as recorded in the police report (see excerpt 11). He summarizes what he has just been reading, and presents it as part of an incipient argument. His emphasis on ‘<underline>that</underline>’ (line 2) seems to indicate the seriousness of the events, and the enumeration of the different actions involved in <underline>that</underline> (lines 3–7) underlines this. Lines 8 and 9 retrospectively reveal the grounds for this enumeration: to set up a contrast with what this person (referred to as ‘everyone’, ‘you’ and ‘he’) has done and how he later belittles it to the court. This contrast between <italic>doing</italic> and <italic>saying</italic> is outlined in the beginning of the argument (lines 1 and 2) and actualized in its sequel. The contrast between the proposed severity of the <italic>doing</italic> and the belittlement of it in the <italic>saying</italic> culminates in lines 8 and 9. The judge’s lexical choice in line 8 (‘he starts telling the court here’) and the prosodic features of the quote in line 9 (especially the drawn-out ‘we::ll’), emphasize this contrast.</p>
<p>The presentation of the argument as a generalized hypothetical situation, without specifying a particular actor, invites the suspect to take the perspective of an outsider, and to observe the actions of ‘people-who-do-bad-things-and-then-belittle-them-to-the-court’. Moreover, as the judge does not spell out the contrast between the <italic>doing</italic> and the <italic>saying</italic>, he invites the suspect to draw his own conclusions. He underlines this first by leaving a three-second pause, and then by asking whether the suspect understands what he means (lines 10–11). The judge concludes by pointing out once more that the victim did not think it was a joke. Now the judge shows a certainty about the alleged victim’s position (line 14) that he did not show before. Whereas he previously inferred the boy’s position from his filing a complaint (see extract 10, lines 16–17), he now claims epistemic priority about the boy’s experiences of the case (‘apparently’ has become ‘in any case’). This enables him to overrule the suspect’s evaluation of it as a joke. So, by his quoting from the case file by his generalizing, and by his presenting the point of view of the alleged victim, the judge suggests what ought to be the point of view in this case while avoiding taking a position himself.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1461445612457486">
<title>Recontextualizations of the suspect’s statement in the courtroom</title>
<p>As mentioned earlier, utterances that are entextualized as written documents can be inserted into a new setting and recontextualized by way of quoting, paraphrasing, etc. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1461445612457486">Bauman and Briggs, 1990</xref>). These quoting activities are embedded in contextual framings that specify how the listener should interpret them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1461445612457486">Blommaert, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1461445612457486">Buttny, 1998</xref>). A notable feature of the judge’s quoting practices is his use of quotatives (e.g. ‘you say’) and his explicit mentioning of his source of information (‘page 20 in the case file’). These frame the quotations as making it quite clear that the judge is merely repeating ‘the suspect’s own words’ instead of taking a position himself. Thus, a basic element of these framing activities is that they serve to highlight the judge’s neutrality.</p>
<p>I have shown several ways in which the judge refers to the police report: he mentions it as source of information (‘page 20’), he summarizes it (e.g. ‘you meet someone, you close someone in . . .’), he enacts it (e.g. ‘we::ll, it was foolishness that was a joke’), and he reads from it (e.g. ‘you ask me if we closed the boy in’). The judge does different things with these quotations. In <italic>summarizing</italic>, the judge transforms the text of the suspect’s statement into a component of an ongoing argument. In <italic>enacting</italic> the suspect’s statement, the judge inserts a certain evaluation that makes him look indifferent or irresponsible. With the <italic>‘reading quote’</italic>, the judge takes an officially neutral point of view, as someone who is just passing on what is in the case file (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1461445612457486">Galatolo, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>In order to establish what actions are being accomplished by the judge’s quoting practices, we need to consider them in their sequential environment. As the first substantive action in the trial is the public prosecutor’s presentation of the charges, the subsequent interaction between the judge and the suspect is framed within a context of accusations and defences. In our case the contested issue is the question of whether the suspect’s actions are to be described as a robbery or as ‘foolishness’. The sequential placement of the judge’s initial quoting activities (excerpt 10, lines 10–13) makes them recognizable as contradicting the suspect’s denial and mitigation of the charges. The judge’s subsequent quotations are positioned as introduction to, and in support of, a line of argumentation that serves to make the suspect recognize the seriousness of his actions and accept his responsibility for them. The judge uses the suspect’s ‘own words’ to highlight the contrast between what the suspect said he did and how he evaluated what he did, and thus to invite him to draw his own conclusions. In sum, recontextualizations of the suspect’s statement by the judge in the courtroom enable the judge to contradict and evaluate the suspect’s position, while avoiding taking a position himself.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The entextualization of a suspect’s statement is more than just writing down what was said so that the resulting document can be lifted out of its setting. Entextualization includes organizing the interrogation in such a way that it produces an appropriate police report. De- and recontextualizations of the suspect’s statement involve more than just lifting it from one context and inserting it into another one. In each phase of processes of de- and recontextualization new meanings are added to the suspect’s statement and old meanings removed.</p>
<p>First, the talk in the police interrogation is transformed into the writing of the police report. The decontextualization of the talk removes the interaction in the police interrogation; the recontextualization of the talk presents it as a first-person monologue. As a result, the suspect’s utterances are no longer recognizable as the actions that were produced in, and that derived their meaning from, their sequential position in the interaction. At this stage two kinds of recontextualization have been distinguished: recontextualizations from the talk into the writing, and recontextualizations within the writing. The talk is recontextualized as the first-person monologue of the writing, and then it may also be ‘re-recontextualized’ by inserting ‘recontextualization phrases’ within the first-person monologue style. These ‘recontextualization phrases’ may shed some light on the original interaction, but they are used selectively and sometimes inaccurately.</p>
<p>Second, the writing in the police report is organized so as to make it into a legally adequate document. The suspect’s statement is recontextualized within the writing by the texts surrounding it. The texts immediately preceding and following the suspect’s statement in the police report show the suspect’s acceptance of the conditions of his questioning by the police, and his acceptance of ‘authorship’ of the text of his written statement. The suspect’s statement is further recontextualized by the police officers’ written expressions of bureaucratic, legal and procedural correctness. And finally, the text of the police report is assembled with the other texts of the case file under construction – other pieces of evidence that inform the professionals in the criminal law process on how to manage further proceedings.</p>
<p>Third, the judge brings to life the writing in the police report in his questioning of the suspect during the trial. As the judge’s references to and quotations from the case file are understood in relation to the charges that the suspect stands trial for, these charges continue to play a role during the exchanges between the judge and the suspect. The judge frames his references to the police report by way of ‘quotatives’ to highlight the suspect’s ‘authorship’ of the text in the police report. He further recontextualizes his quotes by their sequential position and design. For example, the introduction of a quote after a defensive utterance of the suspect may make it recognizable as a contradiction of the suspect’s prior talk; the design of the quote as an enactment of the suspect’s earlier talk may convey the judge’s implicit evaluation of the suspect’s position. As these actions are realized by quoting the suspect’s words, the judge can take a position and avoid doing so at the same time.</p>
<p>A result of the entextualization of the suspect’s statement in the police report is that systematic differences are created between the suspect’s original talk and the writing. Although the law requires that the suspect’s statement be written down in the police report as much as possible ‘in his own words’, the suspect’s statement consists of a mixture of his own words, those of the interrogating officer and those of the reporting officer, written in a more or less artificial style. In spite of this, the judge treats the suspect as ‘author’ of his statement during the trial.</p>
<p>In focusing our attention on processes of de- and recontextualization, the dynamic aspects of context have been highlighted. Context is not just something that is already there, something that is fixed and static. People shape and reshape the contexts they are involved in, and their activities are produced and interpreted by reference to these contexts. Both the talk and the written documents that are produced in the course of the police interrogation and that are brought to life again in the courtroom provide the context for the activities they generate, but they are also products of the settings within which they are constructed and replayed. It appears to be part of the professional conduct of criminal law professionals to disattend these dynamics: the suspect’s statement is taken out of one context, inserted into a different context and treated as independent of context. These actions are not conscious efforts to influence the course of justice, but inherent to processes of entextualization.</p>

<p>The article is based on the audio record of a police interrogation, on the police report of this interrogation and on the video record of the trial of this case. This makes it possible to follow the ‘career’ of a suspect’s utterance from the police interrogating room through to the courtroom. These materials belong to a corpus of 35 audio-taped police interrogations and the reports made of those interrogations, and of audio and video recordings of 36 trials.</p></fn>
