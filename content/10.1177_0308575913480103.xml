            <bold>Therapeutic Residential Care for Children and Young People: An Attachment and Trauma-informed Model for Practice</bold> by Susan Barton, Rudy Gonzalez and Patrick Tomlinson. London: Jessica Kingsley Publishers (2012), 287 pages, £22.99. ISBN 978 1849052559</title>

            <title>Reviewed by Stuart Harragan, Therapies &amp; Networks Team, Mulberry Bush School, Oxfordshire, UK</title>
            <p>In these times of economic crisis and austerity measures, therapeutic residential child care is becoming an increasingly hard sell to cash-strapped local authorities. Such residential provision is not a cheap option and justifying this considerable expense is a challenge indeed. There are other, more cost-effective models that appear to spend taxpayers’ money more efficiently and provide good-quality care for looked after children. For many of the children in care the variety of alternatives is often adequate and meets the needs of the children but, even within mainstream choices there are options, and it is usually accepted that different children will need different resources. Anyone involved with the care of children would wish them to have a family experience and consider this to be the ideal for all. Unfortunately, there are some who, because of their traumatic early experiences, need to be looked after in a different way and for whom life in a caring family presents more complications than it solves.</p>
            <p>This book explains how therapeutic residential care might be an answer in such cases and can offer children and young people the opportunity to live with other people in a way that is designed to give them the experience of a positive and healthy attachment relationship. It does this in a fairly methodical manner and the authors start by setting out their argument for a theoretical base to underpin practice. Although much of this will be familiar to those caring for children, they are clear that it should be constantly evolving and so bring some of the concepts up to date by drawing on recent developments in the field of neuroscience, particularly the work of Bruce Perry and Maia Szalavitz.</p>
            <p>Alongside the theoretical concepts, case studies are provided which bring theory and practice together neatly. These are scattered regularly throughout the book and enliven what could otherwise be a rather dry subject. Each chapter is broken down into smaller sections which also make it a relatively easy read. While reading this, I could easily see it being used as an introductory text for people new to the field of therapeutic child care, as it covers the subject well enough and offers a solid foundation. It would also be very useful for social workers to read in order to get a better understanding of why residential group living is needed and can be a positive placement for some children.</p>
            <p>The other side to this book is that it exists as a marketing tool for the Lighthouse Foundation in Australia. All of the vignettes are taken from the work of the project and are written from the point of view of the young people and staff. This is not surprising as two of the authors are senior staff there. It does a good job of representing their work but this is also a limitation. If this is to be used for training purposes and specifically for helping social workers and commissioning officers have a better understanding of therapeutic residential care, a broader representation of the available provision would be more useful. The model described in this book is one where many young people stay with the Foundation through their adolescence and into adulthood and do not necessarily have a family to return to. The Lighthouse Foundation becomes the young people's surrogate family and remains somewhere they are able to return to when they need support – they are members for life. The preference in the UK is for children to eventually have a family experience and for the residential element of their care to be a stepping-stone to an eventual foster placement. There will, of course, be young people for whom this is not possible but this is likely to be the exception.</p>
            <p>The book is well written and offers a good broad introduction to some of the theory and practice behind therapeutic residential care. I particularly like the inclusion of current neuroscience theory and the way concepts are brought to life in the case studies.</p>
