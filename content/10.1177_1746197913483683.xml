<abstract>
<p>This article explores how active citizenship can be encouraged through education and community action. It proposes that service learning and a renewed focus on voluntarism can both promote social cohesion between different ethnic and cultural groups while also fostering among the population a greater understanding of and commitment to civic culture. It reviews the international evidence on service programmes and the newly created National Citizen Service programme in the United Kingdom, arguing for a greater role for service learning in the citizen educational offer.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Encouraging a more active notion of citizenship has been a priority for recent governments in the United Kingdom. An active notion of citizenship places more emphasis on citizens’ responsibilities rather than rights. The current Government has framed their vision of a ‘Big Society’ of citizens driven to be more active in their communities by a renewed sense of solidarity and empowerment. The Government has cited several rationales for this policy framework. These include creating more socially responsible citizens who are less likely to be dependent on government, as well as a number of positive outcomes for local communities such as providing greater feelings of interpersonal trust, cohesion and collective efficacy.</p>
<p>As societies have become increasingly diverse, our conceptions of citizenship and patriotism have evolved. Research by the think tank Demos suggests that patriotism is connected less with actions such as saluting the flag or singing the national anthem, but rather an active notion of citizenship that includes community engagement, a sense of solidarity and volunteering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1746197913483683">Wind-Cowie and Gregory, 2011</xref>); similarly, international evaluations of civic service schemes found a significant positive and long-term impact on civic participation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1746197913483683">Billig, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1746197913483683">Hart et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1746197913483683">Patterson et al., 2012</xref>). These values cut across cultural and ethnic lines and cast doubt on traditional notions of citizenship and patriotism. It also suggests that encouraging a more robust sense of civic duty may lead to greater feelings of patriotism.</p>
<p>Some academics suggest that younger generations are disengaged from democratic politics and that this may well have negative social consequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1746197913483683">O’Neill, 2001</xref>). To address this, in 2002, the previous Labour Government under Prime Minister Tony Blair made Citizenship education a compulsory element of the UK National Curriculum. However, the pedagogy and curriculum of Citizenship education has come under increasing criticism.</p>
<p>Evidence suggests that the promotion of ‘service learning’, as opposed to traditional classroom learning, is a more successful approach to inculcating active citizenship and civic duty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1746197913483683">Brown, 2011</xref>). In recognition of this, the Coalition Government in the United Kingdom has created ‘National Citizen Service’ (NCS), a voluntary activity designed to increase active citizenship, encourage social mixing and facilitate the transition to adulthood. Our review of the evidence, as detailed in this article, suggests that an expanded NCS may increase civic duty and intra-societal empathy and understanding. However, one 3-week programme aimed only at 16-year-olds is not sufficient. A life cycle approach that used ‘service learning’ to teach citizenship would be more successful.</p>
<p>The first section of this article discusses what is meant by citizenship, particularly as it relates to questions of identity and the issues surrounding multiculturalism and the increasing diversity of modern society. The second section provides the current context in England on citizenship education; the subject was made compulsory in 2002, but the current Government is considering scrapping this requirement, arguing that current teaching is not of a high enough quality. The subsequent sections outline a ‘service learning’ approach to citizenship education and investigate the role that the new NCS can play in embedding it in the everyday life of society. We explore the objectives of NCS, measures of its success and its relationship with citizenship education.</p>
<p>The contents of this article are based on a study of secondary sources, in combination with information taken from researchers working in this area. This includes drawing on formal interviews conducted for previous Demos research projects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1746197913483683">Leighton and Sodha, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1746197913483683">Grist and Cheetham, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1746197913483683">Wind-Cowie and Gregory, 2011</xref>) as well as informal discussions with key stakeholders.</p>

<title>Identity, citizenship and multiculturalism</title>
<p>This article focuses on active citizenship, or what duties citizens have by virtue of their citizenship. This conception of citizenship is known in the literature as a ‘republican’ notion of citizenship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1746197913483683">Dagger, 2003</xref>). Under a republican conception of citizenship, responsibility becomes a key determinant – this is expressed by the UK Citizenship Foundation, which defined citizenship as being ‘about ensuring that everyone has the knowledge and skills to understand, engage with and challenge the main pillars of democratic society – politics, the economy and the law’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1746197913483683">The Citizenship Foundation, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>A republican notion of citizenship can thus be argued to underline the emphasis on encouraging active citizenship, which – as argued above – recent governments in the United Kingdom have made a priority. However, the drive to encourage active citizenship must also consider questions of identity, culture and the increasing diversity of Western liberal democracies as the presence of many different cultures within a single state have made founding citizenship on a single cultural or national identity yet more problematic (Huntingdon, cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1746197913483683">Doppen, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>There has been a perceived failing of multiculturalism as a political project, and this has increasingly led to debates about the relationship between nationalism, culture, ethnicity and conceptions of citizenship. For example, Chancellor Merkel of Germany stated that ‘this [multicultural] approach has failed, utterly failed’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1746197913483683">Siebold, 2010</xref>), while former President Nicholas Sarkozy also referred to multiculturalism as ‘a failure’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1746197913483683"><italic>CBN News</italic>, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>In academia, these debates are often held between ‘post-nationalists’ on the one hand and ‘liberal-nationalists’ on the other. For the post-nationalists, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1746197913483683">Habermas (1998)</xref> argues nationalism must be discarded and make way for ‘constitutional patriotism’, that is, pride in democratic processes. In contrast, liberal-nationalists argue that it is impossible to create the unity and trust that underpins a welfare state if contributors do not feel any common bonds with those they are helping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1746197913483683">Purvis and Hunt, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1746197913483683">Kymlicka (2003)</xref>, solidarity can only be achieved if all citizens show commitment and loyalty to national institutions, a shared language and a national identity that stresses the sovereignty and temporal continuity of their state. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1746197913483683">David Goodhart (2004)</xref>, Director of the think tank Demos, has also argued that there is a fundamental tension between increasing levels of diversity and multiculturalism and the necessary sense of solidarity that must underpin public support for the welfare system.</p>
<p>Given the stresses that the nation-state comes under through globalisation and mass immigration, contemporary scholars have attempted to reconceptualise citizenship around actors rather than institutions. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1746197913483683">Gaventa (2002)</xref>,<disp-quote>
<p>Recent more pluralistic approaches re-conceptualise citizenship to take a less state-centred, and more actor-oriented approach. They argue that citizenship is attained through the agency of citizens themselves, based on their diverse sets of identities.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>When theorising citizenship, academically or politically, there are inherent challenges in balancing the multiple identities that are subscribed to by individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1746197913483683">Purvis and Hunt, 1999</xref>). Without incorporating some aspects of these identities, the concept of citizenship rings hollow. As previously stated, it seems both impossible and undesirable to create a single, homogenous identity where all difference is suppressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1746197913483683">Purvis and Hunt, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1746197913483683">Faulks, 2006</xref>). It has been argued that a state that imposes a proscribed culture, either individualistic or collectivist, without sufficient regard for the other, risks ‘disastrous consequences’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1746197913483683">Blond, 2012</xref>). Suppression of differing group identities, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1746197913483683">May (1999)</xref> suggests, will not work:<disp-quote>
<p>[Both] conservative and liberal commentators fail to recognise that ethnic conflict and fragmentation are most often not when compromises are made between ethnic groups … but when these have been historically avoided, suppressed or ignored.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Furthermore, defining citizenship through interaction with state institutions is no longer tenable, as many who subscribe to differing ethnic and cultural identities view state institutions with hostility, rather than as a unifying force (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1746197913483683">Purvis and Hunt, 1999</xref>). Due to this hostility, the republican model for understanding citizenship comes under strain.</p>
<p>Although it is important to appreciate multifaceted identity – be it cultural, gender-related or ethnic – commonality is still an important virtue. Goodhart writes that ‘citizenship is not just an abstract idea … it arises out of a shared history, shared experiences and, often, shared suffering’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1746197913483683">Goodhart, 2004</xref>). He also cites David Willetts, channelling Kymlicka, who questions how long the solidarity principle underpinning the welfare state can continue, given the pressure from divergent values and lifestyles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1746197913483683">Goodhart, 2004</xref>). Through this understanding, it is not ethnic diversity that can damage social solidarity and the welfare state but divergent value systems.</p>
<p>However, following the recognition that a single identity cannot be forced upon diverse groups and that it is divergent value systems that threaten solidarity, there must be recognition that citizens are bound by commonalities. Research in the United Kingdom has found that those who are proud of their own ethnic group, be it White or Black and minority ethnic (BME), are also more likely to say that they are proud to be a British citizen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1746197913483683">Wind-Cowie and Gregory, 2011</xref>).Thus, it appears that recognition of difference in citizenship does not necessarily entail a rejection of commonality nor does it make divergent value systems inevitable.</p>
<p>In this sense, citizenship is connected to a sense of pride. The same research has found that pride is not necessarily centred in national institutions such as the Royal Family but in a sense of voluntarism, community and ‘looking out for one another’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1746197913483683">Wind-Cowie and Gregory, 2011</xref>).This voluntary giving of time to the community does not suppose that the community is in itself a moral force but that by giving time freely to the service of others, a comradely spirit is fostered. Thus, ‘doing good’ and volunteering may strengthen one’s national and community pride (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1746197913483683">Wind-Cowie and Gregory, 2011</xref>). In light of these findings, it has been argued that citizenship ‘tests’ that often quiz potential new citizens on obscure aspects of a host country’s culture and history should be replaced by a requirement to volunteer in one’s local community for a certain number of hours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1746197913483683">Wind-Cowie and Gregory, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>There is scope to build on this work to more clearly articulate the relationship between interaction with the community, the fostering of pride in that community and the consequent feelings of pride in the nation. For example, how does this relationship work in communities that are divided, dysfunctional or in fact, dangerous? It is worth stating, however, that pride in this sense does not require conformity nor does it preclude the desire to improve one’s community surroundings – the pithiest expression of this sentiment is the former slogan of the Swedish Social Democrats – <italic>stolt men inte nöjd</italic> – meaning ‘proud but not satisfied’. A modern conception of citizenship, though involving some shared icons, is less about such things and more about shared efforts and a willingness to work in pursuit of a shared vision for the future and the locality.</p>

<title>Citizenship education: how to teach or inspire civic responsibilities?</title>
<p>Citizenship education was introduced as a compulsory element of the UK National Curriculum in 2002 by David Blunkett, then Secretary of Education, following the recommendations of the Citizenship Advisory Group. The Group, chaired by Professor Bernard Crick, was established amid concerns over a decline in political and civic engagement among youths, exemplified by falling turnout at elections. The legislation also provided a non-compulsory curriculum for Key Stages 1 and 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1746197913483683">Smith, 1999</xref>). There is close to an international consensus on the importance of citizenship education: a large-scale study of citizenship teaching in 38 countries found that though there is no agreement on how to teach it, it is considered important by all of the countries surveyed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1746197913483683">Schulz et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>In order to measure its impact, the Department for Education commissioned a large-scale longitudinal study of pupils from ages 11 to 18 years who received the Citizenship education course. The study found that studying the subject was linked to higher levels of civic engagement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1746197913483683">Keating et al., 2010</xref>). Similar results have been found in other countries: Leming found that those involved in active citizenship courses in the United States developed a higher sense of responsibility than those who did not (Leming in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1746197913483683">Billig, 2000</xref>), as well as a greater acceptance of cultural diversity (Melchior in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1746197913483683">Billig, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Students in the United States, where citizenship learning is deemed more important than in the United Kingdom, rank highly in measures of social participation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1746197913483683">Patterson et al., 2012</xref>). Moreover, varied activities, in contrast to purely passive learning, in Israeli Druze schools have also seen a positive fostering of national and multi-ethnic identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1746197913483683">Court and Abbas, 2010</xref>).Scotland follows this active model of teaching; ‘the child is viewed as an active and self-regulating learner, rather than simply a passive recipient of teacher instruction’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1746197913483683">Brown, 2011</xref>: 21).</p>
<p>Fostering ‘social and moral responsibility’ and ‘community involvement’ in young people, two of the three stated aims of the original Crick report, is more difficult in a classroom setting, as such a setting consists of a necessity mainly of theoretical learning. Applying these principles to a modern context has often been a difficult experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1746197913483683">Patterson et al., 2012</xref>), and this is borne out by Ofsted’s (The Office for Standards in Education, 2010) report, where high achievement is constantly linked to levels of ‘participation’ and ‘responsible action’ such as ‘exploring and discussing current issues’ as opposed to ‘completing factual exercise’ (p. 9). Classroom lessons are vital, however, to attaining another key objective: cultivating skills of rational enquiry and debate.</p>
<p>These rational skills help young people understand political issues that affect them and voice their standpoints to those who govern them. Such understanding is vital to a democratic state as ‘the health of a democracy is directly linked to the degree to which its citizens believe they can effect change’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1746197913483683">O’Neill, 2001</xref>: 17). Without understanding the system, citizens will not be able to effect change. To tackle this through citizenship education, one case study in the Ofsted report told of how students have been asked to form their own political parties and debate issues along party lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1746197913483683">Ofsted, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Teachers are instructed to connect these abstract topics with current events and issues, which the original Citizenship Advisory Group (CAG) report called ‘the lifeblood’ of citizenship education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1746197913483683">Department for Education and Employment, 1998</xref>). A wide-ranging international study by International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement (IEA) found that globally, most schools were adopting a topical approach to citizenship education, focusing on concepts such as human rights, diversity, community cohesion and the environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1746197913483683">Schulz et al., 2010</xref>).Classroom teaching can therefore inform students of the political system they live in and interest them through the introduction of concepts such as human rights.</p>
<p>It is worth mentioning at this point that the context and characteristics of a school influence the development of young people’s understanding of civic responsibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1746197913483683">Schulz et al., 2010</xref>). While it is beyond the scope of this article to review the impact of in-school democracy, forthcoming research by the Institute for Public Policy Research in the United Kingdom looks at the proliferation of different school models following the introduction of academies, and more recently, free schools, using four schools as case studies. Initial presentation of the findings, in particular looking at the Royal Society of Arts (RSA) Academy in Tipton, demonstrates that differing approaches to school governance can have a considerable impact on pupil attainment, community involvement, and of particular interest, parental engagement – even in areas previously low in voluntarism.</p>
<p>According to Doppen, the Government must have a role in setting the curriculum and framework for which active citizenship can be developed, but schools can and should assist in this (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1746197913483683">Doppen, 2010</xref>). Based on the success of the current model of citizenship education, we are not proposing that the curriculum move away from compulsory lessons in citizenship. The argument outlined by Kerr, that citizenship education must be inclusive, ‘values rich’ and immersive, is stronger than ever. In other words, everyone should study it, there should be a normative view about good or active citizenship, and it should involve a deeper, more capabilities-building education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1746197913483683">Kerr, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>In short, both types of learning are required but the participation element has to be improved. NCS, citizenship education and service learning need to be well integrated and should reinforce each other. The risk is that if citizenship education remains solely class based, then it will never become truly practical or inspiring enough to produce active citizens.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1746197913483683">
<title>The importance of ‘service learning’</title>
<p>There is already an element of participatory learning in the citizenship curriculum, with Ofsted finding that in most schools they visited, some students were involved in learning through participation and responsible action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1746197913483683">Ofsted, 2010</xref>). One example was students raising funds for charity through experiencing homelessness for a night; this built links between charitable organisations and the students. Another way to enhance the student understanding of citizenship is through working to receive the International School Award (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1746197913483683">Ofsted, 2010</xref>), which is awarded to schools that meet the most success in developing a curriculum containing international elements such as partnering with foreign schools and promoting an international ‘ethos’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1746197913483683">British Council, 2012</xref>). Although there are examples of successful practical engagement with questions of citizenship, it was often considered ‘hard’ to do (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1746197913483683">Ofsted, 2010</xref>: 10) and not all schools are able to perform well in this area.</p>
<p>Service learning differs somewhat from what currently goes on in the majority of English schools. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1746197913483683">Jerome (2012)</xref>, ‘service learning’ is<disp-quote>
<p>An experimental approach to education that involves students in meaningful, real-world activities that can advance social, emotional, career, and academic curricula goals while benefitting communities. (p. 60)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The following is an example of service learning and it differs from school-based learning due to the activity taking place outside of the classroom and through its voluntary component. Following Hurricane Katrina, high-school students began the Each One, Teach One programme in New Orleans. This programme involved university students cleaning up public parks and school buildings during the morning then tutoring middle school students in the afternoons, often continuing the tutoring online for several years (Jerome, 2011). Another example would be having young people collaborate with local scientists to measure pollution levels, and eventually presenting findings to the local city council (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1746197913483683">Fredericks, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>There is a broad consensus in the literature that ‘community service performed during adolescence is related to later civic participation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1746197913483683">Billig, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1746197913483683">Hart et al., 2007</xref>), and from this perspective, service learning can be justified as fulfilling the goals of successful citizenship education. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1746197913483683">Grist and Cheetham (2011)</xref>, outside experiences such as volunteering increase the capabilities of the participants, particularly relating to navigating both work and social environments.</p>
<p>Capabilities can be defined as ‘the power to do things’, that is, the abilities required to do something that we want to do for ourselves. This is a combination of economic, social and environmental factors: for example, the capabilities of being able to read and concentrate, and having the time and access to the right environment in which to study could be classed as the capabilities required to attend university (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1746197913483683">Sen, 2009</xref>). This suggests a clear benefit that service learning could offer over classroom-based learning: although the latter successfully informs students, the former is superior in developing capabilities.</p>
<p>Research has found that service learning helped young participants develop a range of capabilities and positive outcomes, including teamwork, the ability to stick to a task, empathy, time-keeping, confidence and mixing with people from different backgrounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1746197913483683">Grist and Cheetham, 2011</xref>). Service and service-based learning are not unique in generating these benefits – part-time work and apprenticeships can inculcate similar abilities in young people. Service learning is unique because of the impact it can have on social and civic awareness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1746197913483683">Youniss and Yates, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>A study of Colorado’s Learn and Serve programmes, and a separate study of Philadelphia’s Freedom Schools showed a significant and positive correlation between participation in service learning and students’ connection to their community, with the Philadelphia study also showing that participants felt greater efficacy in their community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1746197913483683">Billig, 2004</xref>). There are numerous states where service learning is compulsory, including California and Maryland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1746197913483683">Billig, 2000</xref>), and it is thus understandable that the above findings support the conclusion that US students rank highly in measures of civic participation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1746197913483683">Patterson et al., 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Other studies have also shown an increase in the degree to which participants felt aware of community needs, believed that they could make a difference and were committed to service now and later in life. An article by Youniss and others found that high-school students who participated in service learning and volunteered were more likely to be engaged in community organising and to vote 15 years after their participation in the programme (Youniss et al. in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1746197913483683">Billig, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>As demonstrated above, service learning is successful in achieving active citizenship goals, and so it would appear wise to provide it a stronger foothold in the education system. However, despite the success of service learning, there are still questions over the implementation of such schemes, not least the recently introduced NCS in the United Kingdom. This issue, and the scheme, will be discussed in the following section.</p>

<title>The NCS</title>
<p>David Cameron formally announced the creation of a new NCS programme 1 month before the 2010 general election, with a high-profile speech and the publishing of a policy paper. The programme consists of 3 weeks of activities:</p>
<list id="list1-1746197913483683" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p><italic>Week 1</italic>: Personal challenge and teamwork – involving a team-building exercise away from home, including outdoor activities.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Week 2</italic>: Skills and service – placing participants in local community charities to undertake community-based residential service work, helping specified groups.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Week 3</italic>: Social action – for the final week, participants are sent back home to develop and carry out a social action project in their local community.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Upon completion of the third week, participants are expected to undertake ongoing social action projects for 5 weeks, most often on a part-time basis. National service programmes used to be commonplace in Europe, most often associated with a period of military training for young men. Some countries still have National Service programmes that young people are expected or required to undertake, for example, Finland, Estonia and Cyprus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1746197913483683">EU Citizens, 2010</xref>). In some countries still, and many historically, national service was essentially basic training and military service. Many European countries, however, have moved away from this model: Germany has replaced its compulsory military service with a voluntary form of community action, while Sweden ended their scheme in 2010, after 109 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1746197913483683"><italic>The Local</italic>, 2010a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1746197913483683">2010b</xref>).</p>
<p>In the United Kingdom, there have been consistent calls for a replacement civilian service ever since national military service was discontinued in the United Kingdom in 1960. For example, in 1994, David Blunkett advocated compulsory community service for under-21-year-olds in a personal submission to former Labour leader John Smith’s Commission on Social Justice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1746197913483683">Field and Crabtree, 2009</xref>). Former Prime Minister Gordon Brown founded V (the national young volunteers’ service) with the objective to create 1 million new young volunteers, and included a policy requiring 50 hours of compulsory community work by the age of 19 in the Labour Party manifesto for the 2010 election (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1746197913483683">BBC News, 2009</xref>). The idea of having a civilian ‘national service’ that requires undertaking volunteering and ‘social action projects’ received widespread support upon announcement, with 77% of the public in favour according to one survey. Support extended across party political lines, with 82% of Conservative voters describing it as a ‘good idea’, but also 77% of Labour voters and 76% of Liberal Democrat voters supporting the scheme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1746197913483683">YouGov, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>In a similar vein, the route to acquired citizenship in the United Kingdom has been made more difficult and longer by the 2009 Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1746197913483683">Grove-White, 2010</xref>). Volunteering within a structured programme, alongside whatever other work is being performed, can shorten the time one waits to become a British citizen. However, this scheme has been criticised; it is not considered to take into account the fact that approximately 70% of all man hours worked by migrants are already voluntary and ‘the likely achievement of “active citizenship” will be to undermine volunteering amongst migrant communities and alienate them further from British society’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1746197913483683">Grove-White, 2010</xref>: 4).</p>
<p>Further research into student attitudes to compulsory volunteering has yielded mixed results; some students have endorsed compulsory volunteering as they see the value in service learning programmes while others ‘feel forced to serve’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1746197913483683">Stukas et al., 1999</xref>: 60). A 1993–1995 study found that early volunteering did positively correlate with future volunteering, but higher levels of external control correlated negatively with future intentions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1746197913483683">Stukas et al., 1999</xref>). From this study, it can be seen that mandatory volunteering has a negative effect, but the promotion of volunteering has a positive effect. It thus poses a difficult question of how to maximise future volunteering without negating this positive effect by compulsion.</p>
<p>In contrast to the UK Government’s plan to introduce a form of national service, at this point still voluntary, the majority of European countries have moved away from compulsion in recent years. Out of the 27 member states, 21 do not have conscription while conscription in Denmark only occurs if there is a shortage of volunteers. France, Spain, Italy, Portugal and Poland have all phased out national service between 1990 and 2010 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1746197913483683">EU Citizens, 2010</xref>). In 2012, the Government’s voluntary NCS began its second year in operation. In 2011, the pilot took on 11,000 young people, and this summer there will be places for 30,000. There are currently 11 organisations that deliver NCS. An organisation called The Challenge Network is the primary deliverer of NCS, providing one-third of all NCS placements. It also acts in an advisory role for smaller providers, as the pilot year saw significant variation in the quality of the programme’s implementation.</p>
<p>Criticism of the NCS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1746197913483683"><italic>Daily Telegraph</italic>, 2012</xref>) has focused on its short timeframe and voluntary nature, though the Government’s ambition is to extend it to every 16-year-old school leaver. There has also been criticism that the cost to participants, a one-off fee of £100 considered nominal by the Government, is potentially enough to deter young people from low-income backgrounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1746197913483683"><italic>The Guardian</italic>, 2011</xref>). Others have argued that the there is little point in the Government’s expensive NCS scheme when ‘there are already plenty of well-established, high quality accredited learning options available to young people’, which could offer greater value for money (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1746197913483683">UK Youth, 2012</xref>). As NCS is still in its early stages, there exists only one publicly available evaluation of its effectiveness.</p>
<sec id="section6-1746197913483683">
<title>Objectives and evaluation</title>
<p>The government has three stated objectives for the NCS. These include a more cohesive society, a more responsible society and a more engaged society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1746197913483683">National Citizen Service, n.d.</xref>). Thus, evaluations of NCS focus on whether the programme achieves ‘social mixing’ of participants from different backgrounds, a greater sense of responsibility and a renewed sense of active citizenship and civic duty.</p>
<p>The first objective of a cohesive society relates to the degree of ‘social mixing’ that happens among those taking part in the scheme. This depends on NCS being a comprehensive programme with an all-inclusive intake, which is representative of differences in ethnicity and social class. Examples of metrics for success include respondents’ reporting, ‘forming new friendships with people not like me’, as well as an increase in ‘feeling empathy towards others’, ‘trust of others’ and ‘understanding others different to me’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1746197913483683">Conservatives.com, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Scholars are divided on the ability of service learning programmes and citizenship education to foster a more cohesive society. Some scholars have argued that citizenship education ‘operates as a form of placebo: an activity that gives the appearance of addressing the issues (racism and race equality) but which, in reality, manifestly fails to tackle the real problem’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1746197913483683">Gilborn, 2006</xref>). This has been a criticism of multicultural education in general, where some have argued that policy and practice are not linked effectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1746197913483683">May, 1999</xref>). Researchers from the Netherlands are also sceptical of the ability of citizenship education to construct a coherent national identity that negates inter-group conflict (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1746197913483683">Doppen, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Others, however, have argued that service learning increases tolerance of cultural diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1746197913483683">Billig, 2000</xref>). While further substantiation is needed, some evidence suggests that service learning may be more successful than class-based learning in this regard. Evidence from the Canadian Katimavik programme suggests that volunteering fosters better community relations and tends to decrease prejudice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1746197913483683">Office of the Chief Audit and Evaluation Executive Evaluation Services Directorate, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The second objective is instilling a sense of responsibility, which is interpreted as assisting young people with the transition to adulthood. This is a familiar concept within the discourse around citizenship, and there is some evidence suggesting that service learning can be effective in this regard (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1746197913483683">Billig, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1746197913483683">Xu, 2010</xref>).Examples of metrics used in this category include whether participants report or demonstrate: ‘awareness of own feelings and behaviours’, ‘responsibility for their local community’, ‘responsibility for their own lives’, ‘taking responsibility for getting a task done right’, ‘actively challenging unfairness in life’, and ‘being prepared to lead to achieve good for others’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1746197913483683">Conservatives.com, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The third objective is inspiring greater levels of active community engagement – or active citizenship. Citizenship education takes place within a school environment, and the lessons are broadly applicable to the country as a whole, such as in learning how the UK parliament operates. Service learning, on the contrary, is localised and involves engagement with community stakeholders. For example, citizenship education would teach civic responsibility while service learning would entail an activity such as visiting the elderly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1746197913483683">Ofsted, 2010</xref>). While schooling can be set at the national level, the visit to the elderly must be done in a local context.</p>
<p>Examples of metrics for success in the category of community engagement include whether participants report or demonstrate: ‘belief that they have a stake in the community’, ‘currently giving time to help others’, ‘wanting to spend more time supporting others’ and ‘knowledge about how to engage more with the community’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1746197913483683">Conservatives.com, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The National Centre for Social Research (NatCen) has conducted a preliminary evaluation of NCS, of which the findings of impact were mixed, in keeping with findings of academic research on the subject of mandatory volunteering. There were statistically significant improvements in communication, teamwork and leadership alongside improved measures of transition into adulthood, for example, self-esteem, perceptions of control of life and self-awareness. In particular, teamwork skills appeared to be improved, as were the ability to compromise to achieve mutual goals and the development of leadership skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1746197913483683">NatCen, 2012</xref>). However, NCS appeared to have less of an impact on social mixing and community involvement. Although several participants were considered to have been highly successful in this area, the overall pattern of change across the cohort was inconclusive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1746197913483683">NatCen, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite the equivocal picture of NCS from this preliminary evaluation, there is evidence from schemes abroad (particularly from North America where service learning is more entrenched) that service learning programmes are successful in encouraging active and responsible citizenship.</p>

<sec id="section7-1746197913483683">
<title>Evidence of impact of service learning</title>
<p>Evaluations of international civic service schemes, albeit based on self-reported data, have shown that they can be effective in delivering across all three outcomes sought by the government outlined above.</p>
<p>Much of the evidence comes from the United States, where service learning is more deeply ingrained (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1746197913483683">Xu, 2010</xref>). Service learning is of recognised importance in the United States, shown by the number of states that have made it compulsory for high-school students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1746197913483683">Xu, 2010</xref>). There is also evidence from Canada (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1746197913483683">Office of the Chief Audit and Evaluation Executive Evaluation Services Directorate, 2010</xref>) and Germany that structured voluntarism as a form of citizen service has been successful in increasing rates of volunteering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1746197913483683"><italic>The Local</italic>, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>One evaluation of City Year, a US programme where graduates are placed in deprived schools as part of the AmeriCorps programme, found that alumni had higher levels of political efficacy and were more civically engaged: 87% said that the programme helped them to exercise public responsibility and community service, 77% that it helped them become involved in some volunteer activity and 92% that it made them more confident in working with people from diverse backgrounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1746197913483683">Anderson and Fabiano, 2007</xref>). This supports previous evidence put forward that service learning increases civic responsibility, such as Each One, Teach One and City Year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1746197913483683">Billig, 2000</xref>) alongside findings cited by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1746197913483683">Xu (2010)</xref>.</p>
<p>An evaluation of the Canadian Katimavik programme suggested positive results in terms of social mixing and appreciation of diversity, and to some degree greater valuing of community service. For example, nearly all participants reported recognising the important role that voluntary work played in the community. Although it is important to note that the programme did not appear to directly increase <italic>actual</italic> levels of volunteering following the programme – which remained much the same as before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1746197913483683">Office of the Chief Audit and Evaluation Executive Evaluation Services Directorate, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Evaluations, however, have not been uniformly positive. A tracking study of the American Youth Corps conducted by Abt Associates found no statistically significant improvement in any of its chosen measures of civic engagement, stating: ‘the results suggest no impact of youth corps on the measures in the civic engagement and life skills domain’. These measures included neighbourhood and civic obligation, social trust, volunteering, connection to community and engagement in the political process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1746197913483683">Price et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section8-1746197913483683">
<title>A life cycle approach to service learning</title>
<p>As mentioned above, NCS is currently provided exclusively for 16-year-olds in the summer after they finish secondary school. While there are currently efforts underway to make the programme more flexible, there are no plans to expand the offer to those younger than 16 years or at university. Previous research by the think tank Demos has argued that this is insufficient, and that achieving desired outcomes around social mixing and active citizenship will require periods of ‘service learning’ that span the entire lifespan of every citizen, which would be more effective.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1746197913483683">Leighton and Sodha (2009)</xref> suggest that the complete offer should include</p>
<list id="list2-1746197913483683" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Service learning at school, beginning in Key Stage 2 and continuing until the age of 16 years;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Options to take part in full-time service opportunities as part of 16–18-year-olds’ compulsory education (provided for by NCS);</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Structured service opportunities for 18–24-year-olds as a route to the labour market for young people who are disengaged;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Service for university undergraduates;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Ongoing service opportunities at work and beyond;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Service programmes for the retired and elderly.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>One obvious criticism of the NCS is that it only takes place within a short time span. A spokesman for the Young Men’s Christian Association (YMCA) stated that ‘it is not short term help that is needed but year-round care’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1746197913483683"><italic>Daily Telegraph</italic>, 2012</xref>).It is worth noting though that not all programmes in other countries, for example, the United States, run for a particularly long period of time. In Maryland, 75 hours of service learning is required to graduate, while in Washington it is 60 hours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1746197913483683">Xu, 2010</xref>). These programmes have relatively positive outcomes, and therefore, it is possible to surmise that duration is not the principal factor in increasing civic responsibility. Nonetheless, NCS in the United Kingdom is relatively short.</p>
<p>One of the key objectives of NCS is to encourage social mixing, and research by the think tank Demos has previously put forward the case that this should include intergenerational mixing. The British Crime Survey has consistently revealed high levels of distrust and fear of the young among the elderly – false impressions that could be dispelled through reducing the social distance between young and old (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1746197913483683">Margo et al., 2006</xref>). By treating students as active participants in studying, rather than as passive receivers of information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1746197913483683">Brown, 2011</xref>), it is possible to increase intergenerational mixing; for example, modern history lessons with input from those who lived through the period are a way to increase contact between the young and the old in schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1746197913483683">Wind-Cowie and Gregory, 2011</xref>). However, this may not do enough to bridge the gap. A recommendation would be to promote mutual and equal social action that will do more to bridge the intergenerational gap – and service opportunities in later life could facilitate this.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1746197913483683">
<title>Can citizenship education and NCS be unified?</title>
<p>Unification of citizenship education and the NCS would appear to be the best approach to fostering a more robust notion of citizenship. Theoretically, the knowledge and skills gained in school would be supplemented by the practical capabilities cultivated through volunteering and social action. Similarly, the curriculum being augmented with service learning, drawing lessons from NCS and other social action projects would potentially improve the desired outcomes from both. The evidence from the Citizenship Education Longitudinal Study indicating that the good outcomes from education can wane if they are not maintained strengthens the case for more opportunities for service in later life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1746197913483683">Keating et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Given the problems cited earlier in this work surrounding the teaching of multiculturalism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1746197913483683">May, 1999</xref>) and the contrast with the pride instigated by volunteering felt by those proud of their own ethnic group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1746197913483683">Wind-Cowie and Gregory, 2011</xref>), a practical voluntary element could complement schooling to achieve key goal of citizenship education: ‘the creation of a shared political identity … allow[ing] for multiple political identities based on gender, race, ethnicity, social exclusion etc’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1746197913483683">Annette, 2009</xref>). In promoting pride in identity but also shared obligations, the issue of identity and citizenship could be tackled without resorting to a heavy-handed, mono-cultural approach.</p>
<p>As noted above, there is a potentially inherent tension in NCS between the desire for social mixing and the fact that the programme is voluntary. On the one hand, making NCS compulsory might alter its image in the eyes of young people – going from being something fun to something fusty and dull. Having it on a voluntary basis means that those who take part are already enthusiastic. Some academic work, collated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1746197913483683">Hart et al. (2007)</xref>, has found that the dichotomy between voluntary and mandatory provision is not easy to neutralise. Hart writes that ‘the benefit of community service for civic development may depend on whether it is required or voluntary’ but presents evidence for both sides of the argument (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1746197913483683">Hart et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Some studies have found that there are unintended negative consequences to making volunteering mandatory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1746197913483683">Stukas et al., 1999</xref>). However, other studies, in particular from Metz and Youniss, have found that mandatory volunteering when young leads to taking up voluntary activities later in life (Metz and Youniss, cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1746197913483683">Hart et al., 2007</xref>). Such findings are problematic because a divided evidence base makes it difficult to make unambiguous recommendations on whether the NCS should be kept voluntary or made mandatory.</p>
<p>A second risk in making the NCS mandatory is that the concept of volunteering itself may be devalued. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1746197913483683">Furedi (2011)</xref> refers to a ‘professionalisation’ of volunteering, an activity that no longer holds true civic virtue. He writes that ‘the institutionalisation of volunteering destroys the meaning of an altruistic act’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1746197913483683">Furedi, 2011</xref>) and it is hard to find fault with the notion that compulsion will drain the moral force from the activity. This is not to say that net benefits to the community and to social solidarity will not still occur but the social construct of voluntarismwill be damaged.</p>
<p>Finally, there is a powerful argument against retaining the voluntary nature of the NCS: those most in need may be unwilling to do the programme or otherwise excluded. It is not unusual in voluntary programmes for a selection bias to occur: evidence has shown that it is those considered ‘middle class’ who give the most in volunteering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1746197913483683">Mohan, 2010</xref>), and thus, it is likely that the socially advantaged will benefit the most from the NCS as it currently stands. From a social egalitarian perspective, the voluntary nature of the NCS is damaging, and given the well-known economic divisions between ethnic groups in British society, the goal of social cohesion may not be realised.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This article has set out the concept of active citizenship, and how it can be achieved through a combination of traditional citizenship education and service learning and community engagement, fostering a new civic responsibility in the young. The civic culture of the United Kingdom revolves around community action, social solidarity and volunteering. Evidence suggests that service learning should play a greater role in order to promote social cohesion. Service learning in combination with more traditional citizenship education is recognised as being successful in achieving active citizenship goals. However, not enough students are currently enrolled in such schemes.</p>
<p>Although the NCS has had a promising start by some indicators, it has not been successful in some important areas related to citizenship. While improving self-esteem and providing support in the transition to adult is laudable, the more important goals of social mixing and community engagement were not successfully instilled in the majority.</p>
<p>The social value attached to volunteering may be reduced if the NCS is rendered mandatory. Schools have a role in promoting active citizenship, and given the success of service learning programmes that entail volunteering, individual schools should give serious thought to using them to promote it. The government should also give serious thought to enshrining community action as part of the citizenship educational offer.</p>
