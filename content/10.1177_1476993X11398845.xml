<p>The current essay offers an overview of major studies on <italic>hapax legomena</italic> in the MT, LXX and NT. The focus of the contribution is on the definition of <italic>hapax legomenon</italic>. Authors disagree as to whether the term should point to (a) a word found only once in a specific biblical corpus or to (b) a word occurring more than once as well as unique grammatical forms of a word as well as unique meanings. The present article defends that <italic>hapax legomenon</italic> should only be reserved for a word found only once in the MT, the LXX or the NT.</p>

<body>
<p>Within classical literature the poems of Homer have received much attention. It was in this field of studies that an interest for difficult words and <italic>hapax legomena</italic> first developed. Pre-Alexandrian lexicographers were among the first to compose lists of words found in Homer that are rare and difficult to understand. <italic>Hapax legomena</italic> are included in these indices but are not treated individually. There is also no explicit clarification of what ‘in Homer’ refers to. Alexandrian linguists simply spoke of <italic>hapax legomena</italic> as ‘words occurring only once’.</p>
<p>Modern classical scholars devoted attention to defining and refining the concept. The term <italic>hapax legomena</italic>, then, was not only used for ‘words found once in Homer’ but also for words that appeared twice, in a parallel or repetitive text, for words with a unique meaning, or for special grammatical forms.</p>
<p>While rare and difficult words found in the Bible have been studied individually, little systematic research has been done on the subject. The present contribution offers a survey of the major studies on <italic>hapax legomena</italic> in the MT, the LXX and the NT. I begin my essay with studies on <italic>hapax legomena</italic> in Homer, since it was in classical studies that the interest for <italic>hapaxes</italic> started. I then continue with a survey of systematic studies on <italic>hapax legomena</italic> in the MT, the LXX and the NT.</p>
<p>My essay will answer the following question: should we define <italic>hapax legomena</italic> in the narrow sense as ‘a word found only once in a specific biblical corpus’? Or should we expand the definition to include ‘words occurring two or three times as well as unique meanings of words or special grammatical forms of a word found in unusual places, repetitive parts of a specific biblical text’? In what follows, I will demonstrate why the term <italic>hapax legomena</italic> should be reserved for words found only once within a specific biblical corpus.</p>
<sec id="section1-1476993X11398845" sec-type="intro">
<title>Introduction: <italic>Hapax Legomena</italic> in Homeric Literature</title>
<p>Homeric linguists in Alexandria were among the first to indicate the presence of difficult words by means of the text-critical symbol διπλη̂ (&gt;). Zenodotus of Ephesus (ca. 325–234 <sc>bce</sc>) and Aristarchus of Samotrace (200–145 <sc>bce</sc>) used the symbol &gt; in the margin of their editions of the <italic>Iliad</italic> and <italic>Odyssey</italic> to draw the reader’s attention to unique words and difficult terms or constructions.</p>
<p>In general the Alexandrian linguists pointed with the <italic>siglum</italic> &gt; to ‘words said only once’ but disagreed on the technical term to be used when describing these words. The expression ἄπαξ λεγόμενον is employed seldom in comparison to the more common ἄπαξ εἰρημε´νον or ἄπαξ ε´χρη´σατο (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1476993X11398845">Wagner 1999</xref>: 67). All these different terms, however, refer to the same reality.</p>
<p>Modern linguists tend to compile lists of <italic>hapax legomena</italic> in Homer and try to refine and elaborate the concept. J. Friedlander starts from the following definition. <italic>Hapax legomena</italic> are: (a) words occurring more than once in the same sentence or song; (b) words occurring at unusual places in the text or in repetitive passages; (c) words with an unusual meaning in a certain context; (d) names; (e) grammatical peculiarities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1476993X11398845">1851</xref>: 228). In his work on Plato, A. Fossum follows Friedlander’s definition but notes that in the works of Plato there are words that ‘occasionally occurred two or more times within a small space and nowhere else in the 26 dialogues. If the instance was not great and there was a close connection, I thought I might look upon the word as <italic>hapax legomenon</italic>’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1476993X11398845">Fossum 1931</xref>: 206). Soon, however, the author realizes that ‘I had before me thousands of words that I did not know how to organize. It was a big task and bigger, because I did not know how to go about it’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1476993X11398845">Fossum 1931</xref>: 206).</p>
<p>Along the same lines as Friedlander, M. Petrusevski defines <italic>hapax legomena</italic> as (a) words and grammatical forms found in Homer only and not in other literature, (b) words occurring in other literature but used once by Homer only, (c) words used only once with a specific meaning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1476993X11398845">1967</xref>: 106). Prompted by the difficulties Fossum encountered, M. Kumpf restricts his definition of <italic>hapax legomena</italic> to ‘lexical words that occur only once in the text of Homer’ (1984: 9).</p>
<p>The definitions mentioned above present five difficulties. First, there is the problem of <italic>terminology</italic>. Friedlander (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1476993X11398845">1851</xref>: 228), Fossum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1476993X11398845">1931</xref>: 206) and Petrusevski (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1476993X11398845">1967</xref>: 106) consider words occurring more than once to be <italic>hapax legomena</italic>. But can a word found ‘more than once’ be listed as a;pax? Is this not a contradiction in terms?</p>
<p>Second is the problem of delineating the text in which a certain word occurs. Friedlander mentions words occurring at ‘unusual places’ in ‘the’ text or in ‘repetitive parts’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1476993X11398845">1851</xref>: 228). Petrusevski points to forms found ‘in other literature’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1476993X11398845">1967</xref>: 106) and Fossum refers to <italic>hapaxes</italic> ‘within a small space’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1476993X11398845">1931</xref>: 206). What is understood by these vague references? What does ‘other literature’, ‘small spaces’ or ‘unusual spaces’ stand for?</p>
<p>Third, there is a difficulty with <italic>grammatical peculiarities</italic>. Is a unique syntactical construction or a unique grammatical form of a word to be called a ‘word’ (!) that is found only once? A certain grammatical form of a word may be unique in a particular context, but that does not make the word a <italic>hapax legomena</italic>. Words occurring only once may at the same time occur in a grammatical form found nowhere else in Homeric literature, but not every word appearing in a unique grammatical form is by definition a <italic>hapax legomenon</italic>. It is of course interesting to point to unique grammatical forms and their meaning, but such forms should not be considered when discussing words found only once.</p>
<p>Fourth, should unique meanings of a given word be listed as <italic>hapax legomena</italic>? This query is closely connected to the previous one. A word occurring only once may also have a unique meaning found nowhere else in Homer, but not every word with a unique meaning in a particular context is a <italic>hapax legomenon</italic> by default.</p>
<p>Fifth, should we include or omit names from a list of <italic>hapax legomena</italic>? If one follows the definition of the Alexandrian linguists, a name that occurs only once in Homer should be listed as a <italic>hapax legomenon</italic>. In many instances, however, a Greek name in itself has no specific meaning (as opposed to Hebrew names). If one studies the etymology of words found only once in Homer, names may not be relevant and should be omitted. The same may not be the case, however, when studying names found only once in the MT.</p>
<p>These five preliminary remarks form the foundation for my analysis of definitions of <italic>hapax legomena</italic> in the MT, the LXX and the NT. In what follows I will not repeat these five observations but will discuss additional problems that occur when studying biblical <italic>hapax legomena</italic>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1476993X11398845">
<title><italic>Hapax Legomena</italic> in the Massoretic Text</title>
<p>The Massoretic apparatus employs ל as an abbreviation for the Aramaic תיל (‘there is no other’). It is found in the margin of the text and draws attention to peculiar grammatical forms or difficult constructions in a sentence that may be perceived as scribal errors. The purpose of the annotation is to indicate non-recurring words and their possible scribal or philological difficulties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1476993X11398845">Greenspahn 1984</xref>: 1-3).</p>
<p>The Talmud contains numerous words occurring only once, but they are treated in the same way as difficult words or grammatical constructions. A specific term for these words does not exist and rabbis do not give them exhaustive or systematic treatment. The rabbis, however, use various methods to explain these peculiar words. They are interpreted (i) on the basis of tradition; (ii) through a parallel passage taken from the Mishnah; (iii) by derivation from a foreign language; (iv) through etymological analogy; (v) or as a composite or contraction from two words (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1476993X11398845">Casanowicz 1904</xref>: 228-29).</p>
<p>The work of the Egyptian Jewish exegete and philosopher Saadya Gaon (ca. 882–942 <sc>ce</sc>) is particularly innovative in this regard. Gaon compiled a list of difficult words and <italic>hapax legomena</italic> found in the MT. His work is the oldest example of Hebrew lexicography. He also collected lexical material found in the Talmud and presents it with parallels from rabbinical literature and sometimes from the Arabic. His study has greatly contributed to our understanding of the meaning of difficult Hebrew words and <italic>hapax legomena</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1476993X11398845">Krauss 1980</xref>: 47-77).</p>
<p>In modern biblical scholarship the necessity of lists of word frequencies and lists of words or roots occurring only once in the MT becomes apparent. Therefore scholars start from the Homeric scholarship’s notion of <italic>hapax legomena</italic> which they in turn apply to unique words and terms occurring only once in the MT. For A.S. Yahuda <italic>hapax legomena</italic> are not only words found once in the MT but also (i) words appearing twice in the same form and meaning; (ii) words occurring in two different forms but with the same meaning; (iii) unique forms of roots attested elsewhere in Scripture; (iv) words that have a unique meaning in a specific context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1476993X11398845">1902–1903</xref>: 698). I. Casanowicz understands <italic>hapax legomena</italic> in a literal sense and counts 1,500 Hebrew words or forms that occur only once in the MT. He points to 400 strict or ‘absolute’ <italic>hapax legomena</italic> which are ‘either absolutely new coinages of roots, or cannot be derived in their formation or their specific meaning from other occurring stems. The remaining 1,100 <italic>hapax legomena</italic> can easily be connected with other existing words’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1476993X11398845">1904</xref>: 226-28).</p>
<p>L.G. Zelson asserts that one should not only include ‘absolute’ <italic>hapax legomena</italic> in indices but also (i) unique words repeated in parallel passages within sentences with a similar structure and (ii) words occurring several times within the same alinea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1476993X11398845">1927</xref>: 244). H. Cohen follows Zelson’s definition and considers <italic>hapax legomena</italic> as ‘any biblical word whose root occurs in but one context’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1476993X11398845">1978</xref>: 6-7).</p>
<p>F. Greenspahn’s study focuses on words occurring only once in a certain text of the MT and is mainly a statistical overview (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1476993X11398845">1984</xref>: 29). Accordingly he disregards proper names, words from other languages and homographs (= words that are spelled identically but have a different pronunciation and meaning). In the same way as Casanowicz, he distinguishes between ‘absolute’ <italic>hapax legomena</italic> and ‘non-absolute’ <italic>hapax legomena</italic>. ‘Absolute’ <italic>hapax legomena</italic> are words that occur only once in the whole MT and have not a single connection with words that could be perceived as related to them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1476993X11398845">Greenspahn 1984</xref>: 29). ‘Non-absolute’ <italic>hapax legomena</italic> are words that appear only once <italic>in a certain form</italic> but can easily be connected with other words found in the MT. Although dated, Greenspahn’s study is the most ‘recent’ systematic study that provides a complete list of MT <italic>hapax legomena</italic>.</p>
<p>The above overview of studies on unique Hebrew words, roots, and <italic>hapax legomena</italic> is interesting for several reasons. First, it shows that it is only in modern scholarship that unique Hebrew roots, word forms and peculiar meanings of certain words are described as <italic>hapax legomena</italic>. Neither the Massoretes nor the rabbis have a specific term to describe these ‘unique’ words. Rather, it is modern scholars who apply this Greek notion to the Hebrew text. Several definitions of Hebrew <italic>hapax legomena</italic> demonstrate that using a Greek concept to identify Hebrew names or roots is not beneficial. In the MT both names and roots can have unique meanings when they occur in a certain context. In Greek, however, a name (or specific root) rarely carries an additional meaning in the way a Hebrew name does.</p>
<p>Second, there is the difficulty of defining Hebrew <italic>hapax legomena</italic>. As is the case with those who discuss <italic>hapax legomena</italic> in the work of Homer, authors who treat Hebrew <italic>hapax legomena</italic> also disagree on how to define the notion. There are issues regarding the choice of terminology, the delineation of the Hebrew corpus, the difficulty of treating unique grammatical forms and meaning of roots, and the problem of whether or not to include names in the list. An additional issue concerns Casanowicz and Greenspahn’s distinction between ‘absolute’ and ‘non-absolute’ <italic>hapax legomena</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1476993X11398845">Casanowicz 1904</xref>: 226; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1476993X11398845">Greenspahn 1984</xref>: 29). This seems to be a redundant and contradictory distinction. Is a word that occurs only once not absolute by definition? Can a word that is non-absolute be a word occurring only once?</p>
<p>Third, the scope of the studies in respective determines the way authors define Hebrew <italic>hapax legomena</italic>. Yahuda, Zelson and Cohen are primarily interested in the etymology of unique Hebrew roots. This approach therefore leads them to define <italic>hapax legomena</italic> in a broader way. Casanowicz and Greenspahn compile lists of <italic>hapax legomena</italic> from a merely statistical point of view. Therefore the distinction between ‘absolute’ and ‘non-absolute’ <italic>hapax legomena</italic> facilitates their categorization of words into different lists. Their understanding of the term <italic>hapax legomenon</italic> is both broad (non-absolute) and narrow (absolute).</p>

<sec id="section3-1476993X11398845">
<title>The Septuagint</title>
<p>In comparison with the study of <italic>hapax legomena</italic> in Homer or the MT, the study of <italic>hapax legomena</italic> in the LXX is distinctive since the text is a translation. The only monograph on the subject has been written by C. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1476993X11398845">Wagner (1999)</xref> who discusses <sup>LXX</sup><italic>hapax legomena</italic> in the Greek version of Jesus Sirach, one of the deuterocanonical books. For Wagner <sup>LXX</sup><italic>hapax legomena</italic> are to be distinguished from <italic>hapax legomena</italic> found in other literature. <sup>LXX</sup><italic>hapax legomena</italic> are words that occur only in a <italic>specific book</italic> of the LXX and which may occur several times within the same book, as long as it is a unique word that cannot be found elsewhere in the LXX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1476993X11398845">1999</xref>: 83). His work is the most recent systematic study of <sup>LXX</sup><italic>hapax legomena</italic>.</p>
<p>Along with Wagner’s monograph, several scholarly articles treat specific <italic>hapax legomena</italic> found in a given book of the LXX. These studies highlight the relevance of studying <italic>hapax legomena</italic> for determining the character of the LXX translation. J. Cook studies <italic>hapax legomena</italic> and neologisms in the Septuagint of Proverbs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1476993X11398845">2002</xref>: 1-50). He defines <italic>hapax legomena</italic> as ‘a Greek word used only once in the LXX’ (p. 2). The large number of <italic>hapax legomena</italic> and neologisms found in Proverbs is an indicator of the translation technique of the translator. Cook concludes that a high percentage of <italic>hapax legomena</italic> are found in those LXX books that are a free rendering of the <italic>Vorlage</italic> (pp. 48-49).</p>
<p>H. Ausloos and B. Lemmelijn have published an article on <italic>hapax legomena</italic> in the Song of Songs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1476993X11398845">2008</xref>: 43-61). The authors begin their contribution by stating that ‘uncommon words have always received special attention’ (p. 43). However, once they began their analysis of the <italic>hapaxes</italic> in the Songs of Songs, they realized that most commentaries on the Song of Songs do not pay any systematic attention to them. Therefore they rely on the lists of Casanowicz (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1476993X11398845">1904</xref>: 228) and Greenspahn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1476993X11398845">1984</xref>: 183-98) and follow these authors’ distinction between ‘absolute’ and ‘non-absolute’ Hebrew <italic>hapax legomena</italic>. Ausloos and Lemmelijn claim that doing this is ‘practicable’ for their research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1476993X11398845">2008</xref>: 44). The point of their study of the LXX translation of Hebrew <italic>hapax legomena</italic> in the Song of Songs is to demonstrate that the translator of the Song of Songs renders Hebrew <italic>hapax legomena</italic> with great respect for his <italic>Vorlage</italic>. He tries to find an adequate Greek equivalent for Hebrew <italic>hapax legomena</italic> that fits the context.</p>
<p>Again, several comments can be made on the above studies:</p>
<p>Wagner’s distinction between <sup>LXX</sup><italic>hapax legomena</italic> and ‘other’ <italic>hapax legomena</italic> seems superfluous and contradictory. What is the basis for saying that <sup>LXX</sup><italic>hapax legomena</italic> can occur several times within the same book?</p>
<p>Cook treats <italic>hapax legomena</italic> and <italic>neologisms</italic> together. Are both categories the same? A neologism can be a hapax but not every hapax is a neologism.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1476993X11398845">
<title>The New Testament</title>
<p>The study of <italic>hapax legomena</italic> in the NT has received attention but there still is no systematic study of the phenomenon. There are some statistical data available in concordances and studies on the NT vocabulary, but authors disagree on the exact number of <italic>hapax legomena</italic> in the NT. In his statistics of NT vocabulary, R. Morgenthaler (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1476993X11398845">1958</xref>: 26, 165) states in one of his frequency lists (<italic>Haüfigkeitstabelle</italic>) that there are 1,934 <italic>hapax legomena</italic> or words found only once in the NT. He further notes there are 842 words occurring twice, 470 found three times, 322 four times, and 221 five times. Morgenthaler, however, does not list the individual words but only provides statistical data. In the Gospel of Luke, for example, he finds 971 words occurring only once. It is unclear which words (or word forms?) belong to this category.</p>
<p>In his translated and revised edition of <italic>Grimm Wilke’s Greek English Lexicon of the NT</italic>, J.H. Thayer gives lists of words found once in Mark, Luke, Matthew, John and Acts. With regard to the third gospel, he finds 312 words ‘peculiar’ to Luke. He does not explain what he means by this definition, but a look at the list makes clear that he refers to words found in Luke more than only a single time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1476993X11398845">1889</xref>: 698-704).</p>
<p>In the second volume of the <italic>Vollständige Konkordanz zum Griechischen Neuen Testament</italic>, K. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1476993X11398845">Aland (1978)</xref> provides an overview of <italic>hapax legomena</italic> in the NT. With regard to the Gospel of John, for example, the concordance lists 84 <italic>hapax legomena</italic> that are, in this case, words occurring only once in John and nowhere else in the NT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1476993X11398845">1978</xref>: 451-52). Numbers and names, however, are also included in the list, as well as words found in variant readings of the text.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1476993X11398845">F. Neirynck and F. Van Segbroeck (1984)</xref> compiled a companion volume to Aland’s concordance. Their study consists of three parts of which the first part on compounds and derivatives is the most relevant to our own study. The lists only focus on words compounded with a preposition and with an a privative (list A) and other compounds and derivatives (list B). The lists give a statistical overview of these compounds and derivates and their occurrence in the main books of the NT. In Lists C and D, the authors give an overview of proper names and words not listed in A, B and C respectively. In both lists they mention <italic>hapax legomena</italic> and other words occurring in only one NT book. They do not clearly define what they mean by <italic>hapax legomena</italic>, but from the examples listed, the term seems to refer to words occurring only once in a given book of the NT.</p>
<p>In his lexicon, P.-G. Müller defines <italic>hapax legomenon</italic> as ‘a word that is found only once in the text of the Bible’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1476993X11398845">Müller 1985</xref>: 130). His definition is based on a literal translation of the Greek ἄπαξ λεγόμενον which means ‘a word spoken once’. Nothing more is said by him about the subject. This definition is very questionable. A word found only once in ‘the Bible’ is not the same as a word found only once in, for example, ‘the LXX’. A word can occur once in the LXX but also (once or more) in the NT.</p>
<p>In his unpublished article on <italic>hapax legomena</italic> in Hebrews, G. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1476993X11398845">Steyn (2007)</xref> systematically treats the <italic>hapaxes</italic> found in the letter written to the Hebrews. Steyn too distinguishes between ‘absolute’ and ‘non-absolute’ <italic>hapax legomena</italic> and even uses the term ‘proper’ <italic>hapax legomena</italic>. It is striking that he nowhere mentions that it was Casanowicz who first developed this distinction. His treatment of <italic>hapaxes</italic> in Hebrew is interesting since he compares those to other literary corpora: the LXX, Jewish Hellenistic literature, non-Jewish Hellenistic literature. At the end of his article he concludes that there are only eight <italic>hapax legomena</italic> that are found in Hebrews only and in no other literary corpora.</p>
<p>The recent work on the vocabulary of Luke (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1476993X11398845">Denaux, Corstjens and Mardaga 2009</xref>: xxxii-iii) provides a list of <italic>hapax legomena</italic> or words found only once in Luke and nowhere else in the NT. In addition, these authors cite <italic>dislegomena</italic> or words found twice in Luke and nowhere else in the NT along with words occurring in both the Gospel of Luke and Acts.</p>
<p>There is no systematic study of <italic>hapax legomena</italic> for the NT. Hence there has been little discussion regarding the very definition of the concept. Steyn is the only author who attempts to give an overview of specific relevant data regarding the letter to the Hebrews but, unfortunately, his contribution has not been published yet.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In this survey I have discussed the problems one encounters when applying the term <italic>hapax legomenon</italic> to words found more than once. First, I conclude that in biblical scholarship the term should be reserved for (1) words found only once, (2) within the MT, the LXX or the NT. For other words occurring twice or more in a given context one should use the terms <italic>dislegomena, trislegomena</italic> etc. Alternative terms such as ‘absolute’, ‘non-absolute’ or ‘proper’ <italic>hapax legomena</italic> are redundant and confusing and should therefore be avoided.</p>
<p>Second, the term <italic>hapax legomenon</italic> should only be used when individual words are being studied. Including unique grammatical forms or unique meanings of words under the same umbrella confuses the results. A certain word may occur in a specific form or meaning, but that does not necessarily entail that that specific word is a <italic>hapax legomenon</italic>.</p>
<p>Third, my study also suggests that names, while found only once in the LXX or NT, can be listed as <italic>hapax legomena</italic>; they may not reveal substantial information when analyzed in light of their etymology.</p>
<p>Fourth, the application of the Homeric concept <italic>hapax legomenon</italic> to the study of words, roots and meaning of words found only once in the MT is a modern development. The Massoretes and rabbis were not interested in listing words found only once. They rather focused on unique names and roots found in the MT that may cause scribal errors.</p>
<p>Fifth, although some books and articles treat biblical <italic>hapax legomena</italic> in the MT, the LXX and the NT, the subject continues to be a neglected field of study.</p>
