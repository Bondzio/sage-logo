<p>“I went to the conference, made numerous connections, reaped valuable benefits, and laid the foundation for a new career.”</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Attending a professional conference is an effective way to explore and advance knowledge, skills, and careers. For graduate students, attending a conference is an effective way to explore academic fields and new professions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1045159512452263">Chapman et al., 2009</xref>). However, attending a professional conference requires precious resources—time and money—so the decision to attend, or not, is often difficult. Are you new to the adult education field and considering your first conference? Or, are you a seasoned adult education professional considering your next conference? Perhaps you are a professor or practitioner encouraging a student or mentee to attend a professional conference. If you have decided to attend a conference, what is your plan for maximizing the experience?</p>
<p>The purpose of this reflection is to share my experience and a framework for graduate students, and professionals, to maximize attending professional conferences. If I had not attended a professional conference as a master’s student, I would not be a doctoral student today; if I had not attended a second professional conference while applying for doctoral programs, I would not be studying and researching my way to the professoriate. Based on my conference experience, reflection, and research, an overarching theme of <italic>making connections</italic> emerged and formed the foundation for a model (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1045159512452263">Figure 1</xref>). Although the model’s focus is graduate students making connections at a professional conference, the <italic>making connections</italic> opportunities and best practices also apply to seasoned professionals. Although no one person will experience all connections at all conferences, each graduate student or professional has the opportunity to experience multiple connections and benefits.</p>

</fig>
<p>As an example, the model begins with making connections to colleagues. For graduate students, attending conferences provides access to a variety of potential colleagues, including other students, professors, practitioners, and authors. As a new professional, it is important to meet other professionals. Social cognitive theory contends the learning process is social, involving the interaction and observation of others, and constructivist learning theory contends meaning is constructed from experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1045159512452263">Merriam, Caffarella, &amp; Baumgartner, 2007</xref>). Conferences offer formal and informal methods of socializing and a variety of experiences with colleagues. I have heard conference attendees proclaim they learned as much in informal conversations with colleagues over lunch, during breaks, or before and after sessions, as they learned in formal sessions. Receptions, conference-arranged dinner groups or dine-arounds, and business meetings are additional ways to connect with colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1045159512452263">Senese, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Graduate students often wear student ribbons and are easy to spot and meet. Conferences provide opportunities for students to form strongly bonded communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1045159512452263">Ghosh &amp; Githens, 2009</xref>). Conferences also provide opportunities for graduate students to interact with professors in a higher level of interaction, in different situations, and in new ways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1045159512452263">Lirgg et al., 2010</xref>). Students and faculty enjoy the positive relationships developed in a professional environment outside of the classroom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1045159512452263">Fiorentino, Manson, &amp; Whalen, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>My first adult education conference was in 2009. While earning my master’s degree, my advising professor recommended I attend the American Association for Adult and Continuing Education (AAACE) conference in Cleveland, Ohio. My initial thought was the wind off Lake Erie can be very cold in early November. My next thought focused on my meager graduate student budget and whether it could stretch to cover travel and conference-related expenses. I was also concerned about missing class, taking time away from studies, and not knowing anyone at the conference. After much deliberation, I went to the conference, made numerous connections, reaped valuable benefits, and laid the foundation for a new career. The key benefits of attending my first conference were new colleagues, different perspectives presented in the orientation and concurrent sessions, expanded knowledge and skills, exposure to new products and hot topics, and greater understanding of the depth and breadth of my new field.</p>
<p>I left my first conference with the specific goal of presenting at the next conference. Fast forward one year and I not only attended but also copresented at the 2010 AAACE conference in Clearwater, Florida. My second AAACE conference was a unique opportunity to explore doctoral programs by networking with students and professors, gaining valuable insights into research, doctoral student life, and life as a professor. I was surprised by an invitation to attend a Commission of Professors of Adult Education (CPAE) business meeting and thrilled to glimpse the inner workings of my new profession.</p>
<p>Fast forward another year and I not only presented but also took the lead in copresenting two sessions at the 2011 AAACE conference in Indianapolis, Indiana. My doctoral adviser partnered with me to develop a concurrent session based on my work and research at our university’s Center for Teaching Excellence. When I needed a collaborator and primary presenter for my second proposal idea, a connection made at my first professional conference provided the solution. A professor from another university agreed to copresent with me, adding his experience and a second perspective. Working on our session, entitled <italic>Powerful Strategies for Graduate Students/New Attendees to Maximize a Professional Conference</italic>, led to serving on the conference’s Connect and Greet committee.</p>
<p>This year, my goal is to continue making connections and copresent with professors or students at the 2012 AAACE Conference in Las Vegas. As I approach my research and dissertation, I am very interested in research ideas and potential collaborations. Another goal for this year is to attend and copresent at an additional adult education conference to expand my connections. I have a joint roundtable session accepted at a research conference and a research-based proposal accepted at a faculty and organization development conference.</p>
<p>What are your conference plans and goals? You have a decision to make about your level of conference participation. Will you reactively sit back and observe? Or, will you proactively make plans and take advantage of opportunities to make connections? Conference <italic>attenders</italic> reactively attend as spectators, whereas conference <italic>consumers</italic> proactively exhaust all of the opportunities available at a conference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1045159512452263">Boucouvalas, 1985</xref>). At the highest participation level, conference <italic>constructors</italic> proactively maximize their conference experience with planning and making connections to other learners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1045159512452263">Chapman et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Conference constructors can proactively use the model’s checklist and best practices (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1045159512452263">appendix</xref>) to identify potential conference connections and plan how to maximize connections and benefits. If we fail to plan, we plan to fail. To be most effective, use online resources and the conference handbook to carefully set goals and plan activities to maximize the conference’s opportunities to connect. As depicted in the model’s last making connections, once the plan is developed, execute the plan until you experience a surprise! When an unexpected opportunity presents itself, deviate from your plan. Think of your plan as a roadmap, including surprise twists and turns leading to unexpected benefits and opportunities. Unforeseen opportunities may be the most compelling reason to attend a professional conference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1045159512452263">Gadecki, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Graduate students and professionals who attend conferences have the potential to enjoy and benefit from making a variety of connections. While I have shared some of my connections, you will make your own connections. Hopefully, the model and checklist will assist you in making conference constructor choices to maximize making connections. Whether a graduate student or seasoned professional, I encourage you to attend and actively participate in one, or several, conferences. I look forward to making a connection with you as a new colleague at the next conference!</p>
