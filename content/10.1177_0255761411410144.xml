<p>This article discusses the adoption of a wiki to support the processes of collaborative research between members of an international team involved in the project MyPlace: MyMusic. The focus is on how new technological communications, here specifically the wiki, can enable and transform the methods and processes of research. We propose two main aspects the use of the wiki can bring to research in music education: to facilitate multi-modal research processes and to promote research as a collective rather than individual practice. Both aspects, we argue, can extend the potential for music education research and subvert some of the limiting hierarchical traditions of academic research. This shift to a networked, multi-modal research method calls for new skills: technological, personal and social. Some analytical models of networked processes by other authors provide illuminative templates and these are introduced. The article maintains a balanced view, describing potential advantages alongside possible pitfalls.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In this article our aim is to describe and discuss the adoption of a wiki portal to support the processes of collaborative research between the members of an international team involved in the project MyPlace: MyMusic. Our focus is how new technological communications, in our case specifically the wiki, can enable and transform the methods and processes of research. We will present two main aspects the use of the wiki can bring to research in music education: to enable the integration and navigation across and between media of different forms and to promote research as a collective and social rather than an individual practice.</p>
<p>In the early part of the article we provide three contexts for the discussion that follows: first, the field of early childhood music education; second, our search for other examples of wiki-enabled research; and third, the project itself. We then go on to explain some of the practical detail and decisions concerned with setting up the wiki. Finally, we move on to a discussion about the kinds of changes to the research process – both in principle and practice – that a wiki potentially can enable. The project is still ongoing, and so some of this latter discussion remains at the level of hypothesis. However, to strengthen our discussion we draw on wider, recent writings about the development and use of wikis and about the nature of participatory processes facilitated by Web 2.0 structures. By weaving this recent reading with our own experiences we arrive at a set of ideas and propositions. Thus, the wiki mediated methods in our project are evolving in ways that are influenced, reciprocally, by practical experience and by our theorizing about the processes of Web 2.0 enabled research.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0255761411410144">
<title>Context 1: Early childhood music education</title>
<p>Contemporary music education research is increasingly collaborative. Co-authored papers, international research projects and edited volumes involving international teams of authors are increasingly common. Early childhood music education (ECME) is a small discrete field that is marginal to the dominant field of music education and less well established. It is characterized by individual researchers working in relative isolation in many different countries. Collaboration is therefore important to researchers in ECME in order to strengthen the field and so any collaborative enterprise inevitably involves working with colleagues who are widely dispersed across countries and continents. The arrival of Web 2.0 tools has considerably expanded the possibilities, the ease and the reach for interactions between teams of internationally located researchers (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0255761411410144">Wenger, White, &amp; Smith, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Web 2.0 tools not only facilitate connections between researchers, they also facilitate the movement, exchange and analysis of multi-media data. Music education research in recent years has taken advantage of the technical advances in recording children’s musical activity in the form of audio, video and photos. Using multi-media methods to capture the sound and time-based, corporal dimensions of young children’s musical activity has become central to contemporary ECME research. In the last four or five years all of these visual-audio recording techniques have been made considerably easier in practical terms by the introduction of portable, digital recording devices. Digital files transfer easily and without deterioration from recording device to computer and between researchers’ computers via data holding devices and increasingly, as connection speeds increase, via the Internet.</p>
<p>Both these characteristics of ECME – researchers who are few and widely dispersed and the increasing use of multi-media, digital data – led towards the adoption of new technologically enabled methods of collecting and accessing collectively assembled, multi-media data banks. The reasons that prompted the adoption of a wiki as the central data bank for this project; to create ease of access by many to large quantities of multi-modal digital data is indeed important. But what have also come to be of increasing interest to us as we have developed this project wiki are the possible changes to the processes of research through technologically mediated collaboration. Collaborative research is clearly not new, but the wiki may represent qualitatively new ways of working together and offer new ways of working with data.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0255761411410144">
<title>Context 2: Literature search</title>
<p>From our literature searches we were unable to find any music education research that used or discussed the process of adopting a wiki.1 A general search beyond the domain of music education produced journal articles discussing the use of wikis in more general fields, and a range of web-based sites such as Wikisym (an international symposium on wikis and open collaboration), which give access to a number of papers and further links. Some articles are concerned with the evolution and process of Wikipedia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0255761411410144">Baytiyeh &amp; Pfaffman, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0255761411410144">McKiernan, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0255761411410144">Viegas, Wattenberg, Jesse, &amp; Van Ham, 2007</xref>), some are interested in wikis to support collaborative learning processes, primarily among students in secondary and higher education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0255761411410144">Kumar, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0255761411410144">Ruth &amp; Houghton, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0255761411410144">Wheeler, Yeomans, &amp; Wheeler, 2008</xref>), and some discussed the use of wikis as online central databases to which distributed teams (according to our searches, mostly concerned with medical or scientific research involving large databases) could contribute and access data (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0255761411410144">Sauer et al., 2005</xref>). Our search threw up little writing – certainly none in music education that was interested in how a wiki may enable and transform the research process, particularly the collaborative processes between relatively large (in music education terms) non-hierarchical teams and the qualitative interpretative processes. For literature that was informative about these aspects we had to access wider, general theoretical writing about networked interactions enabled by wikis, social networking sites and so on, and writings about communal learning activity. In keeping with principles that we will elucidate later in the article, we increasingly searched beyond conventional academic sources looking at online writings of all kinds (blogs, Wikipedia, short polemical writings, etc.), articles and programmes in the media, and the breed of contemporary social commentary familiarly referred to as ‘new ideas’ books (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0255761411410144">Bean &amp; Hott, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0255761411410144">Harkin, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0255761411410144">Krotoski, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0255761411410144">Leadbeater, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0255761411410144">Wallace, 2007</xref>). There is a noticeable convergence of journalism, popular culture and intellectual thinking in online sources and such ‘new ideas’ books (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0255761411410144">Jenkins, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>In the next section we describe the project and explain some of the practical aspects and decisions involved in setting up the wiki portal.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0255761411410144">
<title>Context 3: The project</title>
<p>The MyPlace: MyMusic project was hatched (as many projects are) over informal discussions between colleagues during the International Society of Music Education (ISME) – ECME Seminar of 2008 in Frascati, Italy. Face-to-face dialogue and the establishing and deepening of personal relationships between colleagues interested in common fields of activity may be a pre-requisite to successful online collaboration. The trust and personal knowledge developed in face-to-face interactions is carried over into mediated communications – an important point to which we return. The ISME commissions were set up with the purpose of encouraging communication and collaboration between researchers located in diverse international locations and so our project capitalized on this shared motivation which brought us together in the first place.</p>
<p>The aim of the project is to increase our understanding of the home-based musical experiences of young children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0255761411410144">Young et al., 2010</xref>). The team, currently consisting of 12 participants, each undertook to find a 7-year-old girl and/or boy, and to make a home visit of an hour or two to their child or two children. During the visit the researcher(s) followed a common protocol. They talked to the child about their musical activities at home (what they do and when, what they enjoy), enquired about musical equipment in the home (instruments, CD collections, toys, technologies for playing music and viewing multi-media items), interviewed a parent and invited the child to sing their favourite song. Information was collected in the form of video-data, photos, interviews, field notes and diagrams. Each researcher contributed their data to a common data bank which was then made available to all researchers in the team. Members of the research team were invited to work collaboratively to identify project-wide themes and pursue them collectively, or to identify aspects or themes they would pursue individually, with a partner or small group. This offered the possibility, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0255761411410144">Molina (1997</xref>, p. 118) poses, for ‘<italic>cada cual actúe de forma concreta, personal y peculiar de manera que las acciones de cada persona en relación con la actividad puedan ser aquellas que […] mejor se ajusten a sus conocimientos, habilidades, concepciones, valores, intereses, afectos, situación, experiencias previas, condiciones de vida, etc</italic>.’ [‘each person to act in a specific, personal and distinctive way so that the actions of each person in relation to the activity can be those that […] fit better with their knowledge, abilities, conceptions, values, interests, attachments, situation, previous experiences, living conditions, etc.’].</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0255761411410144">
<title>‘Wi-research’: The wiki</title>
<p>To use a wiki was not part of the original plan. As the project team started to collect and contribute their data to the project coordinators it became clear that the assembling and redistribution of such quantities of data risked becoming an onerous and possibly unmanageable task, particularly since researchers were carrying out their home visits at different times across a relatively lengthy time span. Also, it became clear that there was no reason why additional researchers could not join the team at a later date, the only requirement of participation being that they were able to carry out the home visits and willing to give their data to the common pool. The flexibility required – to manage quantities of mixed mode data, arriving from dispersed geographical locations and at different times – suggested a wiki portal as the most suitable method for assembling data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0255761411410144">Pérez &amp; Young, 2010</xref>). The advances in Web 2.0 mean that a wiki is now cost-effective, reliable enough and accessible to researchers with what is, in relative terms, standard office and home-based computer equipment.</p>
<p>Setting up the wiki required someone with expertise to understand the formatting; the syntax involved. There has been a learning cost in becoming familiar with how to upload data and written material. Expertise among the project members varies and while a few have been able to upload directly, others have been dependent on the wiki manager to carry out these tasks. There may be, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0255761411410144">Wallace (2007)</xref> points out, a need to move on from dependence on the wiki manager to more assertively encouraging project participants to become independent by learning these skills for themselves. Moreover, while photo and written material is easily uploaded and takes little disk space, the video data posed more of a problem. Eventually YouTube software,2 which is specifically programmed to reduce audio-visual material to be as light as possible so that it can be viewed online, was used to upload the videos in the wiki. It is interesting to note how a free, widely accessible formatting mechanism originally devised to support the sharing of video clips for information and entertainment proved to be the most adaptable and useful.</p>
<p>All this process can be made visible to others, annotated and discussed in the mediated dialogue that the wiki as social space allows. The usual discussion section merely offers a simple open box which can then be difficult to follow because the sequence of entries and responses is not organized. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0255761411410144">Wolff (2009)</xref> did, we added a forum: Extension AWC (Another Web Company) Forum from MediaWiki, in which every researcher can start to share thoughts, ask questions of one another related to the data and potentially start to work on co-authored articles.</p>
<p>Importantly in research data concerned with children, the ethical considerations have been vexing, particularly when video-data revealing their faces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0255761411410144">Flewitt, 2006</xref>), their homes and in some cases the privacy of their bedrooms is being uploaded on to a server that is potentially at risk of being accessed by outsiders. The obvious safeguards are being implemented: access to the wiki is controlled by password issued by the wiki manager and, without wishing to diminish the potential sensitivity of the data, in reality, the children are not identifiable by location beyond country name, and the data are in relative terms fairly neutral. The study3 was carefully explained to both parents and children (including a request for permission to use photograph and video material in presentations and publications) who all signed consent forms.</p>
<p>From description of the wiki in practice we now move on to more considered discussion of possible transformations to the research process that the wiki represents. The central proposition to this article is that the affordances of the new technologies – digital data, central collection on an internet server, the wiki architecture – allow for changes in the process of collaborative research which may challenge some of the fundamentals of traditional academic research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0255761411410144">Wilson et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0255761411410144">
<title>‘Wi-research’: Potentials and affordances</title>
<p>There are some broad-level potential advantages for international collaborative research mediated by online tools that we present first. In a post-oil age when researchers should increasingly become alert to the ecological dilemmas confronting us, new technologies offer an alternative low energy means to enable international collaboration without the need to travel. Although our team currently includes fewer members from poorer countries located in the Southern hemisphere in contrast to the Northern than we would like, new technologies are increasingly accessible to researchers worldwide and similarly offer lower-cost opportunities that might help to increase equality of access for researchers worldwide. In saying this, however, we do not overlook the fact that the cost of computers and software and access to training to use computers are still beyond the reach of vast numbers of people who are too poor. To present these advantages – for ‘eco-research’, and for evening up opportunities for participation – in one short paragraph with no extending discussion is not to imply that brevity of mention in any way diminishes their importance in the future of music education research. Both advantages have wider ethical dimensions that cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>The considerable potential of a wiki, and the one which we explore further here, is that it is not only a repository for multi-media data to be collated, chunked and managed, but it is also, importantly, a virtual social space where knowledge can be actively constructed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0255761411410144">Kolbitsch &amp; Maurer, 2006</xref>). The underlying philosophy of wiki, as a technological tool for shared endeavours to which many may contribute on an egalitarian basis, has its origins in Wikipedia. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0255761411410144">Leadbeater (2008</xref>) takes Wikipedia as his reference point in developing his idea of ‘we-think’, which he explains as a form of collaborative innovation. Wikipedia was motivated by an idealism which believes in the importance of individual free will. Rooted in the counter-culture of the 1960s, it draws on an ideology of levelling and of opposition to hierarchy and authority. Wikipedia challenges long-held notions that expertise resides in traditional bastions of knowledge production and that only they have the authority to legitimate and confer value on certain forms of knowledge over others. So, for example, as if attempting to assert ownership of knowledge, many universities, including our own, still frown on the reference to Wikipedia sites in academic writing, even though it has been demonstrated that it is as accurate as more traditional sources of information such as encyclopaedias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0255761411410144">Giles, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>To go deeper into <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0255761411410144">Leadbeater’s (2008)</xref> notion of ‘we-think’, he moves beyond the collective gathering of information, on too from active construction of knowledge through dialogue, to ideas of knowledge creation through collaborative innovation. The interpretative dimension of research has always involved a creative process and creativity <italic>can</italic> be highly collaborative, a cumulative and social activity in which people with different viewpoints, different skills, different insights share and develop ideas together. We are most accustomed to the notion that ideas of originality and value come from individuals who are people of talent and expertise: the writer, the professor, the artist. This is a myth, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0255761411410144">Sawyer (2007)</xref> tells us. And, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0255761411410144">Krotoski (2009)</xref> vividly writes, their ideas are treated as ‘a precious and powerful commodity around which gates and locks are erected’. We are less accustomed to the notion of ideas arising from dynamic processes of creative interaction in which they emerge from people who contribute diverse, but potentially integrative, ideas and insights (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0255761411410144">Molina, 1997</xref>) and, moreover, that these ideas may be pooled as collective property.</p>
<p>So, collaborative innovation challenges the traditional assumptions, values and practices of knowledge creation as an individual pursuit. The significance of using a wiki, and the ideals of collaborative research that it represents, is that it makes sharing central to the dynamism of intellectual, academic production that has hitherto, generally, been built on individual ownership of ideas in the form of property. This is property that acts as a form of capital in securing positions, salaries and prestige.4 A culture of sharing ideas may be deeply at odds with the idea of intellectual property rights that underpins our university and research cultures. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0255761411410144">Leadbeater (2008</xref>, p. 225) writes, ‘many of the early experiments in We-Think seem so odd because the participants give away what they create. They treat ideas and knowledge, at least some of the time, as if they were gifts.’ Truly collaborative research involving the sharing of ideas to arrive at new understandings augments the possibilities for research process while at the same time subtly subverting some of its fundamental assumptions.</p>
<p>Returning the discussion more specifically to the wiki itself, we look now at the augmentation of possibilities for research process it enables in more detail. The wiki ‘architecture’ (Wikimedia, which is freely available, was selected for this project) presents certain predesigned aspects of structure and then requires further decisions in the design of the wiki to encourage the data to be organized, accessed, viewed and discussed in certain kinds of ways. For example, the data of the child or children from each country is uploaded into one interconnected section, rather than data of similar types (the singing of the favourite song, for example) being assembled together. However, slipping across and between sections is so quick that picking out all examples of one type of data horizontally is easily achieved. Added to this, the design of the wiki is starting to enable (and we anticipate will increasingly enable) the easy manipulation of the uploaded mixed mode data (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0255761411410144">Figure 1</xref>). What <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0255761411410144">Jenkins (2006</xref>, p. 4) has identified as ‘transmedia navigation’ is the ability to follow – or to see emerging connections between – the flow of ideas across multiple modalities. Photos, written commentaries, sections of interview data and video clips can be chunked, selected, copied, pasted, juxtaposed and compared to allow for similarities and patterns to emerge leading to themes and interpretations.</p>

<p>At the same time, hyperlinks with other sites containing relevant information can be included when and where appropriate, and theoretical material (mainly articles) that informs certain emerging interpretations can be uploaded. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0255761411410144">Turkle (1995)</xref> identifies the prime characteristic of the internet as the non-linear, associative thinking encouraged by lots of information in small snippets, linking and starting to form patterns. She argues that associative thinking is a powerful thinking style that we propose can transfer in to the creative process of interpretive research, enabled by the affordances of the wiki architecture. The kind of tinkering, ‘bottom-up’ rather than ‘top-down’, in which we immerse ourselves in the online data results in what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0255761411410144">Turkle (1995)</xref> refers to as a kind of ‘soft mastery’, in which thinkers tend towards negotiation and compromise as opposed to the competition and dominance that are inherent, she suggests, in hierarchical, individualistic thought. It is at this point that associative thinking as an individual process of working with online data blends with the ‘soft mastery’ that helps to engender the collaborative sharing of ideas. These processes identified by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0255761411410144">Turkle (1995)</xref> resonate with Sawyer’s identification of group creativity as self-organizing and emergent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0255761411410144">Sawyer, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0255761411410144">Sawyer &amp; DeZutter, 2009</xref>). These characteristics, according to Sawyer, result in group creativity being riskier, in some ways less efficient, and improvisational. Such approaches fly in the face of research as pre-planned, and carefully structured, incorporating certain procedures designed to maximize rigour and reliability and may arouse anxieties for those members of the team raised in more positivist research traditions.</p>

<title>‘We-research’: Participation, recognition and collaboration</title>
<p>To better understand and make sense of the experiences of web-based collaboration we turn again to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0255761411410144">Leadbeater (2008</xref>, p. 21) who offers a valuable analysis of ‘we-think’ as requiring a balance of three ingredients: ‘participation, recognition and collaboration’. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0255761411410144">Wenger et al. (2009</xref>, p. 56), writing about ‘digital habitats’, similarly present three key challenges in pairs of concepts they call polarities which can be overlaid on Leadbeater’s three ingredients. The first of these challenges, ‘rhythms: of separation and togetherness’, denotes the possibilities for working in different times and spaces, both collaboratively and independently which, as we have already mentioned, was a key aim of this project. The second and third polarities link almost exactly with Leadbeater’s participation and recognition as we will see.</p>
<sec id="section9-0255761411410144">
<title>Participation</title>
<p>Technology can provide new ways to connect with others and participate in shared activity. However, in purely practical terms, members must be able to use the technology with enough facility to participate actively. And although the reality was that initial participation in our project through uploading data was not easy enough to encourage full participation from all the team (and needed support from the wiki manager), once uploaded, participation by accessing the site, viewing data and engaging in discussion is more straightforward. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0255761411410144">Wenger et al. (2009</xref>, p. 57) include participation and its polarity ‘reification’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0255761411410144">Wenger, 1998</xref>) as one of their three key challenges5 that drive communities to adopt technology. Participation involves the activities, conversations and personal forms of participation, akin to the kind of tinkering that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0255761411410144">Turkle (1995)</xref> refers to, and reification the crystalline outputs in the form of concepts, documents, articles and so on. For activity to be meaningful and productive, there should be an interplay of both participation and reification in balance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0255761411410144">Wenger et al., 2009</xref>). Clearly, a research project cannot remain at the level of tinkering, much as we may find this a comfortable stage to remain in, and must attempt to balance this by drawing together interpretations and creating outputs.</p>

<title>Recognition</title>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0255761411410144">Leadbeater (2008</xref>), individuals participating in the collaborative activity receive recognition for the worth of their contributions. The value of their contributions and their ideas in the eyes of their peer community provides motivation for participation. Initial recognition in our project was awarded for having collected and uploaded data; seeing the children from worldwide locations, particularly their singing of a song, has an intrinsic interest that acts as a magnet to all the team. Recognition, in part, links with Wenger et al.’s (2009, p. 58) third challenge of ‘identities’, in which they propose that ‘learning together is a complex achievement that weaves communal and individual achievement, aspirations and identities’. They mostly go on to discuss identities in terms of tensions between communal and individual participation. However, they also suggest that participation must be meaningful for individuals within the group relationships if it is to be sustained. It is likely that levels of meaningfulness and affirmation will vary among the project team and that interventions from more experienced members of the team will assist in calibrating the recognition for the less experienced.</p>

<sec id="section11-0255761411410144">
<title>Collaboration</title>
<p>Finally, collaboration is defined more precisely by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0255761411410144">Leadbeater (2008</xref>) as a mechanism that enables the sifting of better from worse. This sifting may be the most challenging, but the most important process to achieve. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0255761411410144">Keen (2007)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0255761411410144">Siegel (2008)</xref>, both critics of what they see as the collective ‘dumbing down’ that can result from the sheer proliferation of online material, call strongly for filtering mechanisms although their proposed solutions lie in quite different sources. For <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0255761411410144">Keen (2007)</xref>, the filtering is enabled through traditional expertise which should not be replaced by a belief in the ‘wisdom of the crowd’. For <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0255761411410144">Siegel (2008</xref>, p. 178), the filtering is achieved through the retention of ‘genuine human and humane’ qualities that imbue the internet communications to provide the all-important checks and balances.</p>
<p>The need for sifting or filtering mechanisms in collaborative activity, particularly as it moves from simple collation of data to interpretation, may be understood as key in rational terms but difficult to achieve in practice because of the personal and emotional relationships between collaborating team members. A study of university students using wiki sites revealed that they were very reluctant to change the writings of other students lest it appear that they were presumptuous in the eyes of others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0255761411410144">Wheeler et al., 2008</xref>). Members of a collaborative online team may be happy to post their contributions to a wiki space for other group members to read, but may be resistant to having their contributions altered or at worst, deleted. Working collaboratively in such a way that allows for constructive criticality with colleagues requires a high level of trust, respect and humility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0255761411410144">Bolam et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0255761411410144">Cassidy et al., 2008</xref>). In jazz groups improvising together, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0255761411410144">Becker (2000)</xref> has proposed that a form of etiquette needs to emerge that balances respectfulness with challenge so that the sifting of better from worse can take place. Hence the suggestion, early in the article, that personal relationships based on such qualities may need to be established prior to the online working community being set up. No matter how technology-enabled they are, groups working together are, first and foremost, social entities. The personal, social, emotional and intellectual dimensions dominate and are merely mediated by technology. There is one important point to add here too, for establishing a shared ‘etiquette’ among members of international teams is no easy matter. Those of us who attend international conferences recognize culturally diverse models of ‘etiquette’ in how respect or challenge might be shown towards the work of others. The evolution of international research via online tools may need, therefore, to consider carefully the issue of cultural sensitivity in the styles of communication and communicative roles that emerge.</p>

<sec id="section12-0255761411410144">
<title>‘We-research’: Communication</title>
<p>We emphasized, early in describing the MyPlace: MyMusic project, how the initiation of it rested on face-to-face dialogue and personal relationships. Researchers such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0255761411410144">Livingstone (2009)</xref> who are interested in the evolution of new technologies are starting to analyze the communicative styles and roles that are evolving in mediated communication through Facebook and similar social networking sites. The processes of collaborative research enabled through the wiki portal share some similarities with a social networking site. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0255761411410144">Livingstone (2009)</xref> is interested in the convergence of face-to-face models of communication with mediated ones and the changes in terms of power and position. Here too, these analyses of social networking sites may intersect with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0255761411410144">Leadbeater’s (2008)</xref> analysis of the motivational force of ‘recognition’ and Wenger et al.’s (2009) emphasis on identities.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0255761411410144">Livingstone (2009)</xref>, from her interest in social networking sites such as Facebook, has adopted <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0255761411410144">Goffman’s (1959)</xref> participation framework as an analytical framework to illuminate the intersection between face-to-face and mediated interactions on such sites. The traditional ‘speaker and hearer’ of live dialogue becomes fractured into a mosaic of roles. On the wiki, a specific discussion initiated in relation to the data uploaded by one project participant addresses that researcher by name (speaker to hearer), but with the expectation that all the other project researchers will listen in on the discussion as marginal hearers and be prompted at least to consider the points and ideally to speak up with their own ideas. This may be akin to a question and answer conversation that may evolve in a conference seminar, but the nature of written commentary enables a form of deliberation – we can spend quite a long time preparing the input, modifying it before we submit and fix it. Another discussion thread may be addressed generally to all the project members, inviting a kind of one-to-many conversation to which any may respond.</p>
<p>What is interesting too is the search for a style of writing on the wiki. Many of the existing forms of ‘internetese’ are inappropriate. The colloquial, semi-permanent comments or pieces of information that might characterize Facebook, the often ironic commentaries of blogs, or the clipped, throw-away Twitters are not appropriate, but nor is a formally framed, academic style of prose that is written for permanence in old media print. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0255761411410144">Siegel (2008</xref>, p. 166) describes the best qualities of the Internet as ‘independent-minded brevity and pith poised atop speed and relevance – with the deliberation, accuracy and reflectiveness of the best journalism’. Selection of vocabulary, style and level of formality/informality, clipped or substantial, are clearly part of the research wiki written style, infused by the emerging ‘etiquette’ that needs to become established. We include an example of wiki communication below. What studies of wikis used to promote learning through dialogue at universities have discovered is that while certain members feel confident to contribute and slip easily in to an appropriate style, others find it less easy and are reticent (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0255761411410144">Wilson et al., 2007</xref>). Encouraging participation among all based on principles of equality of power and similarity of position may be a particular challenge that our team will need to address.</p>

<p>Sample 1: Excerpt from Wiki discussion forum</p>
<p>Chee Hoo – in reading the transcription of your visit it is interesting that C. was not forthcoming in speaking to you individually. That she has been brought up to defer to her parents, and not to express views directly – do you think that’s a correct interpretation? So, it may be all very well for research to have ideas of research processes that enable children to take an active role as participants (research with children rather than research on children) – but this may be Western model of childhood that we are exporting (yet again!) – any thoughts? Sue</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>There is one final point to add. For us the wiki, like email communications, blogs, networking sites that we participate in, is beginning to become another mode of networking very similar to social networking in its blurring of professional and social and leisure time that is characteristic of contemporary life. This blended world of work and leisure leads us to ideas of ‘serious play’ that connect creative activity with professional output. Play is associated with intrinsic motivation and the increased satisfaction derived from creative activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0255761411410144">Mattison, 2003</xref>). We suggest that a wiki uploaded with multi-media data can become a site for researchers to engage in ‘serious play’.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0255761411410144">
<title>Risks and dilemmas</title>
<p>However, in proposing the potentials and affordances of online resources to facilitate changes to the research process, we are wary of proposing a utopian, liberal ideal of research that is democratic and creative. There are also risks. Dispersed groups of researchers can collaborate via web-based interactions in ways that were previously impossible and these can change how we think and relate to one another as researchers, for the better or for the worse. As groups potentially increase their isolated conversations, they could become more fractured and disconnected without recourse to the wider vetting that existing processes of scholarship through peer review, collective transparency and conference presentations enables. The field of ECME already suffers to some degree from isolation. Wider vetting can avoid the blandness or biased views that might result if groups follow their own pathways without external input.</p>
<p>It is also not our aim to pit a kind of new media idealism against old media traditionalism, to suggest that these small developments in collaborative research enabled by the Web 2.0 technologies promise anything more than small, carefully tempered advantages. Such ‘old/new’ polarized arguments in relation to activities enabled by digital technologies are common and usually unproductive. A response to this tendency for black and white thinking is to call upon our key sources again who all counsel on the importance of balance, interplay and moderation (Leadbetter, 2008; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0255761411410144">Wenger et al., 2009</xref>). Wikipedia, for example, has already evolved from its entirely democratic start to assembling panels of experts who monitor the pages to avoid sabotage and inaccurate information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0255761411410144">Viegas, Wattenberg, &amp; Kushel, 2004</xref>). What Wikipedia has shown is an evolution to a ‘both/and’ blend: a kind of third way.</p>
<p>Open platforms for sharing and collaborating raise further dilemmas in how to create ownership. Just how far can we go in sharing data and ideas before we claim ownership of our intellectual property? We have established one simple protocol in the group. All members are free to use the data for their own lines of research and writing, either alone, with partners or smaller teams but should keep everyone informed of their activity and acknowledge the whole team in any formal outputs (listed in alphabetical order as with this article). Forms of hierarchy and elitism, maybe not the older ones, but new ones perhaps, will reassemble. Even this article, which we write from the position as two coordinators of the wiki, presents us with a dilemma about how to acknowledge the other members of the team. We take the fact that we have written the article as appropriate to head it up with our names, but should we, since the wiki only exists by virtue of the collected data from all the team members, be gifting joint ownership of the article to all the team? Publications and the whole academic publication system, rooted as it is in individualistic, hierarchical research traditions, carry professional weightings that we acknowledge are important to both of us as individuals, yet in the democratic spirit about which we write, we are already in danger of contradicting that ideal. We would argue that collaborative research should be able to evolve to give authority to individuals and to the group: a kind of hybrid system that blends both individual effort and collective effort, the both/and balance again.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In this project the wiki is an efficient way for a large, internationally dispersed and diverse team to work together, to contribute to and access a common pool of mixed media data. It offers a fertile space to connect and collaborate in ways that were not possible before and has offered a new menu of options for getting together to do research. The wiki affords a range of techniques and tools that promote collaboration, sharing, coordination, flexibility and innovation. It facilitates existing ways – and creates some new ways – of bringing together data, making links within the data and with the work of others, analysing and interpreting it by engendering collective thinking. When more people are participating, the potential for more creative, innovative research is higher but at the same time the risks of amplifying inherent weaknesses and biases need to be avoided by encouraging a sufficiently critical edge. Moreover, collaborative research challenges some hierarchical assumptions built into the way that academic institutions conventionally conduct and reward research and how knowledge is constructed and valued.</p>

<title>« Nous faisons de la recherche »: En adoptant le wiki comme support pour le processus de recherche collaborative parmi un groupe de chercheurs internationaux.</title>
<p>Cet article discute l’adoption du wiki comme support pour le processus de rechercher collaborative parmi les membres d’un groupe international engagé dans le project MyPlace: My Music. Le point principal du projet réside en savoir comment des nouveaux outils de communication technique, specifiquement le wiki, peut rendre capable et transformer des méthodes et processus de recherche. On propose deux aspects principaux que l’usage du wiki peut apporter à l éducation musicale: faciliter des processus de recherche multimodale et promouvoir la recherche plutôt collective que individuele. Ces deux aspects, nous argumentons, peut élargir le potential pour l’éducation musicale et subvertir quelques limitations de la tradition hiérarchique de la recherche académique. Ce déplacement vers une méthode en réseaux, multimodale demande des nouvelles habilités: techonologique, personnelle et sociale. Quelques modèles analytiques de processus en réseaux proposées par d’autres auteursont y été introduites, fournissant des templates lumineux. L’article maintient un équilibre, en décrivant les avantages et les possibles inconvenients.</p>

<title>‘We-Research’: Ein Wiki übernehmen um kollaborative Forschungsprozesse unter einem Team internazionaler Forscher zu unterstützen.</title>
<p>Dieser Artikel untersucht die Übernahme eines Wiki, um den kollaborativen Forschungsprozess zwischen Mitgliedern eines internazionalen Teams zu unterstützen, die an dem Projekt MyPlace: MyMusic beteiligt sind. Der Schwerpunkt liegt darin, zu bestimmen, wie technische Kommunikationen, hier spezifisch das Wiki, die Methoden und Verfahren der Forschung ermöglichen und verändern können. Wir bieten zwei hauptsächliche Aspekte an, welche die Benutzung des Wiki zur Forschung der musikalischen Bildung erbringen kann: multimodale Forschungsprozesse zu erleichtern und Forschung als ein kollektives, eher als ein individuelles Verfahren zu fördern. Nach unserer Auffassung können beide Aspekte das Potential für die musikalische Bildungsforschung erweitern und einige der einschränkenden hierarchischen Traditionen der akademischen Forschung zu unterlaufen. Dieser Wandel zu einer multimodalen, vernetzten Forschungsmethode fordert neues, technisches, persönliches und soziales Wissen. Einige analytischen Vorbilder des vernetzten Prozesses von anderen Autoren liefern aufschlussreiche Vorlagen, die hier vorgestellt werden. Der Artikel stellt auf ausgeglichener Weise die potentiellen Vorteile sowie möglichen Schwierigkeiten dar.</p>

<title>“Nosotros Investigamos”: Empleando una wiki para apoyar los procesos de investigación colaborativa en un equipo de investigadores internacionales</title>
<p>Este artículo trata sobre el uso de una wiki como apoyo a los procesos de investigación colaborativa entre miembros de un equipo internacional implicado en el proyecto “MiLugar: MiMúsica”. Su propósito es saber cómo las comunicaciones tecnológicas, en nuestro caso, concretamente una wiki, puede favorecer y transformar los métodos y procesos de investigación. Sugerimos dos aspectos fundamentales que el uso de las wiki pueden ayudar a la investigación en educación musical: facilitar los procesos de investigación multimodal y promover la investigación como práctica colectiva antes que individual. En nuestro artículo argumentamos que ambos aspectos pueden ampliar el potencial por la investigación en educación musical y alterar algunas de las limitaciones de la investigación académica tradicional y jerárquica. Este cambio hacia un método de investigación en red requiere de nuevas capacidades: tecnológica, personal y social. Se presentan además algunos modelos analíticos de procesos en red realizados por otros autores que nos propocionan plantillas iluminativas para nuestro trabajo. El artículo mantiene un equilibrio a la hora de describir las ventajas potenciales junto con las posibles limitaciones.</p>
