<p>62.2589 ANNAN, Jeannie, <italic>et al</italic>. – <bold>Civil war, reintegration, and gender in Northern Uganda.</bold> <italic>Journal of Conflict Resolution</italic> 55(6), Dec. 2011: 877–908.</p>
<p>What are the impacts of war on the participants, and do they vary by gender? Are ex-combatants damaged pariahs who threaten social stability, as some fear? Existing theory and evidence are both inconclusive and focused on males. New data and a tragic natural quasiexperiment in Uganda allow us to estimate the impacts of war on both genders, and assess how war experiences affect reintegration success. As expected, violence drives social and psychological problems, especially among females. Unexpectedly, however, most women returning from armed groups reintegrate socially and are resilient. Partly for this reason, post-conflict hostility is low. Theories that war conditions youth into violence find little support. [R, abr.]</p>
<p>62.2590 APOLTE, Thomas – <bold>Why is there no revolution in North Korea? The political economy of revolution revisited.</bold> <italic>Public Choice</italic> 150(3–4), March 2012: 561–578.</p>
<p>The paper critically assesses the Acemoglu-Robinson approach to revolutions, as it is focused on inequality of wealth or income rather than on collective-action problems. We show that income inequality is not a sufficient and not even a necessary condition for a revolution to occur. Rather, a necessary condition for a revolution is that any subpopulation can expect net benefits from it, for which inequality is not a precondition. As a result, a certain structure of commitment devices or their absence rather than inequality is crucial for explaining why revolutions sometimes occur and sometimes not. [R]</p>
<p>62.2591 ARLOFF, Arles – <bold>Italie, un pouvoir corrompu (Italy, a corrupt power).</bold> <italic>Futuribles</italic> 381, Jan. 2012: 5–20. [Résumé en français]</p>
<p>Corruption and collusion between ruling politicians and the mafia are not recent phenomena that came on the scene with the rise of Berlusconi. They go back several centuries and are deeply rooted in the national political system. Drawing on the copious writings of Italian journalists and authors specializing in this question – and on the testimony of the “last of the judges,” [the author] reminds us how the mafia was built, from its earliest days, on the corruption of political power. She also shows the extent to which these corrupt practices came to be accepted and regarded almost as normal in that country. Italy remains in the control of “notables,” politicians and other dignitaries closely linked to the mafia <italic>(alta mafia)</italic> amid a prevailing code of silence, all of which increasingly makes the country resemble certain former, unlamented South American dictatorships.

<p>62.2592 ASHBROOK, John – <bold>Politicization of identity in a European borderland: Istria, Croatia, and authenticity, 1990–2003.</bold> <italic>Nationalities Papers</italic> 39(6), Nov. 2011: 871–897.</p>
<p>Istria provides a good example of how identity is politicized and how and why individuals adapt it to both internal and external influences. While in the past local and regional identities were politicized in response to colonization, more recently national divisions became more prominent. However, in the very recent past, Istrian identity again became politicized as many natives drew lines between themselves and what they saw as an external national influence emanating from Zagreb. In the 1990s, a renewed Croatian national movement competed with an Istrian regional movement. Istrian regionalists, seeking to justify taking and maintaining regional power and hoping to more quickly bring Croatia into the EU, used this new political tactic against the nationalizing Croatian government.

<p>62.2593 BABONES, Salvatore – <bold>The middling kingdom [China].</bold> <italic>Foreign Affairs</italic> 90(5), Sept.-Oct. 2011: 79–88.</p>
<p>Sure, China's economic growth has been unprecedented, even miraculous. But the country is unlikely to keep up its breakneck pace. Instead, China's growth should level out soon, returning to rates more like those of comparable middle-income countries, such as Brazil, Mexico, and Russia. [R]</p>

<p>What means are left in a situation where power itself works to leave Hungary's social structure and legal system in ruins? We could accept the destruction, indulge individually in the melancholy, or respond collectively to the common sorrow, a Hungarianized <italic>Hüzün</italic>. We could retire to an ivory tower or go abroad and, with binoculars, watch the destruction from there. This is all nonsense. The right attitude holds Keats's negative capability. In a situation full of uncertainties, secrets, and doubts, we should remain functional. It is all just a question of resolve. [R] [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 62.2731]</p>
<p>62.2595 BARFIELD, Thomas – <bold>Afghanistan's ethnic puzzle.</bold> <italic>Foreign Affairs</italic> 90(5), Sept.-Oct. 2011: 54–65.</p>
<p>In 2001, fearing ethnic strife, the international community pushed for a strong central government in Kabul. But such fears were based on a false reading of Afghan history and fostered a system of regional and ethnic patronage. To correct matters, the US should de-emphasize Afghanistan's ethnic fault lines and push for more devolved and inclusive governance. [R]</p>
<p>62.2596 BASEDAU, Matthias, <italic>et al. –</italic> <bold>Do religious factors impact armed conflict? Empirical evidence from Sub-Saharan Africa.</bold> <italic>Terrorism and Political Violence</italic> 23(5), Nov.-Dec. 2011: 752–779.</p>
<p>Theoretically, the “mobilization hypothesis” establishes a link between religion and conflict by arguing that particular religious structures are prone to mobilization; once politicized, escalation to violent conflict becomes more likely. Yet, despite the religious diversity in sub-Saharan Africa and the religious overtones in a number of African conflicts, this assumption has not yet been backed by systematic empirical research on the religion-conflict nexus in the region. The following questions thus remain: Do religious factors significantly impact the onset of (religious) armed conflict? If so, do they follow the logic of the mobilization hypothesis and, if so, in which way? To answer these questions, this article draws on a unique data inventory of all sub-Saharan countries for the period 1990–2008, particularly including data on mobilization-prone religious structures.

<p>In looking at the successful resolution of the political standoff in Côte d'Ivoire, most commentators have focused on the role of France and the UN. But this misses the real story: the critical role played by Africa's homegrown institutions. [R]</p>
<p>62.2598 BELLIN, Eva – <bold>Reconsidering the robustness of authoritarianism in the Middle East: lessons from the Arab Spring.</bold> <italic>Comparative Politics</italic> 44(2), Jan. 2012: 127–150.</p>
<p>The events of the Arab Spring have suggested the necessity of rethinking the logic of authoritarian persistence in the Arab world. However, the internal variation in regime collapse and survival observed in the region confirms earlier analyses that the comportment of the coercive apparatus, especially its varying will to repress, is pivotal to determining the durability of the authoritarian regimes. At the same time, the trajectory of the Arab Spring highlights an empirical novelty for the Arab world, namely, the manifestation of huge, cross-class, popular protest in the name of political change, as well as a new factor that abetted the materialization of this phenomenon-the spread of social media. The latter will no doubt be a game-changer for the longevity of authoritarian regimes worldwide from now on. [R]</p>
<p>62.2599 BENAVIDES VANEGAS, Farid Samir – <bold>Indigenous resistance [in Colombia] and the law.</bold> <italic>Latin American Perspectives</italic> 39(1), Jan. 2012: 61–77.</p>
<p>The indigenous peoples of Colombia have used various forms of resistance to attempt to change their identities and appropriate their lands. Over time the emphasis has shifted from law and legal titles to marches and land-occupations to armed resistance and back again to the law. The legal liberalism that emerged with the 1991 Constitution in Colombia led to the demobilization of the indigenous movement of the time, as marches and land-occupations were abandoned in favor of lawsuits that identified violations of rights. Success in the courts did not result in any change in the government's policies or its model of development. Indigenous peoples' problems on the ground remained unresolved. In recent years, however, local organizations have rediscovered old forms of resistance and use the law as just one tool among many for protecting their rights.

<p>62.2600 BENGIO, Ofra – <bold>The “Kurdish Spring” in Turkey and its impact on Turkish foreign relations in the Middle East.</bold> <italic>Turkish Studies</italic> 12(4), Dec. 2011: 619–632.</p>
<p>For many years, the world used to hear about the <italic>Partiya Karkeren Kurdistan</italic> (PKK) terrorist actions in Turkey. Recently, however, a new factor entered the scene with great force: a popular uprising which resembles in some ways the Palestinian intifada and the other uprisings which have taken place since the end of 2010 in Arab countries. In the Kurdish lexicon it is called <italic>serhildan</italic>. The fusion between well-organized guerrilla activities and an open national movement has brought the Kurdish problem in Turkey into its most crucial phase ever. This essay analyzes the immediate and deeper causes for the Kurdish problem in Turkey and assesses its impact on the stability and security of Turkey itself and on Ankara's foreign relations as a whole.

<p>62.2601 BENNETT, Bruce W.; LIND, Jennifer – <bold>The collapse of North Korea: military missions and requirements.</bold> <italic>International Security</italic> 36(2), Fall 2011: 84–119.</p>
<p>In North Korea, the upcoming leadership transition in the Kim Jong-II regime will be a precarious time for the Kim family's hold on power. A collapse of the North Korean government could have several dangerous implications for East Asia, including “loose nukes,” a humanitarian disaster, a regional refugee crisis, and potential escalation to war between China and the US. To respond to a collapse and these problems, neighboring countries may perform several military missions to stabilize North Korea. These include the location and securing of North Korean weapons of mass destruction, stability operations, border control, conventional disarmament, and combat/deterrence operations. [R, abr.]</p>
<p>62.2602 BERG, Eiki; SOLVAK, Mihkel – <bold>Muted differences: entrenching legitimacy of the Bosnian statehood?</bold> <italic>Cooperation and Conflict</italic> 46(4), Dec. 2011: 460–481.</p>
<p>The UNDP report <italic>The Silent Majority Speaks</italic> (2007) demonstrates widespread consent and a popular desire for change while promoting a single state with strong regions as a compromise model for Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH). Surprisingly, our own research (2009) on political legitimacy reveals quite the opposite tendencies, where political entities such as the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (FBiH) and the <italic>Republika Srpska</italic> (RS) more often drift apart than merge together. What strikes us is the fact that the FBiH, which advocates a more integrated state, does not necessarily have more legitimate grounds for achieving that goal than the secessionist counterclaim of RS in its own right. The two entities remain worlds apart on a range of issues and agree only on rather abstract principles of an ideal political order. [R]</p>
<p>62.2603 BIGO, Didier; GUITTET, Emmanuel-Pierre – <bold>Northern Ireland [UK] as metaphor: exception, suspicion and radicalization in the “war on terror”.</bold> <italic>Security Dialogue</italic> 42(6), Dec. 2011: 483–498.</p>
<p>This article questions the fashionable view that Northern Ireland is a counterinsurgency lesson to be learned for the global “war on terror”. It suggests that Britain's involvement in the Northern Ireland conflict can be regarded as a meaningful metaphoric utterance in efforts to analyze the practical failures and threat discourses of the global “war on terror”. Northern Ireland is more than a specific case-study: it acts as an appealing metaphor in attempts to understand the logics and pitfalls of the “war against terrorism,” where the increasing primacy granted to terror control means that Western governments are increasingly more willing to infringe otherwise inviolable rights in the pursuit of a supposed greater good – security. The article explores the political economy of unease, suspicion, exception and radicalization in the “war against terrorism”. [R, abr.]</p>
<p>62.2604 BLAYDES, Lisa; LO, James – <bold>One man, one vote, one time? A model of democratization in the Middle East.</bold> <italic>Journal of Theoretical Politics</italic> 24(1), Jan. 2012: 110–146.</p>
<p>We argue that questions about the commitment of Islamic political opposition to democracy beyond a country's first free election may hinder Middle Eastern democratization. We extend A. Przeworski's canonical model of political liberalization as described in <italic>Democracy and the Market</italic> (1991). Democracy can occur when two types of political actors meet – regime liberalizers who prefer democracy to a narrowed dictatorship, and civil society elite who honor democratic principles. While a series of influential studies have argued that authoritarian elites block democratic transition because of their fear of the economic redistributive preferences of the median voter, this study suggests that regime liberalizers in the Middle East suspect political openings could become a vehicle for Islamists to seize power through free elections only to deny the median voter another chance to express their will.

<p>62.2605 BLOMBERG, S. Brock; BROUSSARD, Nzinga H.; HESS, Gregory D. – <bold>New wine in old wineskins? Growth, terrorism and the resource curse in Sub-Saharan Africa.</bold> <italic>European Journal of Political Economy</italic> 27, Suppl. 1, Dec. 2011: 50–63.</p>
<p>Since 1995, growth in Sub-Saharan Africa has averaged more than 5% per year, reversing a two-decade decline of real income <italic>per capita</italic>. We explore the extent to which the nascent growth is sustainable or not due to higher incidences of terrorism and commodity price declines. Our analysis is based on a rich unbalanced panel data-set with annual observations on 46 countries from 1968 to 2004. We explore these data with cross-sectional and panel growth regression analysis and quantile regressions. We estimate the economic and statistical effect of terrorism on growth in Sub-Saharan Africa, controlling for a variety of other factors. We then investigate the extent to which there appears to be a structural break in the estimated relationships. We find that the terrorist-oriented fragility of Sub-Sahara has increased in the most recent period. [R, abr.] [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 62.1402]</p>

<p>Hungary was considered a pioneer of democratic reforms in the Soviet bloc. After 1989, the new democratic system quickly achieved a very high degree of stability by regional standards. Consolidation, however, was accompanied by growing polarization between the political camps. The tendency of political elites to call into question the legitimacy and integrity of their political opponents not only strains the ability of democratic institutions to function. It also poses risks to Hungarian democracy. [R] [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 62.2731]</p>
<p>62.2607 BOWEN, John R. – <bold>Islamic adaptations to Western Europe and North America: the importance of contrastive analyses.</bold> <italic>American Behavioral Scientist</italic> 55(12), Dec. 2011: 1601–1615.</p>
<p>The article examines the ways Islamic leaders have adapted to conditions in Britain, France, and the US by taking one problem – how a Muslim woman can obtain a religious divorce – and identifying contrasts across those three countries. It emphasizes two contrasts among the three countries: the degree of residential concentration of Muslims and the social effects such concentration may have, and the legal legitimacy of religion in civil courts. Muslim leaders have crafted institutions accordingly: in Britain, Shari'a councils emerging from tight-knit communities and regarded by jurists as relatively benign; in France, Islamic leaders constrained to emphasize the Islamic legitimacy of civil institutions; and in the US, leaders developing contractual instruments in response to relatively favorable judicial reactions.

<p>62.2608 BOZÓKI, András – <bold>Autoritäre Versuchung: die Krise der ungarischen Demokratie (The authoritarian temptation: the crisis of Hungarian democracy).</bold> <italic>Osteuropa</italic> 61(12), Dec. 2011: 65–88.</p>
<p>Since taking office in April 2010, the government under V. Orbán has been restructuring Hungary's political system. It is moving away from the principles of a liberal constitutional state. In the name of “majority democracy,” the government has weakened the separation of powers, centralized the state, and expanded the prime minister's powers. The root causes of this change lie in the Hungary's political and social structural deficiencies. An illiberal democracy has now come into being. There is a risk that this will turn into a hybrid regime in which elements of democracy merge with elements of authoritarian rule. This would set a precedent in the EU.

<p>Portugal stands on the precipice of default. Contrary to much of the conventional wisdom, it has not come to this pass simply because of its inclusion in the euro group. Its troubles go back further, to the immediate aftermath of the country's 1974 revolution. At that time, the fateful constitutional decision was made to install a social democracy amid the remnants of the preceding dictatorship known as the <italic>Estado Novo</italic>. In the ensuing three and a half decades, the <italic>Estado Social</italic> grew to nearly half the size of Portugal's economy. The intervention in the marketplace entailed in this growth has undermined capital investment, leaving the economy in a moribund condition. To make matters worse, Portugal's democracy has succumbed to the regime's vulnerability to political parties' short-sighted rent-seeking. [R]</p>
<p>62.2610 BROOKS, Risa A. – <bold>Muslim “homegrown” terrorism in the United States: how serious is the threat?</bold> <italic>International Security</italic> 36(2), Fall 2011: 7–47.</p>
<p>Since the 11 September 2001 attacks, analysts and public officials have expressed growing concern about the potential of Muslim citizens and residents of the US to plot attacks within the country's borders – “homegrown” terrorism. To assess this apparent threat, I examine what is known about the willingness and capacity of Muslim Americans to execute deadly attacks in the US. Three conditions, either alone or together, could contribute to an increasing threat of homegrown terrorism. The first concerns what is known about the radicalization of Muslim Americans and whether a surge in arrests in 2009 indicates a growing trend in Muslim American terrorism. The second relates to the capacity of aspiring militants to avoid detection as they prepare attacks. The third depends on the skills of aspiring terrorists and therefore their capacities to execute increasingly sophisticated attacks. [R, abr.]</p>
<p>62.2611 BRUDNY, Yitzhak M.; FINKEL, Evgeny – <bold>Why Ukraine is not Russia: hegemonic national identity and democracy in Russia and Ukraine.</bold> <italic>East European Politics and Societies</italic> 25(4), Nov. 2011: 813–833.</p>
<p>The article discusses the impact of national identity on democratization and market reforms in Russia and Ukraine. We develop a concept of hegemonic national identity and demonstrate its role in Russian and Ukrainian post-communist political development. Russia's slide toward authoritarianism was to an important degree an outcome of the notions of national identity adopted by the main political players and society at large. In Ukraine, on the other hand, a hegemonic identity failed to emerge and the public discussion of issues of national identity led to the adoption of much more liberal and democratic notions of identity by a considerable part of the political elite. Adoption of this more liberal identity, in turn, was one of the main reasons for the Orange Revolution. [R, abr.]</p>
<p>62.2612 BURNHAM, Peter – <bold>Towards a political theory of crisis: policy and resistance across Europe.</bold> <italic>New Political Science</italic> 33(4), Dec. 2011: 493–507.</p>
<p>This article analyzes the Great Recession in terms of a movement from a discourse of financial crisis to a crisis of sovereign debt to the current phase of the politics of austerity and cuts. It suggests that the unifying factor in the response of policy-makers to the crisis is the attempt to recompose class relations and tighten market-based constraints over labor power and money. The strategy represents a clear illustration of the “political use of crisis” to reaffirm the stark reality of the “cash nexus”. Selective state intervention to contain and prevent the “contagion” of the crisis has increasingly politicized the management of the economy and fueled debate about the nature of money, the character of the state, and the morality of capitalist social relations.

<p>This article examines Israel's attempts to weaken and defeat the Lebanese Hezbollah. It reviews Hezbollah's rise after the 1982 Israeli invasion of Lebanon, Hezbollah's successful effort to force Israeli forces to withdraw from Lebanon in 2000, the 2006 war, and Israeli attempts to deter Hezbollah. The article argues that Israel has largely failed to defeat Hezbollah militarily and politically. Israel's experience offers lessons for how terrorist groups learn, the effectiveness of terrorist attrition strategies against casualty-sensitivity states, the difficulties in coercing terrorist groups, and the importance of an information strategy. Finally, Israel's clash with Hezbollah indicates the importance of thinking of groups that are large and multi-faceted from a counterinsurgency paradigm. [R]</p>

<p>The authors ask how America can simultaneously be religiously devout, religiously diverse, and religiously tolerant. They argue that America's relative religious harmony lies in the frequency of “religious bridging”. Almost all Americans have a friend or close family member of another religion, and these personal relationships keep America's religious melting pot from boiling over. [R]</p>

<p>This paper empirically investigates the socio-economic causes of terrorism and political violence in a sample of 12 countries in Western Europe. First, we show that in western European countries the classical economic argument of opportunity cost if confirmed. That is, the larger is the set of current economic opportunities for individuals the lower is the likelihood or the willingness for them to be involved in a terrorist activity. Second, expected future economic growth seems to be associated with an increase in current terrorist activities. Eventually, our results also show that terrorist brutality (measured in people killed) is positively associated with real GDP <italic>per capita</italic>.

<p>62.2619 CASE, William – <bold>Mahathir's successors sharpening dilemmas in Malaysian politics.</bold> <italic>Maryland Series in Contemporary Asian Studies</italic> 2011(2): 1–71.</p>
<p>The great puzzle about Malaysia's politics is how, amid the country's rapid economic expansion and evolving social structure, authoritarian rule has persisted, basically unchanged, for more than three decades. Civil liberties have long been constrained by “draconian” amendments to the constitution. Elections, though regular and somewhat competitive, have been heavily manipulated. This monograph characterizes the kind of “hybrid” approach to authoritarian politics that has prevailed in Malaysia, conceptualized in term of electoral authoritarianism and single-party dominance. It also reviews the historical legacies and social structures that have long perpetuated this regime-type and party system, but now produce significant strains. The analysis focuses on the efforts made by Abdullah and Najib to manage rising societal tensions and factionalism within UMNO. The monograph rehearses key lessons and gauges the prospects in Malaysia for political change. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>Over the last decade, a growing number of students of democracy have sought to develop means of framing and assessing the quality of democracy and identifying ways to improve the quality of democratic governance. We review the recent efforts to conceptualize and measure quality of democracy by way of introducing a comprehensive method for measuring some essential properties of liberal democracy. Next, we present an empirical assessment of the quality of democracy in Taiwan based on the sub-dimensions formulated by L. Morlino – specifically, rule of law, accountability, participation, competition, freedom, equality, and responsiveness. In the areas of accountability, participation, and freedom, Taiwan has made considerable progress. However, Taiwan's young democracy still has room for improvement in the areas of the rule of law, equality, and responsiveness. [R] [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 62.2707]</p>

<p>This article examines the causes of the financial and economic crisis in the Republic of Ireland. It first reviews the crisis in advanced capitalist democracies and then situates the Irish case in this context. It relates existing narratives and other evidence to the different theoretical explanations we survey (in this issue) in order to identify the most useful approaches to explaining the Irish crisis. Explanations focusing on the role of mass preferences and varieties of capitalism do not aid our efforts to understand the causes of the crisis or how it unfolded. By contrast, an explanation focusing on the role of lobbying is of some value, as are analyses of elite integration and the structural dependence of the Irish state on a thriving financial and property market.

<p>The current wave of reform in the Maghreb is more a function of convenient timing of political and social calendars than a domino effect linked to the Arab Spring. The Islamist parties, which are the main players, are seeking to maintain a balance between their mentors in the Gulf and their Western partners – American and European. Pragmatism and opportunism are the watchwords in the current changes. [R]</p>

<p>Although past history contains examples of the rise and fall of world leading economies, the catch-up trends of China and India are unique. The paper highlights four unique features in leadership displacement. (1) When economic, demographic, and regional interactions are formally considered, leadership displacement would be of a greater magnitude than is implied by simple GDP comparisons. (2) The two economies appear to be more complementary to each other than competitive, which deepens the displacement effects. (3) An assessment of the external uncertainties suggests a likely acceleration of the displacement, while a brief analysis of involved internal risks suggests that such risks have subsided and are fading. (4) China and India have distinctly different socio-economic and polity systems [from] today's firm-dominated leading countries such as US and EU. [R, abr.] [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 62.2776]</p>

<p>Although population growth in the UK is currently arousing widespread popular concern, political scientists have tended to ignore the issue while political elites are manifestly reluctant to address it.

In particular, the article offers a detailed analysis of a recent Royal Commission's report on the environmental impact of demographic change in order to explore the reasons for this antipathy.

<p>This article conducts a theoretical and empirical analysis of political protest activity surrounding the modern Olympic Games. The Olympics have seldom been explored from a political perspective within the mainstream IR and transnational protest literatures. We argue, however, that the Olympics provide a theoretically interesting context in which to examine political contention in IR in large part because they provide such a unique opportunity structure for a range of actors to exercise power in pursuit of their goals. The article presents an original dataset of all protest occurring between 1896 and 2008 and uses these data to show that not only has Olympic political contention grown substantially over time, but it also has evolved in interesting ways in terms of the particular actors engaged in contention, the tactics they use, and the resistance they face.

<p>62.2629 CROSS, Mai'a K. Davis – <bold>Europe, a smart power?</bold> <italic>International Politics</italic> 48(6), Nov. 2011: 691–706.</p>
<p>Smart power is defined as the effective combination of both hard and soft power. The concept is increasingly used in policy and academic debates, yet a clear understanding of what it actually means is still lacking. As a result, there is little serious consideration of how smart power can contribute to long-standing debates about power in international relations. This article clarifies the meaning of smart power through first analyzing its main components – hard and soft power – separately; and second, bringing these components together to re-conceptualize smart power. The aim is to make smart power more analytically useful, and to outline the various ways in which hard and soft power can be combined effectively. The author argues that Europe is mainly a soft power and sometimes a smart power. [R]</p>

<p>Why does Nicaragua have less violent crime than Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras? All these countries underwent political transitions in the 1990s. Many explanations point to the legacies of war, socioeconomic underdevelopment, and neoliberal structural reforms. However, these arguments do not fully explain why, despite economic reforms conducted throughout the region, war-less Honduras and wealthier Guatemala and El Salvador have much more crime than Nicaragua. This article argues that public security reforms carried out during the political transitions shaped the ability of the new regimes to control the violence produced by their own institutions and collaborators. The survival of violent entrepreneurs in the new security apparatus and their relationship with new governing elites foster the conditions for the escalation of violence in northern Central America.

<p>Through a critical reading of its cartographic construction since the fall of the Ottoman Empire in 1919, I provide unique insights into the numerous, complex, and even contradictory geopolitics of the construction of the “Arab Homeland”. My analysis of several hundred maps produced in eight different states of the Arab Homeland reveals that from the mid-1950s onward, the Arab Homeland was not only commonplace, but also how this supranational territorial entity confused and at times defied generally accepted divisions of the world. Expanding upon literature on supranational entities and the state, I show that territory is not only still important in our globalized world, but that it also has a complex and at times contradictory relationship with the concepts and scales of the state and the supranational.

<p>Al-Qaeda in Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) murders and kidnappings stress roughly upon the presence of a resilient and may be powerful terrorist group in the Maghreb-Sahel territory. This group woke up not spontaneously. It the result of successive rebirth of the radical Islam in this zone. Both globalization and disorganization of the post-Soviet world favored the rising up of radical Islam as a political alternative as well to the local authoritarian regimes as the western models: glocalization, fluidity, rhizome, continuous recombingand instantaneous communication are the constitutive sociological patterns of this new object.

<p>This article examines the development of cooperative relationships in back-channel communication and their impact on intraparty negotiation. It draws on extensive newly available evidence on back-channel communication in the Irish peace process to expand the range of detailed case studies on a topic which is shrouded in secrecy and resistant to academic inquiry. It analyzes the operation of a secret back channel that linked the Irish Republican Army to the British government over a period of 20 years, drawing on unique material from the private papers of the intermediary, Brendan Duddy, and a range of other primary sources. Interaction through this back channel increased predictability and laid a foundation of extremely limited trust by providing information and increasing mutual understanding. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>Like its emblem, the two-headed eagle, Albania is still a paradoxical state. While its foreign policy's dynamics are indeed exemplary, those of its domestic policy are still marked by often disabling practices. At the international and regional level, Tirana has been able to increase its initiatives and has cleverly managed to join many multinational and multilateral institutions, especially in the Balkans, within which Albania is involved in many projects. In contrast, its strong political will seems to have difficulties in becoming a true compound of domestic policy. Between the two parties which are parts of the political field, there is an exacerbated rivalry which highlights their difficulties to consider national interest above their own political apparatus.

<p>Democracy in the Philippines is a paradox. It was the first country in the region to topple authoritarian rule. Signs of a vibrant democracy are extensive: high voter-turnout, civic engagement, institutional arrangements that theoretically promote accountability and safeguard rights and liberties. Yet the flaws in the democratic process are also extensive: elite dominance, institutional weakness, and widespread abuse of public office, which suggest true representation is largely illusory. Concerns about the quality of democracy have become central to political discourse in the Philippines, as seen in debates about constitutional reform and the hopes associated with the election of reform candidate B. Aquino III as president in 2010. This analysis examines how oligarchic structures and dysfunctional institutions threaten the emergence of true democracy in the Philippines.

<p>The use of deterrence, coercion and brute force in effecting peace in asymmetric conflict is often overlooked and a premium instead is placed on diplomacy and bargaining between states and non-state terrorist groups. Indeed, the relative success of the Northern Ireland “peace process” since the 1990s has amplified the sound of dialogue as a means of ending violent conflict in deeply divided societies. This article adopts a different perspective. Borrowing from strategic theory, it examines the British state's application of force in bringing the Provisional IRA to the negotiating table. It argues that in the “battle of wills” between the British state's security forces and the IRA, a more coercive strategy was adopted by Britain than is openly admitted in the scholarly literature on the Northern Ireland “troubles”.

<p>Commentators in the Western media, the US Congress and academia are increasingly contending that China is on its way to becoming a threatening global force, an adversary, if not an enemy. This article examines whether those views are justified, after first establishing the importance of critically assessing all claims that a nation is turning into an adversary. The examination proceeds by summarizing the arguments of those who consider China an adversary in the making – the “adversarians” – and the responses of those who hold China is leaning toward a peaceful development and should be engaged – the “engagers”. The discussion analyzes the debate with regard to the different sectors of power: military/geopolitical, economic and ideational. The conclusion explores alternative American responses to China's rising power in each of the three sectors. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>Proponents of constitutional patriotism advocate the promotion of a political national identity. Whether a national identity founded on common political values is viable, however, remains a matter of dispute. The Swiss nation is one of the few empirical cases cited by those who argue that a political national identity can be a sufficient guarantor of institutional stability and social coherence; indeed, Switzerland is widely regarded as a prototype of the political nation. Our analysis empirically tests this claim. We rely on classical typologies of national identity. We use a more finely graded typology than the usual dichotomies, however – one which allows for combined types – and to focus on individual perceptions of national identity at the mass- and elite-levels.

<p>Sustained growth and an assertive foreign policy are the manifestations of the new “emergent” Brazil. Economic growth finds its origin in a combination of democratic consolidation and macro-economic stability in a brief period of international prosperity. Cautious and well-designed interventions by monetary authorities, with limited political intromission, have reduced the disturbances caused by the international financial crisis of 2008. Social programs, consolidated since the late 1990, and rigorously implemented have succeeded in alleviating extreme poverty in regions. Brazil has renewed its contribution to international governance. It challenged the stronghold of rich countries on multilateral organizations, established new relations with developing countries, joined the most outspoken in favor of democratization and contributed decisively in UN sponsored peace missions. recurrent urban violence and profound social inequalities are slowing the pace of reform.

<p>A. B. Breivik, perpetrator of the Norwegian massacre, was motivated by a belief in a Muslim conspiracy to take over Europe. Extreme and aberrant his actions were, but elements of this conspiracy theory circulate in Europe today across a broad political spectrum, with internet-focused counter-jihadist activists at one end and neoconservative and cultural conservative columnists, commentators and politicians at the other. The political fallout from the circulation of these ideas ranges from test cases over free speech in the courts to agitation on the ground from defense leagues, anti-minaret campaigners and stop Islamization groups. This Muslim conspiracy bears many of the hallmarks of the “Jewish conspiracy theory,” yet, ironically, its adherents, some of whom were formerly linked to anti-Semitic traditions, have now, because of their fear of Islam and Arab countries, become staunch defenders of Israel and Zionism.

<p>This article, forming part of this volume's effort to map the qualities of democracy in Asia, describes Thailand (as of mid-2011) as a formal democracy devoid of each of the “qualities” that promote democracy's full realization. Aside from offering an overall descriptive assessment, the article explains the relationship between the various qualities of democracy observed in Thailand over the past decade. While Thaksin Shinawatra's tenure in office (2001–2006) offers a compelling illustration for the proposition that “not all good things go together,” virtually every dimension of the “goodness” or “quality” of Thailand's democracy has experienced a generalized decline since Thaksin's ousting in 2006.

<p>Following in the footsteps of Zine El Abidine Ben Ali in Tunisia and Hosni Mubarak in Egypt, Muammar Qaddafi of Libya is the third dictator to be swept away in the democratic revolts of the Arab Spring. His fall, which only just preceded the tenth anniversary of the 9/11 attacks, brings symbolic closure to a decade marked by the shadow of Al Qaeda and the “global war on terror”. Astonishingly, Qaddafi had managed to turn the international situation to his advantage. After the toppling of Saddam Hussein, he quickly dismantled his non-conventional arms in exchange for guarantees for the safeguard of his regime. Such opportunism allowed, for a time, a rapprochement with the West. But a stubborn (if heterogeneous) domestic resistance finally exploded in the winter of 2010–2011, and succeeded in ousting the “Guide of the Revolution” after months of bloody combat. The new Libya is a major player in the emancipation process that has only just begun in the southern Mediterranean.</p>

Hungary's adoption of a new citizenship law, which allows Hungarians living abroad to acquire Hungarian citizenship, and its current confrontational, ethno-nationalist politics of nationhood are responsible for this.

<p>Is civic associational engagement within micro-policy fora “good” for democracy more broadly? Drawing from a study of civic associational engagement in Ireland's national Social Partnership process over a ten-year period this article argues that, where deliberations become overshadowed by more traditional communicative norms of bargaining and negotiation, it is not. Evidence is presented from the Irish case to show how civic actors, having internalized the dominant communicative norms of the process, have contributed toward a narrowing of the deliberative space within, but most particularly outside, this process. This has resulted in a considerably weakened public sphere with neither the institutional apparatus nor the discursive capacity to seek accountability from political and civic leaders at a time of profound crisis within the Irish state.

Our article bridges a significant gap in the literature that usually focuses on simple explanations for the existence of ethnic parties. The analysis reveals that the political mobilization of ethnic minorities is explained by institutional elements often underemphasized in existing theories and research. [R]</p>

The Syrian political crisis which began 15 March 2011, however, came as a surprise to most, and will no doubt spark a new round of debate about its causes and possible effects. One aspect widely overlooked or misread is the critical role of the Syrian Alawite community in determining Syria's future. Ongoing Alawite support to the Assad regime is by no means assured. The foundations of Alawite approval of the regime have steadily eroded during the second generation of Assad rule in a process, which resembles Ibn Khaldun's theory for the decline of group <italic>'asabiyya</italic> in the second stage of dynasties.

Specifically, Taiwanese industrialization can be viewed as an outcome of the US intervention in the Chinese civil war and subsequent exclusion of China from the regional political economy in the period between the Korean and Vietnam Wars.

<p>A number of communities in rural Colombia are implementing nonviolence and sustainable resource projects with external support as a means of resisting displacement and dispossession. Practicing peace and rejecting relations with armed groups is a self-protective measure that raises the visibility of the communities' neutrality and status as noncombatants. Community residents' strong motivation to continue to live in a specific landscape and maintain small-scale, local-resource-based livelihoods opens potential sources of support beyond the realm of human rights, humanitarian relief, and solidarity organizations to groups interested in protecting traditional cultures and conserving natural landscapes.

<p>The revolutionary spirit which has run through the Arab World is surprising everyone, including the radical Islamists and the terrorist organizations. In the Maghreb, the fall of the ben Ali regime and the reforms made in Morocco had first destabilized AQIM – which has actually been marginalized in regards to these popular demonstrations. However, after the fall of Colonel Qaddafi AQIM fighters were galvanized believing that the solution to the dictatorial regimes lied in armed strength. In Algeria, the 2011 Ramadan proved to be the deadliest month since the 2006 creation of AQIM. Never before had Droukdal's organization led so many suicide attacks in such a short time. The “Arab spring” is clearly a turning point because the future of the terrorist organization depends entirely on its outcome. This article proposed an inventory of the organization during the time of this great geopolitical and strategical upheaval. [R] [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 62.2632]</p>

<p>This article submits, with N. Mandela, that despite political freedom and a lauded liberal constitution, South Africa remains collectively unfree, especially if freedom is understood as power across four economic and political dimensions. G.A. Cohen's notion of the “collective unfreedom” of the proletariat is still very useful in understanding the extent of unfreedom in South Africa. There are four main reasons for the condition of collective unfreedom in South Africa: poverty; inequality; the electoral system; and macroeconomic policy. In the end, though, the article contests Mandela's claim regarding the force of our moral duty to others to enhance their freedom; rather, it is the realization that our individual freedom depends upon the freedom of others that would motivate all citizens to secure the freedom as power of all South Africans.

<p>This paper examines two contrasting cases of ethnic-group political activism in China – the Uighurs in Xinjiang and the Mongols in Inner Mongolia –to explain the former's political activism and the letter's lack thereof. Given similar challenges and pressures, how can we explain the divergent patterns in these two groups' political behavior? This paper forwards the argument that domestic factors alone are not sufficient to account for differences in the groups' political behavior. Instead, international factors have to be included to offer a fuller and satisfactory explanation. The paper illustrates how three types of international factors – big power support, external cultural ties, and Uighur diaspora community activism – have provided opportunities and resources to make the Uighur political activism sustainable.

<p>In response to Western criticism of the Chinese government policy in Tibet, President Hu Jintao says that the Tibetan problem is not about ethnicity, religion, or human rights, but about national unity or integrity. In fact, the Tibetan problem is about all of these things, and they are intertwined with one another. This paper [examines] each of them from an institutionalist perspective to see in what way such an understanding of the problems may help solve them. [After] explaining new institutionalism, I analyze these problems from a sociological new institutionalist perspective: (1) sovereignty and autonomy; (2) ethnicity and human rights; and (3) culture and religion. Finally I look at the possibility of social change under the institutionalist constraints. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>The article analyzes how traditional tribal and social structures have been undermined by changing socioeconomic and political norms exacerbated by President A. Salih's style of neo-patrimonial, corrosive patronage politics, not by the inherently tribal nature of Yemeni society. As respect for tribal norms has eroded and resource scarcity has intensified, the fabric of tribal society has fundamentally altered and conflict in Yemen has spiraled. The article also explores whether the tribal areas of the country now function as safe havens for Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP). [R, abr.]</p>

<p>What explains the course of Uighur-related violence in Xinjiang and Central Asia since 1990? I argue that the locations and types of violent incidents were influenced by a combination of Chinese government policies and the political geography of Xinjiang. Specifically, 1990 to 1996 were dominated by logistically complex incidents in a low-level violent campaign in Xinjiang. The Strike Hard campaign in 1996 brought about an increase in logistically simple incidents in Xinjiang and some violence in Central Asia as Uighur separatists had trouble moving people, information and weapons across the well-guarded, difficult terrain of Xinjiang's borders. China's rapprochement with Central Asian countries in the late 1990s led after 2001 to a dramatic decrease in Uighur-related violence in general, but also signaled the appearance of logistically creative attacks that required little planning or materials.

<p>This article gives an overview of the political arena and the various political forces at play in post-Mubarak Egypt. With many unpredictable variables currently at play in Egyptian politics, the result of the elections scheduled for November 2011 will likely surprise many, both within the country and beyond. The article also looks at what impact the political changes in Egypt may have had on the relationship between Egypt and Israel. There have been increasingly frequent demands within Egypt to revise the Camp David accords – but not at the expense of war with Israel. While Israel is unlikely to accept any calls to revise the peace treaty, Arab public opinion has become newly relevant for policy-makers and Israel will have to make corresponding adjustments to its regional security strategy.

<p>This article examines the emergence of a mobilizational authoritarian regime during V. Putin's second term. It argues that this development was shaped by the repercussions within Russia of “velvet revolutions” in former Soviet republics. On the one hand, it traces the growth of the perception that Russia faced an imminent revolutionary threat. On the other, it shows how the Kremlin's counter-measures – the creation of the youth movement <italic>Nashi,</italic> the imposition of controls on the NGO sector, and the elaboration of “sovereign democracy” as an unofficial state ideology – were directed against a domestic threat.

<p>The article analyzes the historical evolution of “class ideology” in China, especially since 1978. It finds that the crisis affected rural-urban migrants far more substantially than it did workers in the formal (mostly state-owned) urban sector. While this situation presents numerous challenges (for the central state, a crisis of legitimacy; for the local state, a crisis of managing social unrest as well as providing welfare; and, for the workers, a crisis of survival), it also creates opportunities for new conceptualizations and practices of class-politics. We discuss the nascent articulation of a few of these opportunities in labor union activity, protests, and emergent rights-awareness, and legal consciousness among workers, as well as the implications for China's model of economic development.

<p>This paper explores basic patterns of the recent political culture in the Cyrenaica region of Libya with special regard to the revolutionary events that began in February 2011. The political culture in Cyrenaica is shaped by the heterarchy of tribal, state-like, Islamic and civil urban forms of political organization. This comprises varying political practices and rationales as well as different conceptions of power, rule and also of legitimacy. The concept of “heterarchy” or “heterarchisation” of political order describes the plurality of competing power foci in Libya. The paper argues that tribal and extended family politics play a key role in this setting. [R]</p>

<p>We contend that government capability is a primary factor in shaping individuals' ascription of legitimacy to the state. Capable governments foster perceptions of legitimacy while poor institutional performance decreases the degree to which individuals trust their government. While some tests of this relationship exist in extant literature, much of the work fails to integrate both micro- and macro-level factors, is confined to regions with established state performance, or is based on single-country studies. Our approach avoids many of these deficiencies by using 32 Afrobarometer surveys collected across 16 different countries from 2000 to 2005 and employing hierarchical linear models to estimate the effects of temporal-specific, state-level variables on levels of individual trust.

<p>Koreans have worked hard to improve the quality of their democracy. They have promoted the rule of law, accountability, control of corruption, freedom, and responsiveness, and made an effort to make government more effective. They are also committed to economic freedom. In relation to the rule of law, significant attention has been devoted to reducing terrorism and violence, making government more effective, and enhancing regulatory quality. However, with regard to accountability, control of corruption, and transparency, Korea has still a long way to go. The analysis of democratization and improvements in the quality of democracy to date suggest that Korea has adapted to the changing economic environment and is sustaining its economic growth. This has been accompanied by social and economic polarization and a consequent demand for more and better welfare services. [R] [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 62.2707]</p>

<p>Beset by multiple security challenges, not least the emergence of a powerful Al Qaeda franchise, Yemen appears the antithesis of the “Weberian” state model. But while these challenges are acute, they should be seen as part of a wider “political field,” dominated by powerful tribes and conditioned by patrimonial networks that have long framed the modes of political exchange between the center and periphery. This remains crucial to understanding the wider eddies of tribal politics in Yemen, and in turn, the limits of a purely military response by Washington as it seeks to confront Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula.

<p>This article examines the utility of opportunity theory, framing analysis, and symbolic politics theory in explaining the causes of ethnic war, focusing on the 1970s Mindanao case. Opportunity variables are present as expected, but process-tracing shows they do not operate according to the hypothesized mechanisms. The framing approach identifies several important dynamics. The resonance of frames was influenced by the salience of the issue highlighted, the narrative fidelity of the frame to preexisting cultural beliefs, the credibility of leaders proposing them, and processes of frame bridging. Symbolic politics theory offers the most complete explanation, embracing most of the alternative explanations' insights while filling in their logical gaps. The symbolist analysis begins with group myths justifying hostility on both sides, the result of past Christian-Muslim warfare. [R, abr.]</p>

The theoretical approach examines language behavior in consequence of politically created language structures on the one hand and in consequence of integration in social interaction structures on the other hand. Hence a special imprint of cultural identity arises, which is expressed by language behavior. This approach is used for the examination of language behavior in Belarus. The influence of corresponding socio-economic and cultural indicators of language usage is estimated by a multinomial logit model. [R]</p>

<p>Ceasefires are often seen as a simple measure to end violence and allow more substantive negotiations to begin. Contemporary conflict-resolution models thus posit the ceasefire as a basic step in the peace-building trajectory. Offering an in-depth analysis of Naga militancy in Northeast India, this article argues that ceasefires should rather be understood as a part of the dynamics of conflict. Northeast India is a site of protracted conflict involving multiple contestants, where Naga militant organizations play a key role. A string of ceasefires since 1997 between the Indian government and the National Socialist Council of Nagalim (NSCN) has contained fighting between security forces and militants, while violence has continued unabated between NSCN factions and among an array of other armed groups in the area claimed as “Nagalim,” with serious consequences for local communities.

A particular issue in this relation for Slovenia is the “Erased” – the individuals who did not acquire Slovenian citizenship when Slovenia seceded from federal Yugoslavia – and despite the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) decision, the Slovenian state has still not recognized their rights, which were violated in the post-independence period. The article also examines two other minorities in Slovenia, the Jews and the Roma. The article finds Slovenia to be a closed, non-globalized society which despite its constitutional declaration to protect the rights of minorities and other national communities, is seeking to retain a politically and culturally homogeneous nation-state.

In elections, voters continue to be determined by ethnic and language factors, and the pro-Russian Communist party retains its strength. As a consequence, Parliament is unable to elect a President of the Republic. [R, transl.]</p>

Here, we show why uni- and multi-dimensional reductions of Elazar's and Lieske's typologies and other measures do not predict and explain the variation in representative indicators of state performance nearly as well. To lay the groundwork for a more rigorous understanding of state culture, and to integrate it with the work of Hero on diversity and R.

<p>The four volumes reviewed examine the common theme of the sustainability of China's authoritarian regime as it faces tremendous centripetal forces of market expansion, increased administrative complexity, and social differentiation brought about by the post-Mao Zedong reforms. I argue that the shared focus of several authors on the Chinese Communist party's exercise of individual-level controls – either through internal disciplinary and reward mechanisms or through the strategic co-optation of private interests and civil society groups – provides valuable insights into the organizational basis of authority and exchange emanating from the party-state. At the same time, this perspective manifests inherent biases in accurately assessing the authoritarian government's adaptive capacities under changing circumstances. Further research is needed on local structures where state power encounters social resistance, producing as yet un-institutionalized processes of insecure compromise. [R]</p>

<p>This paper explores the impacts of FDI on financial development in China. Based on panel data at the provincial level (1987/2004), it shows that FDI propels loans by the big four state-owned banks, but produces no effects on loans by other financial institutions. With simultaneous equation model, it proves further that the financial deepening measured by the loans of the big four banks plays attracts FDI, which means that the causal links between them are two-way. By reducing the information asymmetry between the state-owned banks and their clients, FDI improves the efficiency of the financial system. Modern firms having connections with FDI become the new target clients of the state-owned banks. [R] [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 62.1587]</p>

<p>It is the new middle class in Naga society that is steadily reshaping the vision of an independent Naga nation that has been rooted in its tribal institutions. Many of the new ideas and initiatives for resolving the old problems of unity and integration are coming from the professional “middle class” women and men. Fourteen years of ceasefire have seen the expansion of a “non-partisan” middle space, the space of Naga social organizations, which holds the promise of nudging the political groups towards reconciliation and accountability.

<p>There are numerous small, irregular, asymmetric, and revolutionary wars ongoing around the world today. In these conflicts, there is much to be learned by anyone who has the responsibility of dealing with, analyzing, or reporting on national security threats generated by state and non-state actors. The cases we examine (Mexico, Jamaica, Colombia, Argentina, and Peru) demonstrate how the weakening of national stability, security, and sovereignty can indirectly and directly contribute to personal and collective insecurity, radical political change, and possible state failure. These cases are also significant beyond their uniqueness. The common political objective in each diverse case is to control governments, and/or coerce radical change in discrete political-social-economic systems. This defines war as well as insurgency, and shifts the asymmetric global security challenge from abstract to real. [R]</p>

<p>This article claims that the territorial structure of government results from a tension between scale and community. The benefits of scale arise from the nature of public goods, and include economic exchange, political power and protection against external shocks. Communities are double-edged in that they are characterized by parochial altruism. Altruism and social solidarity facilitate government within communities, but parochial attachments constrain government among communities. Scale and community, as theorized here, provide a setting for strategic choice. Both are in flux as patterns of human interaction change, and government itself shapes those patterns. Evidence is drawn from the five largest polities in the history of western Europe: the Roman Empire, the Frankish Empire, Napoleonic France, the Third Reich and the EU. [R]</p>

<p>Political parties can be vehicles for economic and social development in poor countries. They can also serve as rent-seeking instruments. Uncovering how parties function is therefore key to establishing the preconditions for good governance. The article discusses when and why clientelism on the basis of party affiliation may arise. Operationally, party-based clientelism is defined as a bias of public policy in favor of members of the governing political party. In a sample of local governments in India, party-based clientelism is shown to exist in two out of four states and to be strongly affected by economic inequality. [R]</p>

<p>This article critically analyzes the state-building agenda from a governance and aid-policy perspective, and from an anti-corruption viewpoint in particular, highlighting potential problems with both theoretical and practical applications of state-building in a development context. Inconsistencies and contradictions between the state-building and anti-corruption work have not been adequately explored or reconciled. In particular, the article explores these tensions using the example of the Performance-Based Governors' Fund (PBGF) in Afghanistan, where some donors are looking to reduce corruption in local government, encouraging often “warlord” governors to run their administrative offices with integrity.

<p>Northern donor policies relating to building a common future and building peaceful states and societies go to the heart of national and international security agendas. This article critiques the concept of commonality between donors and recipients and within recipient countries. It argues that the policies are problematic from the perspective of security theorizing, both in their mooted “commonality” and in terms of the political intervention that they imply. Historically security has been competitive and founded on compromise rather than commonality, and the internal legitimacy of states has been contested domestically, rather than “built” from outside. Using the example of the Democratic Republic of Congo, the article argues that the ahistorical assumptions of these policies and the activities they license have entrenched specific forms of insecurity.

<p>The qualities of democracy in Fiji are strongly influenced by ethnic divisions and indigenous sources of power and legitimacy in society. Periods of constitutional democracy interrupted by successive coups garnering conflicting support suggest that a more stable Fijian democracy requires a delicate balance of tribal, religious, ethnic and military interests. Successful democratic and governance reform requires the inclusive deliberation of all major groups in civil and political society, and not merely one that purports to represent all. Only by improving the qualities of democracy in Fiji will Fijian politics emerge from its cycle of coups and offer a more stable form of government. [R] [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 62.2707]</p>

<p>This article critically examines the politics of religious conversion in India.

Third, it probes the specifics of Christian conversion in India and investigates the issue within the framework of identity politics and secularism. Fourth, it examines the response and reaction of the radical Hindu nationalists towards religious conversion in general and Christian conversion in particular from the perspective of ethno-religious nationalism. Finally, it evaluates the dimensions of conflict between Christians and Hindus and how they are played out in the shared social arena. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>This article discusses the relationship between multiculturalism and national identity, focusing on the Australian context. It argues that inclusive national identity can accommodate and support multiculturalism, and serve as an important source of cohesion and unity in ethnically and culturally diverse societies. However, a combative approach to national identity, as prevailed under the Howard government, threatens multicultural values. The article nevertheless concludes that it is necessary for supporters of multiculturalism to engage in ongoing debates about their respective national identities, rather than to vacate the field of national identity to others.

<p>This article argues that far from marking a break in recent literary development, the terrorist attacks of 9/11 [2001] made less of an impact on American fiction than we often think. Critics have often accused writers after 9/11 of “retreating” into the domestic; in fact, domestic and individual narratives, often set against sweeping historical backgrounds, already dominated American writing in the late 1990s. At first, therefore, novelists handling the events of 9/11 framed them within the personal and the small-scale. In the last two years, however, writers such as A. Haslett and J. Franzen have begun publishing broader, more ambitious state-of-the-nation novels, explicitly addressing the US's relationship with the Middle East and the impact of globalization. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>We first assess the quality of democratic procedures, content and outcomes in eight countries in the Asia-Pacific region on the basis of quantitative and qualitative data. Second, we investigate whether, to what extent, and how democratic qualities relate to one another. In contrast to our previous empirical findings demonstrating that all the qualities go hand in hand, that participation and competition are the main determinants of democratic qualities, and that the democratic qualities form a funnel of causality, the present study suggests a different set of conclusions. In the Asia-Pacific region, the democratic qualities are weakly related to one another, do not form a funnel of causality, and participation and competition are not the main drivers of democratic quality.

<p>In the 1990s, the Francophone African countries operated their transition towards democracy. This coincided with the worldwide spread of democratic pluralism. In Africa also constitutional law became an effective legal framework for political activities. However, during the past two decades, there have been many violations of democracy, especially in Congo-Brazzaville. The ruling elite has failed to implement effective constitutional rules and principles, which are frequently bypassed. In order to guarantee the efficiency of democracy, three reforms are needed: (1) the Constitution must acknowledge ethnic issues and ensure proportional representation; (2) proactive spatial planning policies must be carried out in order to avoid frustration in disadvantaged regions; (3) the army's role must be clarified in the Constitution, which may help to build a true democratic culture.</p>

<p>In order to bolster sustainable peace-building in violently divided societies, a normative suggestion is that efforts should be made to construct a shared public identity that overarches ethnic divisions. A number of different centripetal/transformationist processes are identified as engineering a shared identity in comparison to consociational arrangements, which are accused of institutionalizing ethnic differences and perpetuating conflict. These transformationist approaches essentially rest on the premise that because ethnicity is constructed, it can be reconstructed into new, shared forms. Looking at Northern Ireland, we argue that there are limits to the extent that ethnicity can be reconstructed into shared identities. By analyzing consociational and centripetalist/transformationist approaches to division, we conclude that although consociationalism will probably not deliver a common identity, it does provide a robust form of conflict-regulation.

<p>The ongoing debate about the structure and dynamics of Al Qaeda has failed to appreciate the importance of an organizational layer that is situated between the top leadership and the grass-roots. Rather than being “leaderless,” it is the group's middle management that holds Al Qaeda together. In Clausewitzian terms, Al Qaeda's middle managers represent a center of gravity – a “hub of … power and movement” – that facilitates the grass-roots' integration into the organization and provides the top leadership with the global reach it needs in order to carry out its terrorist campaign, especially in Europe and North America. They are, in other words, the connective tissue that makes Al Qaeda work. The article provides a number of case studies of Al Qaeda middle managers, illustrating their critical role. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>The article deals with Finnish development in the world economy from the world system perspective. The examination focuses on the semi-peripheral stage and its reflections in the political structure. Until the 1920s, Finland remained an agrarian and peripheral country but in the 1930s, it transformed itself into a semi-periphery. In the 1960s and 1970s, Finland underwent a deep economic and social change which eventually led to a move to the core. Since the late 1960s, the Social Democratic Party (SDP) held an almost hegemonic position in Finnish political life for about the next three decades. Together with strong presidential power, the SDP's hegemony stabilized Finnish politics and promoted the transformation from semi-periphery to the core. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>The summer of 2011 has been another violent one in the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region (XUAR). Despite the removal of hardline party secretary Wang Lequan who was seen to have seriously mishandled the devastating outbreak of violence in July 2009, his replacement by the supposedly reform-minded Zhang Chunxian and the pumping of vast amounts of central government funds into the region, the XUAR is still an area of major concern for Beijing. The central leadership fears its control over the vast, strategically and economically vital province slipped significantly during the last year of Wang's leadership.

<p>The peace process in Northern Ireland lurched from crisis to crisis for almost a decade after the Belfast/Good Friday Agreement was signed in 1998. This article examines the tools the British Government employed in seeking a breakthrough that would bring about the stable devolved government that was the goal of the Agreement. It demonstrates how the government's approach oscillated between seeking to cajole/persuade the parties to agree to share power by the use of incentives and concessions (carrots) and seeking to compel them to do so by the use of sanctions and penalties (sticks). The article demonstrates the problems with both approaches and argues that in Northern Ireland they were often applied in an inconsistent and counterproductive manner.

<p>This article examines the emergence of a neo-Biafran movement, the Movement for the Actualization of the Sovereign State of Biafra (MASSOB) in Nigeria. Drawing on a prior idea of statehood, the advent of MASSOB marks a shift in the tenor of ethnic nationalism by virtue of the fact that the movement entirely rejects a state-led process and demands the creation of an independent state of “Biafra”. The analysis dissects the change in the tempo of contemporary Igbo nationalism and identifies the need for a major restructuring of the Nigerian state in order to forestall the possibilities of other ethno-nationalist claims becoming uncompromisingly separatist.

<p>Indonesia's 1999 decentralization law gave local governments in Indonesia an unprecedented opportunity to adopt pro-development policies. We study whether decentralization has in fact generated improved economic performance in Indonesia. Using a synthetic case-control methodology, we argue that Indonesian decentralization has had no discernable effect on the country's national-level economic performance. To explain why not, we use subnational data to probe two political economy mechanisms-interjurisdictional competition and democratic accountability-that underlie all theories linking decentralization to better economic outcomes. Our findings suggest that extreme heterogeneity in endowments, factor immobility, and the endogenous deterioration of local governance institutions can each undermine the supposed development-enhancing promises of decentralized government in emerging economies such as Indonesia.

<p>Syria has been wracked by unrest and bloody repression for several months. It all started when the police opened fire against protestors in Deraa, in southern Syria. The protests quickly expanded to most other cities, from the banks of the Mediterranean to the eastern borders. The people, inspired by events in Tunisia and Egypt, are demanding that president Bashar al-Assad step down. But the situation in Syria is more like that in Libya, minus the international intervention. The ruling party has unleashed its armed forces against demonstrators and has savagely attacked peaceful marches. The scattered opposition is now trying to unite around a single platform. It must at all costs avoid responding to the government's provocations, since the al-Assad regime hopes to see the opposition engulfed in turn by internal violence. But time seems to be on the side of al-Assad's adversaries: even his most faithful supporters, both within the country and outside, are beginning to have doubts about the dictator's ultra hard-line strategy.

<p>This article explores practices of memorialization in post-conflict society, through the case study of the James McCurrie Robert Neill Memorial Garden, located in East Belfast, which has been vandalized on a number of occasions. It notes the similarities between these attacks and J. Edkins' theorization of resistance at the sites of state memory. In the context of Northern Ireland, however, such resistance serves only to replicate patterns of division, as they seek to re-assert competing historical claims obscured by the memorial. The article therefore turns to the work of J. Derrida in order to employ a deconstructive “double reading” of the memorial, which avoids the trap of treating the past as something that can be instrumentally utilized in the present.

This article argues that within the context of the current economic crisis, there has been a shift from market-talk that displaces human agency to an active naming and production of blameworthy subjects. This serves a political and ideological function by focusing attention on individuals and groups and away from a confrontation with the normative and systemic violence of capitalism itself. By attending to the multiple corollary discourses of responsibility through which the economic crisis is framed, this article interrogates the ways in which responsibility renders political moments intelligible through ascriptions of blame and accountability that both structure how economic crisis is perceived and delimit possible responses to economic events.

<p>Like other former socialist republics, Ukraine has started its nation-building project trying to balance between a limitation of centrifugal forces and the “nationalization” of the state. This article examines the main features of language policies within the Ukrainian nation-building project and adopts a dual approach. It first surveys the political will that has been incarnated in language policies since 1991, and how national identity has been affected by those policies. However, it counterpoises this approach with an analysis of bottom actors and their attitude towards language policies. The framework questions the idea that nation-building is mainly an elite-driven process and suggests that common people can participate in a political project by renegotiating its features at the local level.

<p>The announcement of the allied forces' future withdrawal from Afghanistan leads us to envisage a new stabilization system.

<p>Feudal law emerged in Hungary from compromises that bridged the country's political and confessional divisions.

<p>The author identifies three key factors: the resurgence of the Taliban, the leadership of President H. Karzai and the regional context. The war in Iraq was a costly distraction and it was a mistake to focus nation-building on elections rather than on the strengthening of proper institutions. Economic development, especially agriculture, has not received sufficient attention, with the result that drug production has increased. But there is an increasing recognition that there needs to be some form of conversation with the Taliban. They are now a more sophisticated military organization, but still an extremely unsophisticated social and political entity. They do not have the answers to Afghanistan's problems. There are many other groups with a stake in the future of the country so any comprehensive negotiation will be very complicated. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>This article revisits the so-called “greed theory” of civil war, which is one of the most influential theories of civil war, adopted in recent years by many scholars and policy-makers around the world. Applying the greed theory to the sixteen cases of African countries involved in civil wars during the post-Cold War period (1989–2006), the article assesses how well these cases fit into the theory's argument and policy recommendations. As a result, the article argues that the greed theory does not provide a good explanation of the outbreak of civil wars in these countries, nor does it provide good policy recommendations that would help resolve and prevent most of these civil wars.

<p>Terrorists disengage from the groups or organizations to which they belong as a result of structural, organizational, or personal factors. These types of factors seem to operate with relative mutual independence. All this can be analytically induced from research conducted at an individual level of analysis, based on 35 long interviews with former members of ETA who voluntarily concluded their militancy at some point between 1970 and 2000. Until the mid-1980s, the individual decision to leave ETA tended to be linked to a subjective perception of ongoing political and social changes. From then on, disagreement with the internal functioning of the ethno-nationalist terrorist organization or the tactics adopted by its leaders became more salient motivations for those militants who decided to walk away.

<p>Since the election of the first <italic>Parti Québécois</italic> government in 1976, support for secession in the province of Quebec has demonstrated a surprising capacity to maintain itself, despite two lost referenda. Despite numerous attempts to explain such persistence, no definitive consensus has been reached. We propose a model that gives a primary role to governing parties at the provincial and federal levels. Certain parties generate fear while others produce disappointment. The interaction between the two and the fact that parties have tended to alternate in power in the last 35 years leads to a relative stability in public opinion, as these effects cancel each other out.

<p>The Justice and Development Party's (AKP) victory in the June 2011 parliamentary elections confirms the domination of Recep Tayyip Erdogan's party over Turkey's political scene. During the past few years, Turkey has been increasingly active on the international scene, especially regarding the conflict between Israel and Palestine, the negotiations over Iran's nuclear program and the Arab Spring. Meanwhile, neutrality has always been an important element of the state's diplomacy. Recep T. Erdogan's government will have to clarify its position and choose between continuing the “zero problem with its neighbors” policy and assuming the responsibility of a more active and polarized stand. From this perspective, Turkey may take advantage of its good reputation among the region's population.</p>

<p>Critics decry the 2005 peace agreement between the government of the Sudan and the Sudan People's Liberation Movement as incomplete, a result of the desire of external actors for a quick solution that is neither truly comprehensive nor sustainable. Through a chronological analysis of the peace process between 2000 and 2005, this article demonstrates that the scope for compromise was limited and that a significantly “better” deal was unlikely. The article presents a concise and empirically grounded analysis of the peace process, to lay foundations for further investigation of a crucial, contested and complicated subject in Sudan's recent history.

<p>The economies of the emergent countries demand a fresh examination, that will make it possible to question the approaches of comparative economic development and of comparative industrial policy. The central aim of this article relates to industrial policies and their regulatory systems. These questions throw light on capitalism and in particular on the political economy of the Indian capitalist system and, in the case of China, on what is called imprecisely “state capitalism”. The author suggests that a new look at these political economies is necessary. Three arguments in particular provide the thematic structure of the article. In both countries, industrial policies have grown out of – and continue to grow out of – a system of embedding the economy in the political and the social. A corollary is that the economic choices relating to the entry of these two countries into globalization were not the consequences of domestic mobilization of actors benefiting from globalization: they were the results of public choices.

<p>Decentralization advances patronage politics in distinct ways. (1) In decentralized states both central and local politicians distribute patronage to enhance their political support. (2) Local elections reveal information to central leaders about the geographic distribution of electorally salient voters. Central leaders can use this information to target particularistic benefits to these voters. (3) Elected local politicians have individual strategies to distribute patronage, despite or in addition to the clientelistic strategies of the political parties they represent. Evidence from India indicates that decentralization has contributed to more extensive distribution of patronage in decentralized states. Data from Indian states and villages illustrates the incentives at the state and local levels that shape the distribution of patronage. [R]</p>

<p>In Syria, the threat over Bashar al-Assad's regime may undermine the balance of powers in the whole region. This generates great concerns within the Middle East as well as the international community. Until now, Syria has been the cornerstone of the relations between Iran, Lebanon and the militias Hezbollah (Shiite) and Hamas (Sunnite). Iran could lose a close ally as well as its exclusive ties with both militias, which may acquire more autonomy, with significant consequences regarding current issues such as the conflict between Israel and Palestine. In this context, Israel, the US and the European Union remain very cautious, as the fall of the current regime could have unpredictable and heavy consequences, especially regarding the struggle for power between the Shiites and the Sunnites.</p>

As few theories exist to explain the causes of religious discrimination, this study compares theories related to general religion-state relations based on ideology, culture, and rational choice. We find that while political and structural factors are important in explaining variation in levels of discrimination across Muslim countries, ideational factors may help to explain why certain minority groups appear to be targeted more than others within individual countries.

<p>Authoritarian rule in the Arab world has been seriously undermined by the mass protests that swept across the region during the 2011 Arab spring.

Using Morocco as a case study, this article argues that the protesters' demands were compatible with the image of the Moroccan monarch as a liberal reformer. Consequently, the King could absorb the energy of the protests and the Arab spring and pursue a reformist course that undermined the protesters' democratization demands and strengthened his own position.

<p>Official negotiations between parties in ethno-national conflicts too often result in a deadlock. In such cases, the initial consent of opposing parties to sit together at the negotiating table is considered, retrospectively, to be merely a technical and ultimately futile achievement. The numerous failures of negotiations in such conflicts highlight the importance of studying the relationship between the pre-negotiation process, which initially brings the parties to the negotiating table, and the results of subsequent formal negotiations, especially in view of the basic premise of the conflict-resolution field's “process school,” that is, that effective execution of pre-negotiation functions is critical for successful negotiations. This article examines the pre-negotiation phase in two recent cases: the dispute over Cyprus in 2004 and the “Annapolis process” of 2007–2008. [R]</p>

<p>This article examines the ways in which young Canadians represent the “the War on Terror” in their narratives. I explore how a hegemonic nationalist narrative enters into this representation in different ways and positions itself in a dynamic tension with the US, at times eliding the difference and at times affirming it. I illustrate that these students do not simply tell the narrative of the war, but use the deixis of “we/us/our” or “them/they/their” in a way that constructs multiple imagined communities. I argue that these presumably benign representations of Canadian involvement in the war produce banal nationalism that excludes “others,” and binds human imagination into a framework that works against critical thinking.

We provisionally agree with Lee's conclusion, but we diverge in our reasoning for upholding this hypothesis.

<p>This article provides a critical overview of public policy and practice towards the Romani population in Italy over a period of fifty years. It investigates the uses and consequences of the label “nomads” and widespread essentialist assumptions about their alleged nomadic lifestyle, and the ambiguity embedded in policy which claims to solve the “Gypsy problem”. It explores in particular the ways in which recent political debate and policy initiatives have succeeded in reframing the Roma issue exclusively in terms of emergency and public security. This discursive shift has produced the rescaling of the governance of Roma, relocating the responsibility for managing the Romani people from local authorities to central government, transferring the Roma issue from the social policy agenda to a mere policing one.

<p>Georgia is the most democratic country in the Caucasus, but arguably its democratization has also been riddled by Huntingtonian developmental crises, resulting in ethnic conflicts and civil wars. We argue that variation in the type of political instability is best understood by focusing on the interaction between nationalism and political institutionalization rather than on their independent effects. We show that Gamsakhurdia's “state-breaking nationalism,” coupled with political deinstitutionalization, produced separatist and centrist civil wars. When Saakashvili's “state-making nationalism” enhanced state capacity, it marginalized the opposition and rekindled frozen separatist conflicts, but stronger administrative institutions enabled the government to avert another revolutionary regime change.

<p>This article examines basic patterns of Africa's demography and urbanization and examines the consequences of runaway population growth since the mid-20th c. for Africa's economies, educational systems, urban planning, public health, transport sectors, and other domains. The nexus between population age-structure and the likelihood of civil strife is discussed, with a reference to the “child soldier phenomenon” south of the Sahara. The youth crisis in Africa, as elsewhere, is not merely the upshot of a very young age pyramid, but more importantly, the upshot of the failure of capacious young cohorts to “accomplish” adulthood.

<p>Viewing broad middle class economic losses from the Great Recession as an accident leads many to imagine that a return to pre-recession policies and practices will restore this group's economic prosperity. Another perspective views these losses as part of a larger pattern of economic and political disenfranchisement directed toward the American middle class. To the extent that those who benefit from an event might be recognized as having a hand in its creation, insight into the values and beliefs held by this recession's beneficiaries may prove useful in designing policy changes needed to stem or reverse the continued enactment of these wider goals. Using responses to an original survey administered to faculty at major research universities across the US in 2008–2009, certain values and beliefs held by academics across many departments and disciplines may be observed.

<p>This article critically scrutinizes some of the key assumptions of the radical globalization approach, specifically, that China represents another form of the “competition state” whose development aspirations have been radically constrained by global “new constitutionalism” and American monetary power so as to conform to neoliberalism. Deploying a structurationist approach to global governance and an eclectic/regulatory analysis of the Chinese state, I argue that China has challenged neoliberalism by projecting its growing power through constitutionalized global governance. In the face of (declining) American power, global constitutionalism has provided an opportunity structure that may help China consolidate its long-term strategy of consensual development. Far from anchoring “neoliberal hegemony,” global economic governance is increasingly central to its unraveling. [R, abr.]</p>

Through the application of routinized charisma, Stalin's attempts at legitimization are not only better understood, but also present further avenues for exploring non-democratic legitimation techniques through the use of modern media.

<p>Italian political and public debate since the “earthquake years” 1992–1994 has to a very high degree focused on the country's identity, on the notion of “nation” and how to interpret it, and on the country's historical past and how to link it meaningfully to the (political) present. [However,] the crisis of the party political system in the 1990s also gave a new role to play for Italian Presidents at both the institutional and symbolic levels. In particular, this article argues that a fundamental change took place in the bespeaking of the Italian nation during the presidency of C. Azeglio Ciampi, 1999–2006. This article analyzes this new nationalist discourse as it developed through Ciampi's seven years as President of the Italian Republic. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>This article assesses Egypt's chances of democratization. A parallel is drawn between the processes of civil society mobilization that led to the overthrow of the authoritarian regimes of Z. Videnov in Bulgaria and H. Mubarak in Egypt. In the latter case, democratic, secular civil society has to compete with the larger, better organized and more efficient Islamic civil society. The internal dynamics of the Muslim Brotherhood, secular civil society, Egyptian military and international factors will probably moderate Islamist trends. However, this moderation does not necessarily imply genuine democratization. More likely, the future Egyptian regime will be a hybrid one accommodating both Islamist and democratic systems of values within a relatively stable and balanced political construct.</p>

<p>62.2766 UN Kheang – <bold>Cambodia: moving away from democracy?</bold> <italic>International Political Science Review</italic> 32(5), Nov. 2011: 546–562. [Résumé en français]</p>
<p>This article examines the quality of democracy in Cambodia, arguing that Cambodian democracy since its inception in 1993 has evolved from unstructured competitive authoritarianism toward an authoritarianism characterized by the presence of a stable hegemonic party system wherein the minimum criteria for democracy have been severely curtailed. Although the quality of democracy has declined, the regime's legitimacy has risen, due mainly to sustained economic growth and political stability, and increased patronage-based development. Economic performance-based legitimacy has become path-dependent; without growth the ruling party's legitimacy might be called into question. Given the current political, social, economic and international contexts that favor economic growth with political stability, Cambodia will sustain a dominant party authoritarian regime with limited quality of democracy.

<p>Hungarian memory culture is in turmoil. For more than a decade, a reinterpretation of the past has been taking place. Right-wing extremists play an awkward role in this process. The ruling party, <italic>Fidesz,</italic> inadequately sets itself apart from this view of history. Unconsidered traditions and concepts such as the bird Turul, the Árpád stripes, and Greater Hungary have become national symbols. While Nobel Prize winner I. Kertész is ignored by the official media or disparaged, the politicians in power make respectable “role models” such as writer A. Was, who would have to be considered intolerable in a democratic constitutional state. In history policy, a creeping radicalization is to be observed. [R] [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 62.2731]</p>

<p>The current political atmosphere in Hungary cannot be understood without looking at its past. Here lie the roots of the authoritarian, nationalist, and clerical thinking of the ruling elite. It picks up on the right-wing traditions, values, and practices of the interwar period, which were never dealt with. Socialism prevented this through a lack of public discussion. Instead, it intensified political thinking in categories of friend or foe. Hungary is now paying the price for the risks of freedom without the experience of freedom. Prime Minister V. Orbán and his <italic>Fidesz</italic> party are mobilizing the tendency to political hysteria and resentment present in large parts of the population to build an illiberal system.

<p>According to many observers' unanimous prognosis, Europe's non-European minorities (Muslim in particular) will continue to expand. The growing number of immigrants is nevertheless not the only factor influencing Europe's evolving multicultural nature. The change is not only quantitative, but also qualitative since Europe's cultural profile has been considerably transformed depending on the extent of immigrants' integration. Over the last decade, anti-Western sentiments and support for radical Islamist ideas have been spreading ever more widely among the young Muslim population. Foreign minorities have in turn contributed to the crystallizing of native Europeans' sense of identity. The growing pessimism regarding the benefits of preserving immigrants' cultural difference and the political polarization of European society will imminently lead to sociocultural conflicts.</p>

<p>On 9 July 2011, the Republic of South Sudan became an independent country. Independence was a jewel in the crown of the Sudanese Comprehensive Peace Agreement's long implementation process. Signed in January 2005, the peace agreement ended two long periods of civil war that raged between 1955–1972 and 1983–2005. These wars were characterized not only by confrontations between northern and southern Sudanese, but also by repeated clashes between different southern factions. These wars were rich with outside interference – especially from neighboring countries. [R]</p>

<p>This paper examines the emergence and implications of local resistance against the practice of liberal peace-building in post-conflict Kosovo, as pursued by the international community and local authorities. Exploring the prospects and limitations of local resistance, as articulated through social movements and institutionalized forms of politics, enables us to examine the applicability and potential implications of post-liberal and emancipatory peace, approaches recently propagated by critical approaches to peace-building. Drawing on an original analysis of the discourse and affirmative action of local resistance against the international governance of Kosovo, this paper argues that different types of local resistance articulate a thin line between ethical, emancipatory and exclusionary practices.

<p>62.2772 WEIDMANN, Nils B. – <bold>Violence “from above” or “from below”? The role of ethnicity in Bosnia's civil war.</bold> <italic>Journal of Politics</italic> 73(4), Oct. 2011: 1178–1190.</p>
<p>The literature is divided as to how ethnicity affects wartime patterns of violence in civil wars. This article conducts an assessment of the relative impact of two competing explanations for violence in Bosnia's civil war. One account of this conflict attributes violence to the intentions of ethnic groups to create ethnically homogeneous territories, thus advocating a macroterritorial explanation where the origin of violence is external to the locations it is perpetrated at. Competing theories, however, describe violence in Bosnia as a result of local ethnic resentment and fear that were activated once the war had started. Results from spatial regression provide evidence for violence “from above” and “from below,” showing that there is evidence for both macro- and micro-effects of ethnicity on violence. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>Since the reforms of the late 1970s, grassroots democracy in China has undergone development along different dimensions, namely from the countryside to the city, from grassroots society to grassroots government, from outside of the ruling party to inner-party democracy, and from democratic election to democratic governance. This development has its roots in the macro-reform decisions made by the central government, the possibilities of developing democracy out of China's political system, and also the growing grassroots political awareness and participation. China is a huge country of long history of centralized feudal-autocratic rule. The promotion of democratic politics and the implementation of democratic elections, therefore, require further development in the necessary social conditions. A consensus on the values of democracy and rule of law is yet to be formed, putting grassroots democracy at risks. [R, abr.] [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 62.2776]</p>

<p>The Good Friday Agreement (GFA) attempted to create a workable political framework for managing the conflict in Northern Ireland in a democratic institutional setting. The institutions of the new governing system provided little incentive for politicians to transcend sectarian differences. Since the signing and ratification of this agreement we have witnessed the political success of the more extreme parties at the expense of the moderate parties that were critical to negotiating the GFA. The consociational nature of the institutions of the Stormont government has provided a framework where elites representing different communities could bargain and effectively share power in Northern Ireland. However, the lack of a civil society that transcends the sectarian divide with grassroots reconciliation means that elites have little motivation to make the compromises associated with a functioning democratic political framework for Northern Ireland.

<p>In recent years, Northern Ireland has been presented as a model for the resolution of violent conflicts in deeply divided societies. However, discussion of the “peace process” has occluded scrutiny of the governance arrangements arising, and whether these promote reconciliation across sectarian lines or even make for workable government. Close assessment, against the precedent of the power-sharing experiment of 1974 and efforts to establish power-sharing in Bosnia-Herzegovina and Macedonia after nationalistic conflicts there, suggests that neither of these desiderata is being realized. More flexible power-sharing arrangements are necessary if Northern Ireland is to move beyond its sectarian division to become a more normal society. [R] [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 62.2050]</p>

<p>There are important differences in situation and political development between China and Vietnam, but both are so distant from the parliamentary model that to political science they appear quite similar. They are the sturdy party-state survivors in a post-communist world. China and Vietnam pose a reciprocal challenge to common expectations regarding modernization. On the one hand, their economic growth and political stability undermine notions of stages of development converging (unless the state stalls or fails) in a liberal democratic “end of history”. Despite international openness, the importance of market forces, and a convergence of practical tasks of governance with other developing and developed states, the Sino-Vietnamese model is distinct in its origins, its experiences, and political structure.

<p>Many Western commentators vacillate between contradictory conceptions of the implications of China's rise – the “China Collapse Theory” and the “China Threat Theory”. China faces numerous economic problems, including mounting inflation and the danger of a property bubble. But these problems are being addressed. The Chinese economy has shown itself to be extremely resilient. Strategy and commitment underlie its successful approach. The threat theory is equally off the mark. China is not an expansionist power; its priority remains to boost economic growth and raise living standards; and it is committed to being a good international citizen, as reflected in its striking contribution to UN peacekeeping.

<p>This paper evaluates the Tibet question through the looking glass of Taiwan, by considering four dimensions of comparative dynamics between the two cases of Taiwan and the Tibetan government-in-exile (TGIE) in relation to China: territorial, economic, ethnic and cultural. Of the four, Taiwan has high convergence with China in the economic, ethnic and cultural dimensions, and managed divergence in the territorial dimension. The TGIE, on the other hand, has high divergence with China in all four dimensions: territorial dispute, economic incongruence, ethnic estrangement, and cultural gulf. Further, the TGIE is ideologically and sentimentally charged by this divergence and thrives by exploiting it. It therefore should have few incentives to see the lessons of Taiwan applied in resolving the Tibet question. [R] [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 62.2431]</p>

<p>A debate, fanned by the experiences of South Korea and Taiwan, persists over how economic growth leads to democratization. This article provides a theoretical model showing that economic downturns lead to democratization and evaluates the conclusion systematically with data from South Korea and Taiwan. The model and results corroborate the hypothesis that economic downturns motivate government and nongovernment actors to pursue political reforms and democratization and highlight several contributions. They show democratization as the outcome of strategic responses pursued under weak economic conditions. Further, the findings are robust to alternative specifications of democratization. The results also bring empirics into line with theoretical expectations about democratization while simultaneously revealing that it is not a panacea for lack of support. [R]</p>

<p>This study examines the limitations of the major characteristics of [South] Korean multiculturalism according to the type of beneficiary categorization, and discusses its development schemes by revisiting the multiculturalism policies currently in place, which are designed for social integration. The implementation of Korea's integral policies for immigrants, including the Overseas Compatriot Law, promulgated to make up for these policies' limitations, requires the identification of the immigrants' status quo and the recognition or acceptance of their respective cultures, considering their diversification and settlements. As regards the hierarchical dimension of Korea's policies on multiculturalism, with focus on marriage immigrants, changes in the country's beneficiary-oriented structural recognition and related policies must be instituted to [help] establish a multicultural Korean society and a capacity [to] accept cultural diversification.

<p>The system of functional representation constitutes the greatest challenge to political reform in Hong Kong. Utilizing recent developments in institutional and ideational theories in political science, this article explores how both power and ideas shape the politics of reforming functional representation. The impasse generated by the current balance of power has given rise to a plethora of ideas that seek to reform the system while preserving its place in the political process. However, recent direct negotiations between Beijing and moderate democrats in Hong Kong have triggered a significant political realignment. This shift in the political balance of power has generated new scenarios for the reform of functional representation. [R]</p>

<p>The impressive spread of Internet use in China has led to the rapid emergence of a cyber society, which in turn affects public policy agenda-setting in China, promoting political participation in the policy-making processes in areas acceptable to the Chinese authorities. This article uses the <italic>Gandan Xiangzhao</italic> as a case study to investigate its impact on public policy agenda-building. The case study shows that the development of the Internet not only serves as an instrument facilitating participation in the public policy agenda-building process, potentially it also embodies the spirit of consultation, at least when it is not perceived as a threat to the party regime. This development articulates the demand for the democratization of agenda-building in China, and to a limited extent public participation has been realized in implementation. [R]</p>
