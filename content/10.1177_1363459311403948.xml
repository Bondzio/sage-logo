<abstract>
<p>It is anticipated that a colorectal cancer (CRC) screening programme will be introduced in New Zealand making it the first screening programme in this country to include both males and females. In-depth interviews were carried out with 80 participants (53 females and 27 males) about their knowledge and attitudes to screening programmes in general, as well as their understanding and perceptions of CRC screening in particular. The study highlighted the perceived marginalization of men’s health with a sense that women had advocated for, and therefore monopolized, screening while men’s health had been left unattended. There were also perceptions of women’s responsibility for ensuring men’s access to health services. There are arguments that such perceptions disempower or ‘infantalize’ men which have no long term benefits. While health is perceived as being a feminine matter, it may be difficult to encourage men to engage in preventative behaviours, such as taking up the offer of screening. This article also highlights the heterogeneity of men, where different performances of masculinities were presented. A stereotypical ‘staunch’ or ‘macho image’ discourse was evident in some of the interviews where much emphasis was on maintaining and controlling bodily boundaries. Letting the barrier of embodied ‘staunchness’ down to access health services is a threat to identity. What is required for successful implementation of the CRC screening programme is a normalization of men’s health help-seeking, taking into account the fact that men are not homogenous. Studies in relation to men’s health need to attend to cultural diversity which is likely to present a challenge to individualism. Critical studies of men would be enhanced by more engagement with the work of black male scholars.</p>

<p>If there is such a thing as a ‘popular’ cancer – bowel cancer is not it. The profile of colorectal cancer (CRC) is low. CRC is the most common registered cancer in New Zealand (NZ) and, although age-standardized mortality rates declined somewhat between 1995 and 2005, it remains the second most common cause of cancer death, both overall and for males and females, separately (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1363459311403948">Ministry of Health, 2009</xref>). There are also ethnic differences, with both male and female age-standardized registration rates for Māori, the indigenous peoples of NZ, substantially lower than for non-Māori. There is little difference in mortality rates for males whereas, among females, the Māori rate was somewhat lower, indicating that survival is poorer among Māori, particularly for males. There is also variation by socio-economic status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1363459311403948">Shaw et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>CRC is potentially treatable if diagnosed early and a number of countries have introduced screening programmes to facilitate this early diagnosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1363459311403948">Shaw et al., 2008</xref>). New Zealand is in the process of planning for a screening programme which will be likely to consist of faecal occult blood testing (FOBT), followed by colonoscopy. The proposed programme would be the first formal NZ screening programme to include both males and females. Engaging men in CRC screening may involve particular challenges.</p>
<p>Internationally, concern is expressed about the state of men’s health and their use of health services. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1363459311403948">Courtenay (2009</xref>: 10) writing in the US context and drawing from a US Department of Health and Human Services (1998) report, says that, regardless of income or ethnicity, men are less likely than women to have had contact with a physician even accounting for reproductive health care visits (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1363459311403948">Sandman et al., 2000</xref>). However, this may simply indicate existing good health. Gendered mortality patterns that impact on men due to non-gender specific cancers are reported for the UK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1363459311403948">White et al., 2009</xref>), as are differences in early detection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1363459311403948">Evans et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1363459311403948">Payne, 2007a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1363459311403948">2007b</xref>). These articles tend to describe the issues, but do not help us understand why this situation might arise.</p>
<p>Among groups concerned with men’s health, the impetus is now from description to action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1363459311403948">Cohen, 2009</xref>). In NZ, the Ministry of Health is encouraging men to ‘be more aware of their health and to access healthcare’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1363459311403948">Ministry of Health, n.d.</xref>). The Cancer Society of New Zealand (CSNZ) similarly provides resources, and works to raise awareness of prostate cancer and depression in particular (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1363459311403948">Cancer Society, n.d.</xref>). Social researchers have analysed gender and health (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1363459311403948">Courtenay, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1363459311403948">2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1363459311403948">2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1363459311403948">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1363459311403948">Emslie and Hunt, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1363459311403948">O’Brien et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1363459311403948">Robertson, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1363459311403948">2006</xref>; special issue of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1363459311403948"><italic>Critical Public Health</italic>, 2009</xref>, vol. 19, nos 3–4), but there is a dearth of work discussing gender and CRC. A Massachusetts study found, for example, that women were <italic>less</italic> likely than men to take up CRC screening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1363459311403948">Brawarsky et al., 2003</xref>) and, in a large (<italic>N</italic> = 52,886) US-wide survey, morbidly obese women were less likely to be screened than their male counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1363459311403948">Rosen and Schneider, 2004</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1363459311403948">Friedman-Sánchez et al. (2007)</xref> suggest, following focus group research, that barriers to screening may be gender specific, with women viewing the preparation for endoscopy more negatively than men, and women perceiving CRC to be more prevalent in men and, therefore, they feel less vulnerable. In contrast, the participants in the research reported here, both men and women, perceived that NZ men were less likely than women to take up screening. It is this apparent discrepancy that we are interested in teasing apart.</p>
<p>This research project sought to explore broadly attitudes to screening in general and CRC screening in particular. A range of barriers and facilitating factors surrounding the uptake of colorectal cancer screening were reported by the participants. These findings confirmed those reported for other populations in the international literature, but, somewhat unexpectedly, gender emerged as a key theme, with both men and women indicating that men might be more difficult to target and recruit. We argue that the issues of gender in general, and masculinities in particular, have been under-explored in relation to CRC screening. Bringing the social research literature on masculinity to bear on CRC and CRC screening provides essential depth to understanding this state of affairs. Addressing this gap also has the potential to avoid inappropriately constructed promotion of the screening programme, to contribute to the refocusing of programmes that are currently experiencing sub-optimal response rates, to improve knowledge about how men understand health and also how and why they do or do not engage in health seeking behaviours. It also contributes to the growing concern about men’s health in general. Thus, we investigate the ways in which the low profile of colorectal cancer, processes of screening and masculinity (or, more appropriately, masculinities) intersect.</p>
<sec id="section1-1363459311403948">
<title>Theorizing masculinities</title>
<p>Men are argued to engage in less ‘health seeking’ than women, to engage in more ‘unhealthy’ behaviours and have a shorter life expectancy, in many parts of the world at least (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1363459311403948">Galdas, 2009</xref>). Why men engage in more risky behaviours is unclear and the lack of attention to their shorter lifespan suggests that it is seen as inevitable and unchangeable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1363459311403948">Courtenay, 2000</xref>: 1387), with men’s poor health status becoming invisible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1363459311403948">Annandale and Clarke, 1996</xref>). Although men have been the subject of much health research, how men manage their own health has only been a subject of academic debate relatively recently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1363459311403948">Connell, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1363459311403948">Courtenay, 2000</xref>). Of key importance is the way that masculinity tends to be defined in ways that marginalize behaviours and beliefs that might contribute positively to health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1363459311403948">Courtenay, 2000</xref>). Assumptions about the structural efficiency of men’s bodies when compared to women’s bodies, bodily invulnerability, the admiration of ‘powerful’ men who see health and safety as irrelevant and ideas that health help seeking is a feminine activity, are all examples of this discord between concepts of masculinity and health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1363459311403948">Courtenay, 2000</xref>: 1389).</p>
<p>The study of men’s health falls into two broad groupings. The first is the study of inequalities in health which has described inequalities by gender, but does not address the socio-cultural issues that may help to provide a deeper understanding of these inequalities. The second is the field of men’s health studies which is socio-culturally focused and draws on a conceptual framework from men and masculinities studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1363459311403948">Lohan, 2007</xref>). Within this second group, there is a fundamental division created by the different ontological commitments on which the two sub-groups – ‘men’s studies’ and ‘critical studies on men’ – draw (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1363459311403948">Hearn, 2004</xref>). It is important to spell out the different commitments of each of these approaches, as the differences have implications for how we come to think about masculinity and health.</p>
<p>The men’s studies position is a response to a perceived crisis of masculinity which disadvantages men and is prompted by the shifting position of women in both the public and private spheres. Perhaps the most well-known example of an author writing in this vein is <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1363459311403948">Robert Bly (1990)</xref> <italic>Iron John: A Book about Men</italic>. This approach seeks to reinforce traditional, static and essentialist understandings of masculinity, an approach that has strong similarities with forms of gynocentric feminism in the 1970s and 1980s. This approach also sets femininity up in opposition to masculinity. Men’s studies is very limited in its application as an aid to understanding since it relies upon very limited notions of what it is to be a man in the contemporary world, as well as relying on nostalgic suppositions about ‘when times were better for men’. One of the biggest shifts in gender identities during the 20th century has been a proliferation of ways to enact both masculine and feminine identities that have released some groups more than others from constraining ‘acceptable’ roles. Men’s studies works with a notion of a ‘natural’ masculinity, a commitment that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1363459311403948">Connell (2005</xref>: 47) challenges. He says that the idea of a natural masculinity, which has come from socio-biology, is not at all convincing. The presupposition that men and women are radically different is misleading, with variation between the sexes, being less than that within each sex across intellect, temperament and personal traits. It is in terms of social positioning that the differences tend to be starker.</p>
<p>Critical studies on men have more utility for the issues that are discussed in our data. Influenced by feminist, gay and queer theorizing, the three core principles of this approach are the socially constructed nature of gender, problematizing hegemonic masculinity and investigating gender power relations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1363459311403948">Lohan, 2007</xref>). The work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1363459311403948">Judith Butler (1990)</xref> is useful in analysing the ways that masculinity and femininity are ‘performed’ rather than inherent states of being. This performative understanding is evident for <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1363459311403948">Saltonstall (1993</xref>: 12) who concludes that ‘the doing of health is a form of doing gender’ in so far as decisions that men and women take to be healthy are influenced by understandings of what constitutes appropriate masculine and feminine behaviour. Consistent with the concept of performativity, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1363459311403948">Courtenay (2000</xref>) speaks from and defends a social constructionist perspective on gender roles. The strength of this perspective lies in its insistence on the workings of both structure and agency, an approach also supported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1363459311403948">Hodgetts and Chamberlain (2002)</xref> as essential to trying to improve men’s health. From a social constructionist perspective, gender does not consist of two static categories, but rather is dynamic and relational. Most importantly, a social constructionist perspective sees men and boys as neither ‘passive victims of a socially prescribed role, nor are they simply conditioned or socialised by their cultures’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1363459311403948">Courtenay, 2000</xref>: 1387–1388). The key outcome of this approach is that it allows for the possibility of change – things need not remain as they are.</p>
<p>Within critical studies on men, masculinity is socially constructed and multiple. Discussions of multiple forms of masculinity have been dominated by the experiences, realities and voices of white, western (although not always heterosexual) men. There are some notable exceptions, see for example the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1363459311403948">Pease (2009)</xref> with migrant and refugee men and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1363459311403948">Oliffe et al. (2009)</xref> with South Asian men in Canada, but the intersection of race, ethnicity, masculinity and health has been underexplored in the critical literature.</p>

<title>Methodology and method</title>
<p>In qualitative terms, this is a large study with 110 members of the public (Māori and non-Māori), Māori and non-Māori General Practitioners (GPs) and Specialists (representing surgery, gastroenterology and medical oncology) being recruited. The study reported in this article is part of a larger project designed to develop a micro-simulation model of CRC in New Zealand. This article reports on the data generated from interviews with the non-medical interviewees; that is, 80 participants. Of this number 50 identified their ethnicity as New Zealand European/Pākehā<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1363459311403948">1</xref></sup> (29 female and 21 male) and were located in Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch. There were 30 participants of Māori ethnicity (24 female and six male) who were located in Christchurch, Wellington, Auckland and New Plymouth. All participants lived in urban areas. Māori participants were interviewed by a Māori interviewer. Participants were to be recruited via GP practices. This proved unworkable as the GPs were not prepared to assist in identifying patients with varying CRC risk levels (low, medium and high) for us to follow up. Participants were therefore, recruited in a variety of ways: all non-Māori via flyers posted on GP surgery notice boards, and some Māori participants likewise, but others through personal networks and some on the suggestion of a bowel cancer registry contact. Participants were given a $30 petrol voucher in recognition of the gift of their time. All transcript data included in this article are signified by their ethnicity (N-M = non-Māori; M = Māori) and participant number, gender and age. Non-Māori were recruited in the 50–70 year age range, but Māori were recruited in the 40–60 range, because of lower life expectancy.</p>
<p>In-depth interviewing by experienced interviewers was chosen as the most appropriate method to address the broad research questions as we were interested in gaining in-depth understandings of how people made sense of screening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1363459311403948">Hansen, 2006</xref>: 69). Interviews lasted between half an hour and one hour and a quarter and were digitally recorded and transcribed verbatim. The open-ended topic schedule contained four broad areas to allow participants to share their views rather than being constrained by set closed-ended questions. These broad topic areas were; knowledge of and attitudes to screening programmes; experiences and understanding of bowel cancer; impressions and experiences of the different types of screening procedures; as well as what might encourage their participation in a CRC programme. These topics were covered in each interview, but flexibility was preserved in order to follow unexpected and potentially valuable (in research terms) turns in the conversation. Ethical approval for the study was granted by the New Zealand Health and Disability Multi-Region Ethics Committee.</p>
<p>A thematic analysis was undertaken which is a method used to identify, analyse and report patterns in data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1363459311403948">Aronson, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1363459311403948">Braun and Clarke, 2006</xref>). Meaning is sought in the accounts and/or actions of participants, taking into account how the broader social and political context impinges on these meanings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1363459311403948">Braun and Clarke, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1363459311403948">Holloway and Todres, 2003</xref>). The transcripts were all read prior to the start of coding. The data collected were sorted into data sets, which are extracts from all the data divided into topics of particular analytical interest. The data in each data set were read and re-read and coded for features of specific interest. The coded segments of the transcripts were sorted into overarching themes and sub-themes and then refined. The themes that are discussed in this article are those of the invisibility of colorectal cancer, responsibility and participation and embodied staunchness.</p>

<title>(In)visibility</title>
<p>As indicated in the introduction to this article, compared with some other parts of the body, matters to do with the bowel appear to have a lower profile. For example, one of the Specialists interviewed noted: ‘You have a Breast Cancer Foundation, it’s always out there with pink ribbons, but you don’t have a Bowel Cancer Foundation out there with brown ribbons.’ This is consistent with prior NZ research that found that both men and women, but particularly women, ranked bowel cancer deaths as less numerous than their actual frequency in the gendered population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1363459311403948">Trevena and Reeder, 2007</xref>). An Australian report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1363459311403948">Riley, n.d</xref>), based on a survey of over 3700 Australians found that awareness of bowel cancer and its incidence did not coincide. The authors conclude that people based their knowledge of incidence on the amount that they heard about a particular cancer. The very low profile of bowel cancer is of fundamental importance; the bowel has an image problem:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>talking about bowel cancer, even though it’s important, it’s not quite as sexy as talking about other sorts of cancers. You know the pink ribbon campaign for breast cancer, I mean it’s fantastic that people are out there and wanting to support it, but it’s not quite as sexy talking about bowel cancer, because again everything down there is sort of, you know, it’s not quite so … (N-M. P 36. Female, 60 yrs)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The issue of taboo and the ‘unspeakableness’ of matters to do with ‘bottoms and bowels’ were well aired:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I think it’s a taboo subject. I think anything like bottoms and bowels and prostates, I do think it’s a bit of a taboo subject. (N-M. P23. Male, 60 yrs)</p>
<p>Bowels are shitty things, aren’t they, and you just sort of don’t talk about your shittiness. (N-M. P 27. Female, 57 yrs)</p>
<p>We don’t go to the pub and say, ‘Oh guess what, I think I might have bowel cancer. Oh guess what, mate, I haven’t shitten for two days.’ You know, we don’t talk, we don’t say those things. (M. P 29. Male, 45 yrs)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The low profile of CRC is likely to be a combination of lack of, or only sporadic, information, coupled with the notion above that this is something that ‘you just don’t talk about’. This buried positioning is extremely important to acknowledge and address given the prevalence of CRC. But, as well as a straightforward provision of information, the deep-seated beliefs regarding responsibility for matters to do with health reveal a complex picture that must be acknowledged when attempting to understand issues around CRC screening.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1363459311403948">
<title>Responsibility and participation</title>
<p>Both men and women engaged in discussions of ‘responsibility’ in relation to men’s potential participation in CRC screening, thus we include transcript data from both. These discourses of responsibility contained different understandings of masculine identity, including ‘victim’ and ‘staunch’. The notion of men as victims of social change, in keeping with the men’s studies approach, is evident in how men talked about the screening to which women have access. Women, they thought, had demanded screening programmes for cervical and breast cancer and had monopolized screening:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I just think that as guys, as guys, I mean the women, they stand up better than what the guys do. The guys don’t stand up because we’re macho when we shouldn’t be really. We should be doing, I mean there’s only this blue face [awareness raising campaign September 2009 for prostate cancer] thing that’s come now with prostate cancer. I mean that’s about 20 years behind, 30 years behind the women when they were saying, ‘We want checking for cervical cancer and we want checking for breast cancer.’ (N-M. P 29. Male, 71 yrs)</p>
<p>I know a lot of them are resentful about the women, you know, the women’s sort of health campaigns. The breast screening, you’ve only got to listen to talk-back radio and you’ll get them on the radio ringing up and complaining about, ‘Oh women have got breast screening’, and what have you, but get them off their arses to try and do something for themselves. All they’ve got to do is organize it, but they won’t do it. (N-M. P 36. Female, 60 yrs)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>As well as the idea that men were not proactive in insisting on screening, the perception of active marginalization was also evident:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I’ve never been part of anything, but I’ve always wondered why, when they do that, um and then you look at the figures that more males die of prostate cancer than in road crashes, there’s nothing whatsoever available for males. (N-M. P 44. Male, 56 yrs)</p>
<p>Well it’s interesting um because my awareness is that um more males are, there’s more deaths for males from testicular cancer than there is from cervical cancers as far as I’m aware. (M. P 21. Male, 41 yrs)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1363459311403948">2</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>We are less interested in the accuracy of the preceding statements, but more with how the argument is presented. Faith in the potential of screening for health gain is clear, as is the perception that introducing screening is simply a matter of lobbying and/or advocacy. The strength of biomedical evidence in support of screening for different types of cancer is not mentioned. This is consistent with an analysis of media coverage of prostate cancer screening in Australia which found that, in general, a wide range of newspapers and television news presented the prostate-specific antigen test (PSA) as a life-saving form of screening, while simultaneously framing epidemiological evidence as inferior to clinical experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1363459311403948">MacKenzie et al., 2007</xref>). There is a clear tension between perceptions of under-provision of cancer screening for men and the evidence about screening for particular cancers.</p>
<p>As well as the notion that men as victims are ‘missing out’, is the idea that women are somehow responsible for health in general and may act as agents of social control:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I suspect that women get men involved … I mean as much as we might think that the world’s changed, I don’t think it’s necessarily changed that much and I think that women still are the primary people in the home, who look after the kind of domestic regime. Now whether that’s what kind of food we eat, how much salt we take in, you know, how much sugar the kids have or, you know, or, you know, whether we exercise or, you know, I do think that perhaps women have more um are more consciously involved in that and therefore guide the men. (N-M. P 17. Male, 57 yrs)</p>
<p>Because with the breast screening thing that women do, and I’m pretty sure they’ll encourage their men folk to do it, and if they don’t they’ll get told off. (M. P 14. Male, 59 yrs)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Social control of men’s behaviour is evident in the notions of both guidance and potential censure of men’s behaviour in the above quotations. In terms of participation in screening, specifically, one of the participants suggested that men should be targeted differently if screening for CRC was introduced:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>P 45 You target men differently.</p>
<p>I  Oh differently … how do you think you could target men differently?</p>
<p>P 45 Maybe through women, through their wives. [Laugh] (N-M. P 45. Female, 65 yrs)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Targeting men through their wives assumes that men are partnered, that wives or partners are willing participants and also does not attend to the dynamics that may operate for homosexual couples. Continued reliance on women also reinforces the essentialized perception that there is something about masculinity that is antithetical to considering health matters personal concerns. Targeting men through their wives or partners also potentially infantilizes men. The devolving of responsibility for ‘health’ in general appears to be connected to how men understand their embodied identities.</p>

<title>Hegemonic masculinities: staunchness</title>
<p>Embodied selves were discussed by our participants as bounded, staunch and in some ways inviolable. For Māori men, masculinities and ethnicity intersected to produce even more complexly constructed identities. Having things ‘stripped away from us’ in the quotation below refers to what Māori have had to contend with under the process of colonization:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Well I suppose in a lot of cases (.) I mean, you know, like I’m educated and so I don’t really have an excuse, but um (.) I think, you know, it’s just, I think we’re, partly cause we’re kind of brought up to, you know, be staunch, and um (.) part of it’s just and, yeah, being pig-headed. Um (.) yeah, and you know, almost kind of like um (.) it’s like, you know (.) we’ve had all these other things stripped away from us, but, you know, we’re still going to be staunch as far as going to the doctor goes type of thing. I don’t know. And you know, it may not, it may, you know, may just come just being me and my sort of pig-headedness. Um I think for me I sort of, I pride myself to my detriment about not going to the, not having to go to the doctor in some ways. (M. P 30. Male, 43 yrs)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>For some men, there seemed to be an awareness of the self-defeating nature of some of the behaviours that they engaged in in relation to help seeking:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Um I was asked that question actually by the doctor, ‘Why are Māori guys like that?’ ‘Don’t really know to be honest,’ I said, ‘I don’t know, I wouldn’t have a clue.’ I guess we’re just so bloody staunch and think nothing will go wrong with us, even though it does … I mean, I’ve been trying to figure that one out for ages, and this is on everything health-wise. (M. P 14. Male, 59 yrs)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The above participant draws on notions of invincibility, which he seems to construct as a necessary fiction in spite of the evidence that things do go wrong, Māori men still hold on to the notion that nothing will go wrong and seeking help was seen as constituting ‘weakness’.</p>
<p>Avoiding weakness also involved preserving bodily boundaries and controlling how and when the body might be ‘invaded’ were evident:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>There was this guy that I met in the hospital … and he was a very staunch Māori male … and he said to me he needed to go and have a colonoscopy … and he said to me, ‘No, I’m not, no one’s going to touch me down there. No one’s going to shove things up my arse’, stuff like that. (M. P 18. Female, 54 yrs)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In the face of this dominant positioning of men as ‘staunch’ in the transcript data, masculinities were also reported as dynamic rather than static and some participants identified the beginnings of a process of change:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Well don’t get me started on that one. (Laugh) I don’t know, they’ve got this macho attitude, you know. I mean it’s men in general, but I think Māori men are worse, you know. They’re just too scared. I mean that’s even, that’s changing a wee bit, you know, all these metro sexual men. (M. P 18. Female, 54 yrs)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The above (female) participant points out that it is not only Māori men who have what she calls a ‘macho attitude’. Although non-Māori men did not use the word ‘staunch’, they talked of the ways in which they felt compelled to maintain bodily boundaries in very similar ways:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Guys don’t like to talk to each other about things like that. Women do, but guys don’t share their medical secrets with each other. They’re funny like that. You know, it’s the macho image coming through, a guy’s not going to tell you in the pub that he had a tube stuck up his bum, he had a night at the hospital. We’re like this, ‘Way hey,’ you know, sort of thing. It’s not something guys would discuss. I’m a bit different, I’m a bit different in that respect, but um I would probably fully discuss things like that with my brother and probably my best friend, but um yeah, if I went to the pub with the boys, I probably wouldn’t start talking about colonoscopies. I don’t think I’d be very popular. (N-M. P 7. Male, 53 yrs)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The above participant simultaneously identifies what he calls a ‘macho image’, part of which appears to be not being willing to admit to having had one’s bodily boundaries breached, while distancing himself to some extent from ‘macho’ behaviour which involves not discussing these procedures with anyone. Preserving bodily boundaries was also evident in the talk surrounding sexuality:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>But the other thing is women are better than men, I’m afraid, at dealing with these things. Men are um (.) I was going to say phobic, if you like. I was going to take it one step further and [say] … homophobic, if you like, because, you know, you’re talking about men’s bottoms and that sort of thing. Do you know what I mean? (N-M. P 23. Male, 60 yrs)</p>
<p>But you know, it constantly amazes me with blokes that they don’t mind packing down in a scrum and, you know, arms around blokes and, you know, heads in places that no woman would really want to ever go. But mention having, you know, a doctor for medical reasons, you know, check their prostate, and every man in the room’s a poof, you know. They just, they just can’t get over that. (N- M. P 36. Female, 60 yrs)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>‘<italic>Packing down in a scrum</italic>’ in the above quotation relates to the game of rugby and comments on the homosociality of the scrum, in which heads and bottoms are in close proximity.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>It is quite clear that in order to address the relative invisibility of CRC that appropriate information is required, but our other findings suggest that information alone is unlikely to prompt uptake of screening. Where responsibility for health resides and how men understand embodied selves is also likely to influence uptake. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1363459311403948">Courtenay (2000</xref>: 1395) argues that since women live longer than men, perhaps they should be the standard against which men’s health is judged, rather than the odd slippage that currently operates where women’s health related behaviours are often pathologized. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1363459311403948">Oakley’s (1994)</xref> work highlighted the ways that women were seen to be not really ill, but inventing ill health, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1363459311403948">Courtenay (2000</xref>) turns the tables by suggesting that perhaps we should think about the ways that men might be ill, but be denying it. This is a challenging reconceptualization. It would be unwise to attempt to turn the tables and pathologize men’s behaviour, but the continued infantilization of men is unlikely to be to their long term benefit.</p>
<p>Men and women, Māori and non-Māori engaged in discourses of gendered responsibility/irresponsibility surrounding care of health in general and uptake of screening in particular. If women assume responsibility for getting men to take up screening and men assume that this is women’s responsibility, then men continue to be cast as incompetent decision-makers, and women as, interestingly, powerful, although not always successful health police. Targeting heterosexual men through their partners may not be desirable as it infantilizes men and places an unfair burden on women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1363459311403948">Lyons and Willott, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1363459311403948">Robertson, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1363459311403948">Seymour-Smith and Wetherell, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>While it is hard to explain why it seems positive and not negative to be constructed as childlike (as an adult), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1363459311403948">Seymour-Smith and Wetherell (2002</xref>: 263) suggest that when men operate in ways which are counter to their good health, they are viewed tolerantly and humorously, while women are not similarly indulged. Men’s behaviours can be viewed in this way because of the already positive and hegemonic positioning of masculinity in relation to femininity. This has implications in the health care encounter, where practitioners may construct what is ‘most problematic for male patients [as] not “behaving like a typical man” but behaving “like a woman”’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1363459311403948">Seymour-Smith and Wetherell, 2002</xref>: 264). Maintaining a coherent masculine ‘health’ identity is even more complex when, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1363459311403948">Robertson (2003)</xref> argues, men are required to distance themselves from concern with health, which is seen as a feminine matter (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1363459311403948">Sloan et al., 2009</xref>), at the same time as they are exhorted to take care of their own health by engaging in preventive behaviours (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1363459311403948">Crawshaw, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1363459311403948">Lupton, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1363459311403948">Petersen and Lupton, 1996</xref>). This dual responsibility has been described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1363459311403948">Robertson (2003)</xref> as the ‘don’t care, should care’ dilemma or a balance between being sensible and silly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1363459311403948">Robertson, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1363459311403948">Mansfield and Addis (2003)</xref> advocate normalization of men’s health help seeking and they argue for broad-based strategies including the provision of information and appropriate services. There is not one service, method of providing information, intervention or stimulus that is likely to ‘work’ for all men. Even suggesting as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1363459311403948">Courtenay (2003</xref>: 19) does, that we need ‘culturally appropriate, gender-specific health promotion and disease prevention interventions … for men and boys’, is not enough. As Courtenay and others (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1363459311403948">Courtenay, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1363459311403948">2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1363459311403948">Gough, 2006</xref>) insist, the needs of various populations of men must be taken into account and, even then, we should not assume too quickly that, within these groups, needs are uniformly experienced. Both <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1363459311403948">Gough (2006)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1363459311403948">Lohan (2007)</xref> point to the need to look at the wider determinants of health, using both CSM as an explanatory framework as well as the literature on inequalities in health. Conventionally, health promotion has been more effective for middle class groups. Not paying attention to the inequalities literature in any potential intervention encouraging CRC screening has the potential to increase, rather than mitigate health inequalities.</p>
<p>Masculinities are cross-cut with other aspects of identity, one of which is ethnicity. Māori and non-Māori masculinities are best seen as co-present within the New Zealand context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1363459311403948">Matahaere-Atariki, 1999</xref>). Within these broad groupings there are multiple masculinities and other features of identity that interact relationally with ethnicity, but stereotypic representations remain that are important to discuss. Writing on masculinity and Māori men, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1363459311403948">Hokowhitu (2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1363459311403948">2008</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1363459311403948">Matahaere-Atariki (1999)</xref> both argue that the way that Māori masculinities have been represented perpetuates colonial mythology:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>In the nineteenth century Māori masculine physicality was, like untamed countryside, something to be conquered and civilized; in the twentieth century it was something to be harnessed to provide manual labor for New Zealand’s developing colonial nation; in the twenty-first century it has become a spectacle played out by the overachievement of <italic>tāne</italic> (Māori men) on the sports field. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1363459311403948">Hokowhitu, 2004</xref>: 259)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Sport has emerged as a significant component in defining masculinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1363459311403948">Connell, 2005</xref>: 54). This <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1363459311403948">Hokowhitu (2004</xref>: 276) says, has reinforced a dominant notion of Māori men as ‘inherently physical, staunch, hypermasculine, and violent’. Most of the meanings of staunchness relate to issues of containment, whether of emotions or fluids. The need to preserve bodily boundaries was also evident in the talk surrounding sexuality. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1363459311403948">Winterich et al. (2008</xref>: 300) in their study of men’s experiences of DREs (digital rectal examinations) and colonoscopic procedures found that penetration with the finger was perceived more negatively because it was associated with ‘a gay sexual act’. For some men colonoscopy, as a form of penetration, represented an ‘affront to their masculinity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1363459311403948">Winterich et al., 2008</xref>: 300). Given that colonoscopy is carried out in a highly controlled ‘medical’ environment, the strength of these feelings may be a little surprising, but could simply reflect a widespread, deeply entrenched and persistent heteronormativity (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1363459311403948">Town, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1363459311403948">Warner, 1993</xref>). But, if one of the few legitimated expressions of Māori masculinity has been embodied ‘staunchness’, then letting this barrier down to access health care may represent a threat to identity.</p>
<p>Part of Hokowhitu’s argument is that the previously mentioned versions of masculinity are extremely limited and he contests an essentialized understanding. Instead, he points to an early turn of the 19th-century photograph of <italic>tāne</italic> that shows them showing affection to each other and to the children in the photograph as evidence of other ways of reading Māori masculinity. Multiple Māori masculinities are also evident in the present in the form of playwrights, film-makers, artists, musicians, authors and figures in public, as well as domestic life. While this multiplicity of masculinities circulates, the stereotypical representations remain pervasive even though participants identified the beginnings of a transition.</p>
<p>Doing health and doing gender are part-time occupations that compete for space with all the other facets of our identities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1363459311403948">Fournier and Smith, 2006</xref>) such as ethnicity. While selling the idea of CRC screening to heterosexual men should not be seen as a responsibility of women alone, we need to pay very close attention to the critiques of hegemonic individualized western ways of thinking and intervening. ‘Mutual aid’ type strategies which involve men and women supporting each other in interdependence may resonate with some groups. For example, recent NZ television commercials that used men to promote breast cancer screening for women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1363459311403948">National Screening Unit, n.d.</xref>) as well as the initiative of a rural farm implement company that produced an item of pink farm machinery that was auctioned and the proceeds went to the breast cancer foundation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1363459311403948">Bishop, 2010</xref>). It is also important that men are not thought of as an homogenous group, but that they relate to a multiplicity of masculinities. Close attention to issues of bodily boundary breaking and invasion need to be carefully addressed so as to attempt to allay potential anxieties.</p>
<p>Our key argument is that we should be discussing hegemonies, rather than a singular hegemony. Different groups of men value and emulate different performances of masculinity. We do not believe that it is helpful to see these ‘other’ performances as simply reactive anti-hegemonies, instead we need to understand the different ways that men frame masculinity as agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1363459311403948">Wetherell and Edley, 1999</xref>) and how power plays a role in valuing (or not) these framings. Calls have been made for critical studies of men to engage with the health inequalities literature, but we go further than this and suggest that what is also needed is a ‘talking back’ to critical studies of men by indigenous men and other men of colour, a process that women of colour engaged in relation to feminist theory.</p>
