      <abstract>
        <p>This article is a study of political economy of Gujarat in the context of the issues
          pertaining to ‘good governance’. The article reviews Gujarat’s socio-economic development
          with respect to key indicators of environment, health, education and welfare programmes.
          It presents an argument that overall economic growth alone is not the adequate criterion
          for assessing good governance. Rather, broader issues of human development, reach and
          depth of welfare programmes and the approach informing the economic policy constitute the
          core bases for the assessment of a state’s claims to good governance. Gujarat, one of the
          states of the Indian union, is seen as a developed state that has made considerable
          progress in more recent times in the direction of good governance. This article seeks to
          critically examine this impression.</p>

    <p>The function of any government is to govern socio-economic affairs of society in its
      jurisdiction. Nature of its governance is closely related to (<italic>a</italic>) its mission
      and objective for preserving and/or developing nature of socio-economic and political order;
        (<italic>b</italic>) overall and sectoral policy formations, and (<italic>c</italic>)
        <italic>manner and modus operandi</italic> of management in executing policies. Overall
      policy postulates provide holistic perspective as well as approach of the government towards
      its priority for capital accumulation, distribution of resources, socio-cultural dimensions
      and role of the state therein. This is essentially a political task. Within this political
      framework, government prepares legislations for different sectors. Laws, rules and procedures
      follow. Next step is implementation of policy through macro as well as micro level
      management.</p>
    <p>A premise of neo-liberal political economy school is that markets are the best engine to lift
      living standards and build shared prosperity. What is needed is ‘good governance’ for
      sustainable development so as ‘all can enjoy long, healthy and creative lives’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-2321023013482788">UNDP, 2006</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-2321023013482788">2</xref></sup> ‘Good governance’ and democracy are intertwined.
      In this system citizens and groups articulate their interests, mediate their differences and
      exercise their legal rights and obligations. Transparency in decision making process and
      accountability of the government at all levels enhance legitimacy of the rulers. Participation
      of citizens and civil society actors in governance at different stages is sine qua non for
      efficient and effective implementation of the policies. While participating in governance the
      stakeholders can assert their priorities and make the programmes need-based as well as
      community culture specific. They monitor, supervise and check bureaucratization as well as
      mal-practices at various levels.</p>
    <p>This article is a study of nature of governance of one of the federal states of India,
      Gujarat. At the outset it needs to be emphasized that economic policies of the state
      government in India are largely circumscribed by the policies of the Government of India (GoI)
      under constitutional framework. Within this context, governance of different states in its
      cultural milieu, nature of civil society and politics needs examination. Gujarat has received
      several awards for ‘good governance’ from media and corporate foundations. It is now projected
      not only by the chief minister and his party but also a section of media that Gujarat under
      Narendra Modi’s leadership is the best governed state, and provides a model for India.</p>
    <p>The question we address is: Does ‘good governance’ refer, in holistic sense, to all aspects
      of the government; or only to certain sectors of governance? The article is based on secondary
      data, micro studies of two cities and district social welfare administration and interviews
      with political leaders and bureaucrats (present and past).</p>
    <sec id="section1-2321023013482788">
      <title>Gujarat: Economic Growth</title>
      <p>Gujarat is one of the industrialized states of India. It has on average 11 per cent
        industrial growth as against 9 per cent of all India; and contributes 14 per cent in India’s
        export. Not only in common parlance but also in academic discourse the term Gujarati
        (person) is synonymously used as a business entrepreneur; though vast majority of the
        population in Gujarat is not engaged in trade and commerce. Capital has been well-organized
        earlier in the form of guild and now in the form of modern associations. The state has a
        history of weak and fragmented socio-political movements of labour and deprived communities.
        The Congress was in power till 1995 with a brief break—Janata Morcha (alliance of
        non-Congress parties, 1976–1980) and Janata-Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) alliance
        (1989–1990). BJP rules the state since then. Approach to economic growth in the state has by
        and large remained the same irrespective of the party in power.</p>
      <p>On the eve of its separation from the bilingual Bombay State, newly formed Gujarat was
        ranked the eighth among all the states of India in industrial growth. At that time,
        substantial Gujarati capital was concentrated in Mumbai. The first task that the Government
        of Gujarat (GoG) undertook was to replicate Bombay’s economic growth here. Consensus among
        the ruling elite and mainstream civil society prevailed for ‘orderly and rapid industrial
        development’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2321023013482788">Erdman, 1971</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2321023013482788">1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-2321023013482788">Shah, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-2321023013482788">Sinha, 2005</xref>). A combination of capital as well as
        labour-intensive industrialization in diverse sectors was then a guiding view.</p>
      <p>Beside attracting and facilitating private investment, the government preferred partnership
        with private investors in joint stock companies for capital accumulation. As early as 1962,
        the government set up Gujarat State Fertilizers and Chemicals Ltd. followed by several
        public sector industries. From the beginning, consensus among political leaders prevailed
        that the public sector should function as efficiently as the private sector, free from
        political interference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2321023013482788">Erdman,
          1973</xref>, p. 35).</p>
      <p>Following the pattern of the former Bombay State, various innovative institutions to
        attract, promote and facilitate investment were set up in the early 1960s. Like other
        states, Gujarat also provided several incentives to investors including capital in the form
        of credit with low interest and also subsidy, tax exemption, tax deferment, etc.
        Institutional mechanism has been evolved to provide training in preparation of projects,
        marketing and other skills to young prospective entrepreneurs. District Industries Centres
        came into existence to disseminate information and assist the investors at the district
        level. Besides these inputs, the government acquired land for industrial estates and
        provided roads, water, electricity and other facilities to these locations. By 1982, more
        than three-fourth of the land in Gujarat was eligible for industries with special incentives
        by one criteria or another (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-2321023013482788">Sinha,
          2005</xref>). Government declared several areas as ‘notified area’ for industries under
        Gujarat Industrial Development Act 1962.</p>
      <p>During the pre-neoliberal policy the state government evolved, what Aseema Sinha calls a
        ‘bureaucratic-liberalism’ model of strategic interaction with the central government to
        attract investment in Gujarat and also to guide investors. The actions of Gujarat’s
        bureaucracy unlike several other states embodied the classic developmental role of ‘guiding
        markets’ (ibid., p. 92). The bureaucrats had a free hand to find out ways and means with the
        central government so as the state gets more licenses and private investment. They were
        functioning like entrepreneurs, taking initiative, risk, collecting and collating data
        related to market and industrial production. An autonomous agency for industrial promotion,
        Industrial Extension Bureau, called iNDEXTb 9 ‘i’ is small representing small ego, so is ‘b’
        for bureaucracy, indicating de-bureaucratic approach; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-2321023013482788">Sinha, 2005</xref>: 301, fn 36) was formed in 1977. Its
        financial source has been made independent of state budget to keep it free from bureaucratic
        and political constraints.</p>
      <p>The state government had set up offices not only in Delhi, but also in Mumbai, Kolkata,
        Chennai and South Africa to attract capital. The officers wooed the businessmen and
        encouraged them to invest in Gujarat. In several cases the officers worked on behalf of
        investors to expedite the process of procuring license from the Union government. In some
        cases to expedite the process, bureaucrats used to take first a license in the name of the
        GoG and shift it to the joint sector. Later, its full ownership was transferred to the
        private party (ibid.).</p>
      <p>Within a decade of its formation, Gujarat ‘made striking progress in its industrial
        economy’. Between 1974 and 1990 it was second highest in receiving the letters of intent
        (ibid., p. 56). The state attained third position in terms of number of industries and
        production in 1984–1985. In 1984–1985, among the 200 top giant industries of India, 24 were
        located in Gujarat. Madhavsinh Solanki, the then Chief Minister, as media often reported,
        had an ambition to turn Gujarat into ‘mini-Japan’. Under his stewardship ‘Gujarat became the
        second most industrialized state in India, as his government, in cooperation with the
        private sector, launched many projects in power development, electronics, fertilizer and
        many other industries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-2321023013482788">Wood,
        1995</xref>, p. 158).’</p>
      <sec id="section2-2321023013482788">
        <title>1990s and After</title>
        <p>Anticipating the change in the GoI’s economic policy, the GoG announced ‘Incentive
          Policy’ for the industries by executive order in the early 1980s, and repeated the same
          with modifications in 1986 and 1990. Later, three industrial policies (2000, 2003 and
          2009) have been announced. The first policy declared its target to compete with Southeast
          and East Asian countries. In the post-2002 communal riots, under the Modi government,
          industry policy got blended with cultural uniqueness and pride: Gujarat has ‘cultural
          base’ where you ‘sow a rupee, reap a Dollar’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2321023013482788">GoG, 2003</xref>, p. 3). To boost up spirit of enterprising
          dominant Gujaratis, the state declares: ‘to provide business leadership to entire world’.
          The policy also announces, ‘Good Governance (is): A way of life for Government in Gujarat’
            (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2321023013482788">GoG, 2003</xref>, p.10).</p>
        <p>All the three policies promise: (<italic>a</italic>) to remove all bottlenecks presumably
          obstructing investment, (<italic>b</italic>) to simplify procedures, speeding of process
          and develop single window system for clearance and other related matters;
            (<italic>c</italic>) to change rules and laws to facilitate transferring agriculture
          land to non-agriculture land for industrial purpose; (<italic>d</italic>) to reorient
          administration to take up new challenges of globalization and attract more investment
          throughout the world; (<italic>e</italic>) to strengthen e-governance, data bank and
          dissemination of information for selection of projects; (<italic>f</italic>) to develop
          physical as well as human infrastructure (roads, power, water etc., and skilled
          human-power) to meet the requirements of the industries.</p>
        <p>These policies provide subsidy varying from 25 to 40 per cent to industries. Besides
          reducing their sales tax, the exemption in sales tax from six to ten years has been
          offered. The government promises ‘to reform the tax regime’ so as to make the state
          globally competitive. Number of categories in tax concessions increased from the first to
          the third policy period. In 2009 new schemes for assistance for Micro<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-2321023013482788">3</xref></sup> and innovative, Small and
          Medium enterprises have been introduced. Moreover, foreign investors are also offered
          infra-structure facilities at low cost.</p>
        <p>Infrastructure development Act was passed in 1999 to facilitate private investment and to
          ensure co-ordination among various Government agencies a Board was setup. The Act has been
          amended in 2006 empowering the Government to extend the concession period beyond 35 years
          and to approve financial assistance up to 20 per cent cost of the project.</p>
        <p>Besides increasing number of industrial estates they are upgraded with adding
          infrastructure facilities. The State Industrial Parks and Special Economic Zones (SEZs)
          have developed with extra facilities to stimulate export-oriented industries. Sixty SEZs
          have been approved. Ports are developed to encourage export. India’s first private port,
          Gujarat Pipavav Port Ltd., is being developed to support cargo handling.</p>
        <p>The state is actively engaged in acquiring land for industrial development. Gradually it
          has amended laws related to agriculture land to facilitate industries. First, restrictions
          on purchase of agriculture land for non-agriculture purpose were removed in 1994. Rules
          for converting agriculture land to non-agriculture purpose were relaxed. Second, with
          government order in 2005 the state began to offer public land—waste as well as grazing
          land—to ‘big industries and individual progressive farmers’. They were expected to develop
          that land for productive purpose with the use of technology. Such land was given not only
          on lease without any rent for the first five years but beneficiaries are also permitted to
          mortgage it to banks for loan. Third, under the Land Acquisition Act 1894, the state also
          acquires land from private farmers for ‘public purpose’, and hand over that to industries.
          In Kutch and Saurashtra several hundred thousand hectares of government and private land
          has been given to big industries like Reliance and Adani.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-2321023013482788">4</xref></sup> In fact, a few investors in the SEZ who got
          land on lease or at throwaway price have sold that land to others with high price (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-2321023013482788">Yadav, 2011</xref>). Moreover, besides
          cheap water and electricity, a few industries received gas from the Gujarat State
          Petroleum Corporation, at rates below its cost price. Such favours, according to
          Comptroller and Auditor General (2012) cost the state ₹ 5000 crore. Not only that, the
          government has violated environmental laws, converting a protected wildlife sanctuary
          Kutch for industry. It has also manoeuvred around Coastal Regulation Zone laws for a
          private port to be built for the export of cement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-2321023013482788">Sud, 2012</xref>).</p>
        <p>The officers in the Ministry of Industries and different industrial corporations of GoG
          have been always business friendly. During the license-quota-raj they found out ways and
          means to woo investors. Their enthusiasm increased under the neo-liberal policy. Most of
          them come from upper strata of society; hence they can very easily build rapport with
          entrepreneurs. Money power and social networks of the entrepreneurs match with
          bureaucrats’ mindset. Businessmen believe in keeping the bureaucrats in good humour. The
            <italic>Business India</italic> notes, <disp-quote>
            <p>‘(I)f Gujarat is flooded with investment it is partly due to a corrupt but
              well-organized regime. Industrialists know that in Gujarat everything has a price.
              Land, water and power concessions, not to mention environmental clearances are hassle
              free if one has the right political connections. Similarly files move fast and lengthy
              duplicate procedures are simply non-existent if one knows which palms to grease’ (as
              cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-2321023013482788">Sinha, 2005</xref>, p.
              228).</p>
          </disp-quote></p>
        <p>On the whole the investors, in the past and today, are very happy with Gujarat’s
          bureaucracy and appreciate its efficiency.</p>
        <p>In the 1960s, Gujarat was known for production of textiles. At present Chemicals and
          Petrochemicals have become major industries with 62 per cent share in the total industrial
          production of the state. Medium and large industries have increased nearly eight-fold
          between 1980s and 1990s. In the last decade, on an average more than six hundred new
          projects were sanctioned to launch. At the same time the condition of the small scale
          industries has not improved. A demand of small entrepreneurs in 2006 for creating separate
          wing within the Enterprise Commissioner’s office to pay attention to their problems, has
          not yet met. With such pro-industrial growth governance, Gujarat was at the top among
          Indian states with 11 per cent Gross Domestic Product (GDP) between 2001–2002 and
          2005–2006. But now other states have picked up the growth and moving faster than Gujarat.
          In the last five years between 2006–2007 and 2010–2011 Gujarat’s GDP has declined by 9.3
          per cent, occupying sixth position.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-2321023013482788">5</xref></sup></p>

      <title>Pollution</title>
      <p>Major industrial belt between Vapi in south and Mehsana in north, called golden corridor is
        concentrated with chemical industries. It is the country’s most polluted area. Many
        industries dump their effluents in rivers, ponds and sea, or just throw in open space. They
        pollute water, air and soil. A few of them even illegally connect their outlet pipes to
        municipal sewage. Environmental laws are more often than not flouted.</p>
      <p>The Industry Policy 2000 admitted that ‘the requirement of sustainable development entails
        the need to tighten the pollution control measures and environmental safety in the State’.
        It declares that ‘Along with strictly implementing the pollution and environment protection
        measures, the State would be striving to set right the irregularities in this regard, which
        has taken place in some industrial clusters’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2321023013482788">GoG, 2000</xref>, p. 8). The Minister for industries,
        admitted that ‘We are suffering because of the lack of proper planning in the past…We have
        to come out of it’. But the governance has remained as usual. No priority was expressed to
        tackle in the government’s the ‘Infrastructure Vision 2010’.</p>
      <p>In the 1990s the government initiated and encouraged industries to develop ‘Common Effluent
        Treatment Plants’ (CETPs). These plants are largely supported by the public funds: 25 per
        cent of the cost was state subsidy; 25 per cent central government subsidy; 30 per cent
        loans from the financial institutes; and remaining 20 per cent paid by the industries. Most
        of the plants do not meet the norms prescribed by the Ministry of Environment and Forest of
        GOI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-2321023013482788">Prajapati, 2012</xref>). CAG Report
        2010–2011 noted that ‘treated’ waste water out of CETPs had four to ten times more toxic
        than Government’s own norms in terms of biological oxygen demand (BOD) value, three times
        higher in case of chemical oxygen demand (COD) values and four times higher in terms of
        total dissolved salts (TDS). This has caused ‘large-scale death of aqua stock in the rivers’
        in the recent past. On 7 May 2004 the Supreme Court observed, ‘…due to indiscriminate
        dumping of hazardous waste due to non-existent or negligent practices together with lack of
        enforcement by authorities, the ground water and, therefore, drinking water supplies have
        been effected/damaged’ (<italic>ibid</italic>.).</p>
      <p>Not that the government is unaware of increasing adverse and deadly effects of pollution on
        the vast population. But it does not have courage to displease industrialists. It has a fear
        that strictly enforcement of the pollution control norms would go against the interest of
        the factory owners. And, it is feared that they would go away from Gujarat and may also
        discourage new investors to come to the state. The government which is obsessed with high
        economic growth and to become front-runner in the market is caught with contradictions of
        its own making.</p>

      <title>Employment and Labour</title>
      <p>Like industry agriculture in Gujarat is increasingly becoming capital—and
        technology—intensive. With infrastructure development in irrigation and power, agriculture
        production has increased. But small and marginal farmers are further marginalized and farm
        sector employment has declined. Rural labour is moving to non-farm sector where job
        opportunities have increased. But as the industries are capital-intensive rate of employment
        in manufacturing sector is slow and erratic. Employment per factory has significantly
        declined, from 99 workers per factory in 1960–1961 to 62.40 persons in 1990–1991 and to
        59.44 per cent in 2005. Whereas average invested capital per factory has increased 2.5 times
        in less than a last decade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2321023013482788">Hirway and
          Shah, 2011</xref>).</p>
      <p>To attract investment the State has overtly and covertly undermined the existing labour
        laws which provide some protection to workers. The government has amended labour
        legislations to provide freedom to industry to employ labour on contract basis.
        Consequently, Ahmedabad has the lowest labour costs among the major cities in India, with
        labour costs less than 50 per cent of those in Delhi and 40 per cent below those in Pune.
        The wage bill for industry in Gujarat constitutes only 2.42 per cent of the invested
        capital. The same figure stands at 4.04 for Karnataka, 4.4 for Maharashtra, 4.94 for Andhra
        Pradesh, 5.42 for Haryana and 5.5 for Tamil Nadu.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-2321023013482788">6</xref></sup> Sizeable labour force is in informal sector
        without social security and other benefits under the labour laws. Stipulated minimum wages
        by the GoG are lower in all occupations in Gujarat than Maharashtra and several other states
        (Breman, 2007; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2321023013482788">Mahadevia and Shah,

        to implement labour laws and protect labourers’ interest, has been reduced in its
        strength—both in number and power. Its functioning is further weakened.</p>

          states: Haryana, Punjab, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. In terms of percentage of
          GDP and per capital expenditure on health Gujarat ranks eighth and ninth respectively
          among the major states.</p>
        <p>The state provides primary health care services through local governments—municipalities
          in urban areas and district panchayats in rural areas. Number of primary health centres
          has increased from 142 in 1961 to 1096 in 2010. Each district has government hospital and
          all municipal corporations also run hospital(s) in their city. These institutions, besides
          providing primary health care and curative services, carry out centrally sponsored health
          programmes particularly reproductive child health and national health programmes. The
          performance of the immunization programmes is above 90 per cent. However, all sub-health
          centres do not have adequate infrastructure. More often than not operation theatres at
          Community Health Centres are used for family planning operations only. Users’ fee has been
          introduced, though families below poverty line (BPL) are exempted. It is observed that
          more often than not health centres do not have required medicine and the poor have no
          other way but to buy medicine from the market. Majority of the staff do not have
          residential quarters near workplace. And, one-fifth of the positions at different levels
          have been vacant for many years. Out of 1,135 sanctioned posts for specialist doctors,
          nearly 70 per cent are vacant.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-2321023013482788">7</xref></sup> Ratio of doctors in public sector health care to population is 1:19000,

        <p>Both the Central as well as Gujarat government have accepted policy to outsource health
          care services. In 2008, the government of India launched ‘Rastriya Swashthaya Bima Yojana’
          (RSBY; National Health Insurance Scheme) with the support of the state
              governments.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-2321023013482788">8</xref></sup> Its
          objective is to provide insurance cover to below poverty line (BPL) households for major
          diseases that involve hospitalization. The state government is responsible for execution
          of the programme. So far, the state has enrolled 49 per cent of the BPL families under the
          scheme. An exploratory study indicates that the insured patients often experience hassles
          between the insurance company and hospitals. It has been found that ‘the private insurer
          promotes more coverage as government pay them premium, but discourages claims as larger
          claims would turn out costly for them’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2321023013482788">Mahadevia and Shah, 2012</xref>). There is hardly any
          local administrative mechanism to monitor insurance providers as well as hospitals and to
          guide the beneficiaries.</p>
        <p>Under public-private partnership, Chiranjeevi Yojana (long life scheme) has been launched
          by the GoG in 2006 to reduce Mother Mortality Rate (MMR). It is meant for pregnant women
          from BPL families. Private maternity homes and gynaecologists are involved with
          remuneration in child delivery for poor women. As an innovative scheme it has received
          awards but it has so far not been able to reduce MMR significantly. Its rank order remains
          sixth in MMR among all the states in 2011. This author’s fieldwork in an exploratory study

          private maternity homes avoid taking complicated and risky cases. There is also a
          complaint that the doctors registered under the scheme also charge the patients over and
          above the fees from the government. The cases of the doctors registering ghost patients

        <title>Private Health Care</title>
        <p>Private health care services are multiplying everywhere in the country and so in Gujarat
          too. Number of private hospitals has increased at phenomenal rate in the last three
          decades in the country. The private health care system is widely heterogeneous in terms of
          facilities, quality of doctors, diagnostic equipment as well as skill and charges. Poor
          families living in urban slums get treatment for common ailments from semi-qualified/quack
          medical practitioners. The condition of hospitals/maternity homes in terms of
          infrastructure has also great deal of variation. The general practitioners as well as many
          consultants hardly maintain records of the patients and the treatment given. Fees for
          general practitioner vary from ₹ 10 to ₹ 100, and for consultants from ₹ 250 to ₹ 800 per
          visit. The fees for hospital bed vary from ₹ 50 to ₹ 3000 + per day. Most of the private
          hospitals do not have basic infrastructure or personnel. More often than not they follow
          ‘medically unnecessary procedures’ and prescribe ‘excessive, expensive and more risky
          drugs’.</p>
        <p>Gujarat government made an abortive attempt to monitor private health care system.
          Following the formation of the National Rural Health Mission, the Gujarat government has
          set up Gujarat State Health Mission in 2005, headed by the Chief Minister. In 2006 the
          government initiated to prepare health policy with two objectives: (<italic>a</italic>)
          improving access to, and utilization of health services; and (<italic>b</italic>)
          reorganization and restructuring of the existing health care infrastructure and delivery
          system. After prolonged consultations with civil society organizations, a draft of public
          health rules was prepared and circulated in early 2009. Among other things the rules had
          several provisions to monitor private health providers. Accordingly, all health care
          centres were expected—besides maintaining records of the cases—to display in Gujarati,
          types and availability of services, charges for consultation etc. Meanwhile, the state
          witnessed an epidemic of Hepatitis ‘B’ that took a toll of more than one hundred persons
          in February 2009. The reason was the use of infected syringes that had spread the virus as
          many clinics were not segregating bio-medical waste and were found violating the
          Biomedical Waste (M&amp;H) rules 1998. The government booked six doctors for violating the
          Medical Practitioners Act. Eleven storehouses were served with notices for ‘improper
          segregation of bio-medical waste’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-2321023013482788">10</xref></sup> The government declared to invoke ‘mechanism’ which facilitates
          ‘inspection of private health care establishments’ by the local bodies. The doctors from
          all parts of Gujarat were up-in-arms against the proposed Act. They argued that ‘the
          induction of certain regulatory provisions will make medical treatment in rural and
          semi-urban areas beyond the reach of middle and lower middle classes.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-2321023013482788">11</xref></sup> The government immediately
          succumbed to the pressure. The Health Minister declared, ‘The draft (Gujarat Public Health
          Act) is just placed for free and frank discussion, hence there is no room or cause for
          confrontation’. Since then the draft has been put in the deep freeze.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-2321023013482788">12</xref></sup></p>
        <p>Juvenile sex ratio in Gujarat has reached to 886 in 2011. Upwardly mobile families use
          modern technology for female foeticides. Though sex determination test is legally
          prohibited, it is widely practiced by some clinics which also provide facilities for
          abortion. The government has not been able to make significant dent in preventing the
          practice. Similarly, its performance in Infant Mortality Rate (IMR) in comparison to other
          states has not improved significantly. Like elsewhere, IMR has declined in Gujarat from 57
          in 2003 to 48 in 2009, but continues to lag behind Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Punjab,

        <title>Education</title>
        <p>Primary education is supposed to be ‘free and compulsory’ under the State’s 1961 Act. By
          now, primary schools are available in all most all villages except few remote areas. Since
          1984 female education has been free at all levels. The government also introduced mid-day
          meal scheme to arrest drop-out rate and develop integration among the children of
          different communities. Since 1997, village schools organize public celebration in the
          month of June to mobilize enrolment. And from 2002, to boost girls’ enrolment, Kanya
          Kelavani Rath Yatra (procession for girls’ education) is celebrated for three days in
          which all state officers including chief Minister participate. Moreover, Vidhyadeep Scheme
          providing life-insurance to the students studying in the Government schools up to class
          XII was launched in 2001.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-2321023013482788">14</xref></sup> Moreover, girls’ parents of BPL families are provided with a bond of ₹
          1000 at the time of admission in the first standard in the urban area. With these efforts,
          school enrolment has now reached to nearly hundred per cent. But these incentives and once
          in a year mobilization are not sustained with follow up mechanism. The state’s budget
          allocation on education has remained ‘relatively static’ over the years.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-2321023013482788">15</xref></sup> And its share in allocation
          for primary education has declined in the last decade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2321023013482788">Hirway and Mahadevia, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-2321023013482788">Pratham, 2012</xref>).</p>
        <p>Like elsewhere, drop out rate at primary school level has been considerably arrested from
          21 per cent in 2001–2002 to less than five per cent in 2011–2012 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-2321023013482788">MHRD 2011</xref>). Gujarat’s position however has sunk
          from sixteenth in 2001 to eighteenth in 2011 in terms of growth in literacy. Girls’
          enrolment has remained low compared to boys at all levels. Despite a campaign called
          ‘Gunotsav’ to improve quality of education, the situation has not improved. 55 per cent of
          rural students in standard Vth cannot read a standard II level text and 65 per cent cannot
          do simple subtraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-2321023013482788">Pratham,
            2012</xref>). On an average, students–teacher ratio in primary schools remains 33:1. The
          government had stopped filling the vacant positions for primary teachers in 1995. After
          three years, in 1998 new appointments of the qualified teachers were made under the Vidhya
          Sahayak Scheme (VS) with ₹ 2500 salary (now increased to ₹ 5000 per month). Under the
          scheme no teacher is appointed as permanent. The earlier tradition of frequent supervision
          by the District Education Inspectors has become slack because of variety of reasons
          including inadequate staff. On the other hand, private schools and colleges have increased
          manifold. Except a few meant for elite class, most of them also do not provide quality
          education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-2321023013482788">Shah, 2012</xref>). The

          per cent in Karnataka between 2004 and 2010. Number of BPL families as identified by the

          subsidized food supply, old age pension, widow, the physically disabled and BPL families
          are managed by GoG. Micro studies show that several BPL households are left out of the

          case with eligible poor old persons, widows and disabled. Procedures to get BPL card
          and/or certificate to avail pensions are cumbersome. Over a period of five decades the
          state has set up four Boards<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-2321023013482788">18</xref></sup> to implement various social security schemes for unorganized workers in
          different sectors. According to one estimate merely 0.40 of the total unorganized workers
          entitled under various schemes have been registered. Now the GoI has enacted a somewhat
          comprehensive, Unorganised Workers Social Security Act, in 2008. Responsibility for its
          implementation is with the state governments. The GoG took three years to form the State
          Social Security Board. Mechanism and rules for implantation are yet to be finalized. On
          the whole local administration, to say the least, is indifferent to the needs of the
          needy. The state spent as low as 0.48 per cent of the state budget or 0.04 per cent of

      <title>Overview</title>
      <p>Economic policy for growth that GoG follows, like all other states, is the same that Union
        government has evolved and adopted. Different states have worked out different strategies
        and institutional mechanism for implementing the policy. Thanks to historical and cultural
        milieu—dominance of entrepreneur class and its culture—Gujarat has always remained business
        friendly. It was the case even during the ‘licence quota raj’. Under the neo-liberal
        economic reforms Gujarat was the first state to declare its industrial policy to increase
        incentives and support structure to private investment for industries. Inducements have been
        multiplied in the last two decades. In the institutional structure capital investors are
        treated as the only stakeholders for industrial growth. They are involved in decision making
        and monitoring process. Labour has no place therein. Administrative procedures have
        gradually minimised. Bureaucrats are generally benign towards capitalist class. They are now
        professionalized and geared to follow the best practices of the corporate world into the
        government to accelerate economic growth euphemistically called ‘development’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-2321023013482788">19</xref></sup> Nevertheless, from the
        perspective of neo-liberal economy such governance may be qualified as ‘good’. Gujarat
        however is not the only state with high growth trajectory. Maharashtra, Haryana and Andhra
        Pradesh are at par or even ahead of Gujarat in GDP, investment and per capita income. Tamil
        Nadu, Karnataka and Punjab are not far behind. Comparative studies on governance of these
        states would contribute in exploring political theory on economic development.</p>
      <p>Nature of growth in Gujarat however has led to deterioration of natural resources and
        environment. Gujarat has polluted areas affecting water and air, plantation, animal life and
        human health. The GoG has been ineffective in controlling the industries for violation of
        pollution control laws. In fact the government itself has violated its own environmental
        laws. In the pre-reform period the industry policy was in favour of both capital—as well as
        labour-intensive production. Several laws protecting interests and well-being of labour have
        been scrapped or made ineffective. As investment in industry is largely capital-intensive;
        rate of creating employment is slow. Moreover, regular employment has declined.</p>
      <p>The state has not yet formulated any policy perspective even within neo-liberal economy for
        education and health. Programmes and schemes in these sectors are ad hoc and piecemeal.
        Bureaucrats, a few exceptions apart, are not committed to the social cause. Ground level
        mechanism for implementation of welfare programmes is not as rigorous and dynamic as it is
        in the case of industrial sector. Overall performance of GoG in social sectors is not
        impressive. Several other states—both those which are leading in economic growth with
        Gujarat, particularly Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Punjab and Karnataka, and
        economically slow states like Kerala, Himachal Pradesh—are ahead in these sectors. The state
        has retrogressed in overall human development. It has slipped from tenth to eleventh rank in
        human development between 1999 and 2009. The system of governance in these sectors is not
        participatory. Social sector programmes are increasingly getting privatized under the garb
        of PPP. The objectives of the government and the private agencies in such partnership are
        not the same. The former focus on well-being of the people and for the latter the main
        concern is private profit. Moreover, the approach of the government towards people is that
        of ‘beneficiaries’, and not citizens having rights. Policymakers soft pedal with private
        partners. No effective mechanism to monitor the functioning of the private agencies has been
        evolved. The mainstream civil society in Gujarat is not geared to raise the issues of
        poverty and exploitation. And the civil society segments which have expertise and active
        engagement in health, education and livelihood issues are side-tracked or harassed by the
        government bureaucracy. Performance of GoG in social sector is poorer than the states with
        similar high growth trajectory. Measuring quality of governance on six dimensions
        (infrastructure service delivery, social service delivery, fiscal performance, law and
        order, judicial service delivery and quality of legislature) with several indicators,
        Gujarat is one of the better governed states among the six top. But it is not on the first
        rank. It moves between fourth and sixth position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-2321023013482788">Mundle et al. 2012</xref>).</p>
      <p>The present state of affairs of lopsided governance is not only because of management
        system. It is primarily because of government’s approach and policy for social
        transformation to build desirable society. India’s and Gujarat’s model of governance
        primarily focus on economic growth rather than overall sustainable human development.
        Sensitive and committed administrative mechanism has not been built. Economic growth
        certainly has somewhat trickledown effect. A small section improves life chances and moves
        up. Reduction of abject poverty can be attained. In this trajectory a large number of people
        get lolly-pop and dream for future. They manage to survive. The system needs them as a
        reserve army of labour and as consumers. But since redistribution of growth and equality are
        not on agenda of the ‘good’ governance, inequality and disorder perpetuate endangering
        sustainable human development in varying degree under different regimes.</p>
