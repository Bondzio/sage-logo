<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Global labor migration has made people nervous. As of late, what hits the news stands and political debates are the problems of migrants. Anxieties and worries arise about people who are crossing borders, settling in communities, and taking up jobs and state services. Yet, many of these worrisome bodies often leave with the consent of their home countries. And for some countries, like the Philippines, the process of labor outmigration is a carefully calibrated and systematically organized machine. Still, the working mechanisms of ‘labor brokerage’ – the systematic export of migrants as labor and the commoditization of people as a form of development – remains solely under the purview of policy makers and agencies even though it impacts a range of actors including men, women, and families in both sending and receiving countries. How do governments facilitate labor migration? In what ways does a culture of migration blossom and then calcify?</p>
<p>To this end, Robyn Rodriguez’s <italic>Migrants for Export</italic> and Anna Guevarra’s <italic>Marketing Dreams, Manufacturing Heroes</italic> both set out to interrogate the process of ‘labor brokerage’ in their books. Both authors are committed to exposing labor brokerage as a concession to a neoliberal capitalist order. The scope of these two works is wide, although their focus is set on the Philippines; the argument put forth by both of these scholars is a critique of how peripheral economies and states play up to neoliberal demands to get a piece of the capitalist pie. In a day and age where we are only told what we need to know to pacify our concerns, Rodriguez and Guevarra open up a door to which only a powerful elite usually have the key: the inner workings of bureaucracies, agencies, and governmental bodies that have migration as their task.</p>

<sec id="section2-0896920511431904">
<title>In Conversation with Scholars of Globalization and the State</title>
<p>Both Rodriguez’s and Guevarra’s works engage the literature on globalization and specifically, writings about the transformation of the nation-state under neoliberalism. Scholars have argued that the sovereignty of the nation-state has increasingly changed with the rise of mobile, global capital, multilateral agreements, and international institutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0896920511431904">Harvey, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0896920511431904">Sassen, 1998</xref>). Although it can be argued that transnational bodies significantly change the bounds of nation-state sovereignty, David Harvey makes a strong argument about the collusion of nation-states with global capitalism. In what he calls the ‘neoliberal state,’ Harvey argues that the state has a clear role in favoring finance over the welfare of people by facilitating corporations’ access to resources, establishing specialization industries for flexible labor, complying with international financial institutions by deregulating within state bounds, and pitting state-run social services against private firms. Both Rodriguez and Guevarra add that labor brokerage is another permutation of the neoliberal state.</p>
<p>Rodriguez extends the latter theoretical project by arguing that not only is the state present, but in developing countries, like the Philippines, the state invests in the systematic and institutionalized strategy of labor brokerage to be a viable player in the global economic stage. Her novel intervention in the literature is to say that (1) neoliberal states are fully functioning in the Global South, and (2) that these neoliberal states, as exemplified in their organization of labor brokerage, are constitutive of neoliberal globalization. Rodriguez writes, ‘I would even suggest that labor brokerage might be a necessary institutional form (though problematic, especially for workers) under the conditions of neoliberal globalization’ (pp. xxi–xxii). This is an exciting contribution to this field, because it shows that neoliberalism is diffuse, in that not only do hegemonic nations produce global inequality but governments of developing countries participate enthusiastically, taking up their respective roles in neoliberal economics.</p>
<p>Guevarra also takes up the position that the state is not weakening in the face of economic globalization. However, different from Rodriguez’s take, her entry to this literature is through a discussion of ‘state-led transnationalism’ (p. 6). The strengthening of the state via its transnationalization is driven by the dispersion of its citizens globally; therefore state power extends its governance to the reaches of its citizens’ locations. Guevarra works under the premise that the Philippine state reasserts itself via state-led transnationalism, and she substantiates this claim by investigating its manifestations on three levels: the state, employment and labor agencies, and migrant workers. In examining these different levels, she finds that labor brokerage works as a ‘unique form of labor control and a mechanism of neoliberal capitalist discipline that informs the country’s state–led transnationalism’ (p. 7). Guevarra’s perspective sets its sights on the relationship between the reconfiguration of citizenship and the state’s transnational strategies to reincorporate migrants who live abroad into the Philippine nation.</p>

<title>Guevarra’s Interventions: Race and Gender in Globalization</title>
<p>By situating her work in Leslie Salzinger’s concept of ‘productive femininity,’ Guevarra joins feminist scholars by arguing that processes of globalization are not gender-neutral; rather, globalization counts on tropes of gender to advance the interest of capitalist and neoliberal imperatives. Ideologies of Third World women as naturally ready and ideal workers operate on both racialized and gendered assumptions, but they often cement the marketability of these women on the global market. Guevarra writes, ‘In effect, these tropes mark women’s desirability as workers at the same time that they serve to devalue and legitimize their disposability as labor commodities’ (p. 9). She is careful, however, to argue that while ideas about productive femininity permeate all occupations, ideas about how Third World women are perfect for factory jobs and nanny jobs are different. Guevarra explicitly states that she is interested in the ‘level of coordination’ between the state, its partners, employment and recruitment agencies, and workers that facilitates the circulation of the idea that Filipino workers, women in particular, are ideal global workers. In choosing to highlight this structure, she prioritizes the cultural logic that her book expounds upon. By situating her project in this literature, Guevarra invites readers to think not only about labor brokerage as both an economic and nation-building strategy but also about how labor brokerage is mediated by gendered and racialized ideologies, therefore implicitly arguing that these dimensions are not separate from one another. Rather, it is as if they lean upon one another to produce a gendered and racialized form of productive labor.</p>

<sec id="section4-0896920511431904">
<title>Rodriguez’s Interventions: Migrant Citizenship</title>
<p>Rodriguez deepens her critique of the labor brokerage state by arguing that the state institutes new and specific ways for migrants to participate and belong to the Philippine nation from afar. Migrant citizenship – or a ‘portable set of ‘rights’ that citizens are entitled to even when they are on foreign soil – is a key modality for the Philippine state to claim entitlement to migrant remittances and protection for their migrant citizens. It is, at once, an extraterritorial extension of Philippine protections to migrants, and the thinning of Philippine citizenship under neoliberalism. <italic>Migrant citizenship</italic>, as she terms it, is a legitimizing strategy of a labor brokerage system to pacify the fears and vulnerabilities of migrants. Through legislation and institutionalization, the Philippine state provides training and education as a component of the services provided for their citizens going abroad. Investment in training and education demonstrates the state’s commitment to the professionalization of workers and the state’s engagement in bettering and protecting their citizens from future occupational hazards. However, the existence of these strategies of individual responsibilization implies that if migrant workers are informed about all of the risks in their employment ventures, then the state cannot be blamed as they have exhausted all of their abilities to prepare migrants. In other words, the state already did its job, but once they are overseas, migrants are on their own.</p>
<p>Migrant citizenship also includes the ways the state facilitates the right of citizens to choose employment overseas as a viable form of Philippine livelihood. This state-sanctioned and produced opportunity, then, calls on the state to provide certain protections to migrant workers. To this end, the Philippine state creates institutions and policies to ensure the practice of democratic governance and guardianship over their citizens globally. Rodriguez argues that through migrant citizenship, ‘the state can represent itself as a caring and virtuous state’ (p. xx). Her project is to tease out the contradictions that belie this claim.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0896920511431904">
<title>Summary: <italic>Marketing Dreams, Manufacturing Heroes</italic></title>
<p>In <italic>Marketing Dreams, Manufacturing Heroes</italic>, Guevarra argues that a transnationally coordinated and organized web of networks enables the production of Filipino migrant workers. In her investigation, she identifies the state, employment agencies, workers, and the partnerships between these groups as players in the production of a racialized and gendered labor-brokering process she calls a cultural logic – one that represents the Filipino as the ideal global worker and overseas employment as an ideal opportunity for Filipinos (p. 4). Guevarra sets out to lay bare this ‘ethos of labor migration’ to challenge the essentialist idea that since Filipinos are present as workers in the service industry globally then they are ‘naturally’ the best fit for the job, and therefore the Philippines is the source of this type of model worker available for the global market. While Guevarra deepens our understanding of these vantage points, she is also careful to show us how the transnational organization of state, employment agencies, and workers implicate everyone in the culture of labor brokerage.</p>
<p>Guevarra argues that the Philippines’ ‘ethos of labor migration’, and consequently the country’s reputation as a ‘global labor provider’, is established through colonial history in which the government’s development and transformations became increasingly attuned to migration (p. 24). By following the Philippine state’s permutations in colonial times and its punctilious initiatives in promoting and managing labor migration in its neocolonial period, Guevarra is able to reveal the fallacious and essentialist idea that Filipinos are ‘natural’ overseas workers. After Marcos’s passage of the Labor Export Policy in 1972, Aquino’s national recognition of migrants as ‘bagong bayani’ or modern day heroes, and the Republic Act 8042 Migrant Workers Act and Overseas Filipinos Act of 1995 under the Ramos administration, it is apparent that the Philippine state sees overseas work as natural opportunities opening up in the global economy and Filipinos as natural responders to that work demand. No longer does the state force anyone to leave – it can portray itself as simply facilitating the choices of their citizens. In making the connections between historical and contemporary production of labor migration as a viable form of livelihood, Guevarra’s argument that Filipinos are not just naturally adept to working overseas becomes clear. It is a historically constructed and culturally produced phenomenon, not a cultural trait.</p>
<p>A key point in this work is Guevarra’s argument that the state works with a gendered and racialized moral economy to construct the ideal behavior of migrant workers. In marketing the Filipino worker as the premier global worker to the global market, the state makes the ethnicity ‘Filipino’ synonymous with good worker. Guevarra shows that this racialization of the Filipino overseas worker markets both the worker and the ethnic category as a ‘natural’ solution to global economies’ labor demands. At the same time, Guevarra argues that this moral frame produces a transnational allegiance between migrant workers and the Philippines, albeit an economic one. She characterizes this moral economy in three ways, migrants as heroes, as ambassadors, and as entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>Modern Day ‘Heroes’ or <italic>Bagong Bayani</italic> is the cultural specification of the ‘neoliberal mandate of making economic citizens’ as it works off of the colonial and catholic ideals of social heroism (pp. 54–55). The idea of migrant ‘ambassadors’ positions workers as representatives of the nation; thus the global Filipino workers must be responsible for their own fates abroad and be on their best behavior, thereby excusing employers and the receiving state for abuses and exploitation. Migrant ‘entrepreneurs’ are encouraged by the state to invest in local economies and in their hometown, but this still puts the responsibility on the worker to develop the country’s infrastructure and service industry.</p>
<p>The frame of moral economy produces docile workers, ‘empowering’ them by legitimizing them through the state and, Guevarra adds, by ensuring that workers have all of the information they need about their overseas jobs. The state’s investment in the decrease of workers’ vulnerability overseas is in changing policy on age and in professionalization through education, training, and certification. The ‘informed worker’ is an effort on the part of the labor brokerage state to make certain workers exercise their freedom to choose their employment (p. 59). If the worker is sufficiently disciplined and attentive to their good behavior to keep themselves in line then they represent the Philippines proudly.</p>
<p>However, this moral frame and investment in individualized responsibility – a neoliberal ideal – leaves migrant workers <italic>dis</italic>empowered, Guevarra posits. If they are abused, according to this logic, it is the workers’ fault because they were not self-disciplined enough. Incidents of exploitation and abuse of migrant workers is pushed out of the scope of any state (sending or receiving), as those governing bodies have done all they can to prepare workers. The neoliberal ideology of individualism fomented in the Philippine state’s characterizations of hero, ambassador, and entrepreneur also haunts migrant workers, as they are individually responsible for themselves even in times of great stress.</p>
<p>The gendered dimension of this moral economy is found in Guevarra’s ethnography of state trainings and seminars where migrant workers are not just expected to be disciplined workers but also disciplined in managing their sexuality in the workplace and attending to their heteronormative gender roles of woman, mother, and wife (see p. 80). It holds that if any woman migrant worker is sexually abused or exploited at work, the responsibility sits squarely on her shoulders.</p>
<p>The most compelling part of the book can be summed up in a phrase, ‘<italic>joint and solidary liability clause</italic>’ (p. 103). Guevarra fills out the picture of labor brokerage by including an examination of labor agencies that she describes as social institutions that manage and shape Filipinos’ comparative advantage as workers and their overseas opportunities. This is an exciting part of the book and study of the labor brokerage system because it shows the range of collusion that is needed to produce such a large-scale export of labor. Guevarra is successful in showing the collaboration and interaction of the Philippine state and labor agencies towards labor brokerage in her discussion of the (de)regulating labor promotion and management. The state affects regulation policy to police private sector labor agencies, thus ensuring up-to-par recruitment and training. Yet the private sector works with foreign agencies to influence bilateral state agreements, demanding that the state deregulate the management of migrant labor to maximize all avenues of labor opportunities. Agencies have a dual relationship with the state as they partner with its mission to manage and promote overseas labor but also are at its mercy in terms of regulation (p. 94).</p>
<p>Guevarra demonstrates that the state and labor agencies share a common interest: sustaining overseas labor as a profit-making industry. Still, the social dynamic of state and agencies is at times contentious because they compete with one another to serve as the primary labor broker of Filipino migrants. Agencies get a bad rap as they have a reputation and stigma of illegality, circulated by the state, no less (p. 101). Here it is important to note that the neoliberal regime extends outside of state mechanisms into a scaffolding of agencies that see themselves as key to maintaining the labor brokerage system.</p>
<p>Guevarra also looks closely at the ethos of labor migration through a gender lens in arguing that although the marketing of women is economically-driven, the cultural and ideological logic support the export of Filipino women. She makes a convincing argument that a set of characteristics such as educated, obedient, and overqualified is sold alongside Filipina workers as an ‘Added Export Value’. Drawing from Leslie Salzinger’s useful theoretical frame of ‘productive femininity,’ Guevarra argues that the added export value of Filipinas reinforces and reproduces gender ideologies that make Filipino women out to be natural care workers for the world. Guevarra adds that the racialization of productive femininity for Filipinas is an effort to correct the worldview of Filipinas as low-skill workers. Rather, by highlighting the ‘natural’ qualities of Filipinas against other ethnic groups, Filipina workers’ readiness to migrate coupled with their innately caring and hardworking personality is proof of good worker quality above all others (see p. 134).</p>
<p>Guevarra explores Filipino nurses’ internalization of the very qualities the state and agencies use to market them to the world: as hardworking, multi-skilled, and docile. Guevarra shows that by embracing this model, workers are empowering themselves by giving themselves pride in their self-identified difference, often putting themselves above other nurses. She argues that this empowerment is often an effort by nurses to take control of the very discourses that often leave them vulnerable to workplace abuses. Still, this internalization also perpetuates their ‘added value.’ The perception of their work ethic also disempowers nurses as they become vulnerable to the unrealistic standards demanded of them. Guevarra states that this also weakens the possibilities for uniting with other workers in the US.</p>
<p>The focus of Guevarra’s book is to examine the institutional and cultural processes of labor brokerage, which, she argues, is a form of labor control and neoliberal capitalist discipline. In studying the Philippine state, employment agencies and Filipino workers, she finds that all these groups are working together to sustain the labor export economy. She is successful in exposing the essentialist idea of Filipinos as naturally docile workers by revealing the discursive investment of state and agencies in schemas like ‘Added Export Value,’ racialized productive femininity, and the joint and collaborative nature of state and agencies. However, her discussion on Filipino nurses has not convinced me that workers themselves accept wholeheartedly the essentialist paradigm of the hardworking global Filipino worker. More research could be done to explore whether class and occupation affects the internalization of docility in migrant Filipino workers.</p>
<p>One of Guevarra’s aims is to go beyond a merely linear and economically driven explanation of labor brokerage, toward a more detailed explanation of the discursive construction and material practices of agencies to manufacture an ‘ethos of labor migration’. However, the separation between the economic and cultural explanation might be a false dichotomy. Culture is the transformation of social relations under capitalism. The change in the way people treat each other or what Karl Marx would call ‘exploitation’ or what Paulo Freire would call ‘dehumanization’ are all cultural transformations that align with the escalation of a global capitalist economy. All of which are at the crux of neoliberalism. The intensification of capitalism is not just about economy, governments, and capital; it is also inclusive of cultural and discursive dimensions that support the advancement of neoliberalism. By attempting to go beyond the economics of labor brokerage into the discursive unnecessarily separates these two congruent dimensions.</p>

<title>Summary: <italic>Migrants for Export</italic></title>
<p>In <italic>Migrants for Export</italic>, Robyn Rodriguez’s main argument is that labor brokerage, a strategy of development for some countries to stay competitive in the global economy, is constitutive of neoliberalism. She takes the Philippine state as an illustrative example of her argument by revealing the complex apparatus needed to mobilize its citizens for migration while profiting from the booming remittance industry of its migrant citizenry. In her ethnography of the state, she finds that the institutionalization of labor export is exacted through the formalization of bilateral agreements with labor-receiving states, the facilitation of categories or economies in which labor is brokered, and the maintenance of overseas links with migrant citizens. She states, ‘The Philippine state’s transnational migration apparatus has become something of an “export-processing zone” that mobilizes and exports a commodity, workers, that actually rivals other export commodities in terms of profitability’ (p. 5). Rodriguez likens the Philippines’ migration setup to export-processing zones, in the sense that both are transformations in the organization of labor in neoliberalism and are integral components of neoliberal globalization.</p>
<p>Rodriguez highlights the discursive frame in which the Philippine state considers itself a ‘global enterprise’ of labor for the world and thus cements the Filipino worker as the ideal global worker. She proposes that neoliberal governmentality is exported along with migrant workers (p. 9) through what she calls ‘migrant citizenship’ (pp. xx–xxi), or a ‘portable set of ‘rights’, a key modality for the Philippine state to claim entitlement to migrant remittances and protection for their migrant citizens. She argues that the state–citizen link is made up of transnational governance of remittances and the normalization of labor migration while sustaining ties to the Philippines.</p>
<p>In this book, Rodriguez is interested in the ways that nation-states are engaging in systems of labor brokering – that is, sending and receiving – and the institutionalization of migration in an era of neoliberalism. Her study is an exposition showing how regimes of labor brokerage are a temporary fix for both exporting and importing nation-states. Labor-receiving states count on brokerage to keep circuits of migration flowing, and labor-sending states rely on this organization to manage its migrant population. Labor brokerage as an institutional answer for the global demand for labor in developed nation-states relegates migrant workers to a category of labor instead of humans with human rights. At the same time, exporting labor also becomes an easy remedy to retreat from resolving the deep problems in the welfare state and national development in the Philippines.</p>
<p>The global enterprise of labor, Rodriguez argues, is best executed by the state’s bureaucratization of labor migration. Philippines transnational bureaucracy for labor brokerage incorporates active market research and logic to inform the recruitment and training of workers in the Philippines. The delivery of workers upon the needs and requests of other countries establishes relations of trust between nation-states thus facilitating smoother labor export and reception. Research about which countries need new laborers and which countries have immigration policies amenable to the reception of temporary workers informs Philippine officials where and when to set up consulates to prepare for flows of Filipino labor. On the other hand, preserving good relations with labor-receiving countries means the Philippine state must be attuned to which markets for migrants close. The decrease in demand for workers then informs policies to restrict the flow of Filipino migration sent to particular countries. Rodriguez argues that a healthy Philippines labor brokerage system pays attention to openings and closings of labor markets and immigration policies worldwide. Unfortunately, this system deems any prospective market as viable, so even if jobs are low-paying and precarious, the Philippine labor brokerage state will still offer their workers in the effort to uphold their ‘global enterprise of labor’.</p>
<p>She shows that bilateral agreements and memoranda of understanding are key mechanisms that are often agreed upon at international forums and conferences to ensure markets for Filipino workers. Philippine officials call these exchanges ‘labor diplomacy’, which is clearly exemplified in Rodriguez’s discussion of ‘regional complementation’ (p. 70). For the Philippines, regional complementation seeks to work with other labor-exporting states to help everyone benefit from labor brokerage. What is important about this national, then regional, organization of labor export is that it shows migration as a form of national development is clearly an agenda and a plausible model for developing countries to participate in the demands for cheap labor in this era of neoliberal globalization. Rodriguez’s central argument that the state is a central figure in the globalization of labor is backed by the evidence she provides about the degree of systematization of labor export in Philippine bureaucracy.</p>
<p>Rodriguez argues that the Philippine state reconfigures citizenship to include migrant workers through facilitating out-migration, and it reconfigures nationalism through sustaining and institutionalizing linkages to the homeland. These reassignments or what she calls ‘migrant citizenship’ are largely translated through legal and institutional mechanisms. Nationalist duties are reconfigured as the state–citizen relations rely on the rhetoric of filial piety (pp. 86–87) and remittances (p. 185). However, this migrant citizenship requires Filipinos to leave the country for a job and then participate in their nationalist responsibility towards national development.</p>
<p>Rodriguez also explores the flawed gendered logics in which the labor brokerage system integrates education and training as a solution to the possibility of abuse and exploitation women face overseas. In her, rather thin, analysis of the Social Weather Station surveys measuring public attitudes about women, migration, and their families, Rodriguez finds that middle-class Filipinos are not necessarily troubled by the women leaving their families to work; rather, they are nervous about Filipino women’s overrepresentation in low-wage, low-status labor markets overseas. This worry is constitutive of Filipinos’ concern over the global representation of the Philippine nation-state. Rodriguez links these concerns about the Filipino woman’s body as representative of the nation-state with changing policies that insist on giving women migrants education and training before they leave the Philippines.</p>
<p>However, Rodriguez intervenes by critiquing policies on professionalization. She writes, ‘migrants’ education and “decision-making” … deflect attention from the state’s role in actually (re)producing ideas of Filipinas’ docility as part of its labor brokerage strategy. Filipinas’ vulnerability is arguably a consequence of the racializing and gendering “marketing” practices of the Philippine state’ (p. 105). The individual responsibility put on migrant women to protect themselves through education and training, coupled with the labor brokerage system’s policies of individual responsibilization, releases nation-states and employers from becoming accountable for abuse and exploitation. Instead of migrant reform addressing the structural problems that leave migrant women vulnerable, the Philippine labor brokerage system relies on patriarchal understandings of femininity to police migrant women’s behaviors. Instead of examining and regulating the labor brokerage system, Rodriguez suggests, the state would rather wrongfully regulate migrant women’s actions and behavior as the solution to the potential risks of working abroad.</p>
<p>One of the most important points in this book is Rodriguez’s analysis of the paradox of the Philippine state’s roles as broker and protector of its migrant citizens by looking at a Filipino migrant factory workers’ strike in Brunei. With the context of national anxieties, the state promises protection to migrant workers in a variety of ways: through the Migrant Workers and Overseas Filipinos Act, in the terms of a regulated contract, grievance mechanisms in the Philippines and embassies or consulates overseas, advocacy in bilateral and diplomatic relations, and education and training. However, as Rodriguez’s observations show, much of the bureaucratic protection promised by the state is rendered invalid in other countries under foreign law. Rodriguez argues that the Philippine state designs parameters for migrant citizenship but that these promises are severely limited by the state’s allegiance to foreign employers and governments – the assurance for future diplomatic relations and exchange in labor brokerage. Underneath all of the legislation and state-to-state relations, the real losers are the migrant workers whose rights are incomprehensible upon departure and arrival.</p>
<p>In conclusion, Rodriguez sets out to dissect the migration apparatus under which the Philippine state continues to indiscriminately export Filipino people as laborers to the world. She is successful in laying bare the state’s bureaucracy, in which labor markets are efficiently researched and bilateral agreements are quickly ratified, and thus shows how migration is effectively processed and shipped out. The consequences of this arrangement are the state’s investments in new types of national belonging and relations with migrant citizens. An important contribution of this book to the literature on globalization is Rodriguez’s ability to demonstrate how migration is becoming the temporary fix for the gaping holes neoliberalism has left in the Philippine political economy, but that this design has been developed to become a ‘global norm’ for other countries in the same context. More importantly, at the end of the book, Rodriguez highlights the struggle of migrants to engage the state from their transnational locations, through a ‘transnational counter-hegemonic nationalism’.</p>

<title>Provocations and Future Directions</title>
<p>Both books are compelling and provocative works, though I am left with a few questions. Guevarra’s research reveals different vantage points of the labor brokerage system – from state institutional machinery to employment agencies to migrant workers themselves. For Guevarra, showing these different levels allowed her to unpack the cultural logic working in and through the labor brokerage system. In her final chapters regarding migrant workers, she argues that workers essentially internalize the racialized and gendered rhetoric of Filipinos as ideal workers. She further argues that Filipino nurses’ embrace of this rhetoric, coupled with hospital managements’ overdependence of Filipino workers, gets in the way of solidarity between the Filipinos and the other nurses. While I agree that Filipinos accept and incorporate ideas of flexibility and hard-work into their identities as migrant workers, Guevarra’s reliance on the cultural logic of these migrant ideologies does not take into account the specific political context in local and national geographies. Local conditions of employment and recent histories of immigration into particular towns can often swing cultures of Othering against visible immigrant groups. Regardless of how long Filipinos have been in Arizona, for example, their concentration as nurses make them easy targets for potential exclusionary practices, even by the very nurses they work with. The solidarity between workers may not only be influenced by Filipino migrants’ internalization of their ‘added value’ as workers but also by the local conditions of employment scarcity and racial dynamics. How do the cultural logics that migrate with Filipino nurses about their ideal work ethic intersect with anti-immigrant sentiment in their destinations, like in the US, especially Arizona? How is the ideology of the ideal Filipino global worker situated alongside racialized rhetoric of other communities of color in the US? How does this affect their interactions or potential for solidarity with other ethnic groups in the Philippines?</p>
<p>Rodriguez’s discussion of gender and the Philippine domestic left me wanting more ethnographic evidence about middle-class anxieties about women migrants leaving the Philippines. Filipinos’ apprehension about women migrants embodying national identity, Rodriguez posits, influences the gendering of national policy about migrants. In response to this social imaginary, intervention in gender sensitivity manifests in migrant policy through training and education seminars. Rodriguez argues that this approach to the gender vulnerability of migrants places responsibility on the shoulders of migrants rather than the employment conditions in foreign countries – an echo of neoliberal ideology of individualism. The surveys from the Social Weather Station (SWS) measuring public attitudes about women and migration gives Rodriguez a good platform to make her arguments about gender’s role in labor brokerage. However, there is also a wide middle-class celebration of migrant culture through various mass consumer media: movies, television shows, and music. These media outlets, along with historic cases of martyred migrants like Flor Contemplacion, encourage the extensive circulation of a deep reverence for women making sacrifices, regardless of what type of jobs they hold. How can we reconcile the circulation of contradictory migrant ideologies, popular icons, and middle-class anxieties? If these are both working representations of Philippine national identity to Filipinos and the world, how does this paradox play out in national policy affecting migrants?</p>
<p>Lastly, future directions that stem from these works are expansive. Spatiality of citizenship and its purposes for neoliberal profit and gain was undertheorized in both of these works. Scholars could use these works as ample evidence to show that neoliberal states also come in the form of non-hegemonic, developing governments; but they could also further theorize how the dispersion of citizens and the extra-territorialization of a nation-state could be viable avenues of incorporation into a neoliberal global economy. Also, both works touch on the gender and family as resources for labor brokerage. This area of interest is ripe for historical research, with respect to both its contemporary utilization by the state and the transfiguration of the family under these circumstances.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>At first glance, these works may look very similar; both are tackling the Philippine state’s labor brokerage system and the reconfiguration of citizenship, nationalism, and governance under neoliberal immigration policy. However, in reviewing these books, I find that the main differences in these books have everything to do with the scales each scholar chooses to take up and examine deeply. The scholars’ objectives are different in examining the inner workings of the Philippines’ labor brokerage system. On one hand, Guevarra’s interest in cultural logics that allow Filipinos to be exported and to work in the global labor market with large-scale consistency leads us to look at the labor brokerage system in terms of what she calls the ‘ethos of labor migration.’ Guevarra’s take on the messy and often contradictory ways that all actors – the state, labor agencies, and workers – internalize and function with ideologies of labor brokerage takes us deep into the micro-processes of migration. We are able to see how the ideologies push the export of migrants and how migrants submit themselves to the very cultural logics that market them to the world. Guevarra’s discussion of discourse is significant, because it allows us to understand how global ideologies of race and patriarchy are moored to neoliberal economic policies of migration. Her exploration of meso-level actors – labor agencies – figure into this picture to demonstrate the way culture becomes key in the intricate organization of the management and promotion of the Philippine migration industry. She traces these cultural logics from the state to agency and most importantly, to the ways this culture manifests in the most intimate of migrants’ lives – their thoughts about themselves and their families.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Rodriguez’s project is to break open the labor brokerage system at the level of institutions. Her interest in the systematization of labor and her ethnography of the state helps us see the mechanisms of labor brokerage on the level of state actors. Bilateral agreements and labor diplomacy expose how integrated neoliberalism is in the rationale of the Philippine state in brokering an alarming number of their citizens to the world. She shows us that a driving force for the Philippine state is to maintain its labor export system as efficient and effective, whether by introducing pliant protection measures via legislation or acquiescence to migrant exploitation for the sake of diplomatic relations. Her study allows us to understand the way labor brokerage states are constitutive of neoliberal globalization, as she studies the export of migrants from the vantage points of the state.</p>
<p>Guevarra and Rodriguez give us a uniquely detailed story on how labor brokerage systems work, reorganizing the lives of millions of people every day. These books are complementary for learning about a range of issues: the effects of neoliberalism, cultural and institutional, on migrants; the state’s role in export of people; the invention and maintenance of a culture of migration; the political and juridical mechanisms of a migration industry; the migration apparatus and bureaucracy that is a cornerstone of Philippine society. These scholars intervene in the sociological field by putting front and center the problem of neoliberalism in our generation. In these works, they remind us that the problems of ordinary people stem from the everyday recalibrations of governments, institutions, and agencies. Guevarra and Rodriguez exact a calculated and forceful critique against the systems of capitalism that broker labor and commodify people. Their works would be useful for any scholar looking to critique neoliberal globalization in addition to any student learning about neoliberalism’s impact around the world.</p>
