<p>We report synthesis and characterization of gold NPs/PVA composite films. Gold colloidal NPs were introduced into a PVA matrix by simple solution-casting method to obtain homogenous, transparent, and colored films. NPs and NC films with different contents of inorganic phase (0.7, 1.4, and 2.1 wt %) were characterized by UV/Vis and FTIR spectrophotometry. Dimensions of the colloidal NPs were obtained by TEM (d ∼ 15±3 nm) and compared with results obtained by AFM of NC films. Comparison of thermal properties of the pure PVA and NC films showed that thermal stability is slightly reduced. DSC measurements revealed that T<sub>g</sub> and melting temperatures of NCs are higher compared to pure PVA films.</p>

<p>The usage of semiconductor or metallic nanoparticles (NPs) as polymer fillers relates to the strong current interest in development and application of new materials.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021998311413624">1</xref></sup> Polymer nanocomposites (NCs) have been found successful in versatile applications such as organic batteries microelectronics, non-linear optics, and sensors. NCs combine size-dependant properties of NPs with properties of host polymers such as: possibility to be designed in various shapes, long-term stability, and reprocessability. Resulting properties of NCs are usually simple combination of the properties of inorganic and organic components, although the appearance of novel characteristics can take place due to synergistic effect. Therefore, it is important from a fundamental and practical point of view, to understand the effects of the incorporation of NPs on the physical and chemical properties of the NC.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021998311413624">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>With the advent of nanoscience and nanotechnology, gold NPs have turned out to play an important role because they have the potential to serve as building blocks for putting nanotechnology to practical use.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0021998311413624">3</xref></sup> Nobel metal nanostructures, especially gold NPs, have recently received much attention because of their unique optical, catalytic, and electrochemical properties which make them suitable materials for potential applications in various fields. Gold NPs have been found to play an important role in several catalytic,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0021998311413624">4</xref></sup> gas sensing processes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0021998311413624">5</xref></sup> and nanomedicine applications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0021998311413624">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>The successful applications of NPs require developed techniques for tuning their properties by controlling the size and shape at the nanoscale.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0021998311413624">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0021998311413624">8</xref></sup> Colloidal solutions of spherical gold NPs exhibit a deep red color due to the well-known surface plasmon absorption. The surface plasmon resonance is caused by coherent motion of the conduction band electrons, which interact with an electromagnetic field. Polarization of electrons with respect to the much heavier ionic core of a spherical NP is induced by the electromagnetic field of an incoming light wave. A net charge difference exists only at the particle surface, which in turn acts as a restoring force. In the simplest case, a dipolar oscillation of all electrons with the same phase is created. The observed color originates from the strong absorption of the metal NPs when the frequency of the electromagnetic field becomes resonant with the coherent electron motion. The frequency and width of the surface plasmon absorption depends on the size and shape of the gold NPs and on the dielectric constants of the metal itself and the surrounding medium.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0021998311413624">7</xref></sup> The surface plasmon resonance was theoretically explained by Mie in 1908.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0021998311413624">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>Poly(vinyl-alcohol) (PVA) is a suitable matrix for fabrication of composites with gold NPs. It is an important water-soluble polymer with good chemical and thermal stability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0021998311413624">10</xref></sup> and it has been successfully applied to prepare NCs, for example, Ag NPs/PVA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0021998311413624">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0021998311413624">12</xref></sup> and PbS NPs/PVA.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0021998311413624">13</xref></sup> Its excellent thin film forming properties and optical transparency offers good surrounding medium for metal NPs which can sustain their optical properties. At the same time, NPs can affect significantly matrix (PVA) leading to some new properties which are not present in either of the pure materials. Different fillers alter properties of PVA matrix in different ways.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0021998311413624">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0021998311413624">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the last few years, NCs formed using gold NPs and PVA have been prepared in a number of ways including various photochemical,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0021998311413624">14</xref></sup> heat-treating<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0021998311413624">15</xref></sup> and electrospinning <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0021998311413624">16</xref></sup> methods as well as using PVA based hydrogels instead of polymer solutions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0021998311413624">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0021998311413624">18</xref></sup> Sakamoto et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0021998311413624">14</xref></sup> showed that gold NPs can be prepared in PVA films in situ from Au ions and photochemically generated benzophenone ketyl radicals as reducing agent. Also, PVA alone can be used as reducing and stabilizing agent for generation of gold NPs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0021998311413624">15</xref></sup> The electrospinning method was used for preparation of gold NPs/PVA composite nanofibers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0021998311413624">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>One of the main problems in polymer NC technology is to obtain homogenous, stable dispersion and to avoid concentration gradient of NPs through the polymer matrix. In this study we used simple procedure for preparation of gold NPs/PVA NCs. Highly uniform gold NPs with an average diameter of 15 ± 3 nm synthesized in water were introduced into a PVA matrix by simple solution-casting method to obtain transparent, colored films after solvent evaporation. Obtained NC films were characterized by optical, morphological, and thermal techniques in order to reveal the way polymer matrix and NPs affect each other’s individual properties in NC. Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) measurements indicated the possible interaction between gold NPs and PVA matrix. Although many studies concerning gold/PVA NCs were published<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0021998311413624">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0021998311413624">18</xref></sup> there are few detailed studies of thermal properties of NCs. We discussed thermal properties of gold NPs/PVA NCs and compared them with properties of pure matrix. Also, we obtained melting enthalpies of NC films and used them to calculate PVA's degree of crystallinity in NCs.</p></sec>

<p>Gold NPs were prepared using sodium citrate as a reducing and stabilizing agent, according to procedure reported by Grabar et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0021998311413624">19</xref></sup> About 250 mL of aqueous solution of 1 mM HAuCl<sub>4</sub> was brought to a vigorous boiling, in a round-bottom flask fitted with a reflux condenser, with continuous stirring. Then, 25 mL of 38.8 mM sodium citrate was rapidly added to the boiling solution; final concentration of Au<sup>3+</sup> ions was 0.9 mM. The solution was boiled for another 15 min, during which time the solution's color changed from pale yellow to deep red (wine-red). The solution was allowed to cool to room temperature with continued stirring. Prepared colloidal solutions were mixed in an appropriate ratio with the 5 wt.% PVA aqueous solution, poured into Petri dishes and left in a dark place. After evaporation of water at room temperature, transparent red-violet colored films with thickness of about 30 µm were obtained. The final concentration of gold NPs in the films were about 0.7, 1.4, and 2.1 wt.%.</p></sec>

<p>Absorption spectra of colloidal dispersions (quartz cuvette, 10 mm path length, 4.5 mL capacity) and composite films (direct measurements, film located normal to the light pathway, measured in comparison to air) were acquired using a Thermo Evolution 600 UV-Vis spectrophotometer.</p>

<p>A colloidal gold NPs possesses an intense UV-Vis light surface plasmon absorption band centered on 524 nm, characteristic for a deep red color of dispersion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0021998311413624">Figure 1(a)</xref>). Such intensive absorption is induced by strong coupling of the NPs with the electromagnetic radiation. As a result, absorption maximum position depends on the size and shape of the particles. These information were obtained using TEM. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0021998311413624">Figure 2</xref>, the shape of NPs is nearly spherical and the average particle diameter was 15 ± 3 nm. Spontaneous organization of the gold NPs into chain-like structures is visible. A weak reducing agent, such as citrate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0021998311413624">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0021998311413624">20</xref></sup> will favor a slow reduction of Au<sup>3+</sup> ions allowing slow particle growth which can yield spherical NPs. Excess of citrate ions is used for electrostatic stabilization of NPs.

<p>The absorption spectra obtained for NCs films are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0021998311413624">Figure 1(b)-(d)</xref>. The NC films were transparent indicating that the colloidal particles were well dispersed in PVA. The spectra of NC films exhibit the same shape as gold NPs dispersion; they are characterized with just one peak with a smaller intensity, whose maximum is slightly moved to longer wavelengths compared to colloidal dispersion. This observation can be explained by reduction of the distances between gold NPs within the polymer matrix, that is, by a localized increase in the filling factor after evaporation of the solvent.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0021998311413624">21</xref></sup> The surface plasmon resonance band of gold NPs in NCs with 1.7 and 2.4 wt% of gold is red shifted for about 13 nm compared to the position of plasmon band of the initial dispersion. Theoretical calculations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0021998311413624">21</xref></sup> reveal that a distance between gold NPs has a significant influence on predicted absorption spectra. Highly dispersed gold NPs, considered as single particles, in solution should exhibit only one peak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0021998311413624">Figure 1(a)</xref>) while linked NPs show two absorbance maximums, due to formation ofelongated structures of linked NPs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0021998311413624">21</xref></sup> As the distance between particles decreases, the first peak becomes broader and moves to longer wavelengths before the second peak appears. The distance between gold NPs in our NC films was not small enough for appearance of second peak. Theoretical prediction gives us the distance between particles of about 4 nm for 13 nm peak maximum shift.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0021998311413624">21</xref></sup> A contribution to this shift can be expected also due to the differences of the dielectric constants of the surrounding media (refractive indexes ofwater and PVA medium are 1.333 and 1.521, respectively).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0021998311413624">22</xref></sup> Obviously, spectrum of NC film with the lowest gold NPs loading (0.7 wt %) is mainly influenced by changes of dielectric constant of the matrix; absorbance maximum was shifted for only 2 nm and gold NPs can be considered as single particles.</p>
<p>The shape of the surface of NCs films has been revealed using AFM. The AFM image of Au/PVA NC in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0021998311413624">Figure 3</xref>, indicates presence of some structures (cavities, furrows, and prominent sphere-like parts) on its surface, for the studied filling range. Crystallinity of NCs was checked by XRD measurements and diffractograms are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0021998311413624">Figure 4</xref>. The scattering pattern of amorphous polymers usually has two rings, one of a short-range order and the other of hexagonal ordering of molecular chains. In the diffractogram of pure PVA, there was a broad peak appearing at 2θ ≈ 19.5°, corresponding to the van der Waals distance of 4.5–5 Å between neighboring chains, short-range order. The intensity of that peak increases when gold NPs were embedded in NC PVA films, with increasing concentration of loading, implying that the short-range crystallinity of PVA was increased. The other peak at about 2<italic>θ</italic> ≈ 42°, which can be assigned to hexagonal ordering of neighboring chains, was not observable in pure PVA or NC films. The three peaks, at near 38.3°, 44.5°, and 64.7°, can be seen in diffractograms of NC films, which are assigned to the diffractions of (1 1 1), (2 0 0), and (2 20) planes, demonstrating that face-centered cubic metal gold structure is formed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0021998311413624">23</xref></sup>

<p>In order to determine what kind of interaction between gold NPs and the PVA matrix had taken place, FTIR measurements were performed. Corresponding spectra are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0021998311413624">Figure 5</xref>. In this Figure a broad absorption noticed at 3262 cm<sup>−1</sup> due to the O-H stretching vibrations and sharp peak at 2920 cm<sup>−1</sup> attributed to the stretching vibrations of methylene group can be seen for all samples. Although no remarkable changes were observed, the changes in the intensity of the small and sharp band at 285 4m<sup>−1</sup> were clearly visible, related also to the stretching of methylene group. The intensity of this band gradually increases with the content of the gold NPs, because of the addition of methylene groups from citrate ions. Also, the bands of low intensity at 1720, 1655, and 1565 cm<sup>−1</sup> which can be assigned to C=C stretching mode in PVA, can be seen. The slight longwave displacement of the maximum band from 1565 to 1590 cm<sup>−1</sup> and appearance of the doublet bands at 1737–1710 cm<sup>−1</sup> are also observed in the NCs spectra due to the stretching vibration of the citrate carboxy group. Probably these changes reflect a competition between negative charged citrate ions and oxygen atom of the PVA hydroxyl groups for the adsorption on the gold NP surface. A similar effect was also observed by Bakeeva et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0021998311413624">24</xref></sup>

<sec id="sec8-0021998311413624"><title>Thermal properties of gold/PVA nanocomposite films</title>
<p>The information about thermal stability of the PVA polymer and the effect of gold NPs on its stability was obtained from TGA measurements in inert and air atmosphere. Thermal decomposition in inert atmosphere of neat PVA and gold/PVA NCs with different gold content is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0021998311413624">Figure 6(A)</xref>. It is reported that PVA consists of two inextricably mixed phases: crystalline solid and amorphous glass. This results in quite a complex behavior when the polymer is heated. The thermal degradation process of PVA has been a subject of numerous studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0021998311413624">25</xref></sup> and usually involves multiple steps assigned to: vaporization of volatile content and elimination of side-groups at the lower temperature, followed by breakdown of the polymer backbone at higher temperatures. The TGA curves of our samples are characterized by a few weight loss steps. In the first stage up to 200°C there are nearly no differences between the neat PVA and the NCs in the thermal stability. Also, the presence of NPs in NC films does not affect degradation mechanism itself, but has influence on overall thermal stability of the PVA matrix. This step is attributed to loss of bonded/or physically absorbed water. The major weight loss is the second step observed in the range of 200–350°C, which may be responsible for the structural decomposition of the PVA, followed by a next step in the range 350–500°C, leaving a high amount of residues. The dominant processes appeared during this stage is elimination of OH groups and chain–scission reactions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0021998311413624">26</xref></sup> The major decomposition products are polyenes generated from the dehydration reaction of PVA chains. Existence of two polyene structures, conjugated and non-conjugated, after first degradation process of NC with highly hydrolyzed PVA, was confirmed in literature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0021998311413624">27</xref></sup> Further degradation of non-conjugated polyenes induced by chain-scission reactions led toward formation of <italic>cis</italic> and <italic>trans</italic> methyl derivatives. Throughout the second degradation step that occurs between 400°C and 480°C the chain-scission reaction and reactions of Diels-Alder intramolecular and intermolecular cyclization prevailed. During the chain-scission reaction low-molecular-weight polyenes, acetaldehyde, and acetone are generated by decomposition of high-molecular-weight polyenes. The reactions of Diels-Alder cyclizations are responsible for cyclization and the condensation of polyaromatic structures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0021998311413624">27</xref></sup> Unlike some other PVA NC systems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0021998311413624">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0021998311413624">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0021998311413624">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0021998311413624">27</xref></sup> our NCs display the beginning of the main degradation process at lower temperatures compared to pure PVA (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0021998311413624">Table 1</xref>). Thermal properties of NC are strongly correlated with properties of matrix (PVA) and type of filler NPs (metal or semiconductor, etc.), as well as shape of NPs and type of interaction between NPs and polymer matrix. The differences between pure PVA and NCs decrease with increasing temperature and at the 50% mass loss, results presented in<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0021998311413624">Table 1</xref>, just temperature for NC with lowest gold NPs concentration is lower by 5.5°C compared to pure PVA. The other two NCs with higher NPs loading have 50% mass loss at higher temperatures (5.3°C- 1.4wt.% and 13.6°C- 2.1wt.%). Kumar et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0021998311413624">28</xref></sup> have observed a similar trend with magnetite NPs filler. We would like to stress a significant increase in the residual weight of the NCs compared to the pure polymer. The char yield at 600°C of the NCs is 10% higher than that of pure PVA. The similar effects on the char yield show silver NPs in PVA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0021998311413624">11</xref></sup> and sago starch<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0021998311413624">29</xref></sup> matrix. The observed behavior is most likely the consequence of the attachment of the PVA chains on the surface of the gold NPs.

<p>Under oxidative conditions (air), the mechanism of the degradation process from room temperature to 600°C, is the same for pure PVA and NC films and it consists of four steps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0021998311413624">Figure 6(B)</xref>). At the beginning, around 100°C loss of bonded/or physically absorbed water can be observed. This process is followed by three complex processes: partial dehydration of PVA accompanied by polyene formation (∼300°C); polyene decomposition in the α position at the tertiary carbon atom to form macroradicals, the destruction of the macroradicals yielding low-mass oxygen-containing products such as acetaldehyde, benzaldehyde, acrolein, and the decomposition of polyene macroradicals to <italic>cis</italic> and <italic>trans</italic> derivates, the latter formation of polyconjugated aromatic structures as a result of intramolecular cyclization and condensation (∼400°C); and thermo-oxidation of carbonized residue (∼500°C).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0021998311413624">30</xref></sup></p>
<p>The thermo-oxidative stability of our NC films was lower compared to pure PVA film, for all NP loadings as can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0021998311413624">Figure 6(b)</xref>. The degradation process begins at lower temperatures for NC films and temperatures at 50% weight loss were 6°C, 11°C, and 12°C lower than for pure PVA. The difference increases with increasing NP loading (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0021998311413624">Table 1</xref>). It seems that the presence of gold NPs catalyzed the thermo-oxidative degradations of polymer matrix. Residual masses after second and third degradation steps were higher for NC films compared to pure PVA. The differences also increase with increasing NP loadings. Residual masses at 600°C follow the same low, excluding NC with the lowest NP loading which has the same residual mass as pure PVA. Residual masses in oxidative atmosphere were lower than in inert atmosphere where pyrolization produces amorphous carbon.</p>
<p>PVA is semicrystalline polymer with melting temperature close to the start of degradation process. This property complicates conclusions about its crystallinity from melting temperature measurements. DSC curves of pure PVA and NCs are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0021998311413624">Figure 7</xref> and data obtained from measurements are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0021998311413624">Table 2</xref>. All measured samples have the same shape of DSC curve and exhibit three endothermic transitions, first belongs to glass transition (Tg) at about 62°C–[68°C, second endothermic peak at ∼ 150°C belongs to α relaxation associated with the crystalline region,<sup>31</sup> and narrow peak at about 216-218°C denoted as melting point of polymer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0021998311413624">Figure 7(A)</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0021998311413624">Table 2</xref>). The NCs are found to have a slightly higher T<sub>g</sub> values (about 2-6°C) compared to the neat PVA (62°C). The T<sub>g</sub> relaxation process results from micro-Brownian motion of the main-chain backbone. This is probably a result of interactions existing between gold NPs and PVA that prevent segment motions of the polymer chains and their chain packing density in the vicinity of the NPs. These data are supported by the FTIR measurements. In general, the T<sub>g</sub> values of polymer can be affected by its environment when the chain is within several nanometers of another phase. Also, another important parameter is that some polymer chains are in direct contact with the gold surface while others are at a certain distance from the NP.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0021998311413624">31</xref></sup> The mobility of chains which have only one contact with the surface is expected to be different than the mobility of chains which have many contacts with the surface.

Degree of crystallization decrease for all NCs compared to pure PVA film and has a minimum for a NC with 1.4 wt% of Au. Similar results were obtained by Peng et. al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0021998311413624">33</xref></sup> when silica NPs were introduced in PVA matrix. All silica/PVA NCs with more than 0.5wt% of inorganic phase had decreased degree of crystallinity.</p>
<p>The broadening of the exothermic peak and moving to lower temperatures with an increase in the inorganic phase content in Au/PVA NC films can be seen at <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0021998311413624">Figure 7(B)</xref>. The crystallization temperature of the NCs is for ∼20°C lower compared to the pure PVA (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0021998311413624">Table 2</xref>). Considering the cooling process of pure PVA and NCs, it should be stressed that degradation of PVA starts at temperatures very close to melting temperatures. As can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0021998311413624">Figure 7(A)</xref>, curves are increasing steeply after melting peak for all NCs. It is possible that some degradation products also participate in the crystallization processes of NCs. The crystallization peak of NCs is moved to lower temperatures and is much broader compared to pure PVA, showing that bulk like fraction of PVA is decreasing with increasing filler loading. The ordered association of the PVA molecules was decreased by the presence of gold NPs, meaning that the PVA molecules were highly constrained by inorganic phase. This suggests also, that the NPs prevent crystal thickening. However, the opposite behavior occurs when the PbS NPs were used as inorganic phase in PVA NC – increased crystallization temperature of PVA was observed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0021998311413624">13</xref></sup> The possible reason for that, except intrinsic properties of the inorganic phase, can be significantly higher concentration of the PbS NPs (4.6 wt%, d ∼ 3 nm) in NC, compared to concentration of gold NPs (0.7-2.1 wt%, d ∼ 15 ± 3 nm) in NC films that were the subject of this publication.</p></sec></sec>

<p>Gold NPs/ PVA NC films were synthesized by solution-casting method and transparent, colored films were obtained after solvent evaporation. Absorption maximum assigned to gold NPs, moved to red part of the spectra for 13 nm, after incorporation in PVA matrix. FTIR measurements revealed that interaction between gold NPs and PVA chains is weak. The influence of gold NPs on overall thermal stability of PVA matrix was investigated by TGA and DSC analysis. It was found that presence of gold NPs does not change mechanism of degradation in inert/air atmosphere. Thermal and thermo-oxidative degradation of NC films start at lower temperatures compared to pure PVA film, but NCs ended degradation process with higher residual masses. The presence of gold NPs in PVA matrix slightly increases T<sub>g</sub> and melting temperature of polymer. The crystallization temperatures of PVA matrix decrease in the presence of gold NPs, for ∼ 20°C. Degree of PVA crystallization in pure and NC films, was calculated using appropriate model. Decrease of crystallization degree for all NCs compared to pure PVA film was observed, most probably due to prevention of PVA crystal thickening in the presence of inorganic phase.</p></sec>
