<p>In 2011, Polity Press launched the book series <italic>Theory and the Media</italic>. In addition to <italic>Castells and the Media</italic> the series consists of <italic>Kittler and the Media</italic> by Geoffrey Winthrop-Young, <italic>Žižek and the Media </italic>by Paul A. Taylor and <italic>Virilio and the Media</italic> by John Armitage. As the title of the series reveals, these are books on philosophers’ and theorists’ thoughts on media and media technology’s impact on society. The book on Castells is written by Philip N. Howard, an Associate Professor of Communication, Information and International Studies at the University of Washington. Howard has written extensively on the influence of information technology and the Internet on politics, democracy and society. </p>
<p>In the first chapter of the book, Howard recommends some reading for a short or more thorough insight into Castells’ work (pp. 14 f.). He also provides a guide to Castells’ work for readers from disciplines such as geography, organizational behaviour, economy, political science and sociology (pp. 15 f.). Chapter one gives a very brief insight to the main ideas of Castells’ notion of the network society and how this can be applied to the media. This chapter is helpful to readers not familiar with Castells; it is also useful for scholars interested in media technology and the network perspective. In this chapter, Howard makes some specific recommendations for sociologists when it comes to reading Castells’ <italic>The Rise of the Network Society</italic> (which is the title of the first volume of Castells’ three-volume magnus opum <italic>The Information Age</italic>). We are told that sociologists tend to prefer chapters one, four and five. In the same manner, in addition to chapter one, I can recommend chapters five and six of Howard’s book. </p>
<p>Chapter five introduces the notions of ‘space of flows’ and ‘timeless time’ from <italic>The Information Age</italic>. Howard defines space of flows as ‘[…] the location through which media infrastructure allows for social life from different locations to proceed as if the locations are actually present and proximate’ (p. 80). And timeless time is defined as ‘[…] our sense that past and future converge in the present because digital media bring us things that have already happened and allow us to immediately experience culture produced far away’ (p. 81). Howard then links Castells theories to prominent globalization scholars such as Giddens, Beck and Sassen. Where Sassen argues that physical space becomes more important in the globalized age, because of the increased importance of global cities (New York, London and Tokyo in particular) where corporate centres are located, Castells argues that space is important because of what streams through them. These cities are merely nodes in information networks. </p>
<p>In Chapter six, Howard introduces the most common criticism of Castells, which I think is important. One of these is that the network perspective only applies to Western countries. Howard also suggests that we need more research on how the network society creates social inequality. This is an important perspective in Castells’ work, but it is not sufficiently grounded empirically. Moreover, there is a great body of literature on the digital divide which stands well on its own feet, without being fused with Castells’ network perspective. Castells’ work is also criticized for lack of clarity when it comes to agency and causality, and for lacking a clear embedding in social network theory. </p>
<p>Howard presents Castells’ notion of two important terms; power (chapter three) and culture (chapter four). From a network perspective, power is the ability to project power over existing networks, as well as to construct new networks (p. 38). The network perspective also has potential for resistance. As demonstrated by the Arab Spring, the power in being connected to digital media networks can potentially change politics. For Castells, culture and information technology are intertwined – ‘culture is the relations of production, consumption, power, and experience – along with the information infrastructure that supports these relations’ (p. 57). A crucial aspect of the network perspective is that technology merely represents the material tools that can realize human motivations for action. Illustratively, Howard states that our identities have always been plural, but we now have digital media to ‘reinforce the cultural affiliations that we value, not just the ones that institutions of nation or religion impose upon us’ (p. 72). Thinking of technology as material tools makes the network perspective interesting and relevant for sociologists, but Castells has a tendency to exaggerate the importance of being connected to the network over other structural elements. </p>
<p>Many media theorists put media at centre stage of social life. In Castells’ case, however, his focus on (digital) media can also be attributed to his interest for social philosophy and the pursuit of an overarching and coherent theoretical framework that shall capture every aspect of society. This is sometimes overly ambitious, but if read critically and pragmatically it contributes to our understanding of the media’s influence on social life. And Howard has written a book that will be of help when applying Castells’ ideas to empirical research. </p>
<p>Castells is an important figure in our understanding of the influence of digital media on society, whether one accepts his theory or not. With the exception of the small and sometimes impossible to read visual illustrations of different media networks, Howard has written a readily accessible introduction to Castells’ work on the network perspective and how digital technology is changing social structure. For students and researchers who need an introduction to Castells’ media theory, Howard’s book is thus recommended.</p>
