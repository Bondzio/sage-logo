<abstract>
<p>In this article, we argue that prior organizations research has contributed to the erosion of the natural environment by failing to discriminate physical materiality from sociomateriality. The time–space attributes of physical materiality are more immutable than sociomateriality, so the compression of time and space in and by organizations is disrupting the cycles of the natural environment. We illustrate this point through the example of carbon markets. The development of futures and other financial derivatives contributes to the compression of time, whereas the movement of capital worldwide contributes to the compression of space. This time–space compression disembodies financial instruments from their physical target, namely, carbon, leading to the distortion of the instrument’s “real” value and hampering carbon emissions reductions. We call for organizational theories that more fully account for physical materiality.</p>

<p>SAGE published its first issue of this journal in 1987—the same year the Brundtland Commission released its report titled <italic>Our Common Future</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-1086026612475069">World Commission on Environment and Development, 1987</xref>) that popularized the term <italic>sustainable development</italic>. At that time, the full scale of environmental issues had not yet come into view. Managers often diminished or dismissed the relevance of the natural environment to business decisions, so researchers studying the natural environment were seen as either environmental advocates or those whose interests were marginal.</p>
<p>In recent years, however, the degradation of the natural environment is coming into full view. The ecological footprint of humans is indisputable, and its impact on business is being felt. Increasingly, both managers and researchers are recognizing the gravity of the relationship between organizations and the natural environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1086026612475069">Reid &amp; Toffel, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1086026612475069">Reinecke, Manning, &amp; Von Hagen, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>In spite of the increased managerial attention and academic legitimacy of the natural environment in organizational studies, management research still relies heavily on existing management practices and theories—the same practices and theories that have contributed to environmental problems. Research on the natural environment often takes a back seat in management research, treated as just another issue or empirical context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1086026612475069">Bansal &amp; Gao, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1086026612475069">Hoffmann, Trautmann, &amp; Hamprecht, 2009</xref>). Framing the natural environment as merely a context or issue, rather than focusing on its unique attributes, may actually prevent researchers from making the frame-breaking insights needed to reconcile the needs of business with the demands of the natural environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1086026612475069">Maguire &amp; Hardy, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-1086026612475069">Wijen &amp; Ansari, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>In this article, we take a step forward by attempting to identify the unique attributes of the natural environment. Specifically, we argue that the natural environment has a <italic>physical materiality</italic> that organizations lack. We define physical materiality as objects that have mass and thereby possess objective temporal and spatial qualities. Because of the emphasis on organizations, prior work has ignored the uniqueness of the natural environment and provided a potentially oversocialized view of the world.</p>
<p>Two research areas can inform that interface between the physical and social worlds. First, research on sociomateriality acknowledges the importance of the physical world in management and organizations, arguing that organizational life is the result of the coproduction or mutual constitution of the social and physical worlds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1086026612475069">Law &amp; Mol, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1086026612475069">Orlikowski &amp; Scott, 2008</xref>). These scholars often explore the duality between technology and organizations (both sociomaterial), recognizing that physical materiality is an important part of that sociomateriality. Arguments regarding structuration and duality, however, are applied to the context of organizations and have not extended beyond those boundaries to the natural environment. Consequently, even the approach to materiality by this stream of literature takes on a sociological hue; however, its careful discussion of the social and material worlds can inform our analysis.</p>
<p>Second, the field of economic geography explores the role that organizations and people play in the natural environment, in particular, by analyzing the dimensions of time and space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1086026612475069">Harvey, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1086026612475069">Lefebvre, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1086026612475069">Thrift, 1983</xref>). However, little research in human geography has permeated the walls of management and organizational theory. This body of work provides us the tools and language that permit an analysis of the relationship between physical materiality and sociomateriality.</p>
<p>Our ambition in this article is to integrate insights from sociomateriality and economic geography to inform the relationship between organizations and the natural environment. In particular, we argue that, compared with physical materiality, time and space in sociomateriality are more prone to time–space compression, in which the world seems increasingly smaller and time seems increasingly shorter. Given the relative immutability of time and space in physical materiality, the natural environment bears the cost of the time–space compression occurring in and by organizations.</p>
<p>We illustrate these ideas through the example of carbon markets. Whereas <italic>carbon</italic> possesses physical materiality, <italic>carbon markets</italic> are social constructions. The instruments developed by carbon markets to manage carbon (i.e., sociomateriality), such as futures and other financial derivatives, compress time and space. Yet the temporal and spatial qualities of carbon (i.e., physical materiality) cannot be easily compressed. We show that the resulting time–space mismatch can actually contribute to, rather than reduce, carbon emissions. Such recognition of the unique temporal and spatial qualities of physical materiality can be extended more broadly to organizations and other aspects of the natural environment.</p>
<p>Admittedly, our goal in this article is modest. We do not build new theory. Rather, we expose an important omission in prior work on organizations and the natural environment, in particular, the impact of time–space compression in organizations on the physical materiality of the natural environment. However, the challenge we pose for researchers of organizations and the natural environment is not modest. We hope that our description of physical materiality and the distortions caused by time–space compression will inspire new theorizing that will ultimately lead to greater harmony in the relationship between organizations and the natural environment.</p>

<title>The Physical Materiality of the Natural Environment</title>
<p>The natural environment is composed of physical objects—both living and nonliving. Physical objects have mass that can be assigned to a particular point on a grid in Cartesian space that occurs at a particular point on a clock or calendar. So, the movement of nitrogen, carbon, oxygen, phosphorous, and water can be mapped over space and time and shown to shape the geology and biology of the natural environment. The time and space attributes of physical objects, at a nonquantum level, are generally incontrovertible—most observers can agree on the point in time and space that physical objects occupy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1086026612475069">Ancona, Okhuysen, &amp; Perlow, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1086026612475069">Butler, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1086026612475069">Orlikowski &amp; Yates, 2002</xref>). For example, the location of a factory can be communicated by its latitude and longitude or by its position relative to other landmarks, and the time of the observation can be recorded.</p>
<p>The discussion of physical materiality has only minimally permeated organizational theory. One important contribution to this area is <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-1086026612475069">Whiteman and Cooper’s (2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-1086026612475069">2011)</xref> ethnographic account of management practices of the Cree Indians of James Bay, Canada. These authors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-1086026612475069">Whiteman &amp; Cooper, 2011</xref>) describe the sense-making processes of these communities. They show that the Cree Indians were particularly adept at noticing, bracketing, and selecting vital cues in their landscape, such as the force of a forest fire or subtle changes in climate. Whiteman and Cooper attribute the Cree’s responsiveness to changes in physical materiality to their embeddedness in the natural environment. Research on organizations and climate change also acknowledges the role of physical materiality on organizations. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1086026612475069">Linnenluecke, Griffiths, and Winn (2012)</xref> identify a range of extreme weather and climate events, ranging from hurricanes to new climate futures, that shape organizational responses ranging from resistance to anticipatory adaptation. Physical materiality, therefore, has been shown to shape organizational behavior.</p>

<title>The Sociomateriality of Organizations</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1086026612475069">Leonardi (2012</xref>, p. 28) defines materiality as those “properties of the artifact that do not change from one moment to the next or across differences in location.” Early work in materiality treated the physical environment as distinct from the social environment (explained in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1086026612475069">Orlikowski, 2007</xref>). Organizations were seen as assemblages of material elements (e.g., computers and desks) and social elements (e.g., organizational structures, cultures, and values). More recent work, under the rubric of sociomateriality, argues that the social aspects of organizations cannot be isolated from its material aspects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1086026612475069">Orlikowski &amp; Scott, 2008</xref>). Organizations are regarded as being <italic>sociomaterial</italic> because the social and material are mutually constituted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1086026612475069">Latour, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1086026612475069">Orlikowski &amp; Scott, 2008</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1086026612475069">Orlikowski (2007</xref>, p. 1438), “We can gain considerable analytical insight if we give up on treating the social and the material as distinct and largely independent spheres of organizational life.” To understand an organization’s structure requires an understanding of the physical structures (e.g., buildings, offices, workspaces, and computers) of organizational work. The material environment does not act on the social environment or vice versa; one cannot be defined and described without the other.</p>
<p>Much of the work in this field explores the relationship between technology and organizations. Researchers argue that information storage and communications within organizations depend both on social relationships and the technology they employ (e.g., personal digital assistants, extranets, and collaborative authoring tools; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1086026612475069">Leidner &amp; Kayworth, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1086026612475069">Rice &amp; Gattiker, 2001</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1086026612475069">Orlikowski (2007)</xref> illustrates sociomateriality by describing the example of Internet-searching using Google. At face value, the Internet user appears to possess the power to search for information, yet that search effort depends on the physical infrastructure that Google built, including its servers, directories, and databases. Embodied in those material elements are the ideas, priorities, and preferences of the individuals and groups involved in developing the material objects. Google searching, then, becomes a mangle of the sociological and the material, giving rise to sociomateriality.</p>
<p>Whereas the concept of <italic>sociomateriality</italic> provides the language to discriminate the social from the <italic>material</italic>, we argue that the conceptualization of the material blurs the social and the <italic>physical</italic>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1086026612475069">Orlikowski (2007)</xref> claims that materiality can be both visible, such as desks and buildings, and invisible, such as electricity and voice and data systems. However, objects with mass have incontrovertible temporal and spatial qualities that can be measured, sensed, and verified. Identifying the location and size of a desk can yield a single response, but identifying the location of the Internet or a conference call will yield multiple answers. As well, temporal and spatial attributes are more difficult to manipulate for physical objects than for more social objects. A database, for example, can be divided, reassembled, and edited, whereas carbon’s physical properties are difficult to change. Discriminating physical materiality from more social forms of materiality is a central theme in this article, given that prior discussions of materiality often confounds the two.</p>

<title>Time and Space in Economic Geography</title>
<p>The discipline of geography tackles the interface between human environment and the physical environment through their relationships with time and space: “Space does not exist without matter and the objective qualities of time–space cannot be understood, therefore, independently of the qualities of material processes” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1086026612475069">Harvey, 1989</xref>, p. 203). The subdiscipline of economic geography is particularly salient to business because of its interest in applying the interaction of economic activities and geographic space to explain economic development and human behavior. Economic geographers argue that the distribution of capital across time and space shapes social, cultural, and institutional arrangements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1086026612475069">Castells, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1086026612475069">Harvey, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1086026612475069">Leyshon &amp; Thrift, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>Historical approaches to economic geography considered Cartesian space and clock time. The objects of interest lay on a map and occur on a timeline. However, more recent approaches to economic geography shift the frame of analysis to acknowledge the role of social interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1086026612475069">Dear &amp; Flusty, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1086026612475069">Giddens, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1086026612475069">Gregory, Martin, &amp; Smith, 1994</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1086026612475069">Harvey (1989)</xref>, in particular, challenges the idea of a single and objective sense of time or space, against which we can measure the diversity of human conceptions and perceptions: “I shall not argue for a total dissolution of the objective-subjective distinction, but insist, rather that we recognize the multiplicity of the objective qualities which space and time can express and the role of human practices in their construction” (p. 203). Social time–space is the relevant environment in which events occur and the way in which networks and teams are organized.</p>
<p>Whereas, on the one hand, economic geography is moving toward a more human-centric sense of time and space, organizational sociology is moving toward a greater recognition of materiality in organizations. In many ways, the paths of these two disciplines are converging. Combined, they expose an important opportunity to inform research on organizations and the natural environment. Organizational sociology describes the objects of interest, specifically physical materiality and sociomateriality, and economic geography provides the tools of analysis, specifically time and space.</p>

<title>Time–Space Compression in Sociomateriality</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1086026612475069">Harvey (1989)</xref> argues that changes in communications, transportation, and urban planning have influenced space and time by shrinking distances and accelerating time, which he labels <italic>time–space compression</italic>. For example, the simple process of canning foods compresses time, connecting one moment of time to a future moment. In the 20th century, the development of the combustible engine and a super network of highways meant that goods that previously took months to move from one coast of the United States to the other could now be moved in days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1086026612475069">May &amp; Thrift, 2001</xref>). From the introduction of the railway to the opening of the airways, we are now able to circle the earth almost as quickly as it rotates on its axis around the sun. From the telephone, to the cell phone, to the Internet, the movement of voice and images instantaneously erases vast distances. The physical manifestation of the world can now be experienced from the comfort of our laptops. Images of people from the other side of the world appear in “real” time on the screen on our desktop, seemingly erasing physical distance. Such indications of time and space compression are even reflected in everyday idioms, such as “it’s a small world” and “time flies.”</p>
<p>These issues of time and space compression are not just the vocation of geographers but are also the import of sociologists. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1086026612475069">Giddens (1990)</xref>, for example, explores similar phenomena under the rubric of time–space distanciation. Virtual “meetings” replace physical face-to-face interactions, which releases the constraints of time and space. Consequently, the number of relationships is exploding, resulting in ever-increasing complexity in the web of interdependencies among people. We now can “friend” strangers we will never meet, organize conference calls with people distributed across the world in different time zones, and distribute our own content to thousands with the mere push of a button. Social networks take on new meanings because of our ability to transcend time and space.</p>
<p>Although time–space compression and distanciation acknowledge changes in communication, transportation, and capitalization, they focus on different, almost opposing, outcomes. Whereas time–space compression investigates the shrinking of distance and the shifting of time, distanciation emphasizes the fracturing of social relationships. Communications technology, for example, has allowed us to shrink (compress) the distance between friends from around the world, but it has also contributed to more shallow (distant) social ties. In this article, we have opted to apply the concepts of time–space compression, given that the target of our analysis is the interface between organizations and the natural environment and not social relationships.</p>
<p>Although sociologists and economic geographers acknowledge that, in organizational environments, time and space are shifting, few organizational scholars have considered the implications of these shifts on the natural environment (exceptions being Sharma &amp; Kearins, 2001; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-1086026612475069">Whiteman &amp; Cooper, 2011</xref>). In the next section, we explore these issues through the illustration of carbon markets. Whereas carbon possesses physical materiality, the markets created to manage carbon possess sociomateriality. In the next section, we describe carbon markets, the time–space compression caused by these markets, and the influence of time–space compression on the management of carbon.</p>

<title>Time–Space Compression in Carbon Markets</title>
<sec id="section7-1086026612475069">
<title>The Physical Materiality of Carbon</title>
<p>Carbon is a naturally occurring, abundant element on which most living organisms are based. Carbon can bind easily with other chemical elements, such as hydrogen or oxygen, to form molecules, which move between living organisms and act as the link between all living things. These attributes are important to understand before analyzing their relationship to carbon markets. Carbon molecules have material properties with temporal and spatial signatures animated in complex and dynamic cycles. Climate change is the result not merely from having, in absolute terms, too much or too little carbon in the land, water, or sky but also from disruptions in the balance of carbon moving between cycles. The overall stock of carbon remains relatively unchanged on this planet, but its form and place in the carbon cycles are dynamic. Therefore, to manage nature’s balance requires an appreciation of the temporal and spatial qualities of carbon as manifest in carbon cycles.</p>
<p>Carbon moves through both short-term and long-term cycles among three reservoirs: atmospheric, oceanic, and terrestrial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1086026612475069">Trabalka, 1985</xref>). The short-term carbon cycle, which includes photosynthesis, plant and animal respiration, and the movement of carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) across the air–sea interface, transfers carbon from one reservoir to another in a matter of years. Plants and soils are the most significant reservoir of the short-term cycle. They store 2,200 gigatonnes (Gt) of carbon (three times as much as the atmosphere). Plants and soils release and store carbon on time scales, ranging from seasons to thousands of years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1086026612475069">Leemans &amp; van den Born, 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>The long-term carbon cycle occurs very slowly over thousands to millions of years and consists of processes such as the transformation of carbon into limestone and its subsequent release as the rock weathers. Sedimentary rocks, including the organic sediments that contain fossil fuels, are the largest reservoir of carbon (representing roughly 65.5 million Gt) and the most significant component of the long-term carbon cycle.</p>
<p>The short-term and long-term cycles entrain the flow of carbon among the reservoirs and achieve a balance. Human industrial activities, however, disrupt these cycles, taking the carbon stored in terrestrial reservoirs and transferring it to atmospheric reservoirs. In particular, burning coal and other fossil fuels releases carbon that might otherwise remain contained in terrestrial or submarine sources for millennia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1086026612475069">Sulzman, 2000</xref>). Although carbon moves from the atmosphere to terrestrial and oceanic reservoirs naturally, this process can take up to a thousand years.</p>
<p>The rate at which carbon is released through anthropogenic processes, such as clearing forests and burning fossil fuels, far exceeds the rate at which carbon is sinking naturally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1086026612475069">Schimel, 1995</xref>). The carbon balance is disrupted as anthropogenic activities release carbon into the atmospheric reservoir at a rate far greater than the rate that these gases can be transferred back into terrestrial and marine reservoirs. As carbon shifts from long-term cycles to short-term cycles, the carbon systems that support life are destabilizing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1086026612475069">Canadell et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1086026612475069">
<title>The Sociomateriality of Carbon Markets</title>
<p>Carbon markets, also labeled <italic>cap and trade</italic> and <italic>emissions trading</italic>, have been developed in an effort to reduce carbon emissions. Regulators place a cap on the amount of carbon that can be emitted by firms. When a firm’s carbon emissions exceed this cap, the firm must purchase credits from other firms that emit less than the cap. The cap establishes the level of emissions, and any emissions beyond this cap must be offset by emissions reductions.</p>
<p>Several jurisdictions operate carbon-trading systems. The most established system is the European Union Emissions Trading System (EU ETS), which caps the emissions of more than 10,000 industrial facilities in Europe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1086026612475069">Boykoff, Bumpus, Liverman, &amp; Randalls, 2009</xref>). A number of other countries have also developed trial voluntary emissions trading systems, including the United States, Japan, China, South Korea, and Australia.</p>
<p>Numerous scholars have criticized the carbon markets, highlighting design flaws, failures, and pervasive weaknesses in implementation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1086026612475069">Bäckstrand &amp; Lövbrand, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1086026612475069">Böhm &amp; Dhabi, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1086026612475069">Böhm, Misoczky, &amp; Moog, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1086026612475069">Bond, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1086026612475069">Knight, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1086026612475069">Lohmann, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1086026612475069">MacKenzie, 2009</xref>). However, the literature has yet to take account of spatial and temporal dynamics seriously. We contend that carbon markets can shed light on broader socioeconomic trends, particularly the spatial and temporal relationships between social and physical systems.</p>
<p>Carbon markets trade two main types of credits: allowances and offsets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1086026612475069">Michaelowa, 2004</xref>). Allowances represent the permission to emit greenhouse gases; offsets represent actual reductions in emissions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1086026612475069">Knox-Hayes, 2010a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1086026612475069">Labatt &amp; White, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1086026612475069">Lawrence, Suddaby, &amp; Leca, 2009</xref>). We illustrate time–space compression by describing the trading of offsets, in particular Certified Emission Reductions (CERs) generated under the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), which was established as part of the Kyoto Protocol in 1997. The logic we describe for offsets can also be applied to the generation and trading of allowances. The CDM was designed to reduce emissions in inexpensive, rapidly growing, and often poorly regulated developing countries. Projects in developing countries can earn CERs in exchange for their promised emissions reductions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1086026612475069">Hasselknippe, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-1086026612475069">Watanabe &amp; Robinson, 2005</xref>). Each CER represents 1 tonne<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1086026612475069">1</xref></sup> of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO<sub>2</sub>e).</p>
<p>The CDM process is complex and requires numerous actors, including the CDM Executive Board, legal firms, banks, brokerages, and consultancies that develop, trade, and transfer CERs. The value of carbon offsets lies not so much in the actual reduction of emissions but in the services that each actor generates in the market. Additionally, the demand for offsets is generated not only by the compliance parties (firms obligated to reduce their emissions) but also by other entities seeking to become active in the markets for reasons of profit, experimentation, and/or corporate social responsibility. To illustrate time–space compression, we first need to describe the process that creates CERs and the roles each actor plays in this market. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1086026612475069">Figure 1</xref> illustrates the many hands through which the CER moves.</p>

<p>Each CER is founded on a project that intends to reduce emissions, such as the development of a wind farm, switching to low-carbon lighting in an existing plant, and capturing methane in a pig farm. The process is often initiated either by the local <italic>project owner</italic> in the developing country or an international <italic>project developer</italic> specializing in creating CERs. The project developer identifies a potential project site, establishes the opportunity for reducing emissions, provides engineering expertise, arranges financing of the project, and provides administrative support for CDM processing.</p>
<p>Once a site is identified, the project developer contacts a <italic>legal firm</italic> to draw up a contract for the sale of the net present value of future earnings from the CERs (i.e., offsets) in return for project financing. The contract<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1086026612475069">2</xref></sup> establishes ownership of the CER and raises funds for the project before the project is initiated. The CERs are often financed by investment banks or large utilities headquartered outside of the developing country context, such as Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, or Royal Dutch Shell. Over time, some consolidation has occurred in the industry, as investment banks that finance CER projects have purchased many project developers.</p>
<p>Once the parameters of the carbon-reduction project have been determined, the project developer designs a project design document (PDD), which establishes a baseline estimation of future emissions in absence of the registered project. The project developer submits the PDD to the <italic>CDM Executive Board</italic> for review, which must be validated by an <italic>auditor</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1086026612475069">3</xref></sup> The auditor assesses the accuracy of the projections and ensures that the project will result in real, measurable, and long-term emission reductions. If the CDM’s Executive Board is satisfied with the review, the project is registered.</p>
<p>Once the project has been developed, an auditor who is registered with the CDM Executive Board verifies the carbon emissions from the project, and the Executive Board issues the CERs and deposits them into the investment bank’s account held at the CDM registry. Each year, a supply of CERs from the base year is produced relative to the base year of the development of the plant. This process continues annually for 7 years and is renewable for up to two additional 7-year periods.</p>
<p>Once the CERs have been deposited in the investment bank’s account, the bank can sell the CERs through carbon brokerages and exchanges, which link buyers and sellers of all types of credits, including CERs. The brokerages identify buyers through their own extensive network of clients or through exchanges such as the <italic>European Climate Exchange</italic>.</p>
<p>The European Climate Exchange provides a forum for buyers and sellers to meet. It operates as the clearinghouse for credits, so that buyers and sellers do not trade directly with each other but deal instead with the Exchange. The price of the CER is shaped both by the relative supply and demand of CERs in the market and by the CERs anticipated in the future. If many projects are anticipated, then buyers may choose to wait until the supply is greater. Moreover, some buyers try to profit by speculating on the price fluctuations from shifts in supply and demand. These buyers will buy long, anticipating a higher price in the future, and sellers will sell short (without the actual CER in hand) to raise capital for their projects. In this way, buyers hedge against price and delivery risk. If the supplier’s project is delayed, the supplier will need to purchase CERs on the spot market so they can fulfill the obligation to the buyer at the time the CER is due.</p>
<p>Offsets are purchased by both <italic>compliance buyers</italic>, who use the offsets to cancel their emissions and meet compliance targets, and by <italic>voluntary buyers</italic>, who use the offsets to meet another objective such as corporate social responsibility (CSR). For example, to prove compliance with the EU ETS emission-reduction requirements, companies subject to the EU ETS must surrender carbon allowances (and offsets) to their national registries to meet a specific cap for their operations. If the company does not have enough allowances to meet the yearly cap, it must purchase allowances and offsets to compensate for the difference. Companies can use a certain percentage (close to 10% for many member states) of CERs to meet their cap. A record of the CERs still exists in the registry, but after they have expired because its term of compliance has closed, the CERs can no longer be transferred.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that the Kyoto Protocol will expire at the end of 2012. When the Protocol was first signed in 2005, signatories expected a new protocol to be developed. As no such agreement was forthcoming in Copenhagen in 2009, considerable uncertainty surrounds the future of CDM. At the time this article was written in 2012, the price of carbon had collapsed in face of this uncertainty.</p>

<title>A Specific CER Example: The Santa Fe Wind Farm</title>
<p>In this section, we describe a specific CER project, drawn from the CDM website, which will further help illustrate the offset-creation process described above and the compression of time and space.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1086026612475069">4</xref></sup> The Santa Fe Wind Farm project in Panama was registered with the CDM in 2009. The project owner, Santa Fe Energy, together with the project developer, Ecosecurities, produced a PDD for developing 27 turbines, each with a capacity of 3 megawatts (MW), for a combined capacity of 81 MW and an expected annual generation of 261,751 megawatt-hours (MWh). The PDD describes the project as comprising five main parts: the transmissions lines, internal roads, internal cabling, a substation, and the wind turbine transformers. The developers argued that, in addition to generating electricity, the project would also contribute to Panama’s sustainable development by</p>
<list id="list1-1086026612475069" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Reducing the reliance on imported fossil fuels and diversifying energy sources, thereby improving the nation’s energy security and self-sufficiency</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Increasing employment opportunities in the region (150 people needed for construction, 40 people to be employed permanently)</p></list-item>

<list-item><p>Demonstrating replicable clean energy technology</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Reducing greenhouse gas emissions, especially CO<sub>2</sub></p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The baseline emissions that Ecosecurities applied were based on Panama’s national emissions—a metric of the amount of CO<sub>2</sub> required to produce a comparable amount of energy using Panama’s current average production. This metric of 0.6605 tCO<sub>2</sub>/MWh was multiplied by the wind farm’s yearly capacity, 261,751 MWh, to result in the annual emissions savings of 172,877 tCO<sub>2</sub>e, resulting in as many CERs annually. Ecosecurities argued that no additional emissions would result in the construction or operation of the wind farm.</p>
<p>The project was financed by the French bank Societe Generale Corporate &amp; Investment Banking (Socgen) for US$150 million. The CDM website did not offer details regarding the law firm that drew up the contract; however, the validation report suggests that Ecosecurities commissioned the auditor SGS S.A. (formerly Société Générale de Surveillance) to assess the accuracy of these estimates. SGS S.A. recommended that the CDM Executive Board register the project.</p>
<p>The project was registered initially for 7 years (with the potential of up to two more 7-year renewals), beginning in June 2009 and ending in June 2016. At the 2009 secondary CER market price of €12 per tonne, the CERs would have generated €14,521,668 (172,877 tCO<sub>2</sub>/year × €12 × 7years) over 7 years. Even at the low CER secondary market price in October 2012, of roughly €1.6 per tonne, the CERs would produce €1,936,222 (172,877 tCO<sub>2</sub>/year × €1.6 × 7years) over the first 7 years of the project. Because the bulk of revenues for the project would be generated from the sale of electricity, the CERs offered additional revenues. We estimated that this project would generate US$34 million annually, based on the price of electricity in 2012.</p>
<p>We do not know who owned the CERs because they would be distributed through the project’s developer and its financier. However, the PDD suggested that 30% of the profit related to the carbon offsets sold would be allocated to sustainable projects in communities near the project site, which suggests that at least 30% of the offsets were allocated to the project owner named in the Emissions Reduction Purchase Agreement between the project owner and the financier.</p>

<title>The Compression of Time–Space at the Santa Fe Wind Farm</title>
<p>In this section, we draw on the example of the Santa Fe Wind Farm to illustrate the time and space compression caused by carbon markets. Each year in Panama, 172,877 tonnes of carbon fail to be released to the air as a result of the Santa Fe Wind Farm. Because the fossil fuels that Panama depends on are largely imported, they are likely retained in the ground elsewhere, but more importantly, Panama is the location where the use and preservation of fossil fuels occurs materially.</p>
<p>When the carbon reductions are converted to CERs, they are divorced from the region of their production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1086026612475069">Bumpus &amp; Liverman, 2008</xref>). The anticipated savings of 172,877 tonnes of carbon from the Santa Fe Wind Farm is converted into a piece of information that is marked by a serial number, date of production, location, statement of original ownership, and record of transfer. Unlike carbon, information is relatively easy to move across space and time. Note, however, that it is the <italic>absence</italic>, not the <italic>presence</italic>, of carbon that is converted into information. Thus, value is conferred on carbon that is never released from the terrestrial environment. Therefore, the issues of mobility and materiality become even more salient in CERs than in the typical exchange of financial instruments that represent physically transportable goods.</p>
<p>The CERs generated through the Santa Fe Wind Farm compress time and space by enabling the movement of reductions that do not exist. The futures market serves to compress time, as the promise of reducing carbon in the future accrues value in the present. The Santa Fe Wind Farm raises international capital on the basis of projected future carbon reductions, which can accelerate local development. Furthermore, in the case of compliance buyers, those firms that offset their excess emissions through the purchase of CERs will likely do so at a different time from the time at which the energy was produced by the Santa Fe Wind Farm. This difference in timing is mediated through the registration of the CERs. Indeed, current figures estimate that only 10% of carbon trading is spot trading (i.e., CERs exchanged on the spot; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1086026612475069">Gordon, 2011</xref>). The remaining trades are transacted through derivatives, with the majority being futures for delivery of CERs in December of the current year when most firms must meet their compliance obligations.</p>
<p>Space is compressed by the many hands through which the CERs move. Each intermediary draws an income from the development of the CER, including Ecosecurities, the legal firm, SGS, Societe Generale, the brokerage, and the buyer of the CERs. Each set of hands through which the CER moves distances the instrument from the physical activity of the original development. By stripping a piece of the CER’s value, the benefits from reducing carbon emissions are distributed around the world. Because 30% of the offsets are returned to the region for the Santa Fe Wind Farm, space is not as compressed as it might be for other projects.</p>

<title>The Challenges Created by Time–Space Compression in Carbon Markets</title>
<p>Carbon markets reflect the principles of economic theory that support market mechanisms to price natural resources and internalize environmental externalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1086026612475069">Coase, 1960</xref>). Early experiments demonstrated the ability of markets to successfully control more localized pollutants such as sulfur dioxide, through the relatively successful acid rain-trading program in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1086026612475069">Ellerman, Joskow, Schmalensee, Montero, &amp; Bailey, 2000</xref>). Carbon was first established as a demonstration market, which was believed to have been so successful that proponents argued that the market mechanism could motivate emission reductions on a global scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1086026612475069">Sandor, 2012</xref>). In fact, markets have become so fashionable that they are now used to manage other ecosystem services, including forestry, biodiversity, and clean water (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1086026612475069">Corbera, Brown, &amp; Adger, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1086026612475069">Miles &amp; Kapos, 2008</xref>). Such markets can facilitate economic development because they transfer value across geographic regions, which promotes economic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1086026612475069">Hall, 2011</xref>). The markets also suggest an innate efficiency; emissions are reduced at the lowest cost because reduction activities can be moved to less developed, lower-cost, and less-energy-efficient countries. For example, emissions from industrial activities in Europe can be offset by the production of clean energy in Panama (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1086026612475069">Newell &amp; Paterson, 2010</xref>). Arguably, the shifting of emissions responsibility can also provide technology transfer and clean energy development in developing countries.</p>
<p>The economic theory of carbon markets and their widespread adoption around the world speak to their positive support. However, analyzing the markets through the lens of time–space compression offers a different picture, suggesting that markets have expanded the capital invested in managing carbon but not necessarily the management of actual carbon. We discuss and illustrate some of these challenges in the remainder of this section.</p>
<sec id="section12-1086026612475069">
<title>Loss of Information</title>
<p>Finance has the power to convert physical resources to capital, which, compared with physical resources, has greater mobility in both time and space. Carbon credits, for example, can generate capital from anywhere the carbon exchange operates, and derivatives can leverage future potential value by moving value to the present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1086026612475069">Bryan &amp; Rafferty, 2007</xref>). Such a transaction provides project owners with the advantage of generating capital that would otherwise not be available. The value of the secondary CER market in 2011 was estimated at US$23 billion,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1086026612475069">5</xref></sup> which opens up considerable resources for new renewable energy projects.</p>
<p>However, there is a trade-off between reach and informational richness. Carbon incurs time–space information that is absent in financial instruments. CERs can be easily created, registered, traded, and expired in different regions of the world, almost seamlessly. This mobility can also expose carbon credits to theft.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1086026612475069">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1086026612475069">7</xref></sup> Carbon credits must be homogenous and commensurable to permit trading. Therefore, the location and structure of the production system, such as where and when the carbon is reduced, is sacrificed.</p>
<p>Reducing this information creates two problems. First, the financial instrument representing the carbon is divorced from carbon’s physical materiality; the certificate’s time and space is abstracted from its “real” space and time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1086026612475069">Lohmann, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1086026612475069">MacKenzie, 2009</xref>). Such abstractions from the physical materiality are even further punctuated by CERs, which represent the absence of carbon, not its presence. Consequently, there are two layers of abstraction: project developers first estimate carbon’s time–space attributes, then the climate exchange values the estimate.</p>
<p>Second, the value represented by the financial contract is liberated from the “functional” value of the resource. The certificate has value, regardless of where and when the reduction takes place. When the value of the credit becomes disembodied from its physical process of reducing emissions, the credit’s value can similarly be traded for another commodity. For example, reducing carbon reductions by replacing chlorofluorocarbons with its substitute, HFC-23, can be given an equivalency to reducing carbon through thermal power plants or, for that matter, any other stocks and securities. As the value of reducing carbon is liberated from the material processes of actually reducing emissions, valuable information is lost.</p>
<p>The reduced information can have adverse impacts because the instrument is open to manipulation. This point can be illustrated through the credits stolen from the EU ETS. On January 19, 2011, the European Commission closed all national registries and suspended spot trading across the entire EU ETS after the discovery of the theft of 3.1 million carbon credits (both offsets and allowances) carrying a market value of approximately €45 million. Blackstone Global Ventures had discovered 475,000 missing carbon permits and posted a “missing allowances alert” on its corporate website along with serial and tracking numbers for the missing allowances. The credits were stolen by an organized syndicate of cyber thieves who hacked into the national registries in Austria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Greece, and Poland, then transferred 3 million credits from various company accounts into previously set-up dummy accounts, before selling them on the markets.</p>
<p>The informational nature of the credits allowed for the quick transfer of the credits, so the traders at a Prague exchange could not see the credits being physically transferred from various accounts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-1086026612475069">Zwick, 2011</xref>). The transfer was completed quickly, by using a bomb threat to create a distraction, which then caused a knock-on effect, making it impossible to determine the ownership of the trades that occurred during this period. Furthermore, the complex legal requirements in some member states prohibited the authorities from disclosing the serial numbers, so many of the credits were never traced. Henry Derwent, president of the International Emissions Trading Association, suggested, “The theft shows that in Europe carbon emission allowances are now seen as commodities like gold or wheat” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1086026612475069">Gjelten, 2011</xref>, p. 1). Indeed, the theft illustrates the value—and the risks—of a financial asset that can literally disappear into thin air, but these effects are even more insidious with carbon emissions credits, which value the absence of carbon, thus even further distancing these credits from instruments that value the presence of commodities such as wheat or gold.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1086026612475069">
<title>Distortion of Economic Value</title>
<p>In addition to raising capital, CERs also create a price signal that communicates the social value of reducing emissions. For example, the establishment of the EU ETS has generated business and regulatory interest around the globe to voluntarily measure, report, and reduce carbon, such as through the Carbon Disclosure Project (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1086026612475069">Knox-Hayes, 2010b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1086026612475069">Knox-Hayes &amp; Levy, 2011</xref>). Furthermore, the creation of derivatives locks the value of the emissions reduction over time, which offers stability and confidence to carbon market investors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1086026612475069">Bryan &amp; Rafferty, 2006a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1086026612475069">2006b</xref>). Finally, evidence suggests that the CDM has helped transfer technology and accelerate the development of renewable technologies in developing countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1086026612475069">Forsyth, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1086026612475069">Seres, Haites, &amp; Murphy, 2009</xref>). Due to complementary government policies, China, Brazil, and Mexico have particularly benefited in this respect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1086026612475069">Dechezleprêtre, Glachant, &amp; Ménière, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1086026612475069">Liming, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-1086026612475069">Wang, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>However, these benefits require an accurate reflection of the price signal, but such value can be distorted by the compression of space and time. Cartographers have found that compressing spatial dimensions from three-dimensional space to two-dimensional space, such as representing a globe through a map, distorts the shape of the planet, the sizes of various landmasses, and distances between points on the map. Cartographers try to minimize these distortions through various conventions of maintaining accurate measurements of the most critical areas, such as landmasses. Similarly, a one-dimensional line cannot accurately represent a two-dimensional object. In other words, the process of financialization disembodies the credit from its physical representation, and subjective space and time do not accurately represent the scale and rate at which processes operate in the physical world.</p>
<p>On the one side, the emissions reduction is assumed to be embedded in a spatial and temporal context (e.g., the emissions reduction at the end of the stack pipe where it was accomplished or the forest that sinks emissions, which will eventually cycle through an environmental-sinking process).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1086026612475069">8</xref></sup> On the other side, financial instruments are highly liquid and can easily and instantly be moved and exchanged for other sources of value. These sources of value can be distorted, and even more so because the value is based on the absence of an emission, rather than its physical manifestation.</p>
<p>This point can be illustrated by detailing the calculation of the emissions reductions by the Santa Fe Wind Farm. The CDM requires that the project developer argue for both financial and environmental “additionality” by showing that (a) the emissions reduced in the project activity are additional to the emissions that would have otherwise been reduced and (b) the project would not have been developed without the additional financing received from the generation of CERs. To meet the criteria of additionality, Ecosecurities first created a baseline estimate of the emissions in the absence of the wind farm.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1086026612475069">9</xref></sup> Of the numerous base case scenarios available, they elected to use a thermal plant of equal capacity because of the unattractive investment landscape for wind energy. They argued for this base case because wind energy was considered to be highly risky and unlikely to attract financing. Second, Ecosecurities assumed that the wind farm would produce electricity constantly at full capacity of 81 MW and would otherwise not lead to the creation of other emissions. The emissions reduced were, therefore, calculated as the difference between best-case and worst-case scenarios. Demonstrating additionality is a requirement of the CDM, but the 172,877 tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> reduced per year is highly speculative because this quantity is based on a reality that will not happen and, therefore, cannot actually be demonstrated.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the emissions reductions in carbon markets are valued in subjectively determined time frames. Each unit of greenhouse gas (tCO<sub>2</sub>e) has a spatial and temporal ramification, which is variable. The unit may stay in the atmosphere for 100 years, or it may be captured through plant respiration in a few months. The financial instrument (emissions reduction credit) that is exchanged for the unit of greenhouse gas released cannot accommodate spatial and temporal depth. It is issued at a single point in time and has a fixed life span of, at best, a few years. It cannot adequately capture the value or reduce an emission in terms of the temporal and spatial dimensions required to sink the material CO<sub>2</sub>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1086026612475069">
<title>Failure to Reduce Carbon</title>
<p>Achieving carbon balance requires careful consideration of carbon cycles, and yet the emissions reduction systems under cap and trade fail to fully comprehend and incorporate spatial and temporal dynamics. The financial systems that exchange carbon credits are no longer matched to carbon cycles and cannot accurately account for the spatial and temporal scales at which carbon sinking actually occurs. The compression of time and space in the creation of financial instruments (which are agnostic to time and space) serves rather to exacerbate the imbalance of carbon cycles (physically embedded in time and space through cycling and reproduction).</p>
<p>Carbon markets have grown considerably since their development. The markets appear to have global reach, to be accessible everywhere, but only because the credits have been disassociated from their physical manifestation. The reduction of carbon emissions is still bound to specific places and to certain time frames. In compressing space and time, financial instruments can lose track of the conditions under which emissions actually occur. Even though the mobility of information can be managed, which creates the belief that carbon in Brazil can be managed from Canada, the mobility of the resources themselves cannot easily be managed between different locations. Additionally, the temporal qualities of physical materiality cannot be easily compressed. The rate at which carbon is transferred between reservoirs is fixed regardless of the rate at which credits are assigned. The time–space compression can distort the scale at which carbon transfer occurs; thus, credits seem to represent carbon at greater spatial and temporal scales than is the reality. Consequently, the impact of these instruments on the reduction of carbon emissions can be overestimated due to the compression of space and time.</p>
<p>This issue is particularly trenchant for the use of offsets. For example, in 2005, the decomposition of HFC-23 (a substitute for chlorofluorocarbons) accounted for 67% of CER credits issued under the CDM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-1086026612475069">World Bank, 2007</xref>). Each unit of HFC-23 captured was assumed to have an absolute advantage over other methods of reducing emissions because the value of HFC-23 was calculated over a 100-year time span (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1086026612475069">MacKenzie, 2009</xref>). This time span was determined by the “global warming potential” established by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; however, 100 years of impact are not calculated in the creation of each allowance to emit a unit of greenhouse gas (tCO<sub>2</sub>e). Credits are, at best, the equivalent of 1 year of CO<sub>2</sub> impact. They are issued at the same time each year and expire if not used within the phase (3-5 years) in which they are issued.</p>
<p>As a consequence of this calculation, each unit of HFC-23 was valued at 11,700 times the amount of one emitted tonne of greenhouse gas in the EU ETS. In other words, capturing one unit of HFC-23 in China could be exchanged for 11,700 tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub>e in Europe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1086026612475069">MacKenzie, 2009</xref>). This distorted value of the CER can be attributed to the failure to acknowledge the temporal and spatial aspects of the financial instrument vis-à-vis its physical manifestation. Time was arbitrarily incorporated and subjectively fixed in the instruments, but not properly accounted for. Because of the extreme values assigned to HFC-23, financial resources were drawn away from projects that could have substantially reduced greenhouse gas emissions in the near term, when they were most significantly needed. The CDM, therefore, may not have accomplished what it had intended to do.</p>

<title>The Importance of Physical Materiality to Research on Organizations and the Natural Environment</title>
<p>In the previous section, we showed that time and space have been compressed by carbon markets, which represent a form of sociomateriality; yet, the time and space of carbon, which represents physical materiality, is not as easily compressed. The time–space compression created by carbon markets disembodies the financial instrument from its physical manifestation. As a result, the very mechanism that is used to address the carbon problem may, in fact, aggravate it.</p>
<p>We believe in the importance of applying the concept of physical materiality and the tools of time–space to organizational studies. Many economists have long heralded the carbon markets as a policy measure of choice for controlling carbon emissions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1086026612475069">Sorrell &amp; Sijm, 2003</xref>). We appreciate these merits, but this article also elucidates some of the risks when the temporal and spatial attributes of the financial instruments become so disembodied from their physical manifestation that they are open to distortion and manipulation. In the remainder of this article, we expand our focus to the wider notions of organizing and organizations, of which carbon markets are only a part.</p>
<sec id="section16-1086026612475069">
<title>Departure From Prior Work on Materiality</title>
<p>Prior work on sociomateriality argues that social and material worlds are mutually constituted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1086026612475069">Leonardi &amp; Barley, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1086026612475069">Orlikowski, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1086026612475069">Scott &amp; Orlikowski, 2011</xref>). Such approaches to organizations are not limited, however, to sociomateriality, but can be seen in object-centered sociality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1086026612475069">Knorr Cetina, 1997</xref>), relational materiality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1086026612475069">Law &amp; Mol, 1995</xref>), and actor–network theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1086026612475069">Latour, 2005</xref>). These prior research areas are significant to organizations and the natural environment because they explicitly acknowledge materiality in organizations. Such work has diffused to technology studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1086026612475069">Leonardi &amp; Barley, 2010</xref>), sense-making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-1086026612475069">Whiteman &amp; Cooper, 2011</xref>), and strategy as practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1086026612475069">Feldman &amp; Orlikowski, 2011</xref>), making both its reach and impact substantial.</p>
<p>Our analysis in this article offers two important points of departure from this prior work. First, the prior work does not discriminate physical materiality from other forms of materiality. Servers, desks, databases, and directories are all considered to be material. However, servers have a mass that is not characteristic of databases and directories. The time and space attributes of the mass of physical objects are more immutable than they are for social objects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1086026612475069">Leonardi, 2012</xref>). Servers occupy space at a point in time and form a complex relationship with the other physical objects with which they interact. At a specific point in time, a server may need to be cooled, which emits carbon, or it may need new parts, which must be physically transported. Other forms of materiality, such as databases, may exist virtually and have minimal impact on the natural environment. They can be transmitted relatively seamlessly. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1086026612475069">Leonardi and Barley (2010)</xref> suggest that any artifact, including technology, has materiality in a sense not evident in production systems and workflow integration. The failure to discriminate physical materiality from other forms of materiality and from sociomateriality masks the unique attributes of the natural environment relative to the organizational environment.</p>
<p>A second point of departure from prior work in sociomateriality is the target of analysis. Organizational sociologists shine their spotlight on organizations. Researchers of sociomateriality have argued that organizations are “produced” by their interaction with the material world. However, this singular focus on organizations has deflected attention from the impact of organizations on the natural environment. The natural environment is not <italic>socio</italic>material; it can exist outside of society. Although organizational sociology has, understandably, focused its attention on human-centric phenomena, by ignoring the natural environment, the resulting theory fails to explain the impact of organizations on the natural environment. Understanding the interface between the sociomateriality of organizations and the physical materiality of organizations is worthy of research attention. Physical materiality should be seen not as incidental or intermittent in organizational life but integral to it.</p>

<title>Physical Materiality Differs From Sociomateriality</title>
<p>Understanding and evaluating space and time is critical to understanding and evaluating the changing natures and relationships of human organizations and the natural environment. Within economic systems, the acceleration in the turnover of capital can create an “annihilation of space by time” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1086026612475069">Harvey, 1989</xref>, p. 284), yet the physical materiality of the natural environment remains locked into a more immutable time and space that are less easily accelerated or compressed.</p>
<p>We do not mean to imply that the dynamics of natural systems are exclusively embedded in objective space and time, nor that nature exists in a resistant state unaffected by human agency or organizational activity. We recognize that natural systems exist in a dialectic relationship with human systems. As such, both social and natural systems embody objective and subjective spatial and temporal connotations. In many ways, both human and natural systems are accommodating of, and yet resistant to, time–space compression. However, we contend that the natural world is less amenable to time–space compression than the social world.</p>
<p>For example, Apple Inc. has been accelerating its innovation and productivity cycles and broadening the geographical scope of its products and operations. It is creating slimmer, faster, more powerful devices at an ever-accelerating rate, such that the next generation of a device is on the market even before most consumers have fully consumed its predecessor. Such a compression of time and space incurs a social and environmental cost. The company has outsourced its production in its effort to acquire cheaper labor, compromised the quality of working conditions, extended working hours, sourced more products from suspect sources, and disposed more waste. In doing so, the company has undermined its relationship with employees and generated an incredible volume of environmental pollution, both through the consumption of material resources and the generation of waste (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1086026612475069">Duhigg &amp; Bradsher, 2012</xref>). The time–space compression leads to negative social and environmental consequences that accompany the accelerated speed and expanded geographical scope of Apple products.</p>
<p>The productivity of an apple tree can likewise be enhanced by adjusting physical factors: controlling light, temperature, water, nutrients, and even genetically modifying the DNA of the plant itself such that it produces more fruit in a shorter amount of time. In this way, components of the natural environment can likewise be compressed in space and time. However, the extent to which environmental systems can withstand compression is less than with social systems. The apple tree still requires a set amount of time to grow before it will bear fruit; the fruit still evolve within a paced cycle of development and maturation; and without an ecosystem to provide pollinators, the plant will never bear fruit. Time–space compression can occur within a natural system, but at nothing near the rate of a socioeconomic or financial system that can take the value of an apple orchard (which requires decades to mature and reproduce itself) and turn it over in seconds or even milliseconds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-1086026612475069">Wojcik, 2011</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section18-1086026612475069">
<title>Implications to Organizational Theory</title>
<p>In this article, we have argued of the need to introduce physical materiality more explicitly into organization studies. We have illustrated the importance of physical materiality by focusing on the example of carbon markets. In this section, we will briefly explore some of the implications to organizational theory, by generalizing the ideas we raised in our discussion of carbon markets. Here we argue that the time–space compression occurring in organizations contributes to the loss of information embodied in the natural environment and potentially aggravates environmental issues.</p>
<p>The acceleration of organizational processes, such as product turnover, frequency of reporting, and even CEO turnover, has profound implications on organizations and even more so for the natural environment. The accelerated turnover of products has contributed to excess materials and energy use, and is overcrowding the landfills. Corporate short-termism has challenged both investors and local communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1086026612475069">Palley, 1997</xref>). Furthermore, the geographical scale over which products are now being moved has contributed to externalities, both to the environment and the massive transportation infrastructure. These considerations of the compression of time–space in organizational processes (i.e., sociomateriality) on the natural environment (i.e., physical materiality) have not been explored deeply in organization studies. The temporal and spatial qualities of the natural environment relative to the organizational environment, therefore, could provide both an opportunity and constraint, based not on merely any stock of resources but a stock of resources that occupy a physical place in space and time.</p>
<p>Both authors of this article earned their doctoral degrees from the University of Oxford and are reminded of a story that is often told by the college Bursar of New College, which was established in 1379. The grove of oak trees around New College was planted with the purpose of replacing the beams in the Great Hall, once they had rotted. The oaks take about 150 years to grow, which is about the length of time that the beams in the Great Hall last. New College was able to entrain, both temporally and spatially, its needs with physical resources generated by the natural environment.</p>
<p>Such a story sharply contrasts the rapid, and seemingly accelerating, product turnover experienced today, with increasingly greater outsourcing from ever more distant places (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1086026612475069">Roth, Tsay, Pullman, &amp; Gray, 2008</xref>). Research is needed to understand what is contributing to time–space compression and how it can be managed. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1086026612475069">Harvey (1982</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1086026612475069">2011</xref>) points to technology and financialization, which have lowered the costs of moving goods and services, permitted high-speed and visually rich communications, and geographically shifted capital. Networks of interactions and communications invariably distort time and space and affect materiality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1086026612475069">Orlikowski &amp; Gash, 1994</xref>); however, too little work has been undertaken on the role of these technologies in shaping the relationship with the physical environment.</p>
<p>Not only is research needed to explain what causes time–space compression, we need more insights into its consequences. We illustrated time–space compression through the example of carbon markets, but more systematic analysis is needed. For example, we argued earlier that time–space compression results in a loss of information. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1086026612475069">Lefebvre (1991)</xref> contends that the capitalist class maintains hegemony by controlling the use and knowledge of space. If capitalism contributes to compression, then control is forfeited to those oligarchs capable of controlling social space. The logic of financial structure likewise adjusts or establishes ownership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1086026612475069">Massey, 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>We need greater understanding of the temporal and spatial qualities that discriminate sociomateriality from physical materiality. The authors of this article are engaged in such a research project. We have interviewed more than 190 people who have helped create or shape carbon markets worldwide. Our interviews are showing a clear pattern: time and space are compressing through the sociomateriality of the markets. Interviewees acknowledge that carbon markets have attracted new capital and accelerated capital turnover. Yet they either do not believe or merely assume that carbon markets are creating real carbon reductions or achieving positive, material environmental impacts. Many financiers and project developers question whether additional carbon reduction projects have been initiated as a result of CDM financing than would have otherwise occurred. Although we continue to collect and analyze the data, we believe that time–space compression may help explain the disconnect between what is expected and what is being realized.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>We began this article by arguing that framing the natural environment within the organizations literature may not be sufficient to address the significant challenges facing organizations and the natural environment. By treating the natural environment as merely an issue or context in preexisting management theory, we do not fully appreciate the unique aspects of the natural environment that may, in fact, call for new theory.</p>
<p>We argued that the natural and organizational environments are fundamentally different, in part because of the time and space markers of their respective materialities. Whereas time and space are relatively immutable in a physical world, they are more plastic in an organizational world. The compression in time and space that occurs in the organizational world creates an imbalance with the immutable temporal and spatial features of the natural world. Carbon moves through physical cycles, whereas financial markets and instruments are social constructions open to human interventions. The failure to analyze time and space in our present organizational theorizing may prevent theorists from identifying organizational solutions to some of the most pressing environmental challenges. What is good for business is not always good for the natural environment.</p>
<p>The arguments that we have posed apply not only to carbon markets but also to many financial markets, including mortgages and commodities (e.g., wheat, oil, pork bellies). In most areas of business studies, time is discounted, so that the future takes on less value than the present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1086026612475069">Laverty, 1996</xref>). Such discounting compresses time, yet sustainability places equal value on the needs of future and current generations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-1086026612475069">World Commission on Environment and Development, 1987</xref>). The same applies to space. Neoliberalism has touted the merits of comparative advantage, advocating for globalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1086026612475069">Dunning &amp; Lundan, 2008</xref>). Yet globalization places a heavy and regionally disproportionate cost on the natural environment through the physical movement of goods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1086026612475069">O’Brien &amp; Leichenko, 2000</xref>). Organization and business studies make assumptions of time and space, which are exposed by escalating concerns of the natural environment.</p>
<p>The shift in organizational theory from physical materiality to sociomateriality has likely undermined the importance of the natural environment in organizational life. Ignoring physical materiality is problematic, especially so when the natural resources on which organizations and humans rely are grounded in the physical. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1086026612475069">Barad’s (2003</xref>, p. 801) statement is particularly poignant to researchers of organizations and the natural environment: “Language matters. Discourse matters. Culture matters. But there is an important sense in which the only thing that does not seem to matter anymore is matter.”</p>
