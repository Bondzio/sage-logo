               <italic>Background:</italic> Recent studies have shown that approximately 1 in 6 women of reproductive age use potentially teratogenic medications. Since the pregnancy section in drug labeling is often inconsistent or incomplete, many pregnant women may inadvertently expose their fetus to potentially teratogenic drugs. <italic>Method:</italic> We examined the pregnancy section in the labeling of 6 potentially teratogenic drugs: thalidomide, isotretinoin, leflunomide, warfarin sodium, alprazolam, and lisinopril. We also reviewed regulatory guidelines that address issues regarding contraception method use. <italic>Results:</italic> The amount of information regarding contraception use in drug labeling varied. Occasionally, this information was not found altogether. Regulatory guidelines regarding contraception use, albeit useful, do not comprehensively cover all relevant areas. <italic>Conclusion:</italic> There is a need for an internationally harmonized regulatory guideline that clearly defines when, how, and what type of contraception methods should be used, as well as what type of contraception information should be included in the labeling.</p>

         <title>Introduction</title>
         <p>Worldwide, women have been using more prescription medications over the past decades.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0092861512441099">1</xref>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0092861512441099"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0092861512441099">3</xref>
            </sup> Mitchell et al found that between 1976 and 2008, first-trimester use of prescription medications increased by more than 60% and that the use of 4 or more medications more than tripled in the first trimester of pregnancy.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0092861512441099">4</xref>
            </sup> Schwarz et al reported that 1 in 6 women of reproductive age use potentially teratogenic medications.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0092861512441099">5</xref>
            </sup> With estimates that about half of the pregnancies in the United States are unintended,<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0092861512441099">6</xref>
            </sup> many women may inadvertently expose their fetus to potentially teratogenic drugs.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0092861512441099">7</xref>
            </sup> As a result, patients need reliable guidance on proper contraceptive use when taking medications that may adversely affect a fetus.</p>
         <p>Most drugs in the United States must contain information in their labeling regarding use during pregnancy to be approved for marketing.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0092861512441099">8</xref>
            </sup> All drugs labeled as pregnancy category “D” or “X” by the US FDA have the potential to cause harm to a developing fetus.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0092861512441099">8</xref>
            </sup> Between 1998 and 2001, there were approximately 147 million annual office visits made by women of childbearing age.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0092861512441099">9</xref>
            </sup> Of these, an estimated 11 million visits made by women of childbearing age documented use of 11.7 million class “D” or “X” medications.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0092861512441099">9</xref>
            </sup> However, contraceptive counseling was provided in only about 20.9% of the visits at which such medication was prescribed.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0092861512441099">9</xref>
            </sup>
         </p>
         <p>Drug labeling is an important source of information that patients use in an effort to understand the risks and benefits of a particular medication.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0092861512441099">10</xref>
            </sup> Unfortunately, the contents of the labeling are often inconsistent or incomplete, and, as a result, patients find it difficult to read and assimilate the information provided.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0092861512441099">10</xref>
            </sup>
         </p>
         <p>The ability to choose whether or not to have children is often considered a universal fundamental human right.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0092861512441099">11</xref>
            </sup> For women, it may be viewed as inherent to their self-determination and sense of well-being.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0092861512441099">12</xref>
            </sup> Patients of childbearing age need to be knowledgeable about available contraception methods and how to effectively use them. This is particularly important when patients undergo treatment with potentially teratogenic drugs.</p>
         <p>Given these considerations, the objectives of this article are (a) to evaluate the consistency of contraception information provided in the drug labeling of certain potentially teratogenic drugs approved for use in the United States and the European Union and (b) to assess whether regulatory agencies have issued any formal guidelines on the type and duration of methods of contraception that should be used in the postmarketing setting.</p>

         <title>Materials and Method</title>
         <p>The websites of the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), the FDA, the European Medicines Agency (EMA), and the International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) were reviewed searching for any type of guidelines regarding contraception methods. Internet-based library databases such as PubMed, Medline, and Embase were also searched to identify relevant publications. The terms <italic>contraception</italic>, <italic>birth control</italic>, and <italic>contraceptive</italic> were cross-referenced with <italic>guidance</italic>, <italic>label</italic>, and <italic>guideline</italic>.</p>
         <p>Six drugs known to potentially cause fetal harm and manufactured by various companies around the world were selected to evaluate the consistency of their drug labeling: thalidomide, isotretinoin, leflunomide, warfarin sodium, alprazolam, and lisinopril. Each drug’s information was obtained from its US prescribing information (USPI) and summary of product characteristics (SPC). From each, we recorded the product name, manufacturer, pregnancy category classification (pregnancy guidance), pharmacology highlights, and guidance on contraception (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0092861512441099">Table 1</xref>). In addition, for each drug, we summarized and compared the information.</p>

            <title>Regulatory Guidelines</title>
            <p>One of the goals of this article was to identify guidelines or recommendations dealing with contraception use for the postmarketing setting. We were unable to identify a single, standard, document that addresses all relevant issues (ie, types of contraception methods, classification of contraceptive effectiveness, number of methods a patient should use, or the time frame needed to begin contraception use prior to drug treatment initiation and to continue contraception use once drug treatment ends). Useful recommendations addressing some of these items were found in various publications, but no single document addressed them all. Also, most of them were intended specifically for patients enrolled in clinical trials.</p>
            <p>While conducting clinical trials, drug manufacturers are required to adhere to very strict guidelines provided by global regulatory agencies. In the United States, subjects who participate in clinical research are required to sign an informed consent form (ICF) prior to enrolling in the study. The ICF provides information about the potential benefits and risks of participating in the study, as well as documenting the subject’s decision to participate in the clinical trial. A survey recently conducted by Ng et al revealed that there was little uniformity among biopharmaceutical companies with respect to the contraception language included in their ICFs.<sup>
                  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0092861512441099">13</xref>
               </sup> Several guidelines from regulatory agencies were identified as containing information related to contraception methods:</p>
            <p>The FDA’s Guideline for the Study and Evaluation of Gender Differences in the Clinical Evaluation of Drugs states that pregnancy testing is recommended and women must be counseled about the reliable use of contraception or practice abstinence while participating in a clinical trial.<sup>
                  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0092861512441099">14</xref>
               </sup> However, this guideline does not specify the types of contraception methods to be used because the FDA leaves such decision to the woman in consultation with her health care provider.</p>
            <p>The EMA’s Guideline on Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products on Human Reproduction and Lactation: From Data to Labelling requires that when a drug is used by women of childbearing potential, the manufacturer should provide information regarding pregnancy testing and contraception, when effective contraception is required for patients or partners of patients during treatment, and for a defined period before starting and/or after ending treatment.<sup>
                  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0092861512441099">15</xref>
               </sup> This guideline also provides examples of statements for use in Section 4.6 of the SPC (Fertility, Pregnancy and Lactation). These examples of statements indicate that when the drug can cause congenital malformations, a time where effective contraception should be used needs to be provided by the drug manufacturer.</p>
            <p>The EMA’s Guideline on Summary of Products Characteristics (Revision 2) provides similar information on contraception measures as EMA’s Guideline on Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products on Human Reproduction and Lactation: From Data to Labelling.<sup>
                  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0092861512441099">16</xref>
               </sup> This guideline requires that when a drug is used by women of childbearing potential, the manufacturer should provide information on the need of pregnancy testing and contraception whenever efficient contraception is required for patients or partners of patients during treatment. Information regarding the length of contraceptive use, before starting and/or after ending treatment, also needs to be provided. In addition, it suggests that if contraceptive measures are recommended, there should also a warning in case of drug interaction with oral contraceptives.</p>
            <p>The ICH M3 (R2) guidance recommends that women should be educated on how to prevent pregnancy during the period of drug exposure and warns that this period could exceed the length of the clinical study.<sup>
                  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0092861512441099">17</xref>

            </p>
            <p>The Clarification of Contraceptive Wording in Clinical Trials Conducted in the UK, released in 2010 by the MHRA, clarifies the contraceptive wording that should be used in clinical trials.<sup>
                  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0092861512441099">18</xref>
               </sup> In this document, the agency advises that male subjects, with partners who fit the category of women of childbearing potential (WOCBP), should use contraceptive methods while enrolled in clinical trials and for a suitable period after the last dose of study medication (eg, a whole spermatogenic cycle or 5 half-lives). The guidance also gives a comprehensive explanation of what is considered a highly effective method of contraception and the considerations that need to be observed to make a proper choice in contraceptive use.<sup>

            <sec id="section6-0092861512441099">
               <title>Thalidomide (USPI: Pregnancy Category X; SPC: Contraindicated in pregnancy)</title>
               <p>In US and European labeling, the USPI includes a comprehensive explanation requiring the use of effective contraception methods by WOCBP for 4 weeks prior to beginning treatment, during treatment, and for 4 weeks after cessation of treatment (the half-life of thalidomide is 8.7 hours). The required 4-week period to continue the use of birth control after drug treatment stops translates into over 90 half-lives of thalidomide.</p>
               <p>The SPC and USPI varied on the number of effective contraception methods required to be used by WOCBP. The SPC requires WOCBP to use 1 effective method of contraception whereas the USPI requires 2 methods (one being a highly effective method, which is similar to the effective method required by the SPC). Males are advised to use a condom during any sexual contact with WOCBP.</p>
               <p>Patients and prescribers must comply with the STEPS (System for Thalidomide Education and Prescribing Safety) program, a restricted distribution system approved by the FDA, which stipulates that only prescribers and pharmacists registered with the program are allowed to prescribe and dispense the product.<sup>

               <title>Isotretinoin (USPI: Pregnancy Category X; SPC: Contraindicated in pregnancy)</title>
               <p>In the labeling of 2 US drugs, similar labeling information is found for these 2 drugs regarding duration of contraceptive use and types of contraceptive methods. There is comprehensive explanation requiring the use of 2 effective contraception methods by WOCBP 1 month prior to beginning treatment, during treatment, and for at least 1 month after cessation of treatment. Males are not required to use a contraceptive barrier method unless an overdose happens. Educational materials are provided regarding the risk of congenital anomalies in a developing fetus if exposed to isotretinoin. This educational material is part of special restricted distribution program approved by the FDA called iPLEDGE (https://www.ipledgeprogram.com/default.aspx). This program explains the accepted methods of contraception, and the need to avoid pregnancy, before drug treatment begins, while undergoing treatment, and after treatment ends. Patients must comply with this drug program to obtain a prescription.</p>
               <p>One isotretinoin European labeling stipulates that the prescriber must educate the patient regarding the need to use highly effective methods of contraception. Drug is prescribed only after pregnancy is ruled out by the prescriber and patient agrees to comply with strict rules regarding contraceptive use. The labeling provides guidance on the use of contraception methods during treatment with isotretinoin. However, this guidance does not require 2 methods of effective contraception, but rather <italic>suggests</italic> the use of 2 methods, including a barrier method for at least 1 month prior to beginning treatment, during treatment, and for at least 1 month after cessation of treatment. The mean elimination half-life of isotretinoin is 21 hours. The required 1-month period to continue the use of birth control after drug treatment stops translates into over 30 half-lives of isotretinoin. Males are not required to use a contraceptive barrier method when using isotretinoin.</p>

               <title>Leflunomide (USPI: Pregnancy Category X; SPC: Contraindicated in pregnancy)</title>
               <p>The US and European drug labeling for leflunomide include similar information regarding the drug washout period (2 weeks). All 3 drugs explained in the labeling a drug elimination procedure, using colestyramine or activated charcoal, which reduces the drug elimination period substantially. The patient can conceive once plasma levels of leflunomide’s major metabolite is less than 0.02 mg/L.</p>
               <p>The labeling for all 3 drugs warns that a reliable contraception method must be used by WOCBP; however, they do not specify which methods are considered reliable.</p>
               <p>Men are advised to follow a specific elimination procedure with cholestyramine before fathering a child; however, no animal studies were conducted to assess the risk of male-mediated fetal toxicity. The labeling does not require male patients to use a barrier method.</p>
               <p>Differences in the elimination half-life of leflunomide were observed in the labeling: the labeling for the 2 US drugs states that the half-life is approximately 2 weeks, while the labeling for the European drug stipulates that it is about 1 to 4 weeks.</p>

All of them mention that effective contraception methods should be used by women of child bearing potential. However, they do not specify what types of birth control are considered effective. No single labeling mentions the use of barrier methods for males.

         <title>Discussion</title>
         <p>It is a great and complex responsibility to educate patients of childbearing potential who are using medications that may cause fetal harm and those who prescribe them. Patients should be able to process such information ad benefit from the instructions regarding the proper use of contraception methods and the time duration before drug treatment begins and after treatment ends prior to attempting to conceive.</p>
         <p>Stahl et al analyzed data from the Danish and Swedish national health registries and found a statistically significant increase in the risk of major congenital abnormalities among offspring of males with a history of cancer.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0092861512441099">20</xref>
            </sup> The results of this study suggest that the observed increase in risk of congenital abnormalities may be because of treatment-induced or direct effect cancer genotoxicity, or a constitutional genetic instability that contributed to the risk of both developing cancer early in life and conceiving a child with a birth defect. One salient conclusion of this study is that it is critical to educate male patients receiving drug treatment with a genotoxic agent on the risks posed by such therapeutics.</p>
         <p>Little is known about a drug’s teratogenic potential before the drug reaches the market. This is because of the fact that, prior to a medicinal product being approved for marketing, knowledge about its reproductive risk may be exclusively from preclinical studies in nonhuman species. Preclinical studies are useful to predict human risk; however, the extent of such prediction needs to be carefully assessed.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0092861512441099">21</xref>
            </sup>
         </p>
         <p>Postmarketing surveillance of drug exposure during pregnancy is critical to the detection of drug-induced fetal effects.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0092861512441099">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0092861512441099">22</xref>
            </sup> A review of the drugs approved by the FDA between 1980 and 2000 showed that 91.2% of them (of a total of 468 approved drugs) was still undetermined regarding their teratogenic risk in human pregnancy.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0092861512441099">23</xref>
            </sup>
         </p>
         <p>After a drug has been approved for marketing, and a larger number of individuals have been exposed, knowledge of the drug’s safety profile may increase. The thalidomide experience provides a classic example of postmarketing detection of teratogenic effects. In this case, such risks went undetected because of limitations in the required preclinical testing, which have subsequently been revised. Thalidomide was sold in a number of countries across the world from 1957 until 1961. It was not until 4 years after the introduction of the drug to the market that the severe birth defects attributed to its exposure were widely recognized.</p>
         <p>A recent change in pregnancy category classification by the FDA took place with the drug topiramate (Topamax). Topamax was first approved by the FDA in December 1996. The original FDA pregnancy category classification for topiramate was “C.” This category means that animal reproduction studies have shown an adverse effect on the fetus and there are no adequate and well-controlled studies in humans, but potential benefits may warrant use of the drug in pregnant women despite potential risks.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0092861512441099">8</xref>
            </sup> In March 2011, after being in the market for 14 years, the FDA changed topiramate’s pregnancy category to “D” because new human data showed an increased risk for oral clefts in the offspring of women exposed to topiramate during pregnancy.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0092861512441099">24</xref>
            </sup> Pregnancy Category “D” is assigned when positive evidence of human fetal risk is based on adverse reaction data from investigational or marketing experience or studies in humans, but potential benefits may warrant use of the drug in pregnant women despite potential risks.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0092861512441099">8</xref>
            </sup> These experiences illustrate that, even when a drug is thought to be safe for use during pregnancy, its safety profile may change and its use no longer recommended during pregnancy.</p>
         <p>The results of the drug labeling assessment presented here show that while some potentially teratogenic drugs have comprehensive contraception guidance, others only contain partial and sometimes minimal information. For some drugs, the amount of information in their labeling varied from country to country. This lack of uniformity observed in the pregnancy section of the labeling warrants attention by regulators, prescribers, and the patient population.</p>
         <p>The examination of the warfarin labeling revealed that the 2 drugs marketed in the United States discuss in their labeling the possibility of terminating an exposed pregnancy. However, they do not indicate what birth control methods are appropriate to avoid pregnancy while on treatment with this drug. The European drug labeling neither discusses the possibility of terminating the pregnancy nor explains which birth control methods are considered appropriate to avoid pregnancy while on treatment with warfarin. The EMA Guideline on Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products on Human Reproduction and Lactation: From Data to Labelling states that recommendations on the use of the medicinal product in WOCBP should be given when appropriate, including pregnancy testing and contraception. It also states that where an efficient contraception is required for patients or partners of patients during treatment, and for a defined period before starting and/or after ending treatment, the rationale should be included in the labeling.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0092861512441099">15</xref>
            </sup> The European labeling for warfarin only mentions that effective contraception should be used during treatment. Since warfarin’s half life is approximately 40 hours, the drug may be in the patient’s system in clinically meaningful amounts for over 8 days after the last dose was administered. Based on the EMA guidance, further instruction concerning contraception after the end of treatment may be appropriate.</p>
         <p>The regulatory guidelines we examined did not give clear direction regarding what drug categories should provide contraception language in their labeling nor specific timelines regarding the length of contraception use before beginning and after ending treatment.</p>
         <p>A comprehensive regulatory guideline for the pharmaceutical industry on contraception should address the types of methods that are considered highly effective, the number of methods a patient should use, as well as the time frame needed to start contraception use prior to drug treatment initiation and to continue contraception use once drug treatment stops. These and other topics that this guideline should include are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0092861512441099">Table 2</xref>.</p>
         <p>Our review of the labeling of drugs presented here has several limitations. First, we reviewed the drug labeling of only 6 selected drugs with high teratogenic potential. It is possible that these drugs do not represent the universe of potentially teratogenic drugs. Second, we reviewed drug labeling only in the United States and the European Union. Labeling in other countries and regions was not examined.</p>

         <title>Conclusion</title>
         <p>With WOCBP using increasingly more prescription medications, a comprehensive regulatory guideline providing recommendations to drug manufacturers with regard to standard contraception language in their labeling is warranted.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0092861512441099">21</xref>
            </sup> Such guideline should address important considerations such as who should use contraception methods while on therapy, what is considered to be an effective contraception method, the need of pregnancy testing prior to initiation of drug therapy, when the use of contraception methods should be initiated prior to starting drug treatment, the number of contraception methods patients should use, the need or not of a barrier method for males, and the time needed to continue contraception use after drug treatment stops.</p>
         <p>The choice of a contraceptive method is highly personal and individualized, based on a number of factors, and should be discussed with a health care provider. Manufacturers and regulatory agencies should provide information to assist in that decision making, but should refrain from directive statements.</p>
         <p>A regulatory guidance for the labeling of marketed products, combined with a proactive effort of drug manufacturers around the globe to provide clear and useful contraception information in their labeling, would be the foundation for improving contraception understanding and adherence by patients of childbearing age.</p>
