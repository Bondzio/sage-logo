<p>The economic development of a country is greatly influenced by the state of public finance, which encompasses raising and allocating resources and good economic policies. Public finance is expected to drive the growth of the economy and also narrow down economic disparity through redistributive policies. These twin roles of public finance are at times mutually self-defeating. Economic growth might be hindered due to fiscal imbalances generated on account of redistributive policies and improper management of public finance. Thus, the role of policymakers is to judiciously choose public policies to meet both the objectives. In this backdrop, the book <italic>Development and Public Finance: Essays in Honour of Raja J. Chelliah</italic>, a commemorative volume on the late Raja J. Chelliah, one of the chief architects of India’s public finance policies, is a conglomeration of articles by eminent scholars. The book establishes the continuum between public finance and economic development. It comprises 18 chapters, nine each on perspectives of public finance and perspectives of development.</p>
<p>One important part of public finance policy is revenue generation. In this regard, the book consists of articles on disinvestment and taxation policies in India. Disinvestment in the public sector has been debated for long in academic literature and larger public policy circles. In this book, Vijay Kelkar vehemently argues for a bold and imaginative programme for disinvestment and privatization. He suggests re-engineering of portfolio of public capital assets and creating widely held or board-managed companies. The government should choose a strategy to use resources generated out of disinvestment/privatization to create new public capital assets.</p>
<p>Indira Rajaraman and Rajan Goyal make a normative assessment of the public finances of states, based on data envelopment analysis on 28 states in the Indian Union for five years in the period 2002–2007. The results demonstrate that the average tax effort across all states has increased from 62 per cent in 2002–2003 to 70 per cent in 2007–2008. The analysis also demonstrates that higher grants from the centre have a negative impact on tax effort.</p>
<p>Apart from broader aspects of revenue generation, the book also deals with micro issues as financial transaction taxes (FTT) and double taxation avoidance agreements (DTAAs). On FTT, Parthasarathi Shome admits that there is a lack of convincing evidence concerning the effects of FTT on the volatility of financial markets or its long-run revenue potential. The non-tax regulatory route framework appears to be advantageous over FTT as the latter’s uncertain effect on volatility is averted. Arindam Das-Gupta’s work on India’s network of bilateral DTAAs suggests that it is possibly a suboptimal fiscal policy tool with respect to countries from which India receives FDI and other factor flows.</p>
<p>The book contains two in-depth studies on fiscal imbalance across time and space. In the study on India, D.K. Srivastava argues that during the period from 1950–1951 to 1977–1978, fiscal and primary deficits were incurred to play a counter-cyclical role to minimize the impact or volatility of cyclical phases of growth and to satisfy political motives. However, from 1978–1979 to 2008–2009 there is little evidence of counter-cyclical fiscal policy. Subra Ramamurthy observes that in the post-World War II era actual budgetary balance was abandoned as an operative norm in most OECD countries, as it was deemed more important to balance the economy than to balance the budget. After 1973–74 oil shock, the industrialized economies adopted budget norms that continued till the pre-crisis period. During the post-crisis period expansionary fiscal policies were adopted to stimulate the economy.</p>
<p>The economic development of a country not only depends on its fiscal state but also its interaction with institutional and political structures. An interesting study by Shyam Nath illustrates the political cost (vote losses) model of fiscal federalism by explicitly incorporating the policymaker’s choice of a structure of tax authority to expand the leviathan at the centre and state levels. The model has been validated using income and public finance data for 17 major Indian states for the period of 1975–1997. The study concludes that decentralization of revenue bases and tax earmarking should be a key feature of the reform agenda for fiscal federalism in India. In another chapter, Kaliappa Kalirajan and Keijiro Otsuka illustrate that fiscal decentralization at the state level in India has led to improvement of social development.</p>
<p>Decentralization to the lowest tier of government and economic development is one of the moot topics in recent times. Govinda Rao argues that impact of decentralization on economic development is context and design-specific. In the Indian context decentralization in favour of rural local governments can work as a catalyst if design and implementation can create incentive structures for development. Kaliappa Kalirajan and Keijiro Otsuka observe that decentralization to the third tier of governance contributes positively to rural development by facilitating increase in Panchayati Raj expenditures. However, both these studies have not discussed the revenue inequality of rural local governments in India (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0972150912466478">De, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>India’s preparedness with public policy for environmental issues is also given due importance in the book. It covers articles related to design and implementation of a carbon tax system in India. U. Shankar’s study suggests a preparatory step for India with respect to introduction of a carbon tax limited to fossil fuels, with low tax rates in 2020 and a broad-based tax by 2030. His suggestions are based on a thorough review of experiences of designing carbon taxes in developed countries. Policy initiative with respect to environmental concerns has also been re-emphasized by K.S. Kavikumar. The author argues that to meet sustainable development objectives both mitigation and adaptation policies in India should be integrated with the ongoing developmental process.</p>
<p>The book also encompasses articles depicting methodological improvements in social sciences. Jaya Krishnakumar, Paola Ballon and Juan Tellez have developed a methodological framework for the construction of an effort index for the social policy of a government. Using data for 79 countries for 2000 to 2004, they rank countries according to both the potential and actual effort indices. They find that economically advanced countries perform below their potential while some developing countries are able to go beyond theoretical limitations.</p>
<p>The book is also rich in terms of studies on regional economic growth and convergence. K.R. Shanmugam’s work shows conditional convergence in per capita income of Indian states during 1999–2000 to 2008–2009. Convergence in agriculture is faster than in industry and services. Kaliappa Kalirajan and Keijiro Otsuka observe that the expenditure on social services across states demonstrates convergence, although no convergence pattern has been observed in case of economic services.</p>
<p>On government intervention in agriculture and credit markets, the book produces two significant works. With respect to government subsidy in agriculture, Raghbendra Jha argues that subsidies are largely for current production and accrue to more affluent farmers. Expenditure switch from subsidies to investment is warranted to salvage Indian agriculture from current stagnation. Kausik Chaudhuri and Mary Cherical find that priority-sector lending has had a positive influence on agricultural output. Moreover, increase in rural branch per capita enhances the output of the registered manufacturing sector.</p>
<p>The book also addresses contemporary issues like price stability, goods and services tax (GST) and globalization of knowledge development. C. Rangarajan, one of the chief architects of India’s monetary policy, argues that in developing economies the dominant objective of the central bank should be price stability. Mahesh Purohit and Vishnu Kanta Purohit demonstrate that introduction of GST would generate higher revenue if the new rates suggested by the central government are adopted. N.S. Siddharthan’s chapter on globalization of knowledge development provides a succinct review of the emerging phenomenon of foreign direct investment in research and development, multinational enterprises going in for mass collaboration from several countries and outsourcing R&amp;D problems to unrelated third parties.</p>
<p>Overall, the book is an attempt to bring together seminal works of eminent scholars and policymakers in India. It re-emphasizes the importance of public finance as a policy imperative to usher in economic efficiency and equity. It is a useful book for policymakers as well as students and researchers of macroeconomics and public finance.</p>
