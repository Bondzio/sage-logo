<abstract>
<p>We present the case of an 11-year-old boy who sustained blunt abdominal trauma while bicycling. An abdominal computed tomography scan obtained during his trauma evaluation was suspicious of a right-sided abdominal wall hernia with acute inflammatory changes although there was no palpable mass on physical examination. In follow-up, he was found to have a palpable mass in his right lateral abdominal wall, which enlarged with valsalva. The hernia was repaired primarily using a minimally invasive approach with a 5-mm umbilical cannula and a stab incision over the defect. He was discharged home on the first post-operative day. At 1 year follow-up, he is symptom-free without evidence of recurrence. Lateral abdominal wall hernias in the pediatric patient are uncommon but can result from trauma. Primary repair using a minimally invasive approach is safe and effective in achieving adequate closure.</p>

<p>Blunt abdominal trauma leading to a lateral abdominal wall defect is an uncommon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1460408612440926">Singal et al., 2011</xref>) but well-described etiology of hernias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1460408612440926">Dimyan et al., 1980</xref>), especially in children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1460408612440926">Decker et al., 2011</xref>). When it occurs, it is usually an isolated injury due to a direct blow that results in a disruption of the abdominal wall without violating the skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1460408612440926">Clain, 1964</xref>). A traumatic hernia can be missed or confused for a hematoma, leading to a delay in diagnosis and significant morbidity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1460408612440926">Ryan and Cavallucci, 2011</xref>). The first case reports published on this unusual injury advocated emergent laparotomy due to concern for associated injuries. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1460408612440926">Dreyfuss et al., 1986</xref>). More recently, it has been recognized that these injuries are not commonly associated with other injuries and may be amenable to a minimally invasive approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1460408612440926">Yarbrough, 1996</xref>). Since lateral abdominal wall defects are rarely encountered in children, we present an 11-year-old boy with a traumatic lateral abdominal wall defect managed electively with a minimally invasive approach.</p>

<sec id="sec2-1460408612440926" sec-type="cases"><title>Case report</title>
<p>An otherwise healthy 11-year-old boy was involved in a bicycle accident where he fell over the handlebars and sustained a blow directly to his right abdomen from the blunt end of the handlebar. His only complaint was right-sided abdominal wall pain although his physical examination was benign without any masses or hernias—he did however have a handlebar sign. Given his mechanism of injury, an abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan was obtained which was suspicious for a right lateral abdominal wall hernia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1460408612440926">Figure 1(a)</xref>); there were no signs of other intra-abdominal injuries. There was uncertainty regarding the diagnosis given the paucity of physical examination findings and the lack of obstructive signs or symptoms. He was observed and discharged home after 24 h having ensured he was tolerating oral intake.

<p>At a 2-week follow-up appointment, his abdominal wall tenderness had resolved but he now had a palpable bulge in the same region that was more prominent with valsalva. An ultrasound was obtained due to uncertainty regarding the diagnosis and confirmed the presence of a traumatic abdominal wall defect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1460408612440926">Figure 1(b)</xref>). The differential diagnosis included hematoma, seroma, fat necrosis, or, less likely, a soft tissue neoplasm.</p>
<p>He was taken electively to the operating room for diagnostic laparoscopy and hernia repair. A 5-mm cannula was placed through the umbilicus and the abdomen was explored. Omentum had incarcerated through a lateral ventral abdominal wall defect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1460408612440926">Figure 2(a)</xref>). A stab incision was made over this defect and a 5-mm blunt grasper was used to reduce the omentum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1460408612440926">Figures 2(b)</xref>). A suture passer through this same stab incision was used to close the defect primarily using interrupted 0-polyglactin sutures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1460408612440926">Figure 3</xref>). The patient was dismissed home the following day. He was followed up in the surgery clinic 10 days postoperatively at which time his incisions were well-healed and he was doing well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1460408612440926">Figure 4</xref>). At 12 months of follow-up, he is without recurrence.

<sec id="sec3-1460408612440926" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title>
<p>Traumatic abdominal wall hernias in the pediatric patient are rare and the reported incidence is 1% of all blunt abdominal injuries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1460408612440926">Netto et al., 2006</xref>). This type of injury has been associated with both high- and low-energy mechanisms. In high-energy injuries such as a motor vehicle accident, external and internal forces create compression and lead to disruption of the abdominal wall while the skin remains intact. In low-energy injuries such as a handlebar injury (which is typically seen in children), shearing forces lead to disruption of the abdominal wall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1460408612440926">Iinuma et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>The size of these hernias can span a wide spectrum from a palpable hernia to an occult hernia diagnosed with imaging studies. In our patient’s initial presentation, his physical examination was unremarkable for a hernia. The paucity of physical examination findings can contribute to the difficulty in making the diagnosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1460408612440926">Losanoff et al., 2002</xref>). CT and/or ultrasound can be useful when the physical examination is questionable. If the diagnosis is still unclear, laparoscopy can be used to confirm the diagnosis, which is a further advantage to a minimally invasive approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1460408612440926">Gandhi and Stringel, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>Patients with associated injuries may have other indications for laparotomy. However, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1460408612440926">Damschen’s series (1964)</xref> of traumatic abdominal wall hernia, 60% of patients had no associated injuries. Therefore, a minimally invasive approach may be applicable for most patients with a traumatic abdominal wall hernia. Furthermore, the role of laparoscopy in traumatic abdominal injuries is expanding and associated injuries may still not preclude a minimally invasive approach in the hemodynamically normal trauma patient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1460408612440926">Amin et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>For the few cases reported in children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1460408612440926">Decker et al., 2011</xref>), autologous tissue repair with primary closure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1460408612440926">Rowell and Chin, 2011</xref>) has been the mainstay of treatment without any reported recurrences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1460408612440926">Lopez et al., 2011</xref>). However, long-term follow-up for traumatic abdominal wall hernia is lacking and so the true recurrence rate is not known. For other pediatric herniae, primary repair has been the mainstay of treatment because recurrence rates are as low as 0–2% including umbilical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1460408612440926">Zendejas et al., 2011</xref>), epigastric (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1460408612440926">Coats et al., 2000</xref>), and Spigelian (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1460408612440926">Lopez et al., 2011</xref>) types. In adults, mesh versus primary repair is much more controversial and a variety of factors should be taken into account such as the defect size, patient co-morbidities and tissue quality, and the presence of contamination before the surgeon decides whether or not a mesh is indicated—and if so, what type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1460408612440926">Gross et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>No randomized data directly comparing absorbable to non-absorbable sutures in pediatric hernia repairs are available. However, published series that vary in the type of suture material used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1460408612440926">Zendejas et al., 2011</xref>), all report comparable recurrence rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1460408612440926">Albanese et al., 2006</xref>). Our preference has been to use absorbable suture material as we have observed delayed complications in the form of abscess formation with silk sutures used for high ligation of pediatric inguinal hernias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1460408612440926">Calkins et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>In this case, we utilized a minimally invasive approach previously described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1460408612440926">Bittner et al (2008)</xref>, limited to a single 5-mm cannula, for the laparoscope and a single stab incision with which we not only reduced the incarcerated hernia contents but closed the defect as well. While this laparoscopic technique does not utilize triangulation, it reduces the need for additional ports. We did not find it difficult to reduce the hernia or use a suture passer to place transfascial stitches despite this lack of triangulation. This approach imparts the advantages of minimally invasive techniques (less pain, quicker recovery, and better cosmesis) while allowing for full-thickness fascial bites to ensure a durable closure. Our patient’s only visible scar is a 5-mm right upper quadrant incision. Furthermore, laparoscopy can be extremely useful to confirm the presence of a hernia if the diagnosis is still uncertain.</p>
<p>The natural history of traumatic abdominal wall hernias is not known as almost all are repaired at the time of diagnosis. There has been a single case report of spontaneous resolution of a traumatic abdominal wall hernia in a child, however, the risk of incarceration and strangulation exists for any hernia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1460408612440926">Litton et al., 2008</xref>). In fact, in our patient, he had incarcerated omentum through a defect that was large enough for bowel to herniate through. Therefore, we feel that this type of injury warrants repair as the peri-operative risk of repair is less than that of incarceration and/or strangulation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1460408612440926" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Acquired abdominal wall defects can occur from traumatic disruption of the fascial layers. However, this is an uncommon injury. A minimally invasive approach is safe and effective and should strongly be considered.</p>
