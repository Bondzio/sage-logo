<title>Objective</title>
<p>Our aim was to ascertain if a deliberate practice intervention improves procedural skills and team performance of pediatric residents with simulated NR during their monthly NICU-DR rotation using a HF mannequin.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0009922813488646" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>Each month, 2 teams participated in two 90-minute sessions (2 to 3 weeks apart) in an off-site simulated delivery room. Each team consisted of 2 residents and 1 intern (general pediatrics and/or medicine-pediatrics). Each session included an introduction to simulation, a brief skills practice, and review of the video “Just a routine operation” <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://vimeo.com/970665">http://vimeo.com/970665</ext-link>, which highlights gaps in team performance. This was followed by a 15-minute scenario (modified from SimNewB NRP 2010), which involved a NR of a 37-week GA infant HF mannequin SimNewB (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.laerdal.com">www.laerdal.com</ext-link>) born by cesarean delivery to a preeclamptic woman with placental abruption. APGAR scores were 1 at 1 and 5 minutes. NR required proficiency in 5 skills: positive pressure ventilation (PPV), chest compressions (CC), endotracheal intubation (INT), umbilical vein catheterization (UVC), and intratracheal (ETepi) and intravenous (IVepi) administration of epinephrine. PPV was provided via a flow-inflating bag connected to a pressure gauge and a manometer. Pulse oximetry was available. By design, there was no heart rate response ≥60 bpm to ventilation and ETepi until the correct dosage of IVepi had been given through the UVC. Teams were expected to perform without instructors’ guidance or redirection. Video recording was used for a 20- to 30-minute debriefing and for independent scoring by a neonatologist, a neonatal fellow, and a neonatal nurse practitioner. Each of the 5 skills included 4 technical elements, given 1 point each if performed correctly (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0009922813488646">Table 1</xref>). A total score ≥3 (≥75% of 4 points) for each individual skill and a cumulative score ≥15 (≥75% of 20 points) were considered acceptable.</p>

<p>Each procedure was expected to start or be completed within a predetermined time. Initiation of PPV (≤60 s) and CC (≤120 s if preceded by bag/mask ventilation or ≤180 s if preceded by INT) were derived from NRP guidelines.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0009922813488646">11</xref></sup> The maximum time for INT (as documented by end-tidal PCO<sub>2</sub> color change) was 120 s, or 180 s if preceded by CC. This limit was selected from the data of successful INTs in real life or in simulated NR.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0009922813488646">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0009922813488646">8</xref></sup> ETepi administration was expected by 300 s, UVC placement by 420 s, and IVepi by 480 s. These time expectations were in line with those observed in real-life NR.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0009922813488646">15</xref></sup> Each individual skill was scored for timeliness (0 if not done, 1 if done late, and 2 if done on time); a total cumulative score for timeliness ≥9 (≥75% of 12 points) was considered acceptable.</p>
<p>Team behaviors were evaluated by a method modified from Thomas et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0009922813488646">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0009922813488646">17</xref></sup> that consisted of 3 domains: communication (information sharing and inquiry), management (workload and vigilance), and leadership. Each behavior within the first 2 domains as well as the third domain (leadership) was scored (0-4). A total score ≥3 (≥75% of 4 points) for each individual team behavior and a cumulative score ≥15 (≥75% of 20 points) were considered acceptable.</p>
<p>Between sessions, all residents participated at the NICU in a single deliberate practice (1.5 to 2 hours) intervention using a low-fidelity mannequin (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.laerdal.com">www.laerdal.com</ext-link>). This session focused on procedural skills used during a delivery room NR and required individual repetitive practice with immediate feedback by an NRP instructor (RH). The institutional review board exempted this project from review because it was an educational intervention study. Verbal consent from each participating resident was obtained.</p>
<sec id="section4-0009922813488646">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>Procedural skills and timeliness and behavioral scores were expressed as medians and compared with a Wilcoxon signed rank test. Acceptable performance scores were compared using McNemar’s χ<sup>2</sup> test with correction for continuity. Interrater reliability measured by Krippendorff’s κ coefficients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0009922813488646">18</xref></sup> for skills were as follows: PPV, κ = 0.26; INT, κ = 0.78; CC, κ = 0.48; ETepi and IVepi, κ = 0.65; UVC, κ = 0.63. For team behaviors, they were as follows: communication, κ = 0.37; management, κ = 0.40; and leadership, κ = 0.57.</p>

<sec id="section5-0009922813488646" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>In all, 11 teams (10 Pediatric Level [PL]-1, 19 PL-2, and 4 ≥PL-3) completed the 2 sessions and deliberate practice. Simulated NR was always led by senior residents. During the 2- to 3-week interval between sessions, residents increased their clinical experience by attending approximately 50 low-risk and 40 high-risk deliveries. In our institution, all “real-life” NR are led by the neonatologist or neonatology fellow.</p>
<sec id="section6-0009922813488646">
<title>Procedural Skills: Technical Aspects</title>
<p>Median PPV scores were 3 during the first and 3 (<italic>P</italic> = .42) during the second session. Drying/stimulation, suction, and evaluation of heart rate and respiratory rate were consistently done by all teams. Bag/mask ventilation, however, was incorrectly performed by some teams because of their inability to maintain bag inflation by not controlling the continuous positive airway pressure valve or the oxygen flow. None of these performance gaps reoccurred during the second session.</p>
<p>Median INT scores were 2 during the first and 4 (<italic>P</italic> = .01) during the second session. Good technique for INT was demonstrated by most teams; however, half of them needed more than 2 attempts. During the first session, securing the tube with a NeoBar (Neotech Products Inc, Valencia, CA) was not commonly done; thus, operators kept their hands on the tube, limiting their participation in other tasks. This error did not reoccur during the second session.</p>
<p>Median CC scores were 3 during the first and 4 (<italic>P</italic> = .05) during the second session. Although technique was adequate, bagging was often asynchronous with the CC count. Team leaders seldom recognized fatigue and, thus, failed to reassign tasks. During the second session, these problems did not reoccur.</p>
<p>Median ETepi and IVepi scores were 3 during the first and 4 (<italic>P</italic> = .03) during the second session. During the first session, only half of the teams knew the correct doses. Most residents did not know how to draw epinephrine, operate the 3-way connectors, or flush epinephrine with saline. These errors did not reoccur during the second session.</p>
<p>Median UVC placement scores were 2 during the first and 3 (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .01) during the second session. Only 4 of the teams placed umbilical tape around the cord to control bleeding, and only 6 teams withdrew “blood” from the UVC to evaluate placement. In all, 7 of the teams placed a UVC without saline, thus injecting air into the mannequin, and only 1 of the 11 teams secured the UVC. These performance gaps did not reoccur during the second session. Median combined scores for all procedural skills improved between sessions (14 and 18, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .01).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0009922813488646">
<title>Procedural Skills: Timeliness</title>
<p>As reflected by their median scores (2 and 2), PPV was started in a timely manner by most teams during the first and second sessions. Conversely, the other tasks were started or completed outside expectations (1 and 1 for CC, 1 and 1 for INT, 1 and 1 for ETepi, 1 and 1 for UVC, and 0 and 1 for IVepi). Median combined scores for all procedures did not change from the first to the second session (8 and 8). None of the differences in individual or combined scores was statistically significant.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0009922813488646">
<title>Team Behavior Scores</title>
<p>Median communication and management scores improved from the first to the second session (2 to 4 and 3 to 4, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .01, respectively). During the first session, distribution of tasks without consideration to the capabilities of each resident was common. Vigilance was often compromised because leaders allowed team members to focus only on their assignments while ignoring their potential contributions to other tasks. These performance gaps occurred less frequently during the second session. Most team leaders still did not seem to be aware that difficulties with procedural skills significantly affected timeliness for completion of tasks. Median leadership scores (3 and 4, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .01) and median combined team scores (8 and 10, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .01) improved from the first to the second session.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0009922813488646">

<p>The number of teams with acceptable performance (individual and combined) for technical skills, timeliness, and team behaviors are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0009922813488646">Table 2</xref>. There were definite improvements in the scores for procedural skills as well as for team behaviors; however, no improvement in the timeliness for initiation or completion of the procedural skills was observed.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Data from the present investigation showed that the addition of deliberate practice to our simulation training decreased performance gaps. Our intervention incorporated elements of deliberate practice, such as motivated learners, well-defined objectives, difficulty commensurate with residents’ level of training, and focused repetitive practice with immediate feedback provided by experienced trainers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0009922813488646">10</xref></sup> Similar improvements in NR procedural skills of pediatric and internal medicine residents following multiple deliberate practice sessions given over extended periods have been previously reported.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0009922813488646">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0009922813488646">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0009922813488646">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>Germaine to our study, a DR-based deliberate practice given twice to pediatric residents during their NICU rotation also resulted in improved performance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0009922813488646">14</xref></sup> NR training done during the NICU-DR rotation assumes motivated learners and minimizes the time subtracted from their busy schedules. The benefit of NR simulation-based medical education with deliberate practice has now been accepted.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0009922813488646">10</xref></sup> Whether these gains in performance can be sustained over time or be translated consistently to practice is unclear.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0009922813488646">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0009922813488646">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>Mastery of procedural skills during NR, albeit ideal, may be clinically meaningless unless the tasks in question are performed in a timely manner; thus, our assessment of proficiency included an evaluation of their timeliness. Using a low-fidelity mannequin for NR training, White et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0009922813488646">8</xref></sup> reported time to completion of some skills, but no conclusions were drawn because of lack of standards for comparison. Later, Nadel et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0009922813488646">4</xref></sup> provided a group of third-year pediatric residents with 3 mock resuscitations with immediate feedback over an extended period and noted that the learners performed many of the critical elements of cardiopulmonary resuscitation more quickly.</p>
<p>A trend toward quicker task performances during simulated NR using video debriefing as compared with oral debriefing has also been reported.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0009922813488646">9</xref></sup> Their data, however, could not be used as a measure of proficiency because during the performance of the skill, the instructors redirected their trainees several times.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0009922813488646">9</xref></sup> Significant delays in starting CCs and defibrillation by pediatric residents using a HF model of cardiopulmonary resuscitation highlighted the importance of timeliness.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0009922813488646">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>Sawyer et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0009922813488646">20</xref></sup> who also studied NR residents’ performance following 3 simulations with deliberate practice, given over a 9-month period, reported that intervals for most procedures did not change except for a decline in the time needed to secure vascular access and to start IV medications. Our data showed that although most PPV was started in a timely manner, the significant delays in task initiation (CC) or task completion (INT, UVC placement, and IVepi) observed during the first session continued in spite of the additional deliberate practice intervention. Conceivably, too much focus on the correct performance of procedural tasks may have the unintended consequence of insufficient attention to timeliness. More likely, improvement in timeliness may require repeated sessions over a prolonged period.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0009922813488646">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0009922813488646">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0009922813488646">20</xref></sup> This option may not be easily exercised considering the difficulties of assembling teams of residents for multiple simulation sessions during a prolonged and intense period of clinical activities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0009922813488646">23</xref></sup> In addition, the residents’ opportunities to lead or to assume major responsibilities during “real-life” NR are limited by the restrictive duty hours as well as by the shifting of responsibilities among NR teams toward more experienced providers (ie, neonatologists, neonatal fellows, and NNPs).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0009922813488646">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0009922813488646"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0009922813488646">26</xref></sup></p>
<p>Team behaviors can be assessed during simulated NR scenarios with the methodology described above.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0009922813488646">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0009922813488646">17</xref></sup> Video recording facilitated debriefing and evaluation of individual as well as team behaviors and technical skills.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0009922813488646">6</xref></sup> In our previous study, we observed that 1 simulation session and 2 to 3 weeks of NICU-DR clinical experience resulted in an improvement in team communication only.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0009922813488646">13</xref></sup> The addition of a single deliberate practice session to the current investigation led to definite improvements, not only in communication but also in management and leadership performances. It is possible that after the residents (especially the leader) mastered the procedural skills, they were able to focus more on team dynamics than on individual tasks.</p>
<p>The importance of team training in preparation for NR has been recognized as critical to success.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0009922813488646">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0009922813488646">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0009922813488646">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0009922813488646">28</xref></sup> Videotaped recordings of “real-life” NR highlighted opportunities for improving team and leader performances and outcomes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0009922813488646">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0009922813488646">29</xref></sup> Simulation-based learning provides an ideal opportunity for training health care teams for critical interventions (eg, NR) without compromising patients’ safety.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0009922813488646">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0009922813488646">30</xref></sup> Recognizing the need for team training, NRP leaders have updated current NR guidelines to address the importance of teamwork and communication through simulation-based learning and debriefing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0009922813488646">12</xref></sup> Our institution, like others, has incorporated mandatory crew resource management courses in the training and credentialing of all faculty and house staff.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0009922813488646">31</xref></sup></p>
<p>One limitation of our study was that it did not allow for long-term evaluation of retained knowledge or skills. Also, a post hoc analysis showed that the small sample size had sufficient power to detect only large effects, and this would be further diminished if adjustments for multiple outcomes were made. Finally, it is possible that residents’ performance during a simulated NR may not reflect their reactions during real-life situations, where other providers with different degrees of expertise participate. Despite these limitations, the strength of this study is that even a single deliberate practice intervention during the NICU-DR rotation can correct procedural performance gaps while improving team behaviors, at least for the short term. Also, this study highlights the need for incorporating timeliness of procedures and team behaviors in the assessment of readiness and competency in NR.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>HF simulation with limited deliberate practice intervention results in better procedural skills and team performance; however, lack of improvement in timeliness of tasks may require more sessions for correction. The restricted time available for such interventions during clinical rotations limits the opportunities for further NR training and assessment.</p>
