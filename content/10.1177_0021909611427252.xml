<p>There are two main approaches in the global war on terrorism (GWOT). On the one hand, the hard approach entails physical engagements which cripple destructive plans by terrorists, such as bombings. Through the legislative, judiciary and executive arms of the state, the modern state uses methods such as arrest, surveillance, intelligence and detention to cripple damaging initiatives by terrorists. The soft approach, on the other hand, attempts to debase terrorist ideology through a counter-ideology discourse against radical ideologies which encourage political violence. Through the soft approach, Muslim organizations and leaders debunk terrorist’s ideology of hate and violence. This article attempts to elucidate efforts made by governments, and of particular interest are contributions made by Muslim leaders in maritime Southeast Asia to counter the ideology and activities of terrorism.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The threat of global terrorism on nation-states looms after devastating and successful attacks on the World Trade Centre Twin Towers in the United States of America (USA). September 11 (9/11) re-emphasized the central tenet of national sovereignty and the nature of national security. Thus modern states have amplified and buttressed their domestic intelligence security and international political networks so as to pre-empt and therefore upset any form of attacks by terrorists in their countries. Recently, proactive measures taken by governments in maritime Southeast Asia since 9/11 have resulted in arrests of the Jemaah Islamiyah operatives. Intra- and inter-government efforts and cooperations have considerably checked the advancement of terrorists’ agendas. Hitherto, as much as the global war on terrorism (GWOT) was fought in Iraq and Afghanistan – since these two countries are the ideological bases of Muslim terrorists – the anti-terrorism war was also regionally countered by states in maritime Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>The GWOT was therefore manifested in two main approaches. On the one hand, the hard approach entails physical engagements which cripple destructive plans by terrorists such as bombings. Through the legislative, judiciary and executive arms of the state, the modern state uses methods such as arrest, surveillance, intelligence and detention to cripple damaging initiatives by terrorists. The soft approach, on the other hand, attempts to debase terrorist ideology through a counter-ideology discourse against radical ideologies which encourage political violence. Through the soft approach, Muslim organizations and leaders debunked the terrorist ideology of hate and violence. Public education, counselling and religious decrees (<italic>fatwas</italic>) are features of the soft approach. This article attempts to elucidate efforts made by governments and Muslim leaders/organizations in maritime Southeast Asia using soft and hard powers to counter the ideology and activities of terrorism, with specific reference to Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0021909611427252">
<title>Global War On Terrorism</title>
<p>The GWOT was pronounced by then President of the USA, George W Bush, after the events of 9/11. Claiming that former President of Iraq, Saddam Hussein, had built nuclear plants and therefore was in possession of weapons of mass destruction, the American president initiated the occupation of Iraq which culminated in the defeat of Saddam Hussein. This American policy to occupy Iraq was in tandem with its former policy of engaging the Taliban in Afghanistan. America’s GWOT was mainly focussed on attempts to deal with states which it claimed as rogue states who sponsored worldwide Muslim terrorist organizations – such as Al-Qaeda – which thus justified America’s occupation of Iraq and Afghanistan, who were viewed as the ideological and operation bases of Muslim terrorists’ organizations.</p>
<p>Critics have pointed out that these military attacks on Iraq and Afghanistan are deemed as signs of an incoherent strategy by the Americans to thwart the threat of terrorism since global counter terrorism activities must be adequately complemented with homeland security since terrorist activities take place beyond its ideological and operational bases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0021909611427252">Mockaitis, 2006</xref>: 106). Additionally, former Prime Minister of Malaysia, Dr Mahathir Mohamad, warned against solely relating terrorism to Islam since acts of terrorism are violent acts conducted by certain segments of the Muslim community who take on a wrongful way of expressing their resentment towards the fate of Palestinians and the Muslim world in general, other than the fact that these terrorist activities were motivated by feelings of disgust towards the Western powers’ hypocrisies and double standards against Muslim countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0021909611427252">Mohamad, 2003</xref>: 2). Henceforth, the GWOT brought to fore the necessity of broad and specific modes of action to thwart the ambitions of terrorists by crippling the operational and ideological centres of Muslim terrorism in Iraq and Afghanistan, isolating the ideas and worldview of Muslim terrorists from the rest of the Muslim community worldwide, dealing with injustices faced by the Muslim world as well as securing homeland security along with buttressing regional counter-terrorism measures.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0021909611427252">Alex P Schmid (2011</xref>: 200) defines terrorism as a doctrine about the presumed effectiveness of a special form or tactic of fear-generating, coercive political violence as well as a conspiratorial practice of calculated demonstrative, direct violent action without any legal or moral restrains, thereby targeting mainly civilians and non-combatants performed of its propagandistic and psychological effects on various audiences. Terrorists therefore will use any method to achieve its objective and, in this respect, Islamic terrorist organizations such as Al-Qaeda and the Jemaah Islamiyah used the genre of <italic>jihad</italic> (perpetual struggle) through <italic>qital</italic> (war) to justify their political violent approaches to reinstitute Muslim independence over Muslim lands in Iraq, Afghanistan and the Middle East. While the focus of Al-Qaeda is to reclaim Muslim control of their countries, the ideological spread and recruitment of Al-Qaeda is worldwide and thereby affecting the peace of countries beyond the Middle East and Central Asia. Henceforth, states in other parts of the world have to battle against the spread of <italic>jihadist</italic> (proponents of <italic>jihad</italic>) ideology of war which is propagated by radical Muslim groups worldwide.</p>
<p>Therefore, as a measure of GWOT which has national as well as regional relevance, radical Islamic thought was identified as one of the main causes, mobilizations and inspirations of Muslim terrorist organizations. Radical Islamic thought defined <italic>jihad</italic> as a perpetual struggle through war and political violence by Muslims against non-Muslim countries such as the USA who occupied Muslim countries. To these radical Islamists, Islam is colonized by non-Muslims who robbed Muslims and Muslim countries of their rich Islamic heritage and independence. Therefore, across the world, Muslims must unite and struggle against non-Muslim countries which colonized Muslim lands through direct occupation or using international institutions to justify colonization of the Muslim world. Radical Islam therefore operates freely as an independent entity within the Muslim world and beyond it. As such, radical Islamic groups are on states’ counter-terrorism radar since members or sympathizers of these radical Islamic groups are most likely to be incepted into the fold of Muslim terrorist organizations such as Al-Qaeda and Jemaah Islamiyah in due course.</p>
<p>The centrality of the <italic>jihadist</italic> ideology within Islamic radicalism and terrorists organizations calls for state-centred and regionally-structured counter terrorism ideological discourse. As much as hard approaches to counter-terrorism are critical to prevent further structural growth of terrorist organizations, soft power approaches ensure that radical Muslim groups do not have a free reign on persuasive ideological power to influence new members into their fold. Indeed, as will be emphasized later in this article, that without the efforts of Muslim leaders and organizations to debunk Muslim terrorist organizations’ <italic>jihadist</italic> ideology, hard approach efforts by countries in maritime Southeast Asia to counter-terrorism could only address the terrorism problem when it has surfaced and crystallized instead of rupturing and reconfiguring its roots through the soft approach discourse before as well as after the challenge of terrorism has taken shape.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0021909611427252">
<title>Regional Counter-Terrorism Engagement</title>
<p>In broad terms, radical Islam has been identified as one of the main threats to state security and legitimacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0021909611427252">Bellamy, 2004</xref>: 166). Terrorism as one of the <italic>modus operandi</italic> of Islamic radicalism challenges the state’s legitimacy by causing social and political instability. Kit Collier wrote that there are three ways in which the international system has looked at the phenomenon of terrorism. The global paradigm view the impeccable role of Osama bin Laden and his outfit Al-Qaeda as the main source of terrorism. With leadership and organization playing pivotal roles in the spread of terror ideology, regional groups such as the Jemaah Islamiyah, which is under the leadership of Abu Bakar Ba’asyir, drew strength from the parent organization of Al-Qaeda. The Jemaah Islamiyah localized its operation by setting up cells within individual states in maritime Southeast Asia among which were Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore. The regional organization of the Jemaah Islamiyah remains ideologically connected to the centre while the operations were carried out locally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0021909611427252">Collier, 2006</xref>: 27–8). In order to counter localized operations of the Jemaah Islamiyah, countries in Southeast Asia worked closely with one another in counter terror efforts. Hence security of the respective nation-states was premised on the ability of these states to buttress their domestic security and at the same time was dependent on exchange of information as well as stability within the region.</p>
<p>Moving on from the analysis provided by Kit Collier, the Jemaah Islamiyah, which is a regional manifestation of Al-Qaeda, is therefore a danger to both regional and domestic peace. Ideologically, the Jemaah Islamiyah’s vision is similar to its precursor Darul Islam. Darul Islam’s vision was to set up the Islamic state and the implementation of <italic>Shari’ah</italic> (Islamic law) in domestic governance. Their literal doctrinal interpretation of the canonical sources of the <italic>Qur’an</italic> and <italic>Sunnah</italic> polarized the world into two extremes: good and evil, Muslims and non-Muslims. Thus the cosmic war between good and evil translated itself into a physical contestation of power between Islam and people from other religions. Central to this cosmic clash was the belief that Jews and Christians must be subdued in order to fulfill God’s commandment on earth. Islam therefore must be the religion triumphant and the <italic>Shari’ah</italic> exercised as the constitutional as well as political principles of the Islamic state, as a manifestation of Godly victory.</p>
<p>Both the Jemaah Islamiyah and Darul Islam consist of fanatical members who are ready to act upon any instruction given by either the local cells or regional leadership. To the Jemaah Islamiyah, de-stabilizing governments in Southeast Asia through acts of sabotage will create social upheaval and subsequently a revolt against the state. Sabotage proliferates inter-ethnic tension. Additionally, the Jemaah Islamiyah hope that maritime states in Southeast Asia will mismanage terrorism as being a ‘Muslim problem’, thus fuelling hard feelings against the state and other co-religionists. Thus an internal revolt against the state is the eventual aim of the Jemaah Islamiyah so as to de-stabilize regional governments. Once governments in maritime Southeast Asia are de-stabilised, the Jemaah Islamiyah hope to assume power. However, winning the war is only one part of the struggle. To win the peace and govern effectively are other dimensions of completing their objective as vicegerent of God on earth. Hence the readiness and capability of the Jemaah Islamiyah to govern is indeed questionable. Furthermore, similar to communism, the Jemaah Islamiyah’s model of an ongoing revolution, aimed to cleanse the world of any disbeliever, is utopian in nature since no Muslim empire aimed for such an outcome in their quests for territorial expansion.</p>
<p>However, it is acknowledged that the activities of the Jemaah Islamiyah are calculated and well-planned to achieve the objective of setting up a regional pan-Islamic order. This is possible only with multiple attacks on landscapes where Muslims are present so as to seize the opportunity simultaneously with other operatives in place. The Jemaah Islamiyah therefore was both a domestic and regional threat. For the USA, Southeast Asia is just one front in a global war that runs from Europe to the Middle East, South Asia and Southeast Asia. In Southeast Asia, the war is mostly state centred. While the affected states are aligned with the United States of America against terrorism in general, their concrete enemies are not in Afghanistan or Iraq, but at home (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0021909611427252">Emmers and Sebastian, 2005</xref>: 158). Thus to localize the war against terror was to bolster home security and cooperate with regional states in terms of intelligence sharing, surveillance and interrogation of detained suspects. Additionally, in the soft approach, securing the services of Muslim leadership and organizations as a whole shaped a comprehensive strategy in the regional and domestic war against terrorism. Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia were fully engaged in soft and hard power approaches to counter terrorist ideology and activities.</p>

<title>Soft Power Dimension</title>
<sec id="section6-0021909611427252">
<title>Defining Soft Power</title>
<p>To Joseph S Nye, the concept of ‘soft power’ is defined as the ability of great powers such as the US to obtain cooperation and alliance of other states within the world international order. Soft power, in Nye’s deliberation, excludes the method of gaining consent through the use of popular policies. Instead, Nye emphasizes using interactive persuasion, good diplomatic relations, common values, ideological deliberations and cultural exchanges, along with hard power to combat transnational threats such as terrorism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0021909611427252">Nye, 2004</xref>). In other words, the notion of soft power, first, entails seeking the mutual assistance of states towards the end goal of crippling terrorism and, second, using actors within the population who would become useful and critical partners in undermining terrorist ideology. Ideological deliberations within the concept of soft power genre henceforth are measures which are persistently garnered in order to engage faulty religious worldviews and paradigms.</p>
<p>Thus the use of non-state actors to acknowledge and counter the threat of terrorism and terrorist ideology is a soft power approach in combating the ideology of terror. Hence when actors within and outside the state take on initiatives to undermine terror ideology through the use of religious decrees (<italic>fatwa</italic>), policy statements and education, they have taken on a soft approach in addressing the jaundiced terrorist <italic>jihadist</italic> ideology. Thus, by understanding the forms of Islamization that are taking place in Muslim societies, counter-terror agencies produce effective soft methods to undermine terrorist ideology at large. In sum, one of the main triggers of Muslim radicalization stems from the fervour of religious revivalism led by conservative religious authority as well as secular turned religious activists. The increasing depth of religiosity which is not abated with contextual reading of canonical sources and history of Muslim societies, sufficient mediation by moderate elements within the Muslim religious fraternity and comprehension of the true teachings of the Islamic faith, as well as social integration, fuelled the emotive response to the secular order. Additionally, through acts of private and public piety, this emotive religious revivalism motivates an armed uprising whenever it is perceived that Muslim social activism does not culminate in the end goal of an Islamic state.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0021909611427252">
<title>The Two Variants of Islamist-Extremists</title>
<p>In the context of the Muslim world, the heightening of religiosity also meant stricter interpretation of the canonical sources. It was thought that these strict interpretations of the canonical sources are motivated by the <italic>Salafi</italic> doctrine and paradigm of returning to the authentic practices of the <italic>Qur’an, Sunnah</italic> and the pious generation within the first hundred years of Muslim history. However, within the <italic>Salafi</italic> group, the <italic>Wahabis</italic> came to the fore. As compared to the <italic>Salafis</italic>, the <italic>Wahabis</italic>’ quest for purity of faith among Muslims can only be achieved by assuming political power which is in contrast to the <italic>Salafi</italic> quest of an almost complete indifference to worldly material possessions. Thus it is importance to dissect the <italic>Salafi–Wahabi</italic> nexus so as to differentiate between the pearl and the glass. In fact, within the persistency of the soft approach, <italic>Salafis</italic> provided the necessary doctrinal thesis against the <italic>Wahabi</italic>’ ideology of terror.</p>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021909611427252">Hamid Algar (2002</xref>: 47) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0021909611427252">Khaled Abou El Fadl (2005</xref>: 76–7), the <italic>Salafi–Wahabi</italic> nexus is not a linear and monolithic spectrum; that is, rootedness in <italic>Qur’an</italic> and <italic>Sunnah</italic> leads to a tendency towards an armed struggle (<italic>qital</italic>). While some of the <italic>Wahabis</italic> believe strongly in <italic>jihad</italic> by way of <italic>qital, Salafis</italic> distance themselves and argue against military and clandestine methods to assume power. To the <italic>Salafis</italic>, armed struggles will only cause political instability, therefore disrupting the wider concerns of practical devotions that Muslims need to focus on such as the <italic>Hajj</italic> (pilgrimage) and the more pressing need to maintain Muslim identity in the face of global challenges which are manifested in economic and cultural imperialism in the evolving post-modern world today (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021909611427252">Algar, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0021909611427252">El Fadl, 2005</xref>). The extremist <italic>Wahabis</italic> within the <italic>Salafi–Wahabi</italic> nexus therefore is an isolated group crafting its own agenda in a mobile environment.</p>
<p>A <italic>salafi</italic> intellectual activist from Tunisia, Rachid Al-Ghannoushi, calls upon Muslims to take on the identity of ‘realistic fundamentalist’ or ‘authenticated realism’. In these concepts, Ghannoushi elaborated that the revival of Islamic values must take into consideration social, political and economic realities coupled with acknowledgement of the value of religious pluralism. For Al-Ghannoushi, Islam can only thrive under circumstances that allow it to merge with the realities of the time and thus the democratic platform is the best setting for Muslims to engage with (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0021909611427252">Esposito and Voll, 2001</xref>: 108). Through realistic fundamentalism, Al-Ghannoushi espoused the potential gains Islamism can obtain from a fair and open engagement with the modern world. Al-Ghannoushi therefore is a symbol of the moderate element of the religious revivalism in the Muslim world who contextualized canonical sources and history of the Muslim societies to fit in with the secular norms and rights of non-Muslims in the global setting.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0021909611427252">
<title>Counter-Terrorism Religious Discourse</title>
<p>In Southeast Asia, though Islamic religious movements such as the Muhammadiyyah, Singapore Islamic Scholar and Religious Teachers Association (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0021909611427252">PERGAS, n.d.</xref>) and Parti Keadilan Sejahtera (PKS) have their ideological roots from the <italic>Salafi</italic> ideology, they encompass the religious realism propounded by Al-Ghannoushi. While the underlying ideology of the <italic>Salafi–Wahabi</italic> nexus shares similarity with regards to Islam as a total life-guiding system, the practical agendas in making the foundations of Islamic values deep-rooted differs greatly between the Islamic movements with a broad <italic>Salafi</italic> strain as compared to a narrow <italic>Wahabi</italic>-<italic>jihadist</italic> interpretation. To the <italic>Wahabi-jihadist</italic>, the constant state of warfare (<italic>qital</italic>) to attain the Islamic state is a symbol of true belief and tribulations. To the <italic>Salafis</italic>, however, the purification of belief of the ‘Oneness of God’ is paramount in establishing the Islamic state in oneself which, subsequently, will lead to one adhering to the commandments of God. Warfare, therefore, is only permitted in a situation of self-defence. While the <italic>Wahabis</italic> are interested in outer manifestations of religiosity, the <italic>Salafis</italic> prioritize the substantive basis of Islam: purification of the soul.</p>
<p>Thus it is crucial to acknowledge that, though Islamic bodies like Parti Islam Se-Malaysia (PAS) and Nahdatul Ulama (NU) are not <italic>Salafi</italic>-type organizations, their role in combating the terrorist ideology is equally important since they encompass Muslim scholars as well as activists who are rooted in the traditional conception of religious ethics and therefore religious adherence. As traditionalists, NU and PAS believe in the purification of one’s soul and constitutional means to attain power as it is fundamental that society and state are in constant peace. Thus, like their co-religionists in the <italic>Salafi</italic> category, NU and PAS embody the realistic fundamentalism or authentic realism as espoused by Rachid Al-Ghannoushi.</p>
<p>Within Southeast Asia, Muslim leadership institutions play a leading role in issuing religious decrees in matters involving personal devotion and public affairs. These institutions therefore have tremendous contribution to the <italic>Wahabi-jihadist</italic> impasse. Though Muslim-majority countries like Indonesia consist of populations who are divided between modernist and traditionalist organizations – Muhammadiyyah and Nahdatul Ulama – the assurance these organizations provide to the development of Islam in the local-democratic framework ensure that Indonesian Muslims are not deeply and widely fragmented. In other words, these two institutions have played their role well in ensuring that Muslims in Indonesia have compass-point organizations to base their opinions on matters regarding life from the Islamic perspective.</p>
<p>Both Muhammadiyyah and Nahdatul Ulama were forthcoming in their support towards the war on terror. Additionally, they even criticized terrorism and Al-Qaeda’s interpretation of Islam (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021909611427252">Abuza, 2003</xref>: 192). They have appeared together in public to emphasize that Islam does not advocate violence and warned against the misuse of religion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0021909611427252">Rabasa, 2003</xref>: 69). These efforts of criticizing and public appearance in unity signify the huge efforts these two organizations have undertaken in assisting the ideological war against terrorism. Muhammadiyyah and Nahdatul Ulama are highly regarded Muslim organizations in Indonesia. With 50 million followers in their network of pesantrens, universities and think-tanks, effectively a quarter of Indonesian Muslims have been covered in the ideological engagement against terrorism. Moreover, Muhammadiyyah and Nahdatul Ulama emphasized education in reforming Indonesian Muslims. In this sense, therefore, both Muhammadiyyah and Nahdatul Ulama are organizations that carry realistic fundamentalism approaches in social liberation as opposed to extremists’ interpretations. Their participation in the GWOT using the ideological front is a soft power approach.</p>
<p>A criticism that can be given towards <italic>Salafi</italic> movements such as the Muhammadiyyah is this: the strict interpretation of Islam that they offer may have been a starting base for Muslims to be more ideologically strained in religious interpretation, thus paving way for extremist interpretation. In contrast to Muhammadiyyah, the Nahdatul Ulama’s syncretic and embracing style of merging Islamic doctrines with local practices allow for a broader appreciation of differences that exist in society. However, to equate puritanist ideology to terrorism is a narrow evaluation as there are other related factors such as socio-political marginalization and personal-group dynamics which facilitate the path towards <italic>Wahabism-jihadist</italic> fervour. Furthermore, interestingly, in 2003 the US provided some funding to the Muhammadiyyah and Nahdatul Ulama to promote tolerance among the different faiths as well as the struggle against terrorism. The progressive nature of these two organizations is therefore recognized as a key element in the ‘soft approach’ to debase the ideology of terror (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0021909611427252">Ramakrishna, 2005</xref>: 359–60).</p>
<p>A stronger <italic>Salafi</italic>-oriented Muslim party which believes in the implementation of the <italic>Shari’ah</italic> and the establishment of the Islamic state, the Parti Keadilan Sejahtera (PKS) has also been imminent in its ideological debate against terrorist ideology. In one of Parti Keadilan Sejahtera’s publication <italic>Fatwa-Fatwa Dewan Syariah Parti Keadilan Sejahtera</italic>, the religious decree towards <italic>jihad</italic> clearly states that opposition and challenge to the state must be linked to constitutional means (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0021909611427252">Al-Jufri, 2006</xref>: 194). This means that the democratic process implemented by the current Indonesian government which is consociational in nature must be duly adhered to (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0021909611427252">PKS, n.d.</xref>). The religious decree also attributes to the foremost the role of government and humanitarian organizations in ensuring peace in society. <italic>Jihad</italic> by way of warfare is only permissible for the sake of defending against attack (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0021909611427252">Al-Jufri, 2006</xref>: 209). Offensive engagement is therefore rendered impermissible. Though religious decree from Muslim religious scholars are non-binding, these <italic>fatwas</italic> must be closely adhered to and respected, especially when there is a general consensus on a certain issue among Muslim scholars worldwide. With regards to a defensive <italic>jihad</italic>, the opinions of Muslim scholars worldwide are certainly consensual.</p>
<p>In the context of Malaysia, the example of Parti Islam Se-Malaysia (PAS) simultaneously demonstrates how socio-political realities have impacted Islamists’ agenda to remain true to Rachid Al-Ghannoushi terminology of ‘realistic fundamentalism’ and therefore brings legitimacy to the security challenge against Muslim terrorists. In June 2005, PAS leader Abdul Hadi Awang called on the party members to ‘boost their knowledge of other cultures and religions as a requirement to handle a multiracial society’. He also assured party members that PAS would adopt a ‘realistic plan of action that could overcome the challenges of current political realities’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0021909611427252">Rahim, 2004</xref>: 93). Additionally, PAS’s recent stance to use democratic platforms, ideals and precepts as well as non-interference in affairs of the Malaysian government to arrest elements within PAS who are members of the Jemaah Islamiyah points to PAS’s shift away from unadulterated Islamic state-law rhetoric. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0021909611427252">Syed Ahmad Hussein (2002</xref>: 102), even PAS had to adjust to the socio-political realities. Moreover, the disassociation of PAS to the arrest of Nik Aziz’s (PAS Spiritual Leader) son due to connections with the Jemaah Islamiyah points to the constitutional ambit that PAS was firmly rooted to so as to realize the vision of Islamic state and <italic>Shari’ah</italic> as the state’s governing principles. PAS was focused to use democratic processes to retain and attain political power.</p>
<p>In Singapore, the Islamic Religious Council of Singapore (MUIS) is a crucial partner in the efforts to neutralize terrorist ideology. MUIS’s office of Mufti, which comprises religious clergy who adhere to traditionalist–modernist typology of the <italic>Salafi</italic> ideology, believes that, though Islam is fundamental to Muslim life, the socio-political reality is to be taken into consideration within contemporary Muslim worldview. MUIS henceforth called on Muslims not to be drawn into the terrorists’ ideology of <italic>jihad</italic>. The rejection of <italic>jihadist</italic> paradigm is apparent in Friday prayer sermons in which MUIS declares the <italic>jihadist</italic> paradigm as an anti-thesis to harmony, forbearance and tolerance. Subsequently, MUIS denounce terrorism as an act of destruction by <italic>jihadists</italic> who have a narrow interpretation of the religion, engrossed in their own perspective of issues leading to transgression of humanity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0021909611427252">Islamic Religious Council of Singapore, 2007</xref>: 1). Thus, even though MUIS states that Muslims are required to assist their fellow brethren in other countries, humanitarian works are the only legitimate area of assistance. Moreover, to MUIS, Islam promotes the advancement of harmony and peaceful relations between Muslims and non-Muslims. Hence MUIS call upon all parties within the Muslim community in Singapore to ensure that the terrorist ideology is marginalized for the benefit of Singaporeans at large (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0021909611427252">Kassim, 2002</xref>: 25–6).</p>
<p>The security predicament caused by terrorism has also led to an elevation of the security dilemma by the Singapore government. Though the Singapore government supported the GWOT to offset an impending outcry of religious bias by the Singapore government towards Muslims in Singapore, the Singapore government further supported the build-up of social cohesion and ethno-religious harmony by implementing new policies to rebuild trust between the communities. Prominent Muslim leaders in Singapore were drafted into the engagement against ideology of terror. Among the initiatives that the Singapore government has taken on is the formation of the Religious Rehabilitation Group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0021909611427252">RRG, n.d.</xref>) whose aim is to study the Jemaah Islamiyah’s ideology, offer expert opinion in understanding JI misinterpretation of Islam, produce necessary counter-ideological materials, and to conduct public education for the Muslim community on religious extremism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0021909611427252">Hassan and Pereira, 2006</xref>: 461–2). In the RRG, prolific Muslim scholars from traditional and modernist camps are incorporated so as to represent the broad spectrum of Muslim orientations that are against the ideology of terror. This traditionalist–modernist incorporation is useful and provides legitimacy when giving counselling to captive terrorists and their family members. The broad approach ensures that the local religious clergy impressed on the detainees and their family members the problematic <italic>jihadist</italic> ideology of hate and violence.</p>

<title>Hard Power Approach</title>

<title>Singapore</title>
<p>Within the context of Singapore, the ruthless method of detention without trial in dealing with the threat of communalism and communism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0021909611427252">Singh, 1992</xref>: 110) is now extended to terrorism. A publication produced by the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0021909611427252">Ministry of Home Affairs (2002a)</xref> explains the use of Internal Security Act (ISA) and the history-processes of the act in detaining suspects. Critics have pointed out that the lack of solid evidence to criminalize the terrorist suspects was supplemented by the draconian Internal Security Act, used against Barisan Sosialis in the 1960s and ‘Marxist Conspiracy’ of 1987 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0021909611427252">Rahim, 2003</xref>: 224). The ISA and the Internal Security Department (ISD), however, justified their existence when the ISD placed a Singaporean of Pakistani descent in detention. Muhammad Aslam Yar Ali Khan came under surveillance of the ISD after the ISD received a tip-off from a local Muslim that he had links with Al-Qaeda. Aslam departed suddenly for Afghanistan on 4 October 2001 and was later reported by a ‘foreign intelligence agency’ to have been detained by the Northern Alliance on 29 November 2001. Subsequently, in December 2001, Singapore’s police arrested 13 people, eight of whom were alleged to have been trained at the Al-Qaeda camps in Afghanistan, planning bomb attacks against the US embassy and American naval vessels. The pre-emptive move by the ISD therefore was crucial for national security.</p>
<p>The existence of an Al Qaeda-affiliated network in Southeast Asia was dramatically highlighted by the arrests in Singapore since January 2002 of another 31 members of the extremist Jemaah Islamiyah group which operated a clandestine network of cells in Malaysia and Indonesia. In August 2002, evidently following up on evidence gained through the previous year’s arrests, the ISD detained an additional 21 persons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0021909611427252">Ministry of Home Affairs Singapore, 2003</xref>: 2). Detention of suspects through information sharing and surveillance is a key feature of realizing state security and therefore national interest in the quest for social stability which the Jemaah Islamiyah could have upset through the acts of sabotage. Additionally, though the intelligence apparatus of the Singapore state is successful as an anti-thesis to terrorist network, Singaporeans must also be mobilized towards the cause of national security.</p>
<p>To realize a more holistic approach towards national security, thus strengthening the state’s legitimacy, the Singapore government introduced the concept of ‘total defence’ in 1984. Total defence entails participation of elites and other members of the population to the sacred role of ensuring racial–religious harmony, military prowess, national wealth maintenance and accumulation, social fortitude against challenges and assisting each other in times of trouble (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0021909611427252">Total Defence, n.d</xref>.). Total defence as a pillar of the nation’s advancement and survival is manifested into policies and programmes that aim to enhance the cardinal aspects of human security relating to socio-economic welfare. In hindsight, total defence becomes more relevant to offset the threat of terrorism in causing possible harm on inter-ethnic relations. The concept of defence was transformed from traditional issues of security such as military might to that of social cohesion, citizen policing, patriotism and national consciousness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0021909611427252">Mutalib, 2002</xref>: 132). For example, a brochure encapsulates the concept of people’s participation in defence when it mentions ‘There’s a part for everyone in preventing terrorism: Guarding against terrorism – What you can do’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0021909611427252">Ministry of Home Affairs Singapore, 2002b</xref>). Even taxi drivers and commuters are not spared this effort, with advertisements reminding them to inform the police of unattended things and suspicious behaviours.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Singapore’s state technocratic approach to governance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0021909611427252">Rodan, 2006</xref>: 3–4), co-option of community leaders and sponsoring of organizations ranging from government- to non-government-related agencies made possible the ideological war on terrorism. Through the agency of People Association (PA), the Inter-Religious Confidence Circle (IRCC) was set up to enhance inter-religious ties, complementing the existing Resident Committee (RC) and Consultative Committee Club (CCC), (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0021909611427252">Ministry of Home Affairs Singapore, 2003</xref>: 23). These formations and mobilizations of new and existing state affiliated organizations upon the onset of the war on terror aimed to integrate Muslims into the mainstream community. They were also established to ensure that the fragile inter-ethnic relations between the various ethnic groups were not left unabated.</p>
<p>At the level of ethnic-religious leadership, statutory boards such as MENDAKI (Council for the Development of Singapore Muslim Community) and MUIS declared their distaste against terrorist ideology. MUIS produced a blueprint that embodies an identity of a Singaporean Muslim within the framework of a nation-state. MUIS promoted the idea of the 10 attributes of Singaporean Muslims among which tolerance, civilization development and love for peace are among them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0021909611427252">MUIS, n.d.</xref>). MUIS also modernized local Islamic schools (madrasahs) by embracing secular subjects relevant to the needs of the modern world. Responding to the call by the Singapore government that community leaders and civic organizations in the Muslim community must debunk terrorist ideology, PERGAS, (Association of Muslim Professionals) AMP and Jamiyah supported the detention of terrorists under the ISA. They also sent religious representatives to support the government’s initiative to rehabilitate the detainees through the Religious Rehabilitation Group (RRG).</p>
<p>Internationally, in terms of policy declaration and international scene, the Singapore government gave strong support to the US in its declaration of war against international terrorism. A number of Singaporean political leaders publicly affirmed Singapore’s backing of the US’s efforts to hunt down the terrorists responsible for the 9/11 atrocities in New York and Washington. On 23 September 2001, at a huge memorial at Singapore’s National Stadium attended by some 15,000 people, Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong affirmed that Singapore would stand with the US in the fight against terrorism, even though it had to manage both regional and domestic sensitivities in doing so (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0021909611427252">Ministry of Defence Singapore National Security Coordination Centre, 2004</xref>: 12). Subsequent events of multiple arrests through intelligence sharing with US illustrates that the global war against terrorism indeed had great resonance within the region.</p>
<p>To further impress the severity of the situation to national security, a National Security Coordination Secretariat was set up under the preview of the Prime Minister’s Office to co-ordinate the implementation of a new security architecture that would enhance protection of Singapore against such asymmetric terrorist threats. A National Security Coordination Council (NSCC) and a Joint Counter-Terrorism Centre (JCTC) was established within the secretariat. The NSCC and JCTC comprise of intelligence personnel seconded from Ministry of Home Affairs and Ministry of Defence and regularly reports to Security Policy Review Committee and Singapore’s Prime Minister (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0021909611427252">Ministry of Defence Singapore National Security Coordination Centre, 2004</xref>: 37). This inter-ministry combination aimed to streamline measures that can be used collectively to deal with the threat of terrorism other than creating a security organization directly responsible to the Prime Minister. The Home Affairs Ministry also formed the Home Front Security Centre to oversee various operations and joint exercises. The multiplicity of mirror intelligence organizations ensures that ‘no stone is left unturned’ in search for evidence to pre-empt terrorist attacks in the country.</p>
<p>Additionally, the Singapore government tightened border controls by forming a new department responsible for border checks, passed a legislation act on strategic goods to check on goods which could be used for making ammunitions, conducted enhancement training for security agencies and installed more surveillance materials such as metal detectors in strategic places like the airport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0021909611427252">Ministry of Home Affairs Singapore, 2002a</xref>: 21). Monitoring of money laundering and banking checks was also in place (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0021909611427252">Singh, 2003</xref>: 62). Singapore’s police force also launched a rigorous review of financial transactions in the country (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0021909611427252">Dillon, 2002</xref>: 3). Singapore offered logistical support for training on bomb/explosives detection, post-blast investigation, airport security and passport/document security and inspection to regional states such as Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0021909611427252">Emmers and Sebastian, 2005</xref>: 164). The cross-country effort to enhance security of the region therefore is viewed as indispensible to that of Singapore’s security (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0021909611427252">Da Cunha, 2002</xref>: 133–4).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0021909611427252">
<title>Malaysia</title>
<p>Malaysia’ concept of comprehensive security which was inaugurated in 1985 covers political, military, economic, social, cultural and psychological dimensions. Linked to the overarching values of <italic>Rukunegara</italic> (Basic Principle of the State), ethnic chauvinism and religious extremism were harshly dealt with in order to preserve social cohesion and political stability in Malaysia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0021909611427252">Tan, 2004</xref>: 140–1). One lucid example in maintaining socio-political harmony since December 2001 is the detention of 70 people who were related to terrorism. Using the Internal Security Act (ISA) as a means to justify the arrests, Malaysia’s effort to detain the Jemaah Islamiyah operatives has led to the trimming of the terrorist organization. Malaysia’s parliament also passed an amendment to the 1955 Offenses Act which stipulated harsh penalties to those who used violence during campaigns.</p>
<p>Malaysia arguably faces a greater range of challenges in nullifying its terrorist threat as opposed to Singapore. Other than the Jemaah Islamiyah, Malaysia was facing terrorism threats from its own Muslim citizens in the likes of Al-Maunah and the Ibrahim Libya Movement. Within PAS, there are radical elements which propounded violent approaches to change the political system. To date, the Malaysian government has not been able to curtail those radical elements effectively. Since 1998, there has been an upsurge in support for the opposition Islamic party PAS in Malaysia. To curtail the influence of Parti Islam Se-Malaysia (PAS) and enhance Malaysia’s economic competitiveness, the Malaysian government revamped its education system by placing more emphasis on English. Significantly, the Malaysian government reformed the Islamic education curriculum and placed greater restrictions on PAS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0021909611427252">Emmers and Sebastian, 2005</xref>: 165). To the Malaysian government, modernization of the Islamic curriculum entails a shift from radical to moderate interpretations of Islam. Curriculum modernization in Islamic schools (madrasahs) therefore will undermine extremist elements within PAS, whose understanding of Islam is conceived as narrow and conservative and therefore encourages radicalization and political violence.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the establishment and strengthening of Islamic institutions in Malaysia are also ways to manage the tide of Islamism in Malaysia. Islamic banks, universities and think-tanks are co-opted into the frame of governance in order to serve the growing demands for manifestations of Islamic values in life. The Malaysian government uses state political apparatus and institutions as well as co-option strategy to manage the tide of Islamic movement (<italic>da’waah</italic>). For example, the selection of Anwar Ibrahim as the United Malays National Organization (UMNO) elite was a step in this direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0021909611427252">Milne and Mauzy, 1999</xref>: 85). Anwar’s entrance into UMNO enhances UMNO’s legitimacy in the Malay Muslim constituency. The co-option of Anwar Ibrahim therefore was a master-stroke by Dr Mahathir Mohamad. Using and through Anwar Ibrahim’s leadership, the genre of Islamic <italic>da’waah</italic> in Malaysia focuses on peaceful conversion of locals and the revival of the true Islamic spirit of personal and communal piety through the acts of practical devotion. Education is the true hallmark of a Muslim’s quest to better oneself and to compete with the modern world which Anwar Ibrahim propagated for the Malaysian state when he was Education Minister.</p>
<p>Besides co-opting Anwar Ibrahim, with the challenge of PAS looming at the heels of UMNO, in 2001, Dr Mahathir Mohamad declared Malaysia as an Islamic state. This declaration is a culmination of the Islamization programmes of UMNO in order to outbid PAS in winning votes of the Malays and Muslims. Thus PAS had intensified UMNO’s Islamization plan. UMNO craftily adopted Islamization plans so as to manage the tide of religious resurgence in order to prevent the proliferation of extremist interpretation of religion as purported by some elements within PAS. Though UMNO would engage PAS in a ‘war of words’ before and during elections as a manifestation of political debate in public, the UMNO-led Malaysian government will not hesitate to cripple PAS using punitive measures of border restrictions and the ISA. Nik Adli Nik Aziz, the son of Nik Aziz (PAS Spiritual Leader) was detained unconditionally by the Malaysian government. Malaysia managed to deal with the extremists groups effectively and therefore prevented domestic instability from a local Muslim community backlash (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0021909611427252">Richardson, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Additionally, a crackdown on Kumpulan Mujahidin Malaysia (KMM) militants also led to a sizeable portion of PAS senior party members being detained (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0021909611427252">Chalk, 2005</xref>: 25). In October 2001, several thousand angry PAS supporters protested in front of the US embassy decrying Washington’s actions in Afghanistan. Nik Aziz Nik Mat warned that if the US did not stop its attacks, he would not prevent his supporters from retaliating by joining the war in Afghanistan. The Malaysian government, however, blocked any travel by would-be <italic>jihadists</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0021909611427252">Capie, 2004</xref>: 230). The stringent checks of immigration through crackdown on visa fraud and suspected terrorist from Iraq and Afghanistan were also upheld in this instance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021909611427252">Abuza, 2003</xref>: 217). Thus border security was enhanced to prevent elements within and outside Malaysia from linking up with fellow <italic>jihadists</italic>.</p>
<p>For the sake of Malaysia’s national security, the reaffirmation of state Islamic institutions in Malaysia is also a poignant stance and embedding of state control of the discourse on terror. When the Ulama Association of Malaysia (UAM) issued a religious decree (<italic>fatwa</italic>) condemning the US war in Afghanistan, urging Malaysians to boycott American products, then Deputy Prime Minister Abdullah Badawi disregarded their religious decree by mentioning that only the Malaysian state’s <italic>Shari’ah</italic> court had the rights to issue such a religious decree (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021909611427252">Abuza, 2003</xref>: 218). This political move is important to the Malaysian government’s conception of security and sovereignty. The Malaysian government did not allow any form of power sharing, especially for those that were couched in religious parlance outside the ambit of the Malaysian state’s apparatus. Only the state and her institutions are legitimate sources of political contestation and brokering. PAS therefore had crossed the limits of politicking and power-bargaining which therefore necessitated the Malaysian government to neutralize PAS’s increasing public popularity.</p>
<p>In terms of relations with world powers, the Malaysian government has taken a pragmatic approach to buttress domestic engagement against terrorism. Though Dr Mahathir Mohamad was critical of American support of Israel and lack of justice towards the plight of Palestinians, he was quick to condemn Palestinian acts of sabotage (suicide bombings) as terrorism. Thus, despite the increasing frequency of incongruous notes in the diplomatic discourse with the US, Malaysia has enhanced defence and security cooperation with Washington. Indeed, evidence suggests that, since 9/11, cooperation has expanded significantly in some important areas. The bilateral defence relationship between Malaysia and the US is deeply extensive. In a speech to the Heritage Foundation in Washington in May 2002, then Defence Minister Najib Tun Abdul Razak gave some indication of its scale. He revealed that the US military aircraft average more than 1,000 over-flights through Malaysian airspace annually, regular exchanges of senior military and intelligence officials, and American law enforcement personnel were given the right to question a Malaysian citizen being held prisoner under the Internal Security Act (ISA).</p>
<p>In March 2003, even as American forces launched attacks against targets in Iraq, Malaysia and the US co-hosted an Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Regional Forum Inter-sessional Meeting on Counter-Terrorism and Transnational Crime in Sabah (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0021909611427252">Capie, 2004</xref>: 233). A Southeast Asia Centre for Counter Terrorism which holds training programmes, workshops and seminars was also established to set best practices and experience sharing of participants from all over the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0021909611427252">Salleh, 2004</xref>: 13). Malaysia’s swift efforts in combating terrorism, which made the country a much less safe haven for terrorists, earned respect of terrorism experts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0021909611427252">Liow, 2004</xref>: 247). The hard approach in dealing with the threat of terrorism by the Malaysian government bears much resemblance to her maritime counterpart, the Singapore government. As a result, terrorism activities and terrorist ideology were duly subdued. Singaporeans and Malaysians therefore are guaranteed socio-political peace and stability to date.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The success of soft and hard power approaches in the war against terror ideology and terror activities in maritime Southeast Asia lies in the integrated efforts of states, Muslim organizations and leaders in dealing with the terror threat. Efficient and professional security services, along with political, deal firmly with terrorist threats and are among critical elements in this regional counter-terrorism effort. Other than wide-ranging capabilities in adopting comprehensive anti-terrorist strategies, inter-government efforts buttress the regional war on terrorism. Good intelligence cooperation on the terrorist threat and inter-state cooperation between ASEAN countries and the US buttress respective national, and thereby regional, security of maritime Southeast Asia. Within the regional context, Southeast Asian countries such as Indonesia, Singapore and Malaysia have been proactive in their efforts to bolster regional capabilities in combating terrorism. Furthermore, it should be duly recognized that these counter terrorism efforts, which are manifested in soft and hard power approaches, have the support of Muslim leaders and organizations who have debunked the <italic>jihadist</italic> ideology of hate and political violence, thus providing a comprehensive approach in the global as well as regional war on terrorism.</p>
