<p>This <italic>Journal of Macromarketing</italic> special issue on Anti-Consumption Research and Society was guest edited by Michael S. W. Lee of the University of Auckland, New Zealand, Hélène Cherrier of Griffith University, Australia, and Russell Belk of York University, Canada. I have had a long-standing interest in the history of anti-consumption – especially the roles of consumer boycotts and frugality discourses in U.S. history – and am very pleased with the assemblage of new research the guest editors have brought together for this special issue. The four refereed articles critically analyze the anti-consumption concept from the perspective of reasons theory; investigate why consumers may be reluctant reluctance to engage in boycotts against an international company; show how activist consumers form “carrotmobs” (aka “buycotts” or inverse boycotts) to support virtuous businesses; and investigate the collective normative barriers that prevent alcohol abstinence, and how non-profits can realize social change. A commentary article then explores anti-consumption from an art exhibit’s take on the global fast fashion industry. A second short commentary represents a <italic>Journal of Macromarketing</italic> first: the use of poetry on anti-consumption as an alternative mode of knowledge representation. In their introductory article, our guest editors preview these fine works, discuss the importance of non-consumers and anti-consumption phenomenon within a consumerist world, and stress the need for further research. The Journal owes Mike, Hélène, and Russ a profound debt of gratitude for putting together such an excellent assemblage of macromarketing thought.</p>
