<abstract>
<p>Recent studies of post-collapse regeneration of early state societies have explained the renewed growth of social complexity using the concepts of template regeneration and stimulus regeneration. While such terms are useful generalized concepts, the discussion around them in practice inhibits an understanding of the various social processes implicated in the renewed growth of states, particularly due to the primary focus on elite urban populations. Rather than emphasizing types of regeneration, my approach analyzes how agents transformed rural communities during collapse and subsequent restructuring. Utilizing a case study from the Petén Lakes region, Guatemala, the article makes the point that rural commoners must be considered active to adequately characterize regeneration. An examination of the base of society focuses on intentional choices made to change settlement patterns, architecture and stone tool procurement and usage in order to better understand heterogeneity in the Classic-Postclassic transformation of Maya society (AD 750–1200).</p>

<sec id="sec1-1469605313487820" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Through investigating rural communities with archaeology, important lessons can be learned regarding how particular complex societies operated, what tensions existed and how sociopolitical dynamics played out in prehistory. Recent studies of the collapse of ancient complex societies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1469605313487820">Diamond, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1469605313487820">Gill, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1469605313487820">Webster, 2002</xref>) have, however, focused on environmental processes, such as droughts, as explanations. Responding to the interest in collapse, there also has been a spate of studies on post-collapse regeneration. These studies emphasize adaptation, resilience and renewed growth of complexity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1469605313487820">McAnany and Yoffee, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1469605313487820">Schwarz, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1469605313487820">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1469605313487820">Schwartz and Nicholls, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1469605313487820">Tainter, 2006</xref>). Most detailed archaeological investigations have concentrated on collapses or their immediate aftermaths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1469605313487820">Culbert, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1469605313487820">Rice et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1469605313487820">Tainter, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1469605313487820">Yoffee and Cowgill, 1988</xref>). Fewer studies are on specific effects of collapse or the restructuring of society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1469605313487820">Conlee, 2006</xref>). Almost no studies have looked at how agency exercised in rural communities during collapse was transformative and conditioned subsequent restructuring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1469605313487820">Schwarz, 2004</xref>). Rather, the focus has been on how elites fared, transitions in trade (particularly of status-linked goods), politics, religion and how stratified political systems re-emerged. This article examines rural communities and the active choices they made to ensure their own survival, both creating heterogeneity among communities and transforming society in ways that have not yet been dealt with by regeneration studies.</p>
<p>As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1469605313487820">Yoffee (2006: 227)</xref> states, studies of regeneration are valuable because they engage questions of ‘Why is the past recalled or one part of the past emphasized and other parts forgotten?’ The role of rural commoners in collapse and regeneration is particularly important to understand. They generated surpluses that supported social stratification, urbanization, monumentality and related state practices. To date, archaeologists have seen rural people mostly as passive receptacles on the receiving end of elite actions or elite-driven trends rather than as active or creative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1469605313487820">Lohse and Valdez, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1469605313487820">Robin, 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1469605313487820">2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1469605313487820">Schwarz, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1469605313487820">Schwartz and Falconer, 2003</xref>). Emphasis has been on the regeneration of the government and re-emergence of elites rather than the resurgence of the base of society.</p>
<p>Archaeologists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1469605313487820">Bronson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1469605313487820">Masson et al., 2006</xref>) have identified various forms of regeneration such as template regeneration, a revival process based on a prior political system, and stimulus regeneration, regeneration based on external models or historical memories. These concepts, while useful jumping off points, unfortunately in practice mask variability and have not led to holistic explanations of social transformation. There is also vagueness to the existing discussion of regeneration. The term is loaded by implying that states are in constant political flux and not whole and functioning unto themselves. Regeneration studies should focus on potential drivers of change such as innovation, choices and social mobility, which are increasingly evident in archaeological studies. This article presents a theoretical discussion and considers a case study on the theme of rural agency in the regeneration of complex societies. The case study illustrates how Lowland Maya rural communities transformed their architecture, settlement patterns and lithic procurement in response to events of the Maya Collapse (AD 800–1000).</p>
<p>By looking through the rearview mirror, in this case at Maya societies of the Postclassic period (AD 1000–1525), the article contributes to the collapse and regeneration literatures. It focuses on how agency and innovation feature in social processes unleashed by collapse, and how rural commoner agency and innovation contribute to the regeneration of complex societies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1469605313487820">Giddens, 1979</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1469605313487820">1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1469605313487820">Schwarz, 2004</xref>, 2009). I conceive of individuals as active within communities of practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1469605313487820">Hendon, 2010</xref>), a concept which overcomes limitations of previous practice theory-based notions of community, as described below. I model innovation in material culture as occurring through a process Bourdieu (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1469605313487820">1977</xref>: 96) describes as ‘invention within limits’. Invention within limits suggests that actors readily utilize already existing materials within a culture to fashion new solutions to problems as they arise. Agency and innovation produce iterative solutions and variable practices in response to novel circumstances. Divergences occasioned by the actions undertaken in communities lead to heterogeneity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1469605313487820">Yaeger and Robin, 2004</xref>) in the fate of polities, settlements and collectivities, which subsequently beget a changed society.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-1469605313487820"><title>Regeneration of complex societies</title>
<p>Bronson (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1469605313487820">2006</xref>: 140) defines template regeneration as a revival process that adheres to a fully understood, well-recorded model. He states that regenerations in China took advantage of previous forms of government organization as preserved by widespread literacy, and particularly knowledge curated by Confucian scholar/bureaucrats. Stimulus regeneration is revival based on external models or historical memories -- and some of the historical memories are probably incorrect. The polity regenerates due to these outside influences, although the development of centralization anew is often made possible by ‘wrapping it in the mantle of a glorious past’ (2006: 138--142). The archetypal example is the Holy Roman Empire, which traced its putative roots to ancient Rome, although in actuality it had several diverse sources, none of which were Roman.</p>
<p>Masson et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1469605313487820">2006</xref>) write that the Postclassic Maya, particularly in the Yucatecan city of Mayapán, participated in both template regeneration and stimulus regeneration. In their discussion, the authors focus on selective replication of political institutions and monumental architecture prevalent at Chichén Itzá, an earlier Yucatecan center. They see some of these developments as emanating from the Maya Highlands and Central Mexico. These authors discuss institutional transformations based on structural change due to the selective recall of historical memories. The selective aspect of regeneration involved modified acceptance of the architectural canon from Chichén Itzá and practices like tribute and gifting. Other new practices include a council form of government and increased mercantilism. Masson et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1469605313487820">2006</xref>) view these as transformations of Classic polities, which were based on divine unitary kingships and displayed less evidence of mercantilism. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1469605313487820">Chase and Chase (2006)</xref> express a similar view of selective regeneration of Postclassic polities in the Southern Lowlands of Guatemala and Belize. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1469605313487820">Yoffee (2006)</xref>, in reviewing these chapters, states that Postclassic regeneration was a drastic rearrangement of social and ideological systems.</p>
<p>We can understand transformation only by looking holistically at the entire social and cultural system, however. There must be some accounting of the sociology of various segments of society because their responses differ following collapse. One of the most powerful ways to address the sociology of post-collapse periods is to use agency theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1469605313487820">Giddens, 1984</xref>) in order to model the role of intentional change and innovation in regeneration.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1469605313487820">Giddens (1984)</xref> believes society is brought into being by intentional human action (agency) and is continually and iteratively renegotiated and modified. Individual action is not the only basis for agency since, during interaction, social groups often take the form of actors in some extended sense (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1469605313487820">Earle, 1997</xref>). Giddens notes that actions often have unintentional consequences so that goals and intentions of the actors are not always met, and new problems spring up as the result of action. Archaeologists often overlook this point, but it is important because goal-driven actions are sometimes overshadowed by unintended consequences of action.</p>
<p>Giddens defines two types of resources: authoritative resources that are symbolic and ideological, and allocative resources that are material (land, labor and materials). He distinguishes three structural dimensions of social systems: signification, domination and legitimation. First among related structural properties are ‘codes of signification’ involving authorization and legitimation of command over persons and objects in the ‘contexts of use’ that effectively link symbolic structure with social regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1469605313487820">Giddens, 1979</xref>: 97–101; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1469605313487820">Giddens, 1984</xref>: 31). Social domination takes place by discursive communication resulting in specific modes of resource authorization, involving political institutions; resource allocation, involving economic institutions; and legitimation, involving the normative regulation of conduct. Ideology links to all institutions and its employment leads to the creation of a symbolic order. Rural persons and collectivities are entrained in hierarchical structures of the state within relationships (e.g. tribute obligations, subservient religious and political roles and norms) with elite actors and state institutions. This entrainment can never be total; it is only partial and can only be maintained through continual action reinforcing hierarchy.</p>
<p>If social domination is effective then authoritative and allocative resources are mobilized. This mobilization allows the transformative capacity of command, or power, over persons who then structure the material productions that support this symbolic order (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1469605313487820">Giddens, 1984</xref>: 29–33). If social domination is ineffective or fails, as in a political collapse, then presumably rural actors and collectivities would create new forms of communication, e.g. through invention within limits, and engage in new or modified material productions suited to their needs and their shared or divergent histories, a process that leads to a new symbolic order.</p>
<p>One critical intervention that updates structuration theory is <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1469605313487820">Hendon’s (2010)</xref> application of communities of practice to archaeological contexts. The communities of practice concept emphasizes learning that develops through shared practice over time. This temporal emphasis is a needed corrective to Bourdieu’s concept of habitus, which has come to be considered almost a fixed cultural background. Mostly due to the snapshot nature of Bourdieu’s ethnographic work, his formulation admitted very little cultural process. Communities of practice develop from the way in which mutual engagement in a joint enterprise is defined and sustained through practice involving a shared repertoire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1469605313487820">Wenger, 1998</xref>: 73). The dynamic consequences of practice shift through time as day-to-day and long-term realities are produced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1469605313487820">Hendon, 2010</xref>). Negotiation within the community is key to understanding how a set of resources is made available for further engagement in practice and the repertoire of practice may shift as the result of this process. Negotiation reflects the history of mutual engagement and may further innovation as practitioners jointly establish points of reference or norms and new meanings with these resources as circumstances change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1469605313487820">Hutson, 2010</xref>), but the process remains inherently ambiguous. In this context, these communities of practice are in dialogue and alternately maintained continuity or changed their architecture and obsidian procurement. These shared practices are intersubjective in their historical dimensions and are based on distinctive material domains. They are contexts for remembering and forgetting over time.</p>
<p>One might ask, why not adopt a Marxist perspective in this article? Early Marxist archaeologists like V. Gordon Childe saw social change as a unilineal unfolding of the forces of production. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1469605313487820">Thompson (1970)</xref> and Hamblin and Pitcher (1978) stated that a peasant revolt led to the overthrow of the Classic kings. However, few Mayanists endorse this view today. Most current researchers do not support these views due to a lack of evidence across broad areas of the Classic Lowlands. This phenomenon does not appear to have been a prime mover in causing the collapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1469605313487820">Webster, 2002</xref>). More researchers see multiple factors at work in the collapse, such as inter-elite competition and warfare, instabilities in the institution of divine kingship, elite/commoner conflict, which was localized, and ecological or climatic instability. Many researchers consider some combination of these factors to be decisive and conflict between elites and commoners is only one contributor. A structuration perspective factors in the role of agency and the structuring effects of institutions in multi-causal processes. Such a perspective leads to explanations that deal better with known or suspected complexities of the Maya Collapse. A unilineal economism is poorly suited to Classic period realities.</p>
<p>Next, I discuss the collapse and regeneration of Maya states, specifically a case study of the Petén Lakes region, Guatemala. The presentation describes three kinds of resources whose use was transformed during the Classic-Postclassic transition. I focus on authoritative resources, the organization of architecture and settlement patterning, and an allocative resource, procurement of obsidian tools.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-1469605313487820"><title>Collapse and regeneration of Petén Lakes Maya societies</title>
<p>The Petén Lakes region is one of the few regions in the Southern Maya Lowlands where regeneration can be addressed. It is among the few regions where substantial Postclassic populations survived and are well enough researched and understood to be discussed in depth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1469605313487820">Figure 1</xref>). Other regions have not yet had as much investigation as the Lakes region. A chain of lakes extends east-to-west across central Petén, in northern Guatemala. The largest is Lake Petén Itzá, and Lakes Quexil and Petenxil are smaller lakes southeast of it. Larger Classic centers such as Tikal and Uaxactun were north of the Lakes region while other polity centers such as Seibal, Dos Pilas and other Petexbatún region sites were to the southwest. The Lakes region was a periphery between these two cores.
<fig id="fig1-1469605313487820" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Central Petén region with lakes and sites mentioned in the text.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1469605313487820-fig1.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p>Settlement patterns and architecture identify the symbolic spatial order by which the Maya lived their lives. The Maya made a major transformation between the Late Classic (AD 500–800) and Postclassic. Also, acquisition and manufacturing of stone tools (procurement) are long-studied areas of subsistence economy. Lithic tool procurement activities leave durable primary evidence and byproducts. These artifacts are useful gauges of certain forms of exchange. The interest is in comparisons of status-linked obsidian, which was acquired from long distances (the Highlands of Guatemala and Mexico), versus locally available cherts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1469605313487820">Rice, 1984</xref>). Lakes communities modified how they acquired and consumed obsidian and chert in ways that indicate actively strategizing during a period of change.</p>
<p>Late Classic settlement was organized concentrically around large polity capitals. A four site-size hierarchy existed with minor centers and agricultural hamlets inhabiting broad areas around capitals. Capitals were major centers and had the most formal and substantial architecture, as well as carved monuments. Minor centers had less formal masonry architecture, and were politically dependent on major centers. Agricultural hamlets were collections of primarily domestic structures, often clustered within plaza groups. Individual houses, minimal residential units (MRU), are the smallest permanently inhabited sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1469605313487820">Ashmore, 1981</xref>). The maintenance of polity space was such that agriculturists lived in rural areas, in small hamlets or isolated MRUs, for example, around Tikal, apparently without substantial fear of raids. Thus, a dispersed settlement pattern existed in rural areas.</p>
<p>In the Lakes region, small centers were present both near the lakes and away from the lakeshore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1469605313487820">Moriarty, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1469605313487820">Rice, 1988</xref>). By the end of the Late Classic and during the Terminal Classic (AD 800–1000), however, the Lakes region was in flux, as were the core areas. In place of the concentrically organized site hierarchy, smaller compact sites emerged in defensible locations on islands and peninsulas in the lakes. Examples are the Quexil Islands, Topoxté, Picú, Noj Petén, Zacpetén and Macanché Island (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1469605313487820">Figure 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1469605313487820">Rice, 1988</xref>). Walls defended certain settlements, such as a wall at Zacpetén, which is built on a narrow peninsula extending into Lake Salpetén (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1469605313487820">Rice et al., 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>Quexil Basin ceramics indicate substantial continuity from the Late Classic to later occupations. The Quexil Islands were first settled intensively in the Terminal Classic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1469605313487820">Figure 2</xref>). As discussed elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1469605313487820">Schwarz, 2004</xref>, 2009), the Quexil Islands were settled by local people seeking refuge due to the uncertainties of the political situation, which was in flux as capitals collapsed and elite protection of the polity space ebbed. Formerly peripheral settlements had to make choices to assure their own survival. Warfare was endemic in the late Late Classic and Terminal Classic.
<fig id="fig2-1469605313487820" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Map of the Quexil Islands.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1469605313487820-fig2.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p>Rural communities, such as those in the Quexil Basin, would have utilized strategies of survival and transformation to preserve themselves. In response to a deteriorating macropolitical situation, they chose to relocate to defensible locations, an exercise of agency by rural persons and collectivities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1469605313487820">Earle, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1469605313487820">Schwarz, 2004</xref>). Rural actors took independent action, which is unconstrained by actions and sanctions of elites in the polity core and indeed is a response to the failure of the polity. A heterogeneous situation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1469605313487820">Yaeger and Robin, 2004</xref>: 150) existed in which the fate of individual communities does not approximate the fate of the polity. This independent action is not part of a template regeneration of the state, but an active response leading to transformed settlement patterns.</p>
<p>The communities that emerged had a different symbolic order of architecture. They modified the architectural design canon to account for the more crowded locations, new socio-religious needs that de-emphasized monumentality and new Epiclassic styles (AD 750–1000; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1469605313487820">Ringle et al., 1998</xref>). Rice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1469605313487820">1988</xref>: 230–237) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1469605313487820">Schwarz (2004)</xref> describe Petén Lakes households and communities. Late Classic houses typically were in formal plaza-centered quadrangular groups with two to four or more structures per group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1469605313487820">Figure 3</xref>). An open plaza provided a large ambient interaction space circumscribed by built space around the periphery. Structures faced one another across a single plaza, usually aligned with the cardinal directions, and one structure often dominated the others in terms of height, area and volume (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1469605313487820">Figure 4</xref>). In some cases, this larger structure was a burial shrine. Plaza groups sometimes stand alone, though multiple plazas occasionally formed complex larger groupings. Platforms with high, narrow benches dominated building superstructures. Buildings with enclosing masonry walls were common. Frontal patios, outset staircases and high stone-faced structure facades accentuated the monumentality of buildings, including in some domestic settings.

<p>During the Terminal Classic and Early Postclassic (AD 1000–1200), the Lakes Maya changed their architecture. They built compact ceremonial groups at the crests of hilly island or peninsular sites with domestic groups flanking, often being built on terraces constructed on natural hillsides. In place of established Classic period ceremonial building forms, Postclassic sites referenced templates derived from Yucatecan sites such as Mayapán (e.g. Zacpetén) or were focused on low open halls and east-focused and central shrines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1469605313487820">Pugh, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1469605313487820">Schwarz, 2009</xref>). Architecture emphasized less hierarchical designs and less monumentality. More focus was on plaza-level facades and small altars. Postclassic houses generally consist of rectangular masonry substructures 10–60 cm high with unwalled fronts. Rear portions are enclosed by C-shaped, I-shaped or L-shaped benches, often backed by low masonry walls. Rather than extensive plaza groupings, houses featured diminutive plazas with a bench structure and a kitchen or small domestic shrine. Larger houses, inhabited by higher status people, are found on elevated areas and are flanked by smaller houses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1469605313487820">Rice, 1988</xref>: 233–237).</p>
<p>Previously I described the change in Lakes communities as a mosaic pattern resulting from invention within limits, retention of Classic forms and acceptance of new styles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1469605313487820">Schwarz, 2009</xref>), with the pattern varying by site. New and revised building forms became part of the Postclassic architectural canon. In other cases, the Maya actively adapted Classic period architectural practices to new settings or adopted a new Epiclassic International style (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1469605313487820">Ringle et al., 1998</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1469605313487820">Becker (1999)</xref> first studied plaza plan 2 groups at Tikal, but east-structure focused groups are now broadly known across portions of the Maya Lowlands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1469605313487820">Chase and Chase, 1994</xref>). Some east-structure focused groups were created in the Lake Petén Itzá basin at Classic Tayasal and Motul de San José and continued to be modified and used in the Terminal Classic and Postclassic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1469605313487820">Chase, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1469605313487820">Moriarty, 2004</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1469605313487820">Figure 4</xref>). C-shaped bench structures have Classic antecedents in residences at Seibal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1469605313487820">Figure 5A</xref>) and a presentation palace at Dos Pilas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1469605313487820">Figure 5B</xref>) but these styles were transformed in the Terminal Classic, to emerge as open halls and distinctive Postclassic houses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1469605313487820">Schwarz, 2004</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1469605313487820">Figure 5C–E</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1469605313487820">Manahan and Canuto (2009)</xref> note that Early Postclassic residences clustered in linear groups at Copán and builders utilized distinctive T-shaped buildings. Early Postclassic Copán builders also reused Classic period sculptural stones, which were reset within houses so the sculptural elements were visible. Also, Classic stelae and altars were moved and repurposed after the Late Classic. At Zacpetén, Classic stelae and altars were included as structural elements in Postclassic buildings fronting the main ceremonial plaza and clearly were moved from their original contexts as standing monuments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1469605313487820">Pugh, 2001</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1469605313487820">Schwarz (2004)</xref> identified a stela fragment that was utilized as an altar on a bench on the western Quexil Island (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1469605313487820">Figure 5D</xref>).

Increasingly, archaeologists see the Terminal Classic as a period of cultural transformation, and, where Postclassic communities succeeded, their survival and resurgence has been due to and resulted in broad scale changes in society. The author and Masson et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1469605313487820">2006</xref>) agree on this point. However, while Masson et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1469605313487820">2006</xref>) and others (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1469605313487820">Bronson, 2006</xref>) state that social transformations occur during collapse, they present little discussion of the sociology of the posited transformations (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1469605313487820">Chase and Chase, 2006</xref>) and changes in the Lakes region do not approximate template regeneration. Although the Classic template is represented in the retention of some Classic architectural forms (such as east-structure focused groups), the thoroughgoing shifts in settlement patterns and other architectural forms must be regarded, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1469605313487820">Yoffee (2006)</xref> states, as part of a drastic rearrangement of social and ideological systems. Stimulus regeneration, also dealt with by Masson et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1469605313487820">2006</xref>), is more evident at Mayapán, with its connections to Chichén Itzá. Less clear is the extent of external stimulus in the Lakes region, which nonetheless experienced regeneration. Next, I turn to economics and examine obsidian and chert tool procurement strategies.</p>

<sec id="sec4-1469605313487820"><title>Obsidian and chert procurement</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1469605313487820">Rice’s (1984)</xref> survey data for the Lakes region and other Postclassic data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1469605313487820">Masson et al., 2006</xref>) provide a basis for comparison with recent Lakes region excavation data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1469605313487820">Pugh, 2002</xref>–4; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1469605313487820">Rockmore, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1469605313487820">Schwarz, 2004</xref>). In the Lakes region, obsidian was less commonly available during the Early Classic than during the Late Classic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1469605313487820">Rice, 1987</xref>). Obsidian cores were common in both Late Classic rural and center contexts. Thus, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1469605313487820">Rice (1984)</xref> hypothesized that the Maya developed widespread distribution of obsidian throughout all levels of society during the Late Classic. This hypothesis is in contradistinction to models of centralized control of the distribution of obsidian in Late Classic society (see below). While many obsidian sources were used in the Classic period, Lakes region sites are characterized by high levels of El Chayal obsidian, a source located in Highland Guatemala (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1469605313487820">Rice, 1984</xref>).</p>
<p>In the centralized control model, variations of which have been posited by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1469605313487820">Aoyama (2001)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1469605313487820">Braswell and Glascock (2002)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1469605313487820">Hruby (2007)</xref>, larger centers were active in obtaining, controlling and distributing obsidian, although specific modes of distribution vary by model. Aoyama (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1469605313487820">2001</xref>: 355) writes that the state controlled obsidian distribution in Classic period Copán and institutionalized a ‘centralized dispersing mechanism’ for obsidian cores, resulting in differential access. In this view state actors monopolized obsidian procurement, production and distribution, utilizing obsidian as a status marker and distributing it for political advantage to supporters. The result was that many commoners had limited access.</p>
<p>For the Lakes region Postclassic though, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1469605313487820">Rice (1984)</xref> indicates obsidian was even more ubiquitous so the centralized control model is not tenable. During and after the Terminal Classic, the Maya chose to make and utilize chipped-stone arrow points in addition to blades and other bifacial tools common previously. For the Maya, the use of chipped-stone arrow points was an innovation that created enhanced abilities for warfare as well as for hunting in the reforested Petén. Cores were present at certain sites in limited amounts in the Lakes region. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1469605313487820">Rice (1984)</xref> indicates that core reduction followed by transport may have been common as a means of provisioning certain sites with toolstone. It appears Lakes region Maya chose distribution modes that were resistant to centralization. A decentralized system would have involved independent processing followed by transport and consumption developing within heterarchical systems of resource allocation. Exchange of already finished blades or other tools was a possible distribution route (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1469605313487820">Hruby, 2012</xref>). Rural sites still generally had less obsidian than larger centers, although differential access across society was less pronounced than in the Late Classic.</p>
<p>The Maya used chert, which was locally available, in place of obsidian for tools where and when obsidian was unavailable. Or, in certain cases, chert was likely used by choice or for other reasons. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1469605313487820">Rice (1984)</xref> and Masson et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1469605313487820">2006</xref>) compared the prevalence of obsidian versus chert artifacts. Obsidian was actively acquired and was used strategically as a status marker while chert did not function as such. The idea is to measure the availability of obsidian, as a status-linked trade good, versus locally available chert.</p>
<p>The findings of Masson et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1469605313487820">2006</xref>) are instructive of expectations. They compared the percentage of obsidian versus chert tools found in archaeological contexts at urbanized Late Postclassic Mayapán versus rural Postclassic Caye Coco and Laguna de On. They organized the data by interval categories: 0 percent, 0.1–19.9 percent, 20–39.9 percent, 40–69.9 percent, 70–89.9 percent, 90 or more percent. At Mayapán, 25 percent of residential archaeological contexts had no obsidian tools (0%). A total of 26.9 percent of archaeological contexts had 40–69.9 percent obsidian tools, with lesser percentages of residences in the other interval categories (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1469605313487820">Table 1</xref>). This bimodal pattern indicated to Masson et al. social inequality in access to lithic resources from a distant place, as expected for a highly stratified urban population. At Caye Coco and Laguna de On, no residential contexts had less than 20 percent obsidian tools (the balance being chert tools). At 61.3 percent of residential contexts, obsidian tools were 40–69.9 percent of the stone tool assemblages (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1469605313487820">Table 1</xref>). Masson et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1469605313487820">2006</xref>) state that both the everyday reliance on obsidian tools and the locations of Caye Coco and Laguna de On, closer to highland obsidian sources than Mayapán, illustrate the developing interregional trade in obsidian affecting these sites.

<p>However, lack of detailed comparisons of lithic tool procurement at these sites appears to mask diversity and complexity, as Masson et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1469605313487820">2006</xref>: 202) mention but do not address. The Quexil Islands, San Jeronimo II and Zacpetén (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1469605313487820">Figure 1</xref>) in the Lakes region provide a comparable set of sites. The analysis focuses on agency, choice, innovation and strategy as evident in the material record. Obsidian artifacts from these three sites, described below, were sourced via visual sourcing techniques advocated by Braswell et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1469605313487820">2000</xref>: 272). Obsidian analyses were carried out under the supervision of Prudence Rice and utilized a comparative obsidian type collection. Recent X-ray fluorescence analysis of obsidian from Zacpetén indicates broadly the pattern of source acquisitions prevalent at this Lakes region site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1469605313487820">Rice and Cecil, 2009</xref>), as is discussed below.</p>
<p>Lakes region Postclassic Maya abandoned and lost chipped-stone tools and debris in a wide variety of places at their settlements. The recovery loci illustrate the diverse social and economic strategies that Maya agents employed and the choices they made. Recovery contexts of these obsidian and chert artifacts are primarily from domestic structures and their environs in both elite and commoner contexts, illustrating commoners’ access to and role in stone tool production and use. Chipped-stone artifacts come from on-floor deposits within structures, some of which are in situ primary contexts occasioned by rapid abandonment of certain sites. Some tools are secondary refuse found in formal middens and de facto refuse deposits around structures. These deposit types reference a number of acquisition, site maintenance and waste disposal practices, including production, tool maintenance, recycling and tool exhaustion and disposal. A very limited amount of chipped stone from the Quexil Islands and Zacpetén is from ritual assemblages, mostly primary contexts within Postclassic shrines and temples (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1469605313487820">Rice and Cecil, 2009</xref>: 332).</p>
<p>Local Quexil-Petenxil basin communities of practice innovated and the result was a change in procurement and technological choices. At the Quexil Islands, a small Terminal Classic-Postclassic village, 50 percent of contexts sampled (in this case structures) had between 20 and 39 percent obsidian tools (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1469605313487820">Figure 6A</xref>) with the balance being chert (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1469605313487820">Figure 6B–C</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1469605313487820">Table 1</xref>). This is the lowest modal interval of any of the Postclassic sites discussed here. Interestingly, the Quexil Islands, in addition to having obsidian blades, also had large numbers of chert blades (<italic>n</italic> = 411). These blades had similar morphologies as the obsidian blades at the site (<italic>n</italic> = 323), but were more commonly found. Chert blades were rare prior to the Terminal Classic period. Generally these blades were more than twice as long as wide, and had dorsal flake scar(s) running parallel to the straight margins of the blade. Chert blades were usually 4 cm long or longer. Occasionally the makers notched the proximal margin of one or both sides of the blade base. Possibly the Maya chose to haft these tools. Overall, the chert blades were similar to the obsidian blades but exhibited more irregularity in their morphology, particularly flake terminations. The difference relates to knappers’ difficulty in controlling the blade making with heterogeneous chert raw materials rather than the imported obsidian.
<fig id="fig6-1469605313487820" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p>Lithic tools from the Quexil Islands.

</fig></p>
<p>Neither San Jeronimo II nor Zacpetén had as high a proportion of chert blades as the Quexil Islands. Chert blades (<italic>n</italic> = 212) were also found at deposits in Structure 101 at the Late/Terminal Classic Petenxil Group 1, an isolated hamlet in a smaller lake basin adjacent to the Quexil Basin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1469605313487820">Figures 1</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1469605313487820"> 3</xref>). The main occupation of the structure was during the late Hobo phase (AD 700–900) as evidenced by the Terminal Classic Jato Black-on-Gray, fake Fine Gray, and Terminal Classic ash paste sherds found there (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1469605313487820">Schwarz, 2004</xref>: 148). Thus, the Maya chose to rely on chert blades as a major strategy for obtaining lithic tools at Petenxil Group 1 and the Quexil Islands, perhaps due to local shortages of obsidian during the Terminal Classic, when trade routes and access to obsidian may have been disrupted or shifted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1469605313487820">Braswell, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1469605313487820">Rice, 1984</xref>).</p>
<p>The Maya of San Jeronimo II created a specialized lithic workshop in what appears to be a conscious and active effort to make a place for themselves in the emerging Postclassic economy. San Jeronimo II was a rural hamlet on the Lake Petén Itzá shoreline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1469605313487820">Figure 1</xref>). Excavation operations there examined three structure groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1469605313487820">Rockmore, 2006</xref>). Operations 1 and 2 identified high levels of obsidian tools in comparison to the two other Lakes region sites (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1469605313487820">Table 1</xref>). A total of 46.9 percent of contexts (again structures) had 70–89.9 percent obsidian tools, and 33 percent of contexts had 90 percent or more of obsidian tools. Operation 3 uncovered a chert tool workshop in extra-mural space and across adjacent structures. Rockmore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1469605313487820">2006</xref>) identified over 57,000 chert artifacts, although deposits were so dense they could only be sampled. Preforms and reduction debris indicate that large utility bifaces were produced at this workshop. The scale of production clearly was suited for exchange. It is likely that workshop production was an integrated part of the regional economy owing to the ease of access of inhabitants of this site to Postclassic settlements around Lake Petén Itzá via canoe. It is unclear if the obsidian present at the site in other groups (Operations 1 and 2) was acquired via exchange for the chert bifaces, or by some other means, but obsidian tools were certainly highly available.</p>
<p>Elites at Zacpetén sought to control obsidian blade production in what was a monopolization of resource authorization. Five domestic structure groups at the site have quantified obsidian and chert artifacts. Sixty percent of these groups have 40–69.9 percent obsidian tools. The remaining 40 percent have 70–89.9 percent obsidian tools (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1469605313487820">Table 1</xref>). Pugh (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1469605313487820">2002</xref>–4: 363–365) indicates that the majority of obsidian blade cores were in the largest elite residence, which was rapidly abandoned around the Spanish Conquest (AD 1697). Pugh infers that elites at Zacpetén, which was a much more substantial center than the other two sites discussed, chose to exercise control of obsidian production and even engaged in blade production themselves. In this view, Zacpetén elites doled out obsidian blades to lesser status individuals as part of a strategy of maintaining social and political influence. They also used obsidian as a symbol of their higher status.</p>
<p>Petén Lakes Maya embraced innovation in certain blade production and distribution practices. Excavations at the Quexil Islands and San Jeronimo II recovered very few obsidian blade cores. No spatial pattern of obsidian cores and chert cores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1469605313487820">Figure 6D</xref>) of any kind was detectable at these two sites. For these two sites, the lithic patterning suggests the Maya produced blades off-site. Finished blades were then exchanged for other goods, perhaps a strategy or choice by local residents or an expediency of regional procurement practices.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1469605313487820">Hruby (2012)</xref> notes that for late deposits at El Zotz, a Classic center with Terminal Classic and Early Postclassic occupations west of Tikal, pecking and grinding of obsidian blade cores led to more efficient blade production. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1469605313487820">Braswell et al. (2004)</xref> indicated a similar pattern for obsidian from Terminal Classic deposits in Calakmul, Campeche. Also, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1469605313487820">Healan (2009)</xref> states that in Western Mesoamerica, for example at Tula, Mexico, Postclassic blademakers prepared their core platforms by pecking and grinding. In Hruby’s view, the Petén blades passed through many hands before reaching final destinations. Hruby’s limited examination of Petén Lakes material indicated pecking and grinding of obsidian blade cores were common there as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1469605313487820">Hruby et al., 2012</xref>), meaning the Postclassic Lakes Maya embraced this innovation. Presumably, they engaged in down-the-line trade or another distribution mechanism to provide finished blades to settlements such as the Quexil Islands in the Terminal Classic and Early Postclassic.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1469605313487820">Rice (1984)</xref> indicates varying obsidian-chert artifact ratios (including debitage and tools) of between 0.02 and 0.17 with one outlier for the Lakes region (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1469605313487820">Table 2</xref>). Large Classic centers have ratios as high as 1.1–1.2. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1469605313487820">Schwarz’s (2004)</xref> findings from Petenxil Group 1 (a Late/Terminal Classic group) show a low 0.03 obsidian-chert ratio while the Quexil Islands had higher ratios (0.07 for the eastern island and 0.08 for the western island). These findings support the notion that Postclassic Maya acted to make obsidian more available than was prevalent in the Late Classic, even in small communities (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1469605313487820">Table 2</xref>). San Jeronimo II Operations 1 and 2 had ratios of 0.05 and 0.08. The rural Terminal Classic-Postclassic settlements had higher levels of obsidian than the one local Late/Terminal Classic site for which data are available. Late Postclassic-Early Historic Zacpetén, a larger settlement, had 0.19 obsidians per chert, more than double the ratio of the earlier, smaller settlements.

<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1469605313487820">Rice (1984)</xref> states that by the Early Postclassic the majority of obsidian artifacts were derived from the Ixtepeque source. Ixtepeque is another Highland Guatemalan source and it is unclear why the shift in sources occurred. While Lakes region Maya still used El Chayal obsidian, it was no longer the primary imported source for most sites. Certainly, data from the Quexil Islands, San Jeronimo II and Topoxté (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1469605313487820">Braswell, 2000</xref>) are indicative of this pattern. At Zacpetén, recent X-ray fluorescence analysis of obsidian indicates that, of the largely Late Postclassic/Early Historic specimens, there were nearly equal pluralities of both El Chayal and Ixtepeque source materials dominating the assemblage. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1469605313487820">Rice and Cecil (2009)</xref> hypothesize that inhabitants of Zacpetén participated in a differing exchange sphere that emphasized El Chayal to a greater degree than inhabitants of sites in the western Petén Itzá basin, such as the Quexil Islands and San Jeronimo II. Rural Lakes region Postclassic peoples chose to participate in the obsidian trade with other regions, and the complexities of these patterns are just now emerging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1469605313487820">Rice and Cecil, 2009</xref>). However, there is much less evidence of participation in interregional exchange of ceramic vessels. It is not clear why.</p>

<p>This study has summarized evidence, presented elsewhere (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1469605313487820">Schwarz, 2004</xref>, 2009), that the Petén Lakes Maya transformed their settlement patterns, architecture and economy during the Terminal Classic-Postclassic transition, the Maya Collapse, in what were partially active and intentional changes. Archaeologists posited previously that environmental changes (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1469605313487820">Gill, 2001</xref>) or in-migration of outsiders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1469605313487820">Fox, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1469605313487820">Tourtellot, 1988</xref>) were responsible for causing the transformation in Maya society, but in recent years evidence has accumulated of internal continuity in certain regions, e.g. in the Lakes region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1469605313487820">Rice et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1469605313487820">Schwarz, 2009</xref>). In the face of the collapse and abandonment of larger polity capitals, such as Tikal, Seibal and Dos Pilas, the survival of rural Lakes communities begs the question of heterogeneity in the fate of individual communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1469605313487820">Yaeger and Robin, 2004</xref>). Heterogeneity implies that some communities or segments of society took positive actions to survive, transform themselves and adapt to new conditions. This heterogeneity is visible in the larger literature on collapse. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1469605313487820">Bowersock (1988)</xref> demonstrates that villages were better able to reconstitute themselves politically and economically after the collapse of the Roman Empire than cities, which shrunk precipitously. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1469605313487820">Ladurie (1949)</xref> wrote that following the Black Death of the 1300s some French minor elites expanded their land holdings after rapid depopulation of rural areas. They emerged in stronger social positions versus other groups, including other elite groups, some of which had previously dominant positions. For example, some elites, due to their urban residencies, were affected deleteriously by the collapse of society, but the rural minor elites were able to seize opportunities while avoiding the worst effects of the plague and thus gained an increased share of real wealth.</p>
<p>As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1469605313487820">Rice (1984)</xref> indicated, Terminal Classic-Early Postclassic rural communities had greater access to obsidian than did a similar community during the Late Classic. Lithics were an area of active strategizing. Lakes region Postclassic peoples acted in a variety of ways to obtain and create obsidian and chert tools. I identified, earlier, diverse procurement practices evident from the archaeological data. A decentralized system would have involved modified systems of resource allocation from the Classic centralized system. Local communities of practice developed connections with the outside world, made choices and innovated in ways that created greater access to tools in politically tempestuous times.</p>
<p>The overall pattern of greater availability of obsidian, a previously high-status good, and the diversity of procurement strategies fit with emerging models of Postclassic societies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1469605313487820">Rice et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1469605313487820">Schwarz, 2004</xref>, 2009) as heterarchical with a greater degree of hierarchy developing through time. It would have been difficult for re-emergent elites to monopolize or administer tool acquisition by rural commoners, after widespread distribution of obsidian blades developed in the post-collapse period. However, evidence from Late Postclassic/Early Historic Zacpetén indicates that political control and provisioning of obsidian by elites to supporters eventually re-emerged. The phenomenon of greater post-collapse availability of valued materials has parallels in other societies. In her study of the aftermath of the Wari collapse in Nasca, Peru, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1469605313487820">Conlee (2006: 111)</xref> notes that villagers acquired highly valued <italic>Spondylus</italic> shells outside the political hierarchy. During the Wari period, these prestige goods were unavailable to such villages. Apparently, non-elites, who previously lacked full access to status-linked goods, gained and exploited through their own actions the ability to obtain these goods once politically based controls fell away.</p>
<p>A model of social transformation is needed rather than a covering description of template regeneration and stimulus regeneration. Giddens’ structuration theory provides such a model, which I briefly sketch to conclude this article. For Giddens, society mobilizes two kinds of resources, authoritative resources (e.g. the organization of architecture and settlement) and allocative resources (e.g. land, labor and materials). The political collapse of states created openings for changes in how actors utilized these resources, changes which were profound transformations in the structural properties (e.g. institutions) of society (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1469605313487820">Table 3</xref>). Thus, the Maya decreased expressions of hierarchy and monumentality in their architecture and created less ostentatious building facades. This de-hierarchization is a modification of signification, the symbolic order of use of space.

<p>The collapse also created opportunities for communities of practice to actively transform the built environment and their historical referencing and thus recall of the Classic architectural order. The reuse of Classic sculptural stone, stelae and altars, which were adapted for inclusion in Postclassic buildings at Copán and the Petén Lakes region, is such an example. It appears that, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1469605313487820">Hendon (2010)</xref> would suggest, Postclassic communities of practice chose to use these architectural elements to selectively remember and incorporate the prior symbolic order in their transformed buildings.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, I argued that the architectural transformation was partially a conscious choice; the Maya exercised agency, rather than it being the result strictly of immigration of people with differing architectural styles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1469605313487820">Schwarz, 2004</xref>, 2009). However, not all architectural change is intentional or goal-driven, and unintended consequences to actions often occurred (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1469605313487820">Joyce, 2004</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1469605313487820">Giddens (1984)</xref> makes the point that goal-driven actions sometimes set off a cascade of unintended consequences, which may overshadow the effects of the original actions. Thus, when Terminal Classic and Postclassic communities moved to defensible places due to insecurity, they moved to hilly, restricted areas. They necessarily had to crowd structure groups, truncating formerly large structure groups, for example residences, and diminished the sizes of their plazas and buildings. These changes are, in effect, unintended consequences. Insecurity of communities also meant that few hinterland MRUs were present in the Postclassic, another modification of settlement patterns.</p>
<p>The action of building defensible communities alone is a clear indication of rural agency. Here I draw upon notions of group agency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1469605313487820">Earle, 1997</xref>). Once political domination fell away and control of the space of the polity ebbed, people looked to local leadership to guide these sorts of defensive movements and, thus, resettled themselves.</p>
<p>In the Terminal Classic, the Maya transformed their system of resource allocation -- for example, their economy, or how obsidian was distributed and in what quantities rural peoples could obtain obsidian. This transformation is a change in the structural property of the legitimation of arrangements in society, i.e. the political economy of resource acquisition. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1469605313487820">Braswell (2003)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1469605313487820">Hruby (2012)</xref> have ably described mechanisms of trade of obsidian in the Postclassic, and the modes of exchange are debatable, but for this article it is the increased availability of obsidian and diversity of lithic patterning at the Quexil Islands and San Jeronimo II which indicate that a status-linked good was increasingly used by commoners and various strategies enacted to obtain lithic resources. These patterns evidence forms of social mobility or status striving by rural non-elite groups. It may be that this case study is unique in terms of Postclassic lithic procurement patterning and not characteristic of other Maya regions. We do not have enough interregional data to know at this point. Hopefully this study will spur more investigations of changes in lithic procurement during periods of collapse and regeneration.</p>
<p>I have sketched the transformation in the mobilization in both authoritative and allocative resources, which reshaped structures of signification, domination and legitimation. This transformation is much more of a drastic rearrangement of social and ideological systems, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1469605313487820">Yoffee (2006)</xref> states, rather than a template regeneration, which reproduces older arrangements, or a stimulus regeneration which draws wholesale from other state systems or hazy historical memories (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1469605313487820">Masson et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1469605313487820">Bronson, 2006</xref>). The prevalence of the terms template regeneration and stimulus regeneration in this discussion masks the diversity of strategies actors pursued in various segments of society. It is evident that the regeneration literature, with a few exceptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1469605313487820">Chase and Chase, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1469605313487820">Conlee, 2006</xref>), has been making regeneration into a straw man. I argue we should be trying to develop more sophisticated sociological or political models of transformation. Social change during state collapse and regeneration is highly dynamic and grasping it is critical to understanding the succeeding periods of growth. We must draw on a more holistic view of Maya society, or societies generally, in the study of regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1469605313487820">Conlee, 2006</xref>), including rural commoners and minor sites, rather than simply focusing on polity capitals and elites. Instead of using covering terminology for various kinds of regeneration we ought to closely analyze the sociology of these societies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1469605313487820">Chase and Chase, 2006</xref>). Giddens’ structuration theory provides powerful means for looking at human agency in the regeneration of society and eliciting the heterogeneity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1469605313487820">Yaeger and Robin, 2004</xref>) that exists in communities’ differing actions and outcomes. Thus, in conclusion, I would state that the study of post-collapse social organization remains in its infancy, but the focus should be on heterogeneity, rather than strictly on types of regeneration.</p>
