<abstract>
<p>This study investigates the effects of self-construals (independent self and interdependent self) on consumers’ tendency to be assertive or aggressive in their interaction with retail sales representatives. For this, the study employs samples from the United States and Thailand and tests the hypotheses through multigroup confirmatory factor analysis and full structural equation modeling. The results indicate that independent (interdependent) self-construals had positive (negative) effects on consumer assertiveness and aggressiveness. The implications of these results and some avenues for future research are discussed.</p>

<p>Individuals vary in the degree to which they express their rights without infringing upon those of others (assertive behavior) and use verbal or nonverbal noxious stimuli to maintain their rights (aggressive behavior) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022022112466589">Richins &amp; Verhage, 1987</xref>). Assertive and aggressive behaviors are learned and can be taught (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022022112466589">Gripton &amp; Valentich, 1993</xref>), which suggests the importance of social and cultural environments in which individuals have developed interpersonal interaction strategies. Although assertiveness (AS) and aggressiveness (AG) are primarily examined in the Western contexts especially in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022022112466589">Richins &amp; Verhage, 1987</xref>), a number of studies have suggested that the extent to which individuals exhibit these two personality traits can vary across cultures (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022022112466589">Fray &amp; Hector, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022022112466589">Furnham, 1979</xref>). However, these studies appear to focus on the general traits of assertiveness (AS) and aggressiveness (AG) unrelated to consumers.</p>
<p>Although scarce, these constructs have been examined in recent years in consumer complaint behavior studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022022112466589">Hogarth, Hilgert, Kolodinsky, &amp; Lee, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022022112466589">Keng, Richmond, &amp; Han, 1995</xref>). Most studies to date have looked at consequences of consumer assertiveness/aggressiveness. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022022112466589">Keng et al. (1995)</xref> found that assertiveness was a predictor of higher level of complaints. However, virtually no studies have examined causes of consumer assertiveness and aggressiveness. The predominant focus on the outcome is understandable as the outcomes (e.g., complaint behavior) are more visible in retail environment and retailers need to know how to deal with customers with different interaction styles. However, we argue that understanding the antecedents is equally important. We believe that knowing sources and mechanisms through which the sources influence consumers to exhibit different interaction style will help retailers to anticipate customer reactions and interaction styles and thus help to prevent mishaps proactively.</p>
<p>Thus, our research goal is to contribute to the cross-cultural psychology literature by investigating the effects of self-construals on AS-AG. We develop hypotheses and test them by employing samples from Thailand and the United States, which represent a collectivistic culture and an individualistic culture, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022022112466589">Hofstede, 2001</xref>). Thailand has attracted attention from researchers (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022022112466589">Neff, Pisitsungkagarn, &amp; Hsieh, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022022112466589">Polyorat &amp; Alden, 2005</xref>) but to a lesser extent than other Asian collectivistic cultures. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022022112466589">Oyserman, Coon, and Kemmelmeir (2002)</xref> pointed out that the cross-cultural literature is seriously limited because of the disproportionately heavy focus on four East Asian countries: Japan, Korea, PR China, and Hong Kong. Results from Thai consumers would hence broaden self-construal and AS-AG literature in an Asian context.</p>

<title>Conceptual Background and Hypotheses</title>
<sec id="section2-0022022112466589">
<title>Consumer Assertiveness/Aggressiveness</title>
<p>Assertiveness is an interpersonal behavior directed toward the achievement of some desired goal in the face of obstacles in the environment or the opposition from others (Mauger &amp; Atkinson, 1980, as cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022022112466589">Fray &amp; Hector, 1987</xref>). An assertive individual expresses his or her feelings and behaviors directly and honestly while respecting others. Such behaviors are relevant in several consumption contexts, including seeking information, initiating requests, and expressing dissatisfaction. An assertive consumer is more likely to (a) stand up for his or her consumer rights; (b) initiate and refuse requests; (c) initiate, maintain, and terminate conversations; and (d) express justified anger and annoyance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022022112466589">Richins, 1983</xref>). Aggressiveness reflects a behavior originating from hostile or negative attitudes and feelings toward others in the form of attacks or power exertion (Mauger &amp; Atkinson, 1980, as cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022022112466589">Fray &amp; Hector, 1987</xref>). Aggressive individuals do not recognize the potential consequences of their actions and assume no responsibility for them. In addition, they are likely to exercise excessive power by expressing opinions in a hostile or threatening manner. In a retail context, aggressive consumers may use abusive language toward salespeople or cause a stir to attract other customers’ attention. In short, consumer assertiveness (CAS) serves to maintain one’s rights without infringing upon those of others, whereas consumer aggressiveness (CAG) involves the use of coercive power such as threats or punishments to gain compliance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022022112466589">Richins, 1983</xref>).</p>

<title>Effects of Self-Construals on Consumer Assertiveness and Aggressiveness</title>
<p>The individualism-collectivism (INDCOL) national cultural dimension is often operationalized through independent versus interdependent self-construal at the individual level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022022112466589">Singelis, 1994</xref>) because an individual’s self is central to his or her perception and has been found to be closely related to cultural norms and values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022022112466589">Singelis &amp; Brown, 1995</xref>). An <italic>independent self-construal</italic> (IND) is defined as the bounded, unitary, and stable self that is separate from social context, whereas an <italic>interdependent self-construal</italic> (INT) is defined as the flexible and variable self that emphasizes relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022022112466589">Singelis, 1994</xref>). Individuals with a dominant IND are socialized to express themselves as being “true to themselves.” One can achieve this directness by firmly expressing one’s feeling, opinions, or rights (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022022112466589">Markus &amp; Kitayama, 1991</xref>). By contrast, individuals with a dominant INT tend to act in an appropriate manner to fit in the social setting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022022112466589">Markus &amp; Kitayama, 1991</xref>). For these individuals, norms are more important than their own attitudes in guiding their behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0022022112466589">Triandis, 1996</xref>). In addition, interdependent individuals are more likely to use indirect communication than open and precise communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022022112466589">Gudykunst et al., 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>One’s face is fundamentally one’s social-self and is associated with one’s respect, honor, and status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0022022112466589">Ting-Toomey &amp; Kurogi, 1998</xref>). Therefore, losing his or her face is a critical issue for a collectivist (i.e., an individual with an INT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022022112466589">Hofstede, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022022112466589">Polyorat &amp; Alden, 2005</xref>) but not for an individualist (i.e., an individual with an IND). As individuals with an IND are relatively less concerned about others, they are more likely to exhibit assertiveness and aggressiveness without worrying about others’ face. The previous research findings on face are generally consistent with those from other streams of research. First, conflict management literature (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022022112466589">Oetzel, 1998</xref>) indicates that IND is associated with dominating and direct confrontational conflict management styles, whereas INT is associated with avoiding, obliging, and compromising styles. In addition, previous complaint literature suggests that customers from an individualistic culture are more likely to complain to the service provider or a third party than those from a collectivistic culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022022112466589">Huang, Huang, &amp; Wu, 1996</xref>). Because complaining is suggested to be related to AS-AG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022022112466589">Huppertz, 2003</xref>), similar patterns are also expected for CAS and CAG. In this regard, we propose the following hypotheses:</p>
<list id="list1-0022022112466589" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 1</italic>: Independent self-construal will positively influence (a) consumer assertiveness and (b) consumer aggressiveness.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 2</italic>: Interdependent self-construal will negatively influence (a) consumer assertiveness and (b) consumer aggressiveness.</p></list-item>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section5-0022022112466589">
<title>Samples and the Procedure</title>
<p>We collected data from 87 undergraduate students taking business classes at a U.S. university in the Midwest and 136 undergraduates taking business classes at a Thai university in the Northeast. Four foreign nationals in the U.S. data were excluded from the analysis, making the effective sample size 219 (United States = 83, Thailand = 136). The average age of U.S. participants was 21.6 (ranged from 20 to 32), whereas that of Thai participants was 19.4 (18 to 22). In addition, 66% (20%) of U.S. (Thai) participants were male.</p>
<p>All U.S. participants received original versions of the scales in English, whereas Thai participants received Thai versions, which were translated from English to Thai using back-translation procedure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022022112466589">Brislin, 1980</xref>). We prepared these Thai versions to fit the context of Thai consumers. Furthermore, we prepared two versions in each language to counterbalance the order of scales. Thus, both U.S. and Thai participants received one of the two booklets and completed the survey during regular class hours as part of the course requirement. The participants provided some demographic information toward the end of the questionnaire.</p>

<title>Measure Assessment</title>
<sec id="section7-0022022112466589">
<title>Measures</title>
<p>All multi-item metric variables were measured with 7-point Likert-type scales, ranging from <italic>strongly disagree</italic> (1) to <italic>strongly agree</italic> (7) and were assessed for psychometric properties in each country data as detailed in the next section. Self-construal was measured with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022022112466589">Leung and Kim’s (1997)</xref> scale, which taps into two dimensions—IND (15 items) and INT (14 items). CAS was measured with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022022112466589">Richins’s (1983)</xref> scale, which is composed of the following three dimensions: (1) “resisting requests for compliance” (five items), (2) “requesting information or assistance” (five items), and (3) “seeking redress” (five items). Finally, CAG was measured with six items from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022022112466589">Richins (1983)</xref>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0022022112466589">
<title>Assessment procedure</title>
<p>We examined the validity of the measures by taking a two-step approach. We first assessed the measurement models for each sample with LISREL confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and evaluated their adequacy by considering overall fit, convergent validity, discriminant validity, and reliability separately for each sample. We then conducted a multigroup CFA to assess measurement invariance.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0022022112466589">
<title>Validity and reliability</title>
<p>Because <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022022112466589">Richins (1983)</xref> determined sufficient discriminant validity between the three dimensions of the CAS scale, we assessed the multidimensional scale by conducting a CFA for each sample through an <italic>a priori</italic> three-factor model. However, this model resulted in a poor fit and demonstrated questionable factor loading patterns as well as low reliability. Thus, we refined the measure to obtain a unidimensional scale for each sample by excluding the items with low factor loadings, separately for each country data. With the retained items representing the CAS construct, we conducted a CFA with all the items including the ones for the remaining constructs (IND, INT, and CAG) in an <italic>a priori</italic> four-factor model to assess the measurement model for each sample. To check for the unidimensionality of each measure, we examined factor loadings, χ<sup>2</sup>, various fit indices, and reliability. We excluded a few more items to improve the model fit for each sample. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0022022112466589">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0022022112466589">Table 2</xref> show the final scale items retained, standardized factor loadings, model fit statistics, and internal reliability.</p>

<p>The fit indices indicate that the model fit the data reasonably for both samples. The standardized factor loadings for all items in each construct were significant (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .01), providing evidence for convergent validity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022022112466589">Anderson &amp; Gerbing, 1988</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0022022112466589">Table 2</xref>, all composite reliability coefficients exceeded .60, the recommended minimum threshold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022022112466589">Bagozzi &amp; Yi, 1988</xref>) for both samples. We assessed the discriminant validity of the measures in three ways. First, we constructed a 95% confidence interval for the correlation of each pair of latent variable. None of the confidence intervals included 1.0 or -1.0 for both samples, providing support for discriminant validity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022022112466589">Anderson &amp; Gerbing, 1988</xref>). Second, we used <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022022112466589">Fornell and Larcker’s (1981)</xref> criterion, which requires the average variance extracted (AVE) for a pair of constructs to be greater than the squared factor correlation between the two constructs (φ<sup>2</sup>). With one exception (INT and CAS only for the U.S. sample), all AVE estimates exceeded the squared interconstruct correlations (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0022022112466589">Table 2</xref>). Third, we used chi-square difference tests by comparing a restricted model in which a factor correlation was fixed at 1 with the original unrestricted model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022022112466589">Anderson &amp; Gerbing, 1988</xref>). All the restricted models had substantially poor model fits, resulting in significant chi-square difference statistics. Thus, the discrimination between the constructs was determined to be sufficient.</p>

<title>Cross-cultural measurement invariance tests</title>
<p>Any assessment of the associations between independent and dependent measures across national samples requires the metric invariance and the factor variance invariance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0022022112466589">Steenkamp &amp; Baumgartner, 1998</xref>). We conducted measurement invariance tests per <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0022022112466589">Steenkamp and Baumgartner (1998)</xref> by gradually adding equivalence constraints systematically in a series of multigroup CFA.</p>
<p>We first assessed the configural invariance of the four measures using the multigroup CFA. The resulting model provided a good fit, χ<sup>2</sup>(258) = 370.79, <italic>p</italic> = .00, χ<sup>2</sup>/<italic>df</italic> = 1.44, RMSEA = .06, CAIC = 867.98, CFI = .91, IFI = .91. Thus, similar factorial structure of the constructs across countries was achieved, and it served as the baseline model for testing increasingly restrictive invariance hypotheses. Second, we assessed metric invariance by constraining factor loadings to be the same across the two samples, χ<sup>2</sup>(272) = 389.97, <italic>p</italic> = .00, χ<sup>2</sup>/<italic>df</italic> = 1.43, RMSEA = .06, CAIC = 799.03, CFI = .91, IFI = .91. The chi-square difference test showed that the fit of the metric invariance model was not significantly different from that of the configural invariance model, Δχ<sup>2</sup>(14) = 19.18, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .10, attesting to the same factor loadings across the two samples. Next, we assessed factor variance/covariance invariance by imposing an additional constraint where factor variances and covariances are the same across the samples on the metric invariance model, χ<sup>2</sup>(282) = 418, <italic>p</italic> = .00, χ<sup>2</sup>/<italic>df</italic> = 1.44, RMSEA = .06, CAIC = 762.34, CFI = .89, IFI = .89. Although the chi-square difference was significant, Δχ<sup>2</sup>(10) = 28.65, <italic>p</italic> = .0014, this model has more or less the same model fit indices (e.g., similar RMSEA, improved CAIC, deteriorated CFI and IFI) as those of metric invariance model, suggesting evidence of factor variance/covariance invariance. Thus, we concluded that the four measures in this study have demonstrated a sufficient degree of cross-cultural invariance. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0022022112466589">Table 2</xref> shows the correlations between the constructs and AVE/reliability values, which were obtained from metric-invariant factor loadings from the multigroup CFA.</p>

<title>Analysis and Results</title>
<p>Before testing Hypothesis 1 and Hypothesis 2, it was necessary to assess if the two sample data can be pooled together to run a single SEM across countries. Thus, we used multigroup CFA analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022022112466589">Jöreskog &amp; Sörbom, 1996</xref>) to test if covariance matrices of the observed variables were equal for the U.S. and Thai samples. Because equality of covariance matrices was not obtained, we subsequently ran SEM separately for each sample. We used LISREL 8.8 to assess the full structural equation modeling, within which we assessed the measurement model and the structural equation model simultaneously. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0022022112466589">Table 3</xref> shows results of the SEM analysis for Hypothesis 1 and Hypothesis 2.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The results from Thailand and the United States indicate that independent self-construal positively affects both consumer assertiveness and aggressiveness, whereas interdependent self-construal negatively affects them at the individual level, regardless of the dominant cultures in which the participants grew up. To the authors’ best knowledge, this is the first study that examines the effects of self-construal on consumers’ adoption of interpersonal strategies when dealing with sales representatives. Therefore, the study provides a better understanding of how CAS and CAG are shaped. The result of our study implies that the self-construals, individual-level cultural values, may be more important than one’s membership in a culture in allowing us to predict a consumer’s adoption of different retail interaction styles.</p>
<p>Our study results can be applied to other cross-cultural retail settings involving CAS/CAG. It would be interesting to examine the effects of cultural values on consumers’ responses in the context of sales representatives’ selling strategies such as foot-in-the-door and door-in-the-face techniques (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022022112466589">Cialdini, 1993</xref>) and the scarcity strategy (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022022112466589">Jung &amp; Kellaris, 2004</xref>). In addition, the present study can be extended to examine the relationships between dysfunctional consumer behaviors (e.g., damaging property and littering) in retail settings and consumers’ ethical judgments and intentions for such behaviors.</p>
<p>This study has some potential limitations. Our study tests the hypotheses in only two countries as proxies for individualism-collectivism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022022112466589">Hofstede, 2001</xref>), but future studies could replicate the study with a greater number of countries or a different set of countries as proxies. In addition, we considered somewhat homogeneous samples. Although this approach helped us match demographics of the two samples, the lack of representativeness of the sample in each country may weaken the generalizability of the findings to the population. Finally, the CAS measure used in our study is rather limited. Out of three dimensions proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022022112466589">Richins (1983)</xref>, only four items measuring “seeking redress” was retained due to a lack of discriminant validity and low reliability with a three-dimensional scale. Thus, future research should assess the validity of the multidimensionality of the consumer assertiveness scale in multiple countries.</p>
<p>Despite these limitations, our study findings are encouraging and suggest some interesting avenues for future research. First, given the results obtained at the individual level in the present study, one would logically expect that consumers in a individualistic country (i.e., the United States) would show greater tendency to be assertive and aggressive in retail interactions compared with their counterparts in a collectivistic country (i.e., Thailand). However, this conjecture was not supported in our current study. Future studies might replicate our study using different samples of countries to investigate the impact of INDCOL as well as self-construals on consumers’ retail interaction styles. Second, future research can investigate the potential role of self-construals as mediators in the impact of national culture (INDCOL) on consumers’ tendency to adopt different retail interaction styles. By doing so, future research might be able to successfully unpackage the impact of national culture on consumers’ retail interaction strategies and could reveal that consumers’ self-construals at the individual level are responsible for such cross-national differences in consumers’ retail interaction styles. Such an approach would respond to the call for unpackage the culture (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022022112466589">Fischer, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022022112466589">Matsumoto &amp; Yoo, 2006</xref>). Third, the effects of self-construals on assertiveness and aggressiveness could operate differently depending on whether the setting is private or public. Thus, future research should examine if there might be a stronger norm in a collectivistic culture to show less AS and AG in public (vs. private) settings. Finally, future research should consider a wider range of methods (cf., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022022112466589">Kim &amp; Markus, 1999</xref>) including experiments to provide a better understanding of causal relationships.</p>
