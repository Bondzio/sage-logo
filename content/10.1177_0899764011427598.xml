<abstract>
<p>There is a growing interest in applying the psychological contract concept to the relationship between volunteers and nonprofit organizations. However, previous studies overlook certain elements of volunteers’ psychological contracts as they build on theory established with reference to paid employees. We argue that the inclusion of a value-based psychological contract type, next to transactional and relational types, enables a more thorough understanding of perceived mutual obligations between volunteers and nonprofit organizations. We use the critical incidents technique to map volunteers’ perceived (un)fulfilled obligations and find that volunteers perceive both fulfilled and unfulfilled value-based obligations. Moreover, we describe specific terms related to the mission and values of the organization reported by volunteers. We conclude that future psychological contract research needs to take this value-based dimension into account, especially in volunteerism.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The past decades, the psychological contract (PC)—defined as “an individual’s beliefs regarding the terms and conditions of a reciprocal exchange agreement between that focal person and another party” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0899764011427598">Rousseau, 1989</xref>, p. 123)—demonstrated its capacity to explain paid employees’ attitudes and behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0899764011427598">Zhao, Wayne, Glibkowski, &amp; Bravo, 2007</xref>). Consequently, interest in applying this concept to volunteers is growing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0899764011427598">Farmer &amp; Fedor, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0899764011427598">Liao-Troth, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0899764011427598">Nichols &amp; Ojala, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0899764011427598">Taylor, Darcy, Hoye, &amp; Cuskelly, 2006</xref>). Thinking in terms of PCs could be valuable for nonprofit organization (NPO) managers as it is especially relevant in situations characterized by uncertainty and ambiguity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0899764011427598">Rousseau, 2001</xref>), such as volunteering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0899764011427598">Cnaan &amp; Cascio, 1998</xref>). However, empirical studies on volunteers’ PCs often adopt conceptualizations for paid employees and tend to overlook the role of values. The focus of this article is to demonstrate that the inclusion of a value-based dimension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0899764011427598">Thompson &amp; Bunderson, 2003</xref>) to the PC is warranted. We demonstrate this in two ways: (a) by showing that volunteers perceive mutual obligations relating to the mission, cause, principles, and values of the organization and (b) by showing that volunteers experience both breach and fulfillment of their value-based PC.</p>
<p>Our study contributes to the PC and volunteerism literature in several ways. First, we apply the PC to volunteers—defined as people (a) performing activities out of free will, (b) without remuneration, (c) in a formal organization, and (d) benefiting others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0899764011427598">Cnaan, Handy, &amp; Wadsworth, 1996</xref>)—and thus fit into a research stream that applies and adapts for-profit theories to the nonprofit sector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0899764011427598">Nichols &amp; Ojala, 2009</xref>). Second, we introduce a value-based dimension<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0899764011427598">1</xref></sup> to better capture the content of volunteers’ PCs. This dimension—describing perceived mutual obligations relating to the values, principles, or mission of the organization—was first proposed by Thompson and Bunderson in 2003, but received little attention to date (exceptions are as follows: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0899764011427598">Hyde, Harris, Boaden, &amp; Cortvriend, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0899764011427598">O’Donohue, Donohue, &amp; Grimmer, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0899764011427598">O’Donohue &amp; Nelson, 2007</xref>). Nonetheless, investigating this PC type appears important as its breach can give rise to intense emotional reactions and organizational dissent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0899764011427598">Thompson &amp; Bunderson, 2003</xref>). Finally, in contrast to previous PC content studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0899764011427598">Rousseau, 1990</xref>) we elicit obligations from volunteers rather than letting them rate predefined obligations. We use the critical incidents technique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0899764011427598">Flanagan, 1954</xref>) to collect examples of PC breach and fulfillment from the volunteers’ perspective, allowing us to capture the subjective nature of the PC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0899764011427598">Herriot, Manning, &amp; Kidd, 1997</xref>). Thus, we are able to provide a thorough overview of mutual obligations volunteers perceive as being breached or fulfilled. NPO managers’ awareness of these mutual obligations is critical for effective volunteer engagement and retention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0899764011427598">Nichols &amp; Ojala, 2009</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0899764011427598">
<title>The PC</title>
<p>The PC is an idiosyncratic concept—people construe both their own and the organization’s obligations—and concerns obligations, not expectations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0899764011427598">Rousseau, 1995</xref>). Expectations cannot be considered part of the PC unless they result from a (implicit) promise. When these perceived obligations remain unfulfilled, PC breach occurs which, in turn, evokes certain emotions—such as anger or frustration—termed <italic>PC violation</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0899764011427598">Morrison &amp; Robinson, 1997</xref>). This process of breach and violation plays a major role in PC theory as it influences individual’s attitudes and behavior. For instance, PC breach has been related to decreased job satisfaction, commitment, and performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0899764011427598">Zhao et al., 2007</xref>). Hence, it is important to understand which obligations employees or volunteers report as being breached or fulfilled.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0899764011427598">Rousseau (1989</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0899764011427598">1990</xref>) distinguished transactional from relational PCs. Transactional PCs focus on the exchange of economic currency, within a closed-ended time frame. The terms—the specific inducements that are promised—exchanged by both parties are specific and clearly verifiable by third parties. For example, a volunteer might expect to receive reimbursements for expenses made, in return for fulfilling basic role requirements. Relational PCs focus on the exchange of socioemotional currency within an open-ended time frame. The terms exchanged by both parties are loosely specified and rather subjective. For example, a volunteer might expect to become well-integrated within the group, in return for helping out covolunteers with their tasks.</p>
<p>This typology was extended in 2003 by Thompson and Bunderson with a value-based PC type, defined as “credible commitments to pursue a valued cause or principle (not limited to self-interest) that are implicitly exchanged at the nexus of the individual-organization relationship” (p. 574). Hence, value-based PCs focus on the exchange of ideological currency. Thompson and Bunderson explain that this PC type can be interpreted as volunteers perceiving obligations to contribute to help increase the NPO’s capacity to pursue its cause, in return for the NPO supporting the cause or principles, hence lending its volunteers legitimate claim to participate in the cause. Value-based PCs share some similarities with relational PCs as they both pertain to deeply held personal values and beliefs. But they also share some resemblance with transactional PCs as they both clearly define what constitutes a breach and what does not. However, they differ from other PC types in that the target of the perceived obligations need not be the volunteer personally, but instead might be the beneficiaries of the organization. Hence, value-based PC breach can occur without the volunteer being personally mistreated, for instance, if the volunteer perceives that the NPO fails to uphold its obligation to provide a support program within a certain neighborhood.</p>
<p>Originally, scholars viewed transactional and relational PCs as a bipolar continuum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0899764011427598">Rousseau, 1989</xref>). Current views, however, consider them as separate dimensions that are not mutually exclusive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0899764011427598">Mclean Parks, Kidder &amp; Gallagher, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0899764011427598">Millward &amp; Brewerton, 2000</xref>). A recent article by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0899764011427598">Isaksson, De Cuyper, Oettel, and De Witte (2010)</xref> considers the PC as a layered model, with all PCs containing a core of transactional exchanges and some containing an added layer with relational exchanges. From this perspective, the value-based PC might be considered a third layer, which should be prominent with employees and volunteers working in for- or nonprofit organizations with a strong emphasis on a mission, principles, or values. Hence, we believe this third PC type is especially relevant in the nonprofit sector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0899764011427598">De Cooman, De Gieter, Pepermans, &amp; Jegers, 2011</xref>).</p>

<title>The PC Applied to Volunteers</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0899764011427598">Farmer and Fedor (1999)</xref> were among the first to suggest that the PC could be applied to unpaid work, as people volunteer to fulfill certain motives and, hence, hold certain expectations of the volunteering activities. However, volunteers’ and paid employees’ expectations likely differ as the nature and management of both types of work vary substantially (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0899764011427598">Cullinane &amp; Dundon, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0899764011427598">Farmer &amp; Fedor, 1999</xref>). Several PC conceptualizations have since been used to investigate volunteers’ expectations. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0899764011427598">Liao-Troth’s (2001)</xref> study borrowed a conceptualization for paid employees which distinguished transactional from relational PCs on the one hand and four categories of specific promises (i.e., benefits, good faith and fair dealings, intrinsic job characteristics, working conditions) on the other hand. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0899764011427598">Taylor et al. (2006)</xref> also categorized PC terms reported by administrators and volunteers using these categories. They found that both groups’ expectations diverged and that administrators were often unaware of volunteers’ expectations, increasing chances of PC breach. Adopting a grounded approach, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0899764011427598">Ralston, Downward, and Lumsdon (2004)</xref> established that volunteers expected adequate management, clear and correct communication, appreciation and practical support. The most recent study on volunteers’ PCs by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0899764011427598">Nichols and Ojala (2009)</xref> distinguished organization obligations—fair treatment, interesting and meaningful work, responsibility, providing challenges, healthy work, resources to do the job and skill development—from volunteer obligations—reliability, enthusiasm, commitment, good relations, and empathy with the public, common sense, local knowledge, and finally, general and specific experience. Altogether, these studies provide some insights into the specific expectations volunteers consider part of the PC.</p>
<p>However, we believe that the aforementioned studies have limitations warranting the need for more research. First, several of these studies emphasized expectations (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0899764011427598">Farmer &amp; Fedor, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0899764011427598">Nichols &amp; Ojala, 2009</xref>) instead of obligations and, thus, might have examined a different concept. Second, a number of studies imposed existing categories—for instance, stemming from research on paid employees—to volunteers’ responses (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0899764011427598">Liao-Troth, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0899764011427598">Taylor et al., 2006</xref>). However, it is not established yet whether these categories can be applied as such to volunteers and whether they adequately capture the entire range of volunteers’ perceived obligations. Finally, none of the aforementioned studies included a value-based PC type, although several authors recommended this for future research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0899764011427598">Liao-Troth, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0899764011427598">Taylor et al., 2006</xref>) and neither did they investigate PC types and terms in view of breach and fulfillment.</p>

<sec id="section4-0899764011427598">
<title>Developing Hypotheses</title>
<p>Our first hypothesis concerns the specific terms reported by volunteers in instances of PC breach and fulfillment: we expect to find terms related to the value-based PC type, next to previously documented terms. Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0899764011427598">Thompson and Bunderson’s (2003)</xref> definition of the value-based PC, these terms should describe obligations pertaining to (a) contributing to a valued social cause, mission, or principle and (b) demonstrating a credible commitment to this cause, mission, or principle. They provide examples of value-based volunteer obligations, such as “taking initiative to serve the needs of a particular constituent, acting as a public advocate for the espoused cause, or sacrificing non-work time to contribute to the organization’s ideological mission” and of value-based organization obligations, including “contributions of money or resources to the cause, public advocacy or lobbying for the cause, and internal practices and policies that direct employee attention and time to participation in ideological objectives” (p. 574).</p>
<list id="list1-0899764011427598" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 1</italic>: Volunteers perceive obligations related to (a) contributing to and (b) demonstrating a credible commitment to a valued social cause, mission, or principle.</p></list-item></list>
<p>Our second and third hypotheses concern the PC type—transactional, relational, or value-based—that volunteers report. To date, little is known about the prominence of specific types in volunteers’ PCs, especially in view of breach and fulfillment. In case of PC fulfillment, people are more likely to report incidents that are salient to them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0899764011427598">Herriot et al., 1997</xref>), for instance because the perceived obligation is deemed personally important. Research indicates that volunteers are mainly attracted by the values of the organization, gaining new knowledge, or individual growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0899764011427598">Clary &amp; Snyder, 1999</xref>). This relates well to value-based and relational obligations. We therefore suggest volunteers will find these two PC types more salient and will cite them more frequently. This is consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0899764011427598">Farmer and Fedor’s (1999)</xref> claim that volunteers’ PCs are more likely to be relational than transactional.</p>
<list id="list2-0899764011427598" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 2</italic>: Volunteers will report more incidents of PC fulfillment of a relational or value-based type, than of a transactional type.</p></list-item></list>
<p>Turning to PC breach, we need to take both salience and vigilance—the degree to which the volunteer monitors the fulfillment of obligations—into account (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0899764011427598">Morrison &amp; Robinson, 1997</xref>). People vigilantly monitor transactional obligations, because these are clearly defined and build on strict norms of reciprocity. Moreover, people with a transactional PC will likely have a lower threshold for perceiving breach. In contrast, the increased cost of discovering unmet value-based obligations—because of the associated threat to the ego—means that people will be less vigilant to detect value-based PC breach. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0899764011427598">Thompson and Bunderson (2003)</xref> also suggest that value-based PCs are relatively resistant to minor instances of breach, because the mere pursuit of a cause is intrinsically rewarding and people will not risk jeopardizing the long-term attainment of this cause. In sum, we propose that transactional PC breaches will be frequently reported, although they are less salient, because of the high vigilance by which they are monitored; relational PC breaches will be frequently reported because of their salience; and, value-based PC breaches will be less frequently reported because of decreased vigilance, although they are salient to the volunteer.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section6-0899764011427598">
<title>Sample</title>
<p>We performed in-depth interviews with 25 volunteers from two similar Belgian NPOs (<italic>N</italic><sub>1</sub> = 14, <italic>N</italic><sub>2</sub> = 11). We chose these organizations based on three criteria to yield a rich data set: (a) large, well-established NPOs, active on a national level; (b) with a large number of active volunteers; and (c) a well-implemented volunteer-management policy. The organizations’ staffs helped us contact interview candidates, thus ensuring that all interviewees fitted our volunteer definition, and enabling us to apply a purposeful sampling technique to gather data from volunteers performing various tasks. After 25 interviews, new themes or categories stopped emerging and data saturation was reached (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0899764011427598">Marshall, 1996</xref>). It should be noted that the nature of the critical incidents technique implies that the incidents—as opposed to the interviewees—become the unit of analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0899764011427598">Butterfield, Borgen, Amundson, &amp; Maglio, 2005</xref>). Consequently, our effective sample size entailed 175 critical incidents or an average of seven incidents per interviewee.</p>
<p>Participants were relatively young (<italic>M</italic> = 31.12, <italic>SD</italic> = 9.97) and well educated (highest attained degrees: [higher than] master degree: 48%, bachelor degree: 24%, secondary school or lower: 28%). We interviewed 16 women and 9 men, with an average volunteering tenure of 5.43 years (<italic>SD</italic> = 2.71). Key informants from both organizations confirmed that our sample characteristics reflected those in their organizations. Moreover, the high educational level of our sample is in line with that of other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0899764011427598">Leete, 2006</xref>). However, the gender distribution in our sample does diverge from that in the volunteering population. Nonetheless, we believe this did not seriously influence the content of the incidents reported. Respondents’ age (<italic>U</italic> = 53, <italic>N</italic><sub>1</sub> = 14, <italic>N</italic><sub>2</sub> = 11, <italic>ns.</italic>), education (<italic>U</italic> = 74, <italic>N</italic><sub>1</sub> = 14, <italic>N</italic><sub>2</sub> = 11, <italic>ns.</italic>), gender (<italic>U</italic> = 45, <italic>N</italic><sub>1</sub> = 14, <italic>N</italic><sub>2</sub> = 11, <italic>ns.</italic>), and tenure (<italic>U</italic> = 51.5, <italic>N</italic>
<sub>1</sub> = 14, <italic>N</italic><sub>2</sub> = 11, <italic>ns.</italic>) did not differ between the two participating organizations.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0899764011427598">
<title>Organization Context</title>
<p>Two large Belgian NPOs, each with more than 1,000 active volunteers, participated in this study. Both organizations operate in the youth and education domains: organizing social activities to promote a multicultural society. They both are Belgian subsidiaries of worldwide organizations, but operate autonomously on a national level. The first organization provides services to children and adolescents, whereas the second organization tends to adolescents only. Many clients from both organizations move on to become active volunteers in their respective organizations once they reach a certain age. Although both organizations rely almost entirely on volunteers, they also employ paid employees in staff functions. These staff members are involved in administration, support, and management. Hence both organizations possess a well-established volunteer-management program as opposed to more informal procedures typically found in small grass-root NPOs. Finally, both organizations hold strong missions and values, increasing our chances of volunteers reporting value-based obligations.</p>

<sec id="section8-0899764011427598">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>Our study employed the critical incidents technique which registers significant positive and negative events from interviewees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0899764011427598">Gremler, 2004</xref>). We elicited incidents by asking interviewees for examples of situations in which a perceived obligation was either fulfilled or breached. Like <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0899764011427598">Herriot et al. (1997)</xref>, we assume that more frequently cited PC terms or types are more salient to or vigilantly monitored by respondents. We used eight questions, to elicit critical incidents from respondents (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0899764011427598">Figure 1</xref>), afterwards allowing us to separate examples of breach from fulfillment and volunteer from organization obligations. Moreover, asking respondents to provide examples of obligations during early and present voluntary activities increased the variation in their responses. We encouraged respondents to provide detailed information on each incident, to increase the accuracy and quality of reported incidents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0899764011427598">Butterfield et al., 2005</xref>). Critical incidents were embedded in a semistructured interview, providing a richer context for subsequent interpretation.</p>

<p>Interviews were conducted by the first author and took an hour on average. Each interviewee was guaranteed anonymity and confidentiality, and received a debriefing explaining the research goals. Next, the authors content analyzed all collected critical incidents, using a deductive approach (Elo &amp; Kyngäs, 2007). We constructed categories for PC types—transactional, relational, or value based—and terms based on the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0899764011427598">Herriot et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0899764011427598">Ralston et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0899764011427598">Rousseau, 1989</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0899764011427598">1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0899764011427598">Taylor et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0899764011427598">Thompson &amp; Bunderson, 2003</xref>). Because the terms exchanged in the PC can differ depending on the side of the relationship—volunteer obligations versus organizational obligations—we created distinct terms for each. If new categories emerged during this coding process or incidents could not be assigned to existing categories, we created additional categories. Hence, our analysis consititutes a mixture of deductive and inductive approaches<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0899764011427598">2</xref></sup> (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0899764011427598">Bies, 2010</xref>). This ultimately led to the creation and definition of 12 categories for terms in organization obligations (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0899764011427598">Table 1</xref>), seven categories for terms in volunteer obligations (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0899764011427598">Table 2</xref>), and three PC type categories (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0899764011427598">Table 3</xref>).</p>

</table-wrap-foot>

<p>Finally, two independent judges assigned each critical incident to one of the previously constructed categories for PC types and terms. Because types and terms are not dependent constructs—although some terms can be “prototypical” for a certain PC type, others might overlap with multiple PC types and hence fall under different PC types depending on the context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0899764011427598">Arnold, 1996</xref>)—we did not treat terms as a subdimension of PC type but rather asked judges to assign PC types and terms independently for each critical incident. If multiple PC types or terms emerged in a single critical incident, we asked judges to indicate the most prominent type or term. Judges could use additional information from respondents’ semistructured interviews to make an informed decision regarding the prominence of PC types and terms. Utilizing independent judges allowed us to establish measures of reliability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0899764011427598">Butterfield et al., 2005</xref>)—that is, Cohen’s Kappa—and increased the objectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0899764011427598">Gremler, 2004</xref>). Analyses suggested that two judges combined with 175 critical incidents provided enough power to detect Cohen’s Kappa scores that were statistically better than categorization by chance. Both judges attained moderate interrater agreement on terms in organization obligations (κ = .59), terms in volunteer obligations (κ = .60) and PC types (κ = .55). Next, the judges discussed disagreements until consensus was reached. Incidents on which no consensus could be reached regarding the assigned PC term (<italic>N</italic> = 4) or type (<italic>N</italic> = 2) were discarded from further analyses.</p>

<title>Terms in Organization Obligations</title>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0899764011427598">Table 1</xref> presents an overview of the terms in organization obligations, along with some exemplary quotes. We discerned no statistical differences between respondents from both organizations regarding the distribution of these terms (χ<sup>2</sup> = 11.22, <italic>df</italic> = 11, <italic>ns.</italic>) so we consider all terms together. Interviewees indicated they valued the ability to work autonomously. Receiving <italic>autonomy</italic> motivated them and enhanced their creativity whereas they interpreted deficient autonomy as a lack of respect. They also expected tangible <italic>benefits</italic> and perceived these incentives, such as a training weekend paid for by the organization, as rewarding. Moreover, they expected to receive certain reimbursements. Issues arose when the distribution of reimbursements was perceived as unfair or untimely. Next, they felt it was important the organization <italic>communicated</italic> with them on relevant matters. In most cases, communication-related breaches were caused by miscommunication between local volunteers and the central staff. Often, the organization failed to communicate with all parties (volunteers, members, beneficiaries) involved in day-to-day activities or interviewees felt the organization’s communication lacked professionalism, which made them feel unappreciated. Only one incident concerned the organization’s obligation to make a <italic>contribution</italic> to the NPO’s mission and values, yet several incidents related to <italic>credibility</italic>. Regarding the latter, interviewees in nearly all cases perceived that the organization emphasized different goals, such as financial results and administrative processes. This perception was strengthened by the professionalization of the organization’s paid staff who were perceived to hold different views regarding the values and mission of the organization. Hence, these credibility-related breaches seem to be caused by “perceived goal displacement” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0899764011427598">Thompson &amp; Bunderson, 2003</xref>). <italic>Humanity</italic>-related breaches arose when the organization was inconsiderate of the specific aspirations and needs of volunteers and beneficiaries. Some interviewees also stated they did not have an <italic>input</italic> in organizational policies, and complained their feedback was overlooked. <italic>Fairness</italic>-related breaches were mainly caused by local differences in organizing activities or by the perception that the same volunteers always had to do the bulk of all the work.</p>
<p>Interviewees cited <italic>friendship</italic> as an organization obligation, expecting the NPO to provide opportunities for social interaction. Even so, the high quality of these relationships—due to the volunteers’ common interests and experiences—often surprised them. Interviewees also expected <italic>recognition</italic> for their voluntary work from various actors: immediate supervisors, peers, but also beneficiaries. Both organizations held annual events to thank volunteers, which were perceived as rewarding, but interviewees also derived recognition by seeing their impact on beneficiaries and covolunteers. Problems arose when the provision of recognition was perceived as unfair: for instance, when the organization inconsistently distributed gifts. Interviewees felt their organization had to <italic>support</italic> them to perform their volunteering tasks adequately. Support could be provided in several ways, ranging from material to individual, psychological support. Interviewees cited support-related breaches due to a lack of organizational interest for local issues: organizational representatives either did not notice or ignored these issues. Another often-heard complaint referred to inadequate support to handle administrative tasks and insufficient guidance with the introduction of new programs. Finally, interviewees expected two types of <italic>training</italic>: induction training for new members and specific workshops for experienced volunteers. Training-related breach mostly originated from insufficient follow-up afterwards or a mismatch between the provided training and the volunteers’ needs. However, training was frequently mentioned as rewarding, providing volunteers with an opportunity for personal growth.</p>

<sec id="section11-0899764011427598">
<title>Terms in Volunteer Obligations</title>
<p>Once again, we discerned no statistical differences regarding the distribution of volunteer obligation terms (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0899764011427598">Table 2</xref>) between respondents from both organizations (χ<sup>2</sup> = .76, <italic>df</italic> = 6, <italic>ns.</italic>). Interviewees felt obligated to <italic>advance</italic> in the organization—horizontally and vertically—or to show willingness to advance in the future. Breach occurred when volunteers refused to take up new functions or when they reluctantly took up functions above their skill levels or ambitions. Not surprisingly, interviewees reported pressure from their organization to increasingly take up new responsibilities, but they expected their organization to respect their decisions. Interviewees also wanted to see their <italic>contribution</italic> to the organization’s mission, often through direct contact with the beneficiaries. Many exerted additional effort to achieve the NPO’s mission, for instance by investing extra time and private resources, even if this was not called for by the organization. In contrast, if interviewees had been unable to contribute—even for reasons beyond their own control—they felt guilty and intended to compensate this with future efforts. Some also mentioned an obligation to demonstrate a credible commitment to the organization’s mission and values, for instance by promoting their organization in their personal environment (<italic>credibility</italic>).</p>
<p>Interviewees indicated they performed additional tasks, out of free will, to improve organizational practices or to help other volunteers (<italic>extra-role behavior</italic>). Although the organization did not expect these tasks from them at the outset, they were quickly perceived as an integral part of the volunteers’ general role requirements. Nonetheless, several volunteers decided to discontinue this additional effort after a while, because of the increased workload. Interviewees also felt obligated to put in a minimum amount of time and effort (<italic>hours</italic>). For many, merely showing up for an activity counted as fulfilling an obligation toward their organization, yet they considered it important to live up to their promises and arrive on time. Problems occurred when activities conflicted with other personal engagements, which often led to quitting one organization or reducing activities. Interviewees felt it was important the organization respected their decision in this. Interviewees also felt obligated to take initiative and to improve organizational practices (<italic>initiative</italic>). Often this coincided with taking up new roles, wanting to improve on their predecessors. Finally, interviewees felt they had to fulfill their general task requirements (<italic>work</italic>). When asked for an example of a fulfilled obligation, many stated they had “just done a good job” and that their first and foremost obligation was to do their work. However, some also mentioned they deliberately avoided or neglected certain tasks, because the tasks were dull or because they lacked knowledge or experience.</p>

<sec id="section12-0899764011427598">
<title>PC Type</title>
<p>Our second and third hypotheses concern the PC-type frequencies in case of breach and fulfillment (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0899764011427598">Table 3</xref>). We found no statistical disparity (χ<sup>2</sup> = 2.58, <italic>df</italic> = 2, <italic>ns.</italic>) between respondents from both organizations regarding the PC-type distributions. Respondents cited 82 examples of fulfilled obligations, either by themselves (<italic>N</italic> = 41) or by the organization (<italic>N</italic> = 41). The chi-square test indicates that the distribution of fulfilled obligations over the three PC types was not uniform (χ<sup>2</sup> = 36.17, <italic>df</italic> = 2, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). The residuals show that respondents mostly cited fulfillment incidents of a relational nature, but significantly less incidents of a transactional or value-based nature. We can thus only partially confirm Hypothesis 2, as only the amount of relational obligations was as hypothesized. Respondents cited 91 examples of breached obligations, either by themselves (<italic>N</italic> = 38) or by the organization (<italic>N</italic> = 53). The chi-square test indicates that the distribution of breached obligations over the three PC types was not uniform (χ<sup>2</sup> = 15.12, <italic>df</italic> = 2, p &lt; .001). The residuals show that respondents cited more breach incidents of a relational or transactional nature, than of a value-based nature. Hence, we can confirm Hypothesis 3.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0899764011427598" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>With this study, we aimed to provide an overview of the obligations volunteers perceive as being breached or fulfilled within their PC, including value-based obligations. Volunteers’ cited specific terms related to the value-based PC. They perceived that their NPO had to demonstrate a credible commitment to an espoused cause, and in return they had to make a valuable contribution to this cause. Examples of value-based volunteer obligations emerging from our data were as follows: advocate the NPO’s espoused cause in public, contribute to the NPO’s mission (and seeing the impact on the beneficiaries), and taking initiative to enhance the NPO’s ability of attaining its mission. Examples of value-based organization obligations contained: making sure that all stakeholders—volunteers, staff, board members—are aligned with regard to the NPO’s cause, enable volunteers to contribute to this mission instead of requiring them to do tasks that are unrelated to this mission (e.g., administrative tasks), and create enthusiasm for this cause. Hence, our first hypothesis was confirmed. In general, the terms found in our study are in line with previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0899764011427598">Nichols &amp; Ojala, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0899764011427598">Ralston et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0899764011427598">Taylor et al., 2006</xref>), except that we add the aforementioned value-based terms as well as a term describing a volunteer’s perceived obligation to (be willing) to advance in the organization. The latter thus differs from previously documented terms such as “career development” which describe a perceived obligation on behalf of the organization to provide an internal career trajectory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0899764011427598">Rousseau, 1990</xref>). This term might be unique to volunteering because of its discretionary nature and the need for dedicated volunteers by the NPO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0899764011427598">Cnaan &amp; Cascio, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>Interviewees mostly mentioned incidents of a relational nature when describing fulfilled organization and volunteer obligations, providing partial support for Hypothesis 2. Based on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0899764011427598">Morrison and Robinson (1997)</xref>, we argued that relational and value-based obligations would be more salient to volunteers than transactional obligations, and would therefore be more frequently cited, which was not entirely supported by our data. However, this does not automatically imply that value-based obligations are not salient to volunteers. These obligations might be more difficult to fulfill because they are less concrete and lack a well-defined time frame. For example, the perception that an organization is obligated to help reduce diseases in third-world countries is difficult to meet in a short time frame and will require continuing efforts. This reasoning is further supported by additional interview data, as nearly all volunteers found the values and mission of their organization important, suggesting that value-based obligations were salient. Finally, the high prevalence of relational fulfilled obligations signals that volunteers find a mutually supportive relationship, based on trust and respect, important, which is in line with previous research on volunteers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0899764011427598">Farmer &amp; Fedor, 1999</xref>) and nonprofit employees’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0899764011427598">Hyde et al., 2009</xref>) expectations.</p>
<p>In cases of organization and volunteer PC breach, respondents mostly cited incidents of a transactional and relational nature, thus supporting Hypothesis 3. The low prevalence of value-based obligations is congruent with our reasoning that individuals are less vigilant when monitoring for value-based PC breach as this could harm their self-image (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0899764011427598">Morrison &amp; Robinson, 1997</xref>) and that value-based PCs are more resistant to minor breach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0899764011427598">Thompson &amp; Bunderson, 2003</xref>). The high prevalence of transactional obligations suggests that volunteers vigilantly monitor these obligations, as they are based on a quid-pro-quo relationship and are easy to monitor. The high prevalence of relational obligations might be because of its high salience. Our analyses, however, do not take the ascribed importance or consequences of transactional, relational and value-based obligations into account. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0899764011427598">Thompson and Bunderson (2003)</xref> mention, value-based obligations might trigger certain “moral hot-buttons” and can create intense reactions. Hence, although we registered less value-based breaches than transactional and relational breaches, the consequences of one value-based breach might outweigh those of several transactional or relational breaches. Alternatively, our findings might be influenced by the motives people have for volunteering, as they shape the formation of the PC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0899764011427598">Rousseau, 1995</xref>). Another explanation for the low prevalence of reported value-based breaches might lie in volunteers leaving the organization after a grave breach.</p>
<p>Finally, our findings illustrate that the volunteering context creates some unique characteristics. First, it is remarkable that many respondents attributed administrative workload and a division between local volunteers and central staff as a cause of PC breach. Second, the examples of volunteer obligations cited by respondents clearly illustrate the lack of control NPO managers have over volunteers and the resulting issues of reliability in service provision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0899764011427598">Nichols &amp; Ojala, 2009</xref>). Although respondents felt obligated to advance the organization’s mission, they also felt entitled to freely decide when, where and how they dedicate time to the NPO. The value-based component of volunteers’ PCs might therefore be crucial for increasing volunteers’ commitment and involvement.</p>
<sec id="section14-0899764011427598">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>Our study has certain strengths and limitations. First, the critical-incident technique is a retrospective method and may be confounded by certain biases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0899764011427598">Gremler, 2004</xref>). Interviewees can have problems remembering incidents or might reinterpret them, while they can also be misinterpreted by the interviewer. We attempted to counter this by embedding the critical incidents in a semistructured interview and by using independent raters. There might also be a bias in the elicited incidents, as respondents might be more prone to recall extreme examples of breach or fulfillment, which are more salient or vigilantly monitored (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0899764011427598">Morrison &amp; Robinson, 1997</xref>). Hence, examples of small (or even moderate) breach or fulfillment might be underrepresented in our data. Nonetheless, we believe the use of the critical incidents technique in this study was warranted as implicit obligations might otherwise be hard to capture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0899764011427598">Herriot et al., 1997</xref>). Second, our results might be influenced by sample characteristics. We chose respondents from two similar organizations and it is likely that organizational practices in other nonprofit industries create different expectations. A unique aspect shared by both organizations was that most volunteers first acted as beneficiaries in their organization: an experience that likely influenced their perceptions of mutual obligations. We therefore recommend follow-up studies to take these organizational characteristics into account. Moreover, interviewees could decide freely to participate, meaning that self-selection bias might have influenced our results. For instance, it is possible that volunteers experiencing severe PC breach were less inclined to participate whereas those who had experienced the gravest breaches might have left the NPO and were thus left out of our sample. Although these people are hard to contact, future research would greatly benefit from investigating their PC perceptions using exit interviews.</p>

<title>Implications</title>
<p>Our results suggest several implications for both research and practice. First, we demonstrated that value-based obligations form a part of volunteers’ PCs. However, much needs to be discovered about the consequences of value-based PC breach and fulfillment. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0899764011427598">Thompson and Bunderson (2003)</xref> argue that people might react differently to value-based PC breach—for instance, extreme emotional reactions or whistle blowing—because these obligations pertain to deeply held values and the self-image. Therefore, we recommend future studies to investigate the process and outcomes of value-based PC breach and fulfillment. Second, NPO managers need to be aware of the value-based obligations that volunteers might perceive. Our findings indicate that volunteers perceive mutual obligations pertaining to the NPO’s mission, cause, principles, and values but that these need not be directed to the volunteers themselves. For example, if a volunteer perceives that the NPO is obligated to help reduce illiteracy in the world yet this NPO suddenly decides to stop the provision of free tuition in a certain area, then the volunteer might not be mistreated personally yet he or she may perceive a value-based breach. Hence, it is important to signal the NPO’s commitment to its espoused cause through all its policies and practices.</p>

<p>The three PC type categories were based entirely on theory, whereas the volunteer and organization obligations terms were a mix of deductive–inductive approaches. We therefore only report frequencies in our analyses of PC type categories, to avoid circular production of evidence.</p>
