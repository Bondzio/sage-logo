<sec id="sec1-1471301211432782"><title>The Long Hello: The Other Side of Alzheimer’s Cathie Borrie. Nightwing Press, 2010, 293 pp. ISBN 978-0-9813786-0-2</title>
<p>If you’ve met one person with Alzheimer’s disease, you’ve met one person with Alzheimer’s disease. The same is true for care partners. Alzheimer’s enters into the lives of people who have lived in a relationship with each other long before any thought of disease or supreme vulnerability was nascent. And yet, it does enter into these long-term relationships and how we respond to it is the story of now, of then, and of now and then in the lives of individual people who have lived their own stories. No set of circumstances is the same from family to family, but the example of one family can serve us all in the best of ways.</p>
<p>Cathie Borrie’s book, <italic>The Long Hello: The Other Side of Alzheimer’s</italic>, is a beautifully written, deeply personal, blatantly honest homage to the shining truth that there is no avoiding the sorrow of loss when a loved one, especially a parent, is no longer the person who can take care of us, heal our pain, and provide us with a safe harbor from the storms of life. Far more importantly, however, the book is a brilliant example of how we can find the best parts of our humanity and provide deep love and compassion and sustain the dignity of all concerned at the same time.</p>
<p>In reading the book, we travel back and forth between past and present and learn of the complex, loving relationships in the author’s family and how they evolved from the time she was a girl. Thus, we are given insights into the ongoing stories into which Alzheimer’s (and Parkinson’s) was ultimately written. Over the course of time, we can hear the cadence of Jo Borrie’s (the author’s mother) spoken words, learn of her discerning intelligence, her sense of adventure, her determination to make a life for herself and her daughter in the wake of profound losses, the compromises she made in the process, and we learn how Alzheimer’s did not erase the essence of that exceptional woman. And we learn also how Alzheimer’s bent, but did not break, the loving daughter who was her mother’s care partner for seven years, who said, ‘Hello’ to her mother and to Alzheimer’s, rather than viewing the entire experience as what some have sadly and short-sightedly termed ‘the long goodbye’.</p>
<p>The narrative reveals plainly the courage of mother and daughter and how an adult child can remain deeply devoted and lovingly supportive through her tears, engaging her mother beautifully in deeply important ways, including tapping into her mother’s wisdom about life by asking her mother questions about fundamentally important human issues. This involved putting her mother in a senior position as someone who has something to teach. In addition, Borrie shows, with great acceptance combined with great anguish, that she is able to accept her mother’s reality even though that reality is clear perhaps only to her mother. We cannot understand the depth either of the love or devotion or anguish, however, without understanding the family crucible in which so much is lived throughout the years, and Borrie does an overwhelmingly outstanding job of introducing us to the lives she and her mother and brother and father and stepfather lived together and apart.</p>
<p>Alzheimer’s is one thing to a biochemist or pharmacologist, but it is quite another to a person who experiences it directly and his or her care partners. In <italic>The Long Hello</italic>, Cathie Borrie paints a picture into which each of us travels. As we go through the looking glass, as it were, and journey through her story, we find ourselves deeply, beautifully, moved and incalculably richer and grateful for the experience.</p>
