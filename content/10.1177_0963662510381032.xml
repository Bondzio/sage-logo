<p>This article examines justice in the context of a controversial industrial waste facility siting in a Hakka (a minority ethnic group) town in Taiwan. It provides analysis of local perceptions of disproportionate risk, community knowledge claims, and the challenges of citizens to the controversial environmental impact assessment process. It explores knowledge disputes among regulators, developers, and local activists; it considers the struggle of local actors for recognition and inclusion in decision-making; and it argues for the development of institutional procedures that promote dialogue among stakeholders in order to avoid the preemption of debate, the control of the frame by the government and experts, and the centralization of power.</p>

<title>1. Introduction</title>
<p>On 19 August 2004, hundreds of residents from Hengshan, a Hakka town in Hsinchu County, Taiwan, protested a proposed facility that would generate industrial waste and incinerator ash in their hometown. Among the Hakka activists were several spirit-mediums. They performed their rituals so that the <italic>Yimin</italic>, the spirits of Hakka warriors, who sacrificed their lives during battles against bandits during the Qing Dynasty, will guard over the town. Folk religion has often constituted and reflected local resistance to a dominant hegemony (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0963662510381032">Gates and Weller, 1987</xref>). Were the mediums channeling warriors to fight a contemporary form of banditry? What are the challenges of local knowledge to the assessment of the government and experts that the mediums so dramatically enacted? What relevance might these voices and this case have for justice, particularly environmental justice, in Taiwan?</p>
<p>Environmental justice is a term that covers a wide range of issues, and entails many elements that are not always associated with justice as equality.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0963662510381032">1</xref></sup> Efforts have been made to extend analysis of justice to issues of identity and recognition of difference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0963662510381032">Schlosberg, 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0963662510381032">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0963662510381032">Ishiyama, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0963662510381032">Peña, 2003</xref>), the relationship between humanity and nature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0963662510381032">Di Chiro, 1995</xref>), democratic procedures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0963662510381032">Hunold and Young, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0963662510381032">Schlosberg, 2003</xref>), and sustainable development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0963662510381032">Agyeman and Evans, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0963662510381032">2006</xref>). Through the remainder of this paper, we use the term justice to denote this expanded conception because ultimately justice can and should entail these concerns.</p>
<p>Research has shown how community-generated information and local knowledge can improve scientific inquiry and contribute to sustainable environmental decision-making (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0963662510381032">Van der Ploeg, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0963662510381032">Corburn, 2005</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0963662510381032">Hunold and Young (1998)</xref> applied <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0963662510381032">Young’s (1983</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0963662510381032">1990)</xref> theoretical framework to argue that democratic decision-making and participation in the political process are crucial issues of fairness in siting hazardous industrial facilities. They have suggested that justice requires a participatory communicative democratic process for hazardous waste sitings. First, it is <italic>prima facie</italic> unjust to impose environmental hazards on citizens who did not participate in the decision-making process. Second, a democratic communication process in facility siting is likely to yield the most just outcomes when structured according to specific norms of discussion and inclusion of heterogeneous positions. Democratic processes and public participation tend to respect the interests and autonomy of those affected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0963662510381032">Schlosberg, 2004</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0963662510381032">2</xref></sup> Since the conception of justice has universal application and since it cannot be trumped by appeal to cultural particularism without the concealment or creation of <italic>injustice</italic>, it is important to explore the practical experience of communities, especially the voices, knowledge claims, and perspectives of those involved in activism on behalf of people and places.</p>
<p>Despite a long period of colonial (1895–1945) and one party (1945–1987) rule, the notion of justice is not an unfamiliar concept to many people in Taiwan. There is an emergent connection between environmental concerns and social justice in the campaign against environmental degradation. After sketching the research and the context of siting disputes over industrial waste and incinerator ash in Hengshan town, this paper explores risk concerns in the local context, community knowledge claims, and local challenges to a problematic environmental impact assessment report. It provides discussion of knowledge disputes among the regulators, developers, and local activists and the struggle by locals for democratic participation in the decision-making process. It argues for the recognition of local contextual knowledge and the development of institutional procedures to establish justice.</p>

<title>2. The setting and the research</title>
<p>Hsinchu County lies in northwest Taiwan. Hengshan town has a population of around 15,000. Most residents are Hakka, while there are small numbers of indigenous people. The ancestors of the Hakka emigrated from Guangdong Province; they comprise about 15% of the population of Taiwan. In the 18th and 19th centuries, there were numerous armed conflicts between the Hakka and Holos people (the main Han ethnic group in Taiwan) for economic and political reasons. As latecomers to places initially occupied by locals, the Hakka usually had to struggle to survive on less desirable lands in the mountainous areas. Hakka are well-known for their perseverance even in the most adverse environments, and they are also known to be very adamant in defending their cultural heritage. The Hakka, however, took no stand in the early process of political struggles for democracy and pan-Taiwan ethnic identity. In the late 1980s, they asked political parties to enhance the Hakka’s social and political recognition; they demanded an increased Hakka language program in the public media and schools. The Hakka Rights Movement successfully led to the establishment of the Cabinet-level Council of the Hakka Affairs in 2001 to aid the Hakka people and to promote Hakka heritage.</p>
<p>The population is dominated by the older generation, as most of the young people tend to seek greater material rewards available in the big cities. Hengshan is rich in limestone and lumber. The plants of the Asia Cement Corporation and the Taiwan Cement Corporation have played an important role in local development. When martial law ended in 1987 and Taiwan transformed into a democratically governed country, the local residents started to make public their complaints about air pollution. Those who lived near the plants complained that the roofs of their houses, crops, and plants were all covered by the dust from the cement plants. To remedy this, both corporations installed pollution-control equipment to minimize air pollution. A tourism farm has become a new industry of the county in recent years. The local residents have exerted efforts in Hakka culture preservation and promotion and hope that its tourism resources can bring new opportunities to the district.</p>
<p>The government has regarded incinerators as the main way to deal with household trash since the 1980s. Originally the Environmental Protection Administration planned to build 36 incinerators by 2003 to handle 90 percent of Taiwan’s domestic waste. However, the success of garbage recycling and sorting plans has reduced waste volumes to the extent that even if nine of the incinerators were canceled, there might still not be enough waste to keep the remaining 27 operating economically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0963662510381032"><italic>Taipei Times</italic>, 2004</xref>). Environmentalists and residents have argued that there are too many incinerators.</p>
<p>Considering that incinerator ash continues to pile up at sites across Taiwan, the ministry-level <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0963662510381032">Environmental Protection Administration (2005)</xref> has introduced the BOO (Build-Operate-Own) program in 2001. This program encourages local governments and the private sector to cooperate in matters of industrial waste disposal, while the Environmental Protection Administration will provide grants to private companies that are successful in bidding for the development of waste disposal facilities. The Hsinchu County Government has perceived the BOO scheme as a way to deal with incinerator ash sites in the county, and it has invited bids without consulting local residents. Most of the local residents did not know anything about the development project until it had passed the official Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) process in April 2003 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0963662510381032"><italic>China Times</italic>, 2004</xref>). Taipei County and other county governments also have perceived the BOO scheme as a way to deal with incinerator ash, but they have faced local opposition.</p>
<p>This research is based on documentary analysis and on in-depth interviews of Hengshan local residents in January 2006. The 18 interviewees were selected from local residents of different generations and occupations (e.g., housewives, farmers, tourist industry workers, shop owners, professionals involved in administration and the tourist industry). These interviewees reflect the typical economic activities and social structure of the town. The interviewees were asked what kinds of effects they think the waste facility has had; why they think in the ways that they do; whether they have joined the campaign against waste facility siting and for what reasons. These interviews are supplemented by focus group discussions. Two focus groups were composed of five to seven local activists. A snowball method was used to ask local activists to invite members of self-help organizations to attend the groups. Each meeting was held in the venue where each group normally met at a time of the groups’ convenience. With one assistant responsible for recording and taking notes, the groups were all moderated by the researcher. In each focus group, every participant was encouraged to express their own experiences, generate questions, and talk to each other. Discussions centered on their understanding of the impacts of the waste facility; why they have come to their conclusions; who should have decision-making authority; the role of the public in decision-making; and their conceptions of justice. These interviewees and focus groups provided rich information about the views, experiences, feelings, and the interactions of local actors. Their perceptions of and discourses of resistance to the industrial waste facility are analyzed and compared. Discourse analysis is used to elucidate the different frames that shape the construction and debate of policies and their impacts (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0963662510381032">Hajer, 1995</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section3-0963662510381032">
<title>3. Local perceptions of disproportionate risk</title>
<p>The proposed site is located near the Yakan and Fusin villages in Hengshan. What concerns the residents the most is the potential negative impacts of industrial waste facilities on their hometowns. In the beginning, residents did not know exactly what the term incinerator ash meant and what impacts the facilities would have on their community. Several residents heard the news that people in a small town of Taipei County experienced similar facility siting problems and strongly protested against the project of siting industrial waste in their town, claiming that it contained toxic ash. They realized that incinerator ash may contain dioxin which is dangerous to human health (local activist, W).</p>
<p>Media coverage has provoked public concern. The Public Television Service has reported on the campaign in Hengshan and on the siting dispute in the Ankeng area of Sindian, Taipei County. The Public Television Service made a film called “Is this Place Safe?” in the “Our Island” program. The image of the Ankeng area is formed in the film as a place that is harmonious with nature. The concept of environmental justice and sense of place is formed in the film as a basis for the presentation of local land (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0963662510381032">Wang and Liaw, 2006</xref>). Media coverage has played an important role in keeping the public informed and influential.</p>
<p>Understandings and knowledge of risk have close relationships with cultural worldviews and everyday experience. Concerns about risk are likely to reflect established ways of viewing the world in which one lives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0963662510381032">Irwin, 2001</xref>: 110). Local awareness of the impacts of the waste facility might be connected in some way with their particular historical and social experience. Local residents worry that the facilities will cause air and water pollution, specifically rancid smells, noise, and dust. It is not a long distance from the facility site to the nearest household. People are concerned that typhoons, landslides, and earthquakes might damage the facilities, cause leaks, and affect groundwater. The proposed site is near the source of the Fongsan River. Local activists worry that it will have a negative impact on the residents downriver. For those who make a living from farming, it would be an ecological disaster should an accident happen. They also express their concern about its impact on future generations. As one resident said, “I don’t want my grandson to say that it is because my grandfather did not make efforts to prevent the environment from becoming polluted” (local resident, K). Moreover, some residents expressed their concerns about the negative impacts on the price of land and property, the tourist industry, and their businesses. One resident said, “Several friends and I have planned to run a Bed and Breakfast, but I worry that no tourists will dare to live in our village if hazardous waste facilities are here” (local resident, W). They do not think that the waste facilities will bring significant benefits, though both the government and private contractors have claimed that the project will bring the local residents job opportunities and huge amounts of compensation.</p>
<p>Local activists cite several environmental pollution episodes in the past as examples to express their doubt about the development of the project. The Shengli Incident in July 2000 is one of the most notorious cases. As one of Taiwan’s largest waste handlers, the Shengli Chemical Company was caught in the practice of dumping in and severely polluting the Kaoping River, and the incident left the people of the Kaohsiung without water for two days. This discovery shocked many constituents throughout Taiwan; more so because Shengli was ISO 14,001 (environmental management systems requirements) certified. The Environmental Protection Administration immediately revoked Shengli’s license. The failure in waste monitoring has affected public confidence towards the government. Local activists express their anxiety that toxic waste from the Hsinchu Science-based Industrial Park might be shipped along with industrial waste and incinerator ash to the site in their hometown. There has been mention of other incidents which have involved polluted fish farms that have led to cancer. One local activist said: “We do not want to be the next [victims].” Another echoed, “Take the newly built chemical factory in the neighborhood for example; it seems to burn plastics and we can smell it every day. We report this to the authority every day, but it is in vain. When the officials come, the factory stops burning. I do not think the government could do the monitoring well.” Their distrust in authority is significant:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>In the beginning, they [the company] tell us the details of how they will deal with the ash and the standard procedures. But I guess that they will not really follow these steps once their operation starts. It must be very difficult to separate the toxic ash and non-toxic ash. I am sure that they will do it recklessly. (Local resident, K)</p></disp-quote>

<title>4. Lack of recognition of community knowledge</title>
<p>Lay judgments about risks and technological hazards reveal a sensitivity to social and political values that experts do not acknowledge. In particular, the risks to the locals are totally involuntary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0963662510381032">Fiorino, 1990</xref>: 227; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0963662510381032">Slovic, 1999</xref>: 42–43). Current discussions on environmental controversies tend to affirm the so-called public ignorance or public irrationality model, which assumes that greater scientific understanding among the lay public will bring greater public acceptance and support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0963662510381032">Irwin, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>Researchers, however, have argued that various forms of citizen expertise, which challenge scientific institutions, are essential in addressing matters of environmental threats and sustainability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0963662510381032">Irwin, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0963662510381032">Wynne, 1996</xref>). Simply put, local people may have access to knowledge about environmental quality and causes of environmental problems. Lay people should be counted as experts about their neighborhoods, and they should be able to contribute to knowledge during a process of public policy construction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0963662510381032">Yearley, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Regulation and risk management are dominated by technocracy in Taiwan. Although the Environmental Impact Assessment Law was approved in 1994 to regulate any developmental projects and to standardize the criteria, the lay public does not have much opportunity to participate in the process. The law imposes that the developmental organization must hold a public meeting when its developmental project has passed the EIA process. In fact, the public meeting in Hengshan was intended merely to make the project public rather than consult with the populace. Local environmental activists criticized the system and claimed that they were not aware of the project until the project had already passed the EIA process.</p>
<p>Commissioned by the private development company, the EIA report faced severe local criticism. The ecological survey was carried out by one scholar in mid-December 2002 and mid-January 2003. According to the EIA report, there were no fish in the river and no rare or endangered species near the proposed site. The EIA report claimed that the project would not bring any significant negative impact on the fauna. On the other hand, local activists claim that there are many defective or inaccurate statements in the EIA report, which makes them doubt the motives of its writers. They argued that there is a rich diversity of creatures and plants in the nearby areas, but those were not mentioned in the EIA report. For them, the report is biased, because the data were collected only during the winter and dry seasons. They were also concerned that during the rainy season (spring and summer), heavy rains and typhoons might cause landslides which may further cause leaks and affect the groundwater and soil. They believe that the facility would bring water and air pollution and that people will be forced to leave their homes. But this was not considered a problem in the EIA report. Local activists worried about the seepage of buried waste into the nearby waterworks, but the possible impact on the waterworks was not mentioned in the EIA report.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0963662510381032">Grundmann (2007</xref>: 416) argues that “it is the governments that decide which policy to develop and which knowledge to use for its legitimation.” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0963662510381032">Yearley (1995</xref>: 468–469) argues that universal safety standards or safety procedures may actually be insensitive to local conditions and legitimate unjust outcomes. He provides the example of sheep farmers in Cumbria, northwest England; their land was contaminated by radioactive fallout from the 1986 Chernobyl accident (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0963662510381032">Wynne, 1996</xref>). Although the farmers received the scientific reassurances that the polluting cesium would quickly pass from the food chain, official scientists still measured high levels of contamination years after these predictions, and the farmers were still unable to sell their stock. Similarly, the value of local knowledge and experience of local residents has not been recognized in Hengshan:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>M1: The government tends to think that the experts are always right and what they [the experts] say is the truth. Ecological surveys should be done over a long period of time. The report was done hastily; it failed to consider the welfare of the local creatures and plants. It is written that there is a bamboo forest there, but I have never found bamboo in the town. It [the report] has a lot of mistakes. [The expert] put the boot on the wrong leg.</p>
<p>F1: Departmental egoism is significant in the Environmental Agency and officials trust their own surveys and experts rather than the information that local people offer. (Local activist group 1)</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Local activism has emerged from concern for ecological devastation and justice. The lack of reflection on the impact of human conduct on nature is at the heart of the domination. Critiques of the EIA report show the problem of non-recognition of nature, and activists began to make efforts to speak for nature.</p>
<p>The concerns of local activists about the negative impact on the local community and the interconnected relationship with the local creatures and plants tended to correspond to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0963662510381032">Visvanathan’s (2005)</xref> idea of “cognitive justice” that recognizes “the plurality of knowledge systems.” It also recognizes the “relation between knowledge and livelihood and lifestyle” (p. 92). He emphasizes that the movements should seek “a plural vision that allowed for both the wisdom of normal science and the vision of the eccentric, the dissenter, the marginal, the vulnerable and alternative world-views.” For <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0963662510381032">Leach and Scoones (2005)</xref>, the demand of many civil movements is “for the right for different forms of knowledge and their associated practices and ways of being to coexist, and carry weight in the decisions that affect people’s lives” (p. 36). The notion of cognitive justice corresponds to the conception of recognition of difference as an element of environmental justice, articulated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0963662510381032">Schlosberg (2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0963662510381032">2004)</xref>. For advocates of environmental justice, justice involves a matter of cultural survival when people see their identities and communities devalued and recognition denied them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0963662510381032">Schlosberg, 2003</xref>: 90). Local activists make a direct connection between the defense of their communities and the demands for the recognition of local knowledge, experiences, and ways of life.</p>
<p>The Environmental Impact Assessment Review Committee is comprised of local government officials and experts. The lay public was excluded from the process. The committee never went to the proposed waste facilities site to evaluate the potential impact. Local activists argued that the role of the Environmental Impact Assessment Review Committee was a rubber stamp. As one activist said:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>The technocracy is still reluctant to share political power. You can see the composition of the Environmental Impact Assessment Committee in recent days. They do not want someone to bar the way if they want it to pass the [EIA] procedure. I feel that they will conventionally select and nominate those who will endorse it. (Local resident, L)</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Demands for recognition and autonomy are common to communities of indigenous peoples or ethnic minorities. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0963662510381032">Taylor (2000</xref>: 534) argues, “the environmental discourses of people of color are framed around concepts like autonomy, self-determination, access to resources, fairness and justice, and civil and human rights.” She insists that autonomy is a major component of justice, and she recognizes the need to “respect the cultures of all people, honoring cultural diversity, and appreciating a variety of belief systems that relate to the natural world” (p. 542). Capek’s environmental justice frame also emphasizes the rights of citizens, democratic processes, and respect for grassroots knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0963662510381032">1993</xref>: 8). Religious rituals were performed in communal solidarity. The Hakka campaigners exhibited a defense of their ways of life, knowledge, and beliefs. Local activism reflects the demand for recognition of local contextual knowledge.</p>

<sec id="section5-0963662510381032">
<title>5. Knowledge disputes among policy stakeholders</title>
<p>Divergent basic values and knowledge claims are used to advocate and justify different policies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0963662510381032">Grundmann, 2007</xref>). Understanding knowledge conflicts can help to analyze situations where the current environmental policy positions show “a taken-for-granted <italic>status quo</italic>” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0963662510381032">Ockwell and Rydin, 2006</xref>: 380). Knowledge disputes are significant. Citizens tend to use an environmental justice discourse to defend the community, while the authorities and the developers employ the language of expertise, regulation, and science, as they adopt the “public irrationality” model which denigrates notions of justice and participation. The officials of the Environmental Protection Administration provided criticisms of the NIMBY (Not In My Backyard)-ism in siting the waste facility. For a few government officials, local activists in Hengshan are just like other protestors who protest against landfills, chemical factories, and nuclear power plants.</p>
<p>What concerns the authorities most is whether incinerators, the industrial waste management scheme, and the siting project can be implemented effectively. The official from the Environmental Protection Administration mentioned that “it is the local government which decides to have a site and sign a contract with a private company to deal with the wastes. Owing to the increasing level of environmental awareness, the promotion of development schemes does not go as smoothly as it used to.” Regulators tend to think that compensation, negotiation, and authority in enforcement provide solutions to siting disputes.</p>
<p>Although the activists vehemently oppose the project of waste pollution, the local officials think that local activists “tend to exaggerate the potential negative impacts in order to encourage more residents to join them” (local official, L). The officials emphasize that the siting process follows relevant regulations and that the precautionary measures to be undertaken are flawless. For local governments, activists always have things to complain about, such as discarded soil from construction work, factories, and fuel gas lines.</p>
<p>The development companies tend to think that they are qualified to address common waste problems and that the developmental scheme will be beneficial to the local community. In Hengshan, the corporation handed out leaflets about the project and tried to communicate with local residents. First, it provided positive information about the company. For example, it claims that it has the ISO 9001 Certificate and that it is recognized as an outstanding company. It also pointed out that the company has done a lot for the local community and county by paying huge amounts of taxes, providing job opportunities, and funding activities held in the community. Second, the corporation explained that only treated ash and industry waste will be stored at the site, rather than toxic waste or trash. It guaranteed that it will hire qualified employees, that the construction and operation will meet the safety standards, and that the facility will not cause any negative impacts on drinking water and the living environment. Also, the corporation emphasized that the county government and local people can supervise and monitor waste management according to the environmental regulations. The environmental monitoring system regulates the groundwater, air quality, soil, noise, road services, and so on. A waste management and supervision committee composed of the head of the county, the heads of the town and villages, town representatives, and people from academia, would be set up and be responsible for the use of the compensation on the local community.</p>
<p>Local activists have treated the development company’s knowledge claims with skepticism. They expressed their doubts as to whether or not the Weimon Corporation has the capability to deal with hazardous waste since it has no experience in doing so. As to the content of the contract, local activists do not believe that the development company can guarantee anything. As one activist asks: “Is it possible to have no negative impact on the water? If an accident happens, who will handle it? What if the company goes bankrupt one day? How will the facility be managed? Who will be responsible for that?” Although the supervisory rules have been set up, the local activists did not trust that the government would enforce the regulations strictly and effectively.</p>
<p>In the leaflets, the Weimon Corporation calls for local cooperation and made the following statements:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>[The project] needs the local residents’ understanding and <italic>rational</italic> cooperation to accomplish local development and build a beautiful hometown … We will not allow those who made groundless accusations about the project to disseminate information spitefully, which has caused local <italic>unrest</italic>. What is needed is to avoid the intervention of political forces and someone’s manipulation. We will obey relevant regulations and procedures, deal with waste properly, protect the health and safety of employees and residents, and do our best to be a good neighbor. Also, we will contribute to local development and prosperity. (emphasis added)</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>These statements seem to imply that those who protest against the siting project are irrational, and that those politicians who express their opposition to the project are trying to manipulate public opinion. Local activists responded to the statement by asking, “Who is manipulating whom?”</p>
<p>Local activists do not necessarily equate to the public, though they might claim to represent the local community or the public. Local concerns may be far more complicated and self-interested. The head of Fusin Village was seen as a supporter of the waste facility and as a lobbyist who represented the government and industry. Those villages that had close relationships with the head of Fusin Village did not say no to the waste, nor did they join any protest activities (local activist, W).</p>

<title>6. Community struggles for democratic procedures</title>
<p>Public engagement is likely to have a great effect on the outcome of environmental policies and might help to bridge knowledge and policy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0963662510381032">Yearly, 2006</xref>). Opposition to the siting of the waste facility is motivated by a range of environmental concerns and values, which reflect the residents’ knowledge and concerns about negative impacts which are ignored by experts and decision-makers. The site selection process, which was dominated by the local government, was not transparent, and it rendered privileged access only for technocrats without public consultation. In July 2003, the local government recognized the Weimon Corporation as an eligible applicant for the development of the project and signed a contract with the corporation. Local activists expressed their impression that the government may have conspired with the private company. A few of them pointed out that Weimon Corporation might have already known of the opportunity to make profits even before the local government announced the bids on the project. The company purchased the land, now the proposed site, several years ago. The original land owner knew neither that the buyer was a big corporation nor its purpose. Local activists theorized that the former head of the Fusin Village may have taken a bribe and acted as a broker. These suspicions of local activists are significant:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>I heard that the head of the village might have received bribes. Recently, people say that several representatives of the town received bribes, too. I really do not know whether it is true or not. The head of the village and the representatives are officials, so they might have needed to support the government’s plan. If they received bribes, they would not strongly oppose the plan. I guess some of them might have pretended to oppose the plan. (Local activist, M2)</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Although there is no clear evidence that local officials were involved in bribery, there was a rumor that the head of Fusin Village had taken a bribe. In September 2004, it was reported that the head of Fusin Village was killed by three abductors who threatened to kill him unless he gave them money. The murderers have been arrested, and they claimed that the head of Fusin Village earned a huge amount of money from the bribes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0963662510381032"><italic>China Times</italic>, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>The closed decision-making process made residents suspect that the government was concealing negative impacts from the local community. As one local activist said, “The government seems to be afraid of making it [the project] known to the public. It means that they will not do it well otherwise they should inform the public.” The problem of informational asymmetry and the lack of genuine communication is expressed in the following:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>The institution of the project was done loosely. No communication was made with the local residents. What they did was just let the project pass the EIA process. The company and the government are saying that it is not toxic, and it will not disturb our living; but, they should let us know what will actually happen if the siting facilities are established here. (Local activists, M4)</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The local Self-help Association appealed to people in the neighboring towns to support their action, and stated in their leaflet, that there should be “no toxic ash facilities on the watershed, a clean hometown only.” “The EIA review is illegal.” “Stand up to save Hengshan.” And, “Guarding our homeland, everyone with one heart.” Environmental activists from other towns (e.g. members of the Hsinchu Foundation) came to express their support and to provide assistance. Their sense of injustice was made explicit in the Self-help Association’s leaflet:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>The Government has not completed any constructions beneficial to Hengshan, but why do the people in Hengshan have to bear the burden of national unwanted wastes and let our children live with toxic ash forever? Hengshan, the beautiful land. Its beautiful mountains and clean water need people in Hengshan to protect it, otherwise it will be gone forever. (The Self-help Association)</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>In the leaflet, the Self-help Association appealed to local residents “to choose the candidates who are really concerned about residents’ welfare rather than self-interests when you vote in elections.” Several candidates who run for legislature tend to express their opposition to the development project. Moreover, the Self-help Association organized a petition and a campaign of objection letters to express their sentiments. Letters of objection were written to the head of the county. Also, they appealed to the Environmental Protection Administration, and they asked the Ministry of Interior to reject the plan submitted by the Hsinchu County Government, because of defects in the EIA process.</p>
<p>Instead of saying “take it somewhere else,” local activists tried to promote an acceptable procedure and cooperative search for a broader range of more suitable sites. For many local activists, the government and the developer have a symbiotic relationship. They suggested that the EIA should be done by an independent institution, such as the Industrial Technology Research Institute, a non-profit organization. For local activists, the local voice should be heard, and it should be the residents who make the decisions. They emphasized that it is better to consider the particularity of one place when the government plans to do something, and look at the environmental impact from the perspective of local residents.</p>
<p>Local activists have assistance from other activists who face similar waste facility siting problems in Ankeng, Taipei County. The Ankeng Anti-facility Siting Alliance provided information on siting facilities and shared their experiences of how to make an appeal, hold meetings, and run a campaign. Local activists found that the regulators have required a tougher safety standard in the Sindian development scheme and felt that the government did not pay much attention to the safety of their hometown.</p>
<p>Local activists tended to feel that they benefited personally from being involved in the campaign. They are not just concerned about the affairs in their village or town, but they are willing to be engaged in wider concerns. As one local activist said, “We are very happy to share our experiences and assist others who face similar environmental problems.”</p>
<p>Local activism and coalitions have caused the government to suspend the scheme and engage in the policy of reusing incinerator ash. Engaging in campaign activities also has brought local transformation. Learning and reflection are a crucial part of citizen activism. Local activists mentioned that the siting disputes made the local residents active in resisting disproportionate risks and in guarding their hometown. They were prompted to criticize the top-down decision-making process. It has made the local residents reflective of their situation, cultures, and the kinds of towns that they want to have. Local activists have transformed the Self-help Association into a formal environmental non-governmental organization, the Environment and Culture Sustainability Promotion Association. It has held several seminars and activities on local environmental history and culture, and it engages in environmental education and conservation. Members of local activist groups are engaged with long-term, broader concerns and express their willingness to cooperate with other communities who are in need of help.</p>

<title>7. Conclusion</title>
<p>The lack of recognition of local contextual knowledge, distribution inequity, and procedural injustice plague the controversial waste facility siting. Local activists thought that policy was articulated within one monochromatic frame of knowledge. Instead of the recognition of local knowledge, rationality and citizen interpretation of risks, government officials have given more value to the EIA report written by detached, outside, and biased experts. Local activists distrust the government’s claims that incinerator ash is non-toxic and that the siting facility will have no negative impact on the environment and local communities. The government officials have tended to dismiss local opposition as irrational and unruly, and they do not think that communication with local activists will work. Activists extend their ethic to other communities, and instead of simply asking authorities to put waste in other places, local activists have challenged the existing industrial waste policy imposed by centralized authorities and demanded more participation in the decision-making processes and independent monitoring.</p>
<p>Local activists and other environmental non-governmental organizations (e.g. the Ankeng Anti-facility Siting Alliance, the Taiwan Environmental Protection Alliance, the Green Action Alliance, and the Taiwan Watch Institute) held a workshop named “Oppose the Landfill to Save Taiwan: Leave Children a Clean Future” in October 2005. Activists and residents from various towns came to participate in the workshop to discuss national waste policies and monitoring mechanisms and to share experiences and information. They also expressed their hope to have a sustainable society. Members of the Anti-Waste Facilities Association joined the activities held by the Taiwan Anti-Incineration Association (TAIA) and appealed to stop the ash landfill policy in order to avoid the incinerator ash poison in their Mother Land. Local activists also have tried to seek help from international organizations, which involves drawing on the international community to exert pressure on the government and the corporation to stop the controversial development project. There is hope in the emergence of coalitions of grassroots organizations in order to confront environmental injustices. Also, citizen activism links the idea of environmental justice to the search for sustainability.</p>
<p>The concerns with procedural equality in the environmental justice movement are linked to a call for justice in terms of recognition of difference and the distribution of environmental risks. The idea of “cognitive justice,” articulated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0963662510381032">Visvanathan (2005</xref>: 93), evokes the relation between survival, knowledge, and lifestyle. It recognizes “not only the rights of dissenting scientists within a dominant paradigm, but also the rights of alternative epistemologies and alternative sciences.” It could be seen as one crucial part of the struggle to address the problems of exclusion, misrecognition, and domination. The development of institutional procedures for a dialogue among different perspectives and stakeholders is crucial to the formation of industrial waste policies and siting decisions. Policymakers should not exclude local knowledge and perspectives in risk assessments. A bottom-up approach in setting industrial waste policy would empower various groups to have a meaningful role in the decision-making process. Local knowledge, particular ways of life, and community survival need to be recognized and integrated into the dialogue process.</p>
<p>In the Hengshan case, local activists play a significant role in fighting against injustices, making a difference. They demand democratic participation to address the problem of lack of recognition and unjust distribution. Instead of seeing increased involvement as a necessary good, this paper recognizes the complexities and limitations of public deliberations. For example, different policy outcomes would result from different choices of participants. The idea of inclusiveness raises the problem of scale: it is questionable to engage large numbers of people affected by decisions in a deliberative process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0963662510381032">Parkinson, 2003</xref>). Deliberation accepts only those ways of making arguments that are formal, dispassionate and disembodied, discriminating against women and ethnic minorities whose distinct perspectives and concerns need to be presented in other ways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0963662510381032">Sanders, 1997</xref>). Also, if public engagement is improperly conceived and conducted in particular contexts, further conflicts may occur (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0963662510381032">Horlick-Jones et al., 2007</xref>). Attention needs to be paid to the influences of political elites, experts, interest groups, and political manipulations by the media (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0963662510381032">Chen, 2005</xref>). It is worthwhile to further evaluate the process and outcomes of public participation and to examine the dynamics of the relationships between the state and civic society in the process of promoting democratization of science. In the current Taiwanese context of exclusion and expert hegemony, it is crucial to improve the problem of limited participation to foster informed and active citizens. Various forms of dialogue among stakeholders and public deliberation should be seen as social learning processes that will bring transformation.</p>
