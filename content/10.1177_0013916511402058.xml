<abstract>
<p>The objective was to investigate associations between features of the physical environment and neighborliness. Measures of the physical environment, including sidewalks, front porches, traffic-calming devices, bars on windows, and the presence of litter or graffiti, were collected using a systematic audit instrument in 10 neighborhoods in Portland, Oregon. Generalized linear regression models were created to model the odds of increasing neighborliness given access to the physical-environment factors of interest. The authors observed a greater probability of higher levels of neighborliness as the total number of positive physical-environment characteristics increased (cumulative odds ratio [95% confidence interval] = 1.69 [1.16, 2.45]) and the results were unchanged after controlling for race, self-reported health, perception of safety, years of neighborhood residence, age of house, market value of house, and proportion of homeowners in neighborhood. Modifiable features of the physical environment may be one mechanism through which people can enhance neighborliness.</p>

<p>As research on neighborhoods and health develops further to identify mechanisms that may account for the reported associations, the social relationships among neighbors, sometimes referred to as neighborliness, emerge as an important component. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0013916511402058">Mann (1954)</xref> defined neighborliness as the form of behavior undertaken in the interactions between neighbors, a small number of people who live very near to us. Neighborliness is a specific form of social support that benefits individuals and is a component of psychological sense of community, “a feeling that members have of belonging, a feeling that members matter to one another and to the group, and a shared faith that members’ needs will be met through their commitment to be together” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0013916511402058">McMillan &amp; Chavis, 1986</xref>, p. 9). Sense of community is associated with individual well-being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0013916511402058">Farrell, Aubry, &amp; Coulombe, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0013916511402058">Pretty, Conroy, Dugay, Fowler, &amp; Williams, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>The physical design of neighborhoods, also referred to as the built environment, is thought to play a distinct role in encouraging or discouraging neighborly interactions and has been studied in a variety of ways by public-health professionals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0013916511402058">Corburn, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0013916511402058">Dannenberg et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0013916511402058">Wood, Frank, &amp; Giles-Corti, 2010</xref>), urban planners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0013916511402058">Appleyard &amp; Lintell, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0013916511402058">Forrest &amp; Kearns, 2001</xref>), sociologists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0013916511402058">Sampson &amp; Raudenbush, 1999</xref>), psychologists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0013916511402058">Fried, 2000</xref>), and architects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0013916511402058">Evans &amp; McCoy, 1998</xref>). A better understanding of the role of neighborhood design may suggest unique opportunities to enhance neighborliness.</p>
<p>Physical characteristics of neighborhoods associated with greater “walkability,” or pedestrian friendliness, may encourage residents to spend time walking in the neighborhood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0013916511402058">Alfonzo, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0013916511402058">Saelens, Sallis, &amp; Frank, 2003</xref>) and thus, facilitate casual interaction and enhance informal relationships between neighbors. Jane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0013916511402058">Jacobs (1961)</xref> famously proposed radical new principles for rebuilding cities based on this model of walkable cities. “Weak ties,” the informal relationships stemming from everyday interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0013916511402058">Granovetter, 1973</xref>), are developed through opportunities for passive contact, closer proximity to others, and appropriate spaces to interact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0013916511402058">Skjaeveland &amp; Garling, 1997</xref>). “Soft edges” describe indistinct boundaries between public and private spaces, also called semiprivate zones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0013916511402058">Gehl, 1986</xref>). The importance of these semiprivate spaces is that they provide spaces for people to interact by keeping people out of doors for a longer duration than a purely public or purely private space. For example, a front garden or yard constitutes a soft edge where neighbors might interact if one were out maintaining the garden. Weak ties have been identified as important contributors to feelings of home, security, and social support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0013916511402058">Henning &amp; Lieberg, 1996</xref>). In an examination of the total numbers of contacts in the neighborhood, “weak interactions,” such as hand waving or passively greeting neighbors, occurred three times more frequently than “strong interactions,” such as planned gatherings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0013916511402058">Henning &amp; Lieberg, 1996</xref>). The latter occurred more frequently outside of the neighborhood setting. Also, informal relationships with neighbors are more important for certain groups such as blue-collar workers and the elderly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0013916511402058">Guest &amp; Wierzbicki, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0013916511402058">Henning &amp; Lieberg, 1996</xref>).</p>

<title>Hypotheses</title>
<p>The association of specific features of the physical environment with neighborliness and related constructs have been examined in a limited number of empirical studies, including front porches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0013916511402058">Skjaeveland &amp; Garling, 1997</xref>), bars on windows or doors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0013916511402058">Taylor, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0013916511402058">Taylor, Gottfredson, &amp; Brower, 1984</xref>), well-maintained yards and buildings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0013916511402058">Greenbaum &amp; Greenbaum, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0013916511402058">Skjaeveland &amp; Garling, 1997</xref>), and the absence of litter or graffiti (B. B. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0013916511402058">Brown, Perkins, &amp; Brown, 2003</xref>). Furthermore, other features of the physical environment (sidewalks, traffic calming) that may influence casual interaction by increasing the likelihood of walking as part of the daily routine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0013916511402058">Michael, Green, &amp; Farquhar, 2006</xref>) have not been specifically studied in relation to neighborliness or related constructs. Wood and colleagues (2010) recently evaluated the association between walking behavior, neighborhood physical environment, and social interactions among 609 residents of Atlanta, Georgia. The results of the study support an association between sense of community and leisurely walking in the neighborhood. In addition, sense of community was positively associated with higher commercial floor space to land area ratios, a measure derived from administrative records and hypothesized by the authors to represent the degree to which retail destinations are set back from the street, the amount of surface parking, and the urban design of an area. Sense of community was negatively associated with presence of land-use mix, an indicator of high levels of commercial destinations. Macro-level measures of urban design derived from administrative records such as those used in the study by Wood and colleagues are typical of research on the built environment and health but are incomplete as measures of walkability. Micro-level data on the physical environment can provide additional detail on factors such as sidewalk continuity, aesthetics, traffic conditions, and specific information about building characteristics such as porches. These micro-level data are less commonly used in this research because they are not readily available as are the administrative data.</p>
<p>Methods for assessing micro-level characteristics of the physical environment include self-reported perceptions of neighborhood residents or those directly observed through an audit instrument (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0013916511402058">Elo, Mykyta, Margolis, &amp; Culhane, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0013916511402058">Lin &amp; Moudon, 2010</xref>). However, perceptions of the physical environment may reflect distortions related to the outcome of interest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0013916511402058">Lloyd, 1997</xref>). Correlations between subjective assessments and objective assessments of the physical environment vary across studies from low (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0013916511402058">Saelens et al., 2003</xref>) to moderate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0013916511402058">Elo et al., 2009</xref>) depending on the characteristic of interest. Under- as well as overreporting of physical characteristics appears to be related to characteristics of residents, such as education, income, and level of physical activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0013916511402058">Gebel, Bauman, &amp; Owen, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0013916511402058">McCormack, Cerin, Leslie, Du Toit, &amp; Owen, 2008</xref>). For these reasons, objective measures of micro-level physical environment are needed in studies of neighborliness.</p>
<p>The purpose of the current study was to address this gap and assess whether objectively measured micro-level features of the physical environment were independently or in combination associated with increased neighborliness. Neighborliness was operationalized to include reciprocal relationships and trust of neighbors as well as neighborly knowledge and contacts. We hypothesized that the presence of front porches and a connected system of sidewalks, and absence of bars on windows and doors, graffiti or litter, and traffic-calming devices are associated with neighborliness.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>This study was a cross-sectional analysis of data collected in eight neighborhoods in Portland, Oregon, as part of a study of neighborhood environment. These data included (a) a systematic neighborhood street audit, conducted in 2002-2003, of randomly sampled street segments within each neighborhood using a valid and reliable systematic audit instrument, the Senior Walking Environmental Assessment Tool (SWEAT; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0013916511402058">Cunningham, Michael, Farquhar, &amp; Lapidus, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0013916511402058">Keast, Carlson, Chapman, &amp; Michael, 2010</xref>); (b) an interviewer-administered survey conducted during the same time period, including questions regarding neighborliness; and (c) 2000 tax-assessor data. This study was approved by the Oregon Health &amp; Science Institutional Review Board.</p>
<sec id="section3-0013916511402058">
<title>Study Population</title>
<p>Neighborhoods were selected to represent a relatively diverse spectrum of sociodemographic characteristics, including cost of housing, population, and age of residents. Neighborhoods available for selection have boundaries that are identified by the Portland City Council and delineated by streets and districts. Criteria for inclusion were described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0013916511402058">Michael, Beard, Choi, Farquhar, &amp; Carlson, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Within each neighborhood, all street segments were enumerated using geographic information system (GIS) mapping (<italic>N</italic> = 5,384). Segments representing industrial blocks or freeways were excluded (16%, <italic>n</italic> = 862). A 10% random sample of street segments was selected for the audit by trained observers using the SWEAT (range = 15-96 segments per neighborhood; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0013916511402058">Cunningham et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Neighborhood residents living on an audited street segment were recruited to complete a survey administered by trained interviewers. The interviewers were not the same individuals who had conducted the street audits. Households were enumerated using a tax-assessor data, where all assessed properties within 50 feet of a previously sampled street segment were eligible for selection. The assessed property was required to be on or directly adjacent to the street but was not required to have an address along that segment. For each neighborhood, one of the sampled street segments was selected as the starting place to begin the survey process. Interviewers attempted to interview the first adult to answer the door at each property on the segment before moving on to the next closest sampled segment. The recruitment process continued until every household on all the selected segments of a neighborhood had been attempted twice or 20 households in a neighborhood were interviewed.</p>
<p>In all, 128 residents were interviewed in eight neighborhoods for a response proportion of 32%. The proportion of people who refused interviews ranged from 52% to 74% per neighborhood and did not differ significantly by neighborhood (<italic>p</italic> = .54). Data on the market value and age of each respondent’s house, as well as the proportion of homeowners in each neighborhood, were linked by tax-assessor identification number to data from the systematic observation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0013916511402058">
<title>Dependent Variable: Neighborliness</title>
<p>The neighborliness questions used in the door-to-door survey were adopted from the Social Capital Module of the General Household Survey (GHS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0013916511402058">Coulthard, Walker, &amp; Morgan, 2003</xref>) of 2000-2001 used in Great Britain. Neighborliness was defined by the GHS as the extent of interaction, trust, and reciprocity between neighbors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0013916511402058">Coulthard et al., 2003</xref>). The key items used in the neighborliness index included knowing people in the neighborhood, trusting the people in the neighborhood, looking out for one another, doing favors for neighbors, having favors done for you, and frequency of speaking with neighbors. For the purposes of these questions, “neighborhood” was defined to the survey respondents as the survey participant’s street segment or block. The final score was created by summing the unweighted scores from the six questions, yielding a total of six possible points with more points indicating a greater degree of neighborliness. The Cronbach’s alpha for the overall neighborliness score was acceptable at .65 and similar to the published value for the United Kingdom’s GHS scale (.70; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0013916511402058">Coulthard et al., 2003</xref>). For analysis, those with a neighborliness score less than 3 were grouped into one category because of the low frequency of responses in these categories, resulting in a five-category outcome with a higher score indicating more neighborliness.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0013916511402058">
<title>Independent Variables: The Physical Environment</title>
<p>The physical environment was assessed using SWEAT, an instrument with adequate reliability and validity. Overall reliability of the items ranged from .40 to .89, with 80% of the items meeting criteria for good reliability (κ &gt; .60; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0013916511402058">Cunningham et al., 2005</xref>). In addition, scales representing SWEAT domains were significantly associated with walking for exercise and transportation, supporting the validity of the instrument (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0013916511402058">Keast et al., 2010</xref>). Specific SWEAT items were selected for inclusion in the current analysis based on their proposed ability to maximize the number of informal interactions occurring between neighbors as proposed in the conceptual model: sidewalks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0013916511402058">Hess, Moudon, &amp; Stanilov, 1999</xref>), front porches (B. B. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0013916511402058">Brown, Burton, &amp; Sweaney, 1998</xref>), traffic-calming devices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0013916511402058">Shay, Rodriguez, Cho, Clifton, &amp; Evenson, 2009</xref>), bars on windows, and the presence of litter or graffiti (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0013916511402058">Taylor, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>All of the variables were measured at the level of street segment, with the exception of sidewalk. The street block has been considered an ideal unit of measurement for neighborhood behavior because it constitutes the “everyday environment with a recurring pattern of behaviors and a surrounding and supporting physical milieu” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0013916511402058">Taylor, 1997</xref>, p. 119). As described further below, sidewalk connectivity was measured at the named neighborhood level given that sidewalk coverage would need to extend beyond the immediate street block to influence behavior.</p>
<p>Front porches were defined as porches, balconies, or stoops wide enough to comfortably place a chair and still open a door. Front-porch coverage was measured by counting the total number of buildings with front porches and dividing by the number of buildings on the segment. For analysis, it was dichotomized at the median, with greater presence hypothesized to be associated with greater neighborliness.</p>
<p>Traffic-calming devices were defined by the presence of a traffic circle, cross walk, speed bump, planter, or pedestrian sign on a given street segment or in the intersection between the segment under study and the adjacent segment. Locally, the Bureau of Transportation had in place a traffic-calming program with the primary objective to “enhance neighborhood livability and sense of community by reducing excessive speeding and excessive vehicle volumes on local service streets” (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.portlandonline.com/transportation/index.cfm?c=40512&amp;a=295642#Mission">http://www.portlandonline.com/transportation/index.cfm?c=40512&amp;a=295642#Mission</ext-link>). The variable was dichotomized based on the presence versus absence of the traffic-calming device. Although traffic volume is variable on streets in which traffic-calming devices have been added both locally and nationally, we initially hypothesized that presence (indicating a road with more traffic volume thus necessitating traffic calming) was associated with less neighborliness.</p>
<p>Bars on windows or doors were defined by the presence of any visible bars over windows or doors on any of the buildings on a street segment. It was dichotomized by presence versus absence of bars, with presence hypothesized to be associated with less neighborliness. Bars suggest concerns about high crime levels, which may limit neighborly interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0013916511402058">Taylor, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>Litter or graffiti was assessed by the observer as the cleanliness of the segment as a whole, including streets, sidewalks, properties, and buildings. The presence of litter, graffiti, or broken glass was recorded as none or almost none, yes (but not dominant feature), or yes (dominant feature). This variable was dichotomized based on the presence versus absence of litter or graffiti, with presence hypothesized to be related to less neighborliness.</p>
<p>Sidewalks were assessed on the basis of continuity within named <italic>neighborhoods</italic> rather than on street segments, as the rest of the built-environment variables were analyzed. Studies have shown that when networks of streets within a neighborhood have corresponding sidewalks, that is, the sidewalk-to-street ratio approaches one, the likelihood of pedestrian activity increases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0013916511402058">Hess et al., 1999</xref>), increasing the possibility of informal interactions between neighbors. In the current study, all street segments originally sampled in the named neighborhood (<italic>n</italic> = 359) were evaluated for the proportion of sidewalks continuous on at least one side. Sidewalk continuity was dichotomized as 90% to 100% of sidewalks continuous on at least one side and less than 90% of sidewalk coverage, with greater sidewalk coverage hypothesized to be associated with greater neighborliness.</p>
<p>To assess the additive influence of the physical environment, the presence (or absence) of features hypothesized to be related to greater time spent in the neighborhood and casual interactions with neighbors was summed and evaluated as a composite physical-environment score ranging from 1 (<italic>one positive feature</italic>) to 5 (<italic>five positive features</italic>). Although the theoretical range would include 0, there were no participants without any positive built-environment features. Correlations between the physical-environment characteristics are provided in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0013916511402058">Table 1</xref>. Correlations among these variables were generally small supporting the development of a summed score to consider the cumulative effect. Weak but statistically significant positive correlations were observed between front porches, traffic calming, and completeness of neighborhood sidewalks (.193 to .248); weak but significant negative correlation was observed between bars on windows/doors and completeness of neighborhood sidewalks (−.272).</p>

<title>Covariates</title>
<p>Variables that had the potential to confound the relationship between physical environment and neighborliness were considered in the analysis. Variables collected from the interviewer-administered survey included race (White, non-White; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0013916511402058">Subramanian, Lochner, &amp; Kawachi, 2003</xref>) and self-rated health (excellent or very good versus good, fair, or poor; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0013916511402058">Veenstra, 2005</xref>). Participants were asked how many years or months they had lived in this area, meaning within a 15 to 20 min walk or a 5 to 10 min drive from where they were currently living; responses were dichotomized based on the median response years of residence in the neighborhood (less than 6.5 years, 6.5 years or greater; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0013916511402058">Taylor, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0013916511402058">Ziersch, Baum, Macdougall, &amp; Putland, 2005</xref>). Participants were also asked how safe from crime they felt walking alone in the area after dark: very safe, fairly safe, a bit unsafe, very unsafe, or they never go out alone after dark. This variable was dichotomized based on those who felt very or fairly safe and those who felt otherwise and feelings of safety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0013916511402058">Perkins, Meeks, &amp; Taylor, 1992</xref>). Gender was available only for a subset of the population (<italic>n</italic> = 60) interviewed later in the data-collection process. The role of gender as a confounding factor in this study was assessed in a subanalysis for the subset of participants with data on gender.</p>
<p>Variables collected from tax-assessor data included age of the house in which the person resides and market value. The age of house in which a person lives has been found to be associated with neighborly interaction, presumably because the era of development generally determines the basic characteristics of the street neighborhood. Age of house is dichotomized as older than 1950 or 1950 and more recent to account for differences in the building styles and neighborhood layout of the earlier 20th century compared with the modern era (B. B. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0013916511402058">Brown et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0013916511402058">Cao, Handy, &amp; Mokhtarian, 2006</xref>). Market value was used as a proxy for wealth (B. B. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0013916511402058">Brown et al., 2003</xref>). Market value was dichotomized based on those with houses below the median house value in Portland in the year 2000 and those at or above the median (US$154,900). The proportion of homeowners in the neighborhood is associated with neighborliness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0013916511402058">Rohe &amp; Stewart, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0013916511402058">Ziersch et al., 2005</xref>). These data were publicly available from the City of Portland Office of Neighborhood Involvement at the level of named neighborhood but not at the level of street segment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0013916511402058">Portland Neighborhood Demographic Data in Excel File, 2000</xref>).</p>

<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>Generalized linear models were used to assess the association between built-environment characteristics and the neighborliness outcome. A cumulative logit link function was used to incorporate the ordinal nature of the neighborliness outcome. Because correlation in neighborliness between neighborhoods was negligible (<italic>r</italic> &lt; .1), it was not necessary to adjust for that level of clustering. In addition, the mean number of participants per segment was 2 (<italic>SD</italic> = 1.4); estimates of neighborhood variance will be overinflated and estimators will be less efficient with less than three observations per nesting unit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0013916511402058">Clarke &amp; Wheaton, 2007</xref>). The unadjusted models include a single built-environment characteristic. The final adjusted models were established through the following model-building process. First, a set of models were fitted each with one built-environment characteristic and one potential confounder in the model. Covariates that changed the cumulative odds ratio by more than 10% were identified as confounders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0013916511402058">Rothman, Greenland, &amp; Lash, 2008</xref>). Given the small sample size in the analysis, the final adjusted model was built in a stepwise fashion by including the most influential confounder first and then adding other confounders one by one. At each step potential, collinearity between confounders was evaluated (i.e., a large change in odds ratios or large increases in the standard errors). Collinearity did not occur in any of the model building. A <italic>p</italic> value of less than .05 was considered statistically significant. A Wald test was used to assess the significance of the cumulative odds ratio. All analyses were performed in SAS v9.2 (Cary, NC) using PROC GENMOD.</p>

Front porches and sidewalks were positively associated with neighborliness, and traffic-calming devices and litter or graffiti were negatively associated with neighborliness, although these associations did not reach statistical significance in the adjusted models.

None of the covariates confounded the association between overall physical environment and neighborliness; in a model adjusted for all potential confounders, including race, self-reported health, perception of safety, years lived in the neighborhood, age of the house, market value of the house, and proportion of neighborhood homeowners; the odds ratio remained basically unchanged and was still significantly associated with neighborliness (<italic>p</italic> = .013).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>These findings may suggest that neighborliness—including reciprocal relationships and trust of neighbors as well as neighborly knowledge and contacts—increases with the cumulative presence of physical-environment characteristics that provide semiprivate space for informal interaction, including front porches, continuous sidewalks, and freedom from high-traffic streets (traffic-calming devices), bars on windows and doors, and litter and graffiti. These results confirm and extend the findings of Wood and colleagues (2010) that macro-level, physical-environment characteristics are associated with sense of community.</p>
<p>Although we did not evaluate pedestrian activity directly, our conceptual model presumed that characteristics of the physical environment, such as sidewalk connectivity, would support people walking outside of the house whereby providing neighbors with opportunities to interact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0013916511402058">Alfonzo, 2005</xref>). A study of walkability in Ireland found that a greater number of types of destinations such as restaurants or pubs a person reports being able to walk to from his or her home, the greater the odds of several markers of neighborliness similar to those used in the current study, such as trusting and knowing one’s neighbors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0013916511402058">Leyden, 2003</xref>). Although the measure of walkability used in the analysis by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0013916511402058">Leyden (2003)</xref> did not directly assess sidewalk connectivity, the neighborhoods with higher walkability scores were older and had better developed networks of sidewalks than other neighborhoods in the study. Research on whether neighborhood sidewalk coverage is associated with pedestrian activity is mixed. Although some research provides support for a positive association between sidewalks and walking for transportation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0013916511402058">Giles-Corti &amp; Donovan, 2002</xref>), other research found no support for an association with walking among adults for transportation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0013916511402058">Lee &amp; Moudon, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0013916511402058">Nagel, Carlson, Bosworth, &amp; Michael, 2008</xref>) or recreation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0013916511402058">Giles-Corti &amp; Donovan, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0013916511402058">Lee &amp; Moudon, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0013916511402058">Michael, Beard, Choi, Farquhar, &amp; Carlson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0013916511402058">Nagel et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0013916511402058">Rutt &amp; Coleman, 2005</xref>). In light of the mixed research supporting the role of sidewalks and walking behavior, although not statistically significant, our results supporting a positive association between neighborhood continuity and neighborliness may suggest that the benefit of sidewalks may also lay in the creation of so-called soft edges where neighbors interact rather than in directly influencing physical activity.</p>
<p>Theoretical and qualitative observations support the role of front porches in facilitating social cohesion (B. B. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0013916511402058">Brown et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0013916511402058">Wilson-Doenges, 2001</xref>). In the current study, the presence of front porches was associated with nonstatistically significant increased odds of more neighborliness after adjustment for confounders. The degree to which front porches may influence neighborliness may be dependent on how frequently they are used. Existing studies have found that qualities such as porch size or the presence of furniture are related to increased front-porch use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0013916511402058">Wilson-Doenges, 2001</xref>). Although we only counted front porches that could comfortably seat a chair, we did not measure the quality of the space or their actual use. A population-based study of Hispanic elders reported a significant association between architectural features of the front entrance (including the front porch) that contribute to a sense of “eyes on the street” and level of perceived social support, hypothesized by the authors to reflect interactions between neighbors (S. C. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0013916511402058">Brown et al., 2009</xref>). We did not observe an independent association between porches and neighborliness in the current study. The difference in our findings may result from unique qualities of the Hispanic elders in relation to predictors of neighborliness. In addition, S. C. Brown and colleagues (2009) did not control for the age of housing. More recently built houses tend to have smaller, less functional front porches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0013916511402058">Wilson-Doenges, 2001</xref>), and people who live in more recently built homes are less active than people living in older homes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0013916511402058">Berrigan &amp; Troiano, 2002</xref>), so failure to adjust for age of the housing may result in uncontrolled confounding.</p>
<p>Previous studies found that the presence of litter and graffiti negatively affects social interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0013916511402058">Perkins et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0013916511402058">Perkins, Wandersman, Rich, &amp; Taylor, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0013916511402058">Taylor, 1997</xref>). The presence of graffiti has been found to be a marker of social disruption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0013916511402058">Araya et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0013916511402058">Cohen et al., 2000</xref>) and related to perceived safety from crime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0013916511402058">Day, Boarnet, Alfonzo, &amp; Forsyth, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0013916511402058">Taylor, 1997</xref>). Some researchers have explicitly not included litter or graffiti in their assessment of the built environment, arguing that the feature is too labile and misclassification highly likely, though they do consider it a very important characteristic of the neighborhood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0013916511402058">Pikora, Giles-Corti, Bull, Jamrozik, &amp; Donovan, 2003</xref>). Although bars on doors and windows may also be related to perceived safety from crime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0013916511402058">Taylor, 1997</xref>), we found no association with neighborliness in the current study. Bars on windows may be a proxy for nonresidential building presence on the street, which was negatively associated with sense of community in prior research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0013916511402058">Wood et al., 2010</xref>); however, nonresidential buildings were not directly measured in the current study.</p>
<p>In our study, the presence of traffic-calming devices was associated with a nonsignificant reduction of neighborliness. Prior literature is inconclusive as to the importance of traffic-calming devices for the purpose of neighborhood activity such as walking. An Australian study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0013916511402058">Pikora and colleagues (2003)</xref> found that traffic-calming devices were not perceived by experts to be the most important factors influencing walking in a neighborhood, whereas personal safety, attractiveness of the surroundings, and the presence of destinations were highly important. Michael and colleagues (2006) found mixed results in a qualitative study among senior residents of the same Portland neighborhoods as in this study; although some participants reported traffic-calming devices served to increase safety by slowing traffic, others reported that they made walking less safe by obscuring visibility of drivers to pedestrians.</p>
<p>The current study substantiates and strengthens existing research describing the relationship between the physical environment and neighborliness by empirically testing theories using objective data describing the built environment in combination with a survey of neighborliness that included many important covariates. However, some limitations should be noted.</p>
<p>The observed results may reflect residual confounding by socioeconomic status. Studies indicate that the relationship between socioeconomic status, neighborliness, and the built environment are complex and still poorly understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0013916511402058">Subramanian et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0013916511402058">Subramanian &amp; Kawachi, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0013916511402058">Veenstra, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0013916511402058">Veenstra et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0013916511402058">Ziersch et al., 2005</xref>). Income or education levels were not available in this data set; however, market value of the house in which the person lives served as a proxy for wealth. It is possible that market value of the house is an inadequate measure (perhaps due to overinflated or rapidly changing housing values that do not reflect the true wealth of the resident) and that more thorough measurement of socioeconomic status in this study would influence the observed effect estimates. Residual confounding due to absence of control for gender was also a limitation of our analysis. However, in the subanalyses, including gender, the effect estimates were unchanged adjustment for gender suggesting that gender was not a confounder of the association between physical environment and neighborliness in this population.</p>
<p>Given a response proportion of 32%, selection bias is a possibility and could result in an over- or underestimate of the true association. If nonworking people who were at home and available to be interviewed were disproportionately interviewed, our sample would be more likely to include people who were less healthy. If poorer health is related to both neighborliness and the physical-environment exposure of interest, selection bias would underestimate the odds ratio. Our surveys were initiated between 3 p.m. and 7 p.m., thus including times that would not have entirely excluded a working population from participating. Selection bias would also exist if we captured a population of people who were healthier than the underlying population. Based on our enrollment process, we invited the first adult to answer the door to participate. Thus, we may have been more likely to include people who have the mobility to get to the door. This could overestimate odds ratio if better health is also related to neighborliness. Forty-eight percent of our respondents reported excellent or very good health, this proportion is comparable with what other studies have reported. Other studies have found that between 52% and 58% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0013916511402058">Veenstra, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0013916511402058">Veenstra et al., 2005</xref>) of people report excellent or very good health. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0013916511402058">Sooman and Macintyre (1995)</xref> found that between 11% and 28% of survey respondents rated their health excellent, whereas 19% of survey respondents in our population reported excellent health. These comparisons suggest that our study participants were healthy similar to survey respondents of other studies.</p>
<p>Formal training of the observers minimized measurement error in our exposure (physical-environment characteristics). However, assessment of less-objective characteristics (i.e., litter and graffiti) was less reliable. Misclassification would most likely be nondifferential, as those with high, moderate, or low neighborliness would be equally affected, and would bias our results toward the null. Measurement error mediated by interviewers in the outcome (neighborliness) is possible. The reliability of the scale used to assess neighborliness in this study was lower than in the original study in the United Kingdom for which it was developed, perhaps because of the difficulty in adapting a measure for a different population. Nondifferential measurement error would introduce bias in the measured effect estimates toward the null. Additional nondifferential measurement error was introduced by the temporal mismatch between covariates (i.e., portion of homeowners in the neighborhood) and the built-environment data assessed via SWEAT. The face-to-face interviewers could not be blinded to the built-environment characteristics around them, which could result in interviewer bias. However, interviewers did not conduct the built-environment assessments and had no knowledge of audit results.</p>
<p>This cross-sectional analysis does not demonstrate causality. Although it has been suggested that “it seems reasonable to assume that the causal link goes from attributes of the physical environment to neighboring” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0013916511402058">Skjaeveland &amp; Garling, 1997</xref>, p. 185), this cannot be assumed. It is possible that neighborhoods with high level of neighborliness are better able to organize to improve physical environments, through actions such as neighborhood cleanup projects and lobbying for mandates for continuous sidewalks to be built into neighborhoods, for example. Thus, neighboring behavior may lead to improved neighborhoods, rather than neighborhood features facilitating social traits (B. B. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0013916511402058">Brown &amp; Werner, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0013916511402058">Greenbaum &amp; Greenbaum, 1981</xref>). Longitudinal research is needed to address this limitation.</p>
<p>This study suggests that the built environment plays a unique role in enhancing neighborliness. Comprehensive plans adopted by cities and other localities to guide new development and changes to existing development may contribute to a community’s neighborliness by incorporating factors such as complete street networks (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.completestreets.org/changing-policy/policy-elements/">http://www.completestreets.org/changing-policy/policy-elements/</ext-link>). In addition to the role of the built environment, this study supports helping people live in their own houses for longer periods of time to enhance neighborliness. One way this may happen is through controlling property tax increases for the elderly or those with lower incomes to maintain affordability for residents.</p>
<p>Future studies should look at improvements in the physical environment in relation to changes in neighborliness. A more diverse system of neighborhoods should be studied to determine whether characteristics of the built environment operate the same way in other urban neighborhoods. Furthermore, studies are needed to develop a more sophisticated understanding of mechanisms: Through which behavioral mechanism does the physical environment influence neighborliness? For example, are people more likely to interact when it is easier to walk around? However, even without knowledge of the mechanisms, this research provides further support that neighborhood design affects our relationships with our neighbors, which has the potential to improve well-being.</p>
