<p>The opening title card in the film, <italic>Slumdog Millionaire </italic>(2008), asked the following question: “Jamal Malik is one question away from winning 20 million rupees. How did he do it?” Up to this point, Jamal has answered questions that surpass the knowledge of most people. Even when the host feeds him the wrong answer, Jamal calls his bluff and answers the question correctly. This leads the producers of the show to accuse him of cheating. After all, how could an orphan from the slums of India, employed as a chai-walla<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0160597611433274">1</xref>
</sup> in a call center, know all of these answers? The film follows the story of how key situations in Jamal’s life have provided him with the answers he needed to win. As the title card tells us, Jamal can do it because, “It is written.”</p>
<p>In the end, Jamal wins the money and is reunited with his childhood love, Latika. Their love is sealed with a kiss and a Bollywood dance. Like any other formulaic mainstream film, this version offers the same feel-good ending that audiences hoped for and even anticipated. However, representations in this film also continue to offer the same limited understandings by the West regarding developing countries, and reinforce racial hierarchies that exist in both India and the West. Although these representations bring some attention to issues of poverty and exploitation in Indian society, they fail to realistically address these social problems. </p>
<sec id="section1-0160597611433274">
<title>Social Problems in India</title>
<p>Throughout their young lives, Jamal, his brother Salim, and Latika dealt with powerlessness against their slumlords. In gut-wrenching scenes, we see what life is truly like for orphans who are forced to beg for money in the streets, just to have to turn the money over to their bosses. While the film does a good job of accurately illustrating what life is like in India for many people, little is accomplished for the suffering of children like the protagonists. </p>
<p>As teenagers, Jamal and Salim are forced to fend for themselves, which they do by humorously ripping off unsuspecting Western tourists at the Taj Mahal. These portrayals of India as a foreign place in which crime and deception are rampant are familiar representations of what most know about the mysterious East. Additionally, Latika’s young life reflects the realities of exploitation and rape for many Indian girls and women. As a teenager, Latika’s virginity was used as a selling point to the highest bidder. Even after Latika is rescued by Jamal, Salim used his power to push Jamal out and keep her for himself. When Latika later tried to meet Jamal at the train station, her slumlord-boyfriend’s bodyguards caught up with her and sliced her face for trying to run away. In mainstream films, it is rare to see the female lead disfigured in such a way. To some extent, this representation fits the story and the character, both of which are scarred byproducts of the Mumbai slums. </p>

<title>Indian Representations</title>
<p>As the characters grow from children to adults, it is hard not to notice Latika and Jamal’s lightening skin tones. Latika develops into a beautiful woman with long, straight hair, light skin, and noticeable Aryan features. The practice of using actors and actresses that embody characteristics associated with these beauty ideals is common in mainstream media. Light skin tone has long been the primary marker of beauty in Indian society, particularly for Indian women. The casting decisions made for this movie perpetuate a particular representation of beauty that caters to both Western and Indian audiences and does little to challenge this problematic issue.</p>
<p>At the end of the film, Jamal and Latika dance to A.R. Rahman’s Academy Award winning song, “Jai Ho.” The song, which includes Indian, Arabic, and hip-hop musical influences, and Hindi, Urdu, and Spanish lyrics, was remade into an American pop version by the Pussycat Dolls in 2009 as India is once again exoticised for commercial benefit. Much like the type-face used for the film’s closing credits, India continues to be seen in ways that perpetuate perceptions of the east as foreign and “other.” </p>

<title>Can All Slumdogs Be Millionaires?</title>
<p>As the film leads to the dramatic end, we see groups of people in front of their televisions and on the edges of their seats, much like the theater audience, rooting for Jamal in all of the places that the characters touched. The film played out in locations that are familiar places in India—the slums, the orphanage and seedy underworld, long and winding trains, the Taj Mahal, and even an Indian call center. In the end, Jamal gets the money, the girl, and triumphs over evil. Much of the success of the film is based on this happy ending. Indeed, substantial revenues have been the result of the commitment of mainstream audiences to this particular storyline. In the United States, this film opened the eyes of most Americans to the realities of many children in India. While reality played out in the background, it is overshadowed by Jamal’s rags-to-riches success. This story showed us that Jamal won because he was able to use his slum experience in order to rise above it. Unfortunately, that story is virtually impossible for the real slumdogs of India.</p>
