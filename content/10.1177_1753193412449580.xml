<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>A traumatic thumb defect leads to profound functional disability and psychological stress. Therefore, every effort should be made to reconstruct a damaged thumb to regain hand function, while minimizing any loss of function in the foot if a toe transfer is used.</p>
<p>A 21-year-old, right-handed man presented after a right hand injury. Radiographs showed an open, displaced, comminuted fracture of the metacarpal bone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1753193412449580">Figure 1A</xref>). The right thumb was destroyed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1753193412449580">Figure 1B</xref>). At operation, a free left second toe transfer, including the second metatarsal bone, and a dorsalis pedis flap was used to reconstruct the thumb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1753193412449580">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1753193412449580">D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1753193412449580">Gordon et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1753193412449580">Molski, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1753193412449580">Tsai et al., 1987</xref>). The free second toe transfer was attached with a plate. It was inlaid with a composite pedicle flap from the fibular side of the great toe to improve the appearance of the thumb. The flexor and extensor tendons were attached to the flexor pollicis longus and extensor pollicis longus tendons with 3-0 nonabsorbable sutures. The opponens pollicis muscle was repaired. The plantar interosseous muscles of the transplanted toe were attached to the abductor pollicis tendons with 3-0 nonabsorbable sutures. The great saphenous vein was anastomosed to the cephalic vein and the dorsalis pedis artery was anastomosed to the deep branch of the radial artery in the anatomical snuffbox. The superficial branch of the right radial nerve was joined to the dorsal cutaneous nerve of the transplanted toe. A left peroneal artery perforator flap was used to repair the skin defect on the left foot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1753193412449580">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1753193412449580">B</xref>). The musculocutaneous perforating branches of the free peroneal perforator flap were anastomosed to the dorsal artery of the foot, and the accompanying two veins were anastomosed. The defect on the left leg was covered with skin from the lower abdomen skin transfer and the abdominal incision was directly closed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1753193412449580">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1753193412449580">D</xref>).</p>

<p>Three weeks after surgery, the newly transplanted thumb had survived and provided satisfactory hand function and appearance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1753193412449580">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1753193412449580">B</xref>). The donor sites healed well without complications. At 12 weeks after surgery the thumb metacarpal fracture had healed well and the plate was removed. Six months later the patient demonstrated active movement with flexion to 60° and extension to 0° in the metacarpophalangeal joint of the thumb, and flexion to 40° and extension to 0° in the interphalangeal joint. The static two-point discrimination was approximately 7.5 mm. The grip strength was 82% of the normal contralateral hand. The patient was relatively satisfied with the function and appearance of the reconstructed thumb and had returned to his daily routine.</p>

<p>After free transplantation of the second toe with a flap from the dorsum of the foot, there are several options for repair of the donor site. Skin grafting is associated with minimal trauma. However, after a second toe transplantation with the second metatarsal bone, the end of the second metatarsal bone is exposed. The bone needs to be shortened and the forefoot must be closed together for skin grafting, so that the width of the forefoot decreases. This is not conducive to functional recovery of the foot. A local pedicled reverse flap, such as a pedicled reverse saphenous flap or a pedicled reverse lateral tarsal artery flap, can be used to repair the donor site in the foot. Because free transplantation of second toe with a dorsalis pedis flap requires a longer dorsalis pedis artery for vascular anastomosis, the blood supply of the foot is mainly from the plantar artery. The pedicled reverse lateral tarsal artery flap has limitations for repair of the donor site on the foot because the vascular pedicle of the flap is based on the dorsalis pedis artery and the area of skin that can be transferred is therefore smaller. The surgery for the pedicled reverse saphenous flap causes more damage to the tissue of the lower extremity. Finally, free flaps, such as the peroneal perforator flap or an anterolateral thigh flap, are effective in repair of the donor surface on the dorsum of the foot. However, thumb reconstruction by toe transplantation and free flap surgery requires advanced microsurgical techniques and a team of surgeons.</p>
<p>In this case, we had the opportunity to restore the function and a relatively normal appearance of the mangled thumb. The transfer of the free peroneal perforator flap by microvascular anastomosis is a better and more effective method of repairing the donor area on the foot, because it lessens the scarring on the dorsum of the foot and avoids division of the peroneal artery itself. It is reported that a single toe transfer can restore adequate grip function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1753193412449580">Kotkansalo et al., 2011</xref>). The functional results of reconstruction of the thumb in this patient were far better than could be obtained by a prosthetic device.</p>
