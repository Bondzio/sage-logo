<abstract>
<p>Since the enlargement of the European Union in May 2004, large numbers of migrants from the A8 countries (Poland, Czech Republic, Latvia, Lithuania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary and Estonia) have joined the UK labour market. A8 migrants were required to register under the Worker Registration Scheme if they took up employment in the UK for one month or longer. The research presented here analysed this administrative data in order to shed light on spatial, sectoral and temporal trends in registration flows. The findings can help inform understanding of migration patterns, and responses to them, at the national and local levels. The volume of labour migration flows from East-Central Europe has been substantial and has been concentrated in particular segments of the labour market, with most migrants engaging with the hospitality and agricultural sectors and often working through recruitment agencies. The volume of new A8 arrivals has decreased since the onset of the recession in 2008 but still remained substantial at the end of the Worker Registration Scheme period. The demand for migrant labour has been relatively consistent in agriculture compared to other sectors of the economy during the recession. Conceptually this points to migrant labour serving distinct ‘functions’ in the UK labour market.</p>

<p>This research analyses administrative data from the Worker Registration Scheme (WRS). Whilst containing some important limitations, this dataset can shed light on key temporal, spatial and sectoral trends in East-Central European migration to the UK. Since the accession of the A8 countries (Poland, Czech Republic, Latvia, Lithuania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary and Estonia) to the European Union on 1st May 2004 citizens from these countries have had the right to participate in the British labour market. As a consequence of significant disparities in wage levels, large numbers of A8 migrants have come to work in the UK, and in a short space of time East-Central Europe has become one of the principal source regions of migrants to Britain, and nationals from these states now constitute some of the largest foreign-born populations in the country. As part of the so-called seven year ‘transitional measures’ permitted under EU legislation, between 1May 2004 and 30 April 2011 A8 migrants were required to register under the WRS if they wished to take up employment in the UK for a period of one month or longer.</p>
<p>The volume of inflows from the new EU member states has been significant and these flows have been the single biggest wave of foreign in-movement ever experienced by the UK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269094212463301">Bauere et al., 2007</xref>). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0269094212463301">Table 1</xref> shows figures for the top 10 countries in terms of their net migration (immigrants minus emigrants) to the UK 2005–2009. Poland had by far the largest net migration of nationals to UK, with 393,000 more Polish nationals living in the country in 2009 than in 2005. This is over four times as many as Pakistan, the next biggest net source. Four of the top 10 source countries of migrants to the UK were A8 or A2 (Romania and Bulgaria) countries.

<p>Trends in A8 migration have changed over time, with large numbers coming following the accession, and net migration (immigrants minus emigrants) of A8 migrants to the UK peaking at 80,000 in 2007. Since then overall levels of immigration from the A8 countries have dropped. It is estimated that around half of A8 migrants to the UK do not remain over the longer term (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269094212463301">Blanchflower et al., 2007</xref>), and statistics show that outmigration has increased. However, Britain is still gaining more A8 migrants than it is losing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0269094212463301">ONS, 2011b</xref>), and it is estimated that at the beginning of 2009 migrants from these states made up 1.3% of the working age population in the UK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269094212463301">Dustmann et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>This investigation uses the data contained in the WRS to explore the geography of A8 migration to the UK in more detail, investigating the types of labour market sectors that A8 migrants engage in and how this has evolved in the period between 2004 and the global economic recession, which was still on-going when the WRS ended in 2011. The key contribution of this research is that, for the first time, key temporal, spatial and sectoral trends in A8 migration to the UK are captured for the complete seven-year lifespan of the WRS. This article is of relevance to and can inform two established literatures: those considering the economic dimensions of migration per se and the growing body of work within disciplines such as geography, sociology and anthropology as well as economics on the significant inflows of A8 migrants that the UK has received since 2004. The key trends are that East-Central European migrants are concentrated in particular segments of the UK labour market, that inflows declined since the onset of the recession but still remained substantial when the WRS ended in 2011 and that there has been a sectorally differentiated demand for migrant labour during the economic downturn. These insights can help inform understandings of migration patterns, and responses to them, at the national and local government levels.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-0269094212463301"><title>Data and methods of analysis</title>
<sec id="sec3-0269094212463301"><title>The Worker Registration Scheme</title>
<p>At the time of accession of the A8 states in May 2004, the UK was one of only three countries (along with Ireland and Sweden) to permit citizens from these countries unrestricted access to its labour market. The WRS was introduced by the British Government to monitor the flows of migrants from the new ‘Accession 8’ countries entering the UK to take up employment for a period of one month or longer. The Scheme ran for seven years from May 2004 to April 2011.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0269094212463301">1</xref></sup> A8 migrants were required to register under the WRS with the Home Office for an initial fee of £50 (eventually rising to £90) and this process, whilst not imposing any restrictions on the free movement of labour (bar the registration fee), provided the Government and researchers with an important source of labour market information about migrants from the accession countries. The data recorded by the WRS included: nationality, industry, occupation, hours worked, hourly pay, gender and age. WRS applicants had to re-register (at no charge) if they changed employer, or took on an additional job, although substantial numbers did not do so. Thus, each application to the WRS represents one job rather than one applicant. However, to avoid double-counting, each applicant is represented only once in the WRS figures released by the Home Office (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269094212463301">Bauere et al., 2007</xref>). Data are provided by applicants not applications, with each applicant included once with information relating to their first registered job (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269094212463301">Mercia Research and Strategy, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0269094212463301">Worcester Research, 2007</xref>). The WRS thus only provides data on a migrant’s first job in the UK (initial registration) and not their subsequent jobs (re-registrations).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-0269094212463301"><title>The analysis</title>
<p>Data derived from the WRS were analysed in order to investigate seven key trends:
<list id="list1-0269094212463301" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>the origins of A8 nationals;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>the sectoral breakdown of WRS registrations;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>the relative importance of A8 migration to particular sectors of the economy;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>the geographic breakdown of WRS registrations;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>the relative prevalence of A8 migration in regional and local labour markets;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>temporal changes in the volume of WRS registrations;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>the impact of the recession on immigration from East-Central Europe.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-0269094212463301"><title>Some caveats</title>
<p>This analysis uses the WRS because it is the only UK-wide source of statistical information which allows for examination of temporal, spatial and sectoral patterns in A8 migration. However, the WRS data contain some significant limitations which need to be acknowledged. Perhaps its most serious weakness is that the WRS undercounted the actual volume of migrants into the country, partly due to it not recording migrants who were not employed or who were self-employed. Thus the WRS data can only be a source of information on East-Central European labour migration to the UK, rather than source of information on all A8 migration flows. Any analysis has to be seen in that context. However, the WRS also undercounted the volume of labour migrants because not all employed migrants complied with the requirement to register, partly because there were no fines or sanctions for non-compliance. For example, local primary surveys in Scotland found that up to a third of employed A8 migrants were not registered under the WRS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269094212463301">Fife Partnership, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269094212463301">Glasgow City Council, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Another caveat is that migrants were required to register when they started work, but not when they left their job. Thus the WRS only provides data on inflows of migrants. Importantly, it also records only migrants’ initial destination and sector in the UK, as the data provided on WRS registrations relate to applicants and their first registered job rather than to all applications. Thus the results reported below are based on migrants’ first jobs and locations in the UK and do not capture their subsequent geographic or occupational mobility.</p>
<p>Despite these limitations the WRS is worthy of study. Not only does it provide much more detailed information than other administrative sources (such as National Insurance Number allocations) but, unlike local surveys, it permits UK-wide analysis of temporal, spatial and sectoral trends in A8 migration patterns.</p>

<sec id="sec7-0269094212463301"><title>Origins of A8 nationals</title>
<p>The WRS contains information on the origins of A8 nationals to the UK. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0269094212463301">Figure 1</xref> shows the breakdown by nationality of all WRS registrations May 2004–April 2011 for the UK. As might be expected Poland, being the most populous of the A8 countries, is by far the biggest sender of East-Central European migrants. Lithuania, Latvia and Slovakia are the next most significant sending countries, whereas relatively few immigrants arrived from Slovenia and Estonia.

<p><italic>Source</italic>: Author’s analysis of WRS.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0269094212463301-fig1.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0269094212463301">Figure 2</xref> demonstrates how the relative proportion of migrants from the A8 countries has changed over time between April 2006 and April 2011. Most A8 migrants came from Poland throughout the whole period during which the WRS was in operation. However, it is interesting to note the decline over time in the share of A8 migrants coming from Poland. Between 2006 and 2008 over 70% of WRS registrations were Poles. The share of A8 nationals coming from other countries increased over time, and from mid-2009 onwards fewer than 50% of registrations were of Poles. The countries which have increased their share of A8 migrants most in recent years were Lithuania, Latvia and Hungary. The rapid increase in inflows from these countries and relative decline of numbers arriving from Poland may be related to labour market circumstances in these countries. States such as Latvia and Lithuania have been particularly negatively affected by the global economic downturn whereas the Polish economy has performed relatively well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269094212463301">Aslund, 2010</xref>). The nature of labour market opportunities in the A8 countries is likely to be a significant ‘push’ factor in relation to migration to the UK.

</sec>
<sec id="sec8-0269094212463301"><title>Labour market profile of A8 migrants</title>
<p>A total of 1,133,950 registrations were recorded over the lifetime of the WRS (1 May 2004 to 30 April 2011). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0269094212463301">Figure 3</xref> displays the sectoral breakdown of all registrations. At first glance, a very large volume of A8 migrants appear to have worked in the administration, business and management sector (42.8% of all registrations). However, the high figure in this grouping is a consequence of the way that registrations were categorised in the WRS. Most of the migrants categorised within this sector were employed by recruitment agencies, which are classified as belonging to the administration, business and management sector. However, these migrants’ employment, to a large part, involved working in other parts of the economy, such as agriculture, food processing or hospitality for example (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269094212463301">Home Office, 2009</xref>). Apart from this ambiguous grouping, the next most significant sectors in terms of A8 employment were hospitality and catering (17.4% of all registrations), agriculture (9.6%), manufacturing (6.4%) and food processing (5.5%).
<fig id="fig3-0269094212463301" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>WRS registrations May 2004–April 2011 by sector.</p>
<p>Source: Author’s analysis of WRS data.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0269094212463301-fig3.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p>The concentration of registrations in sectors such as hospitality and catering and with recruitment agencies suggest that A8 migrants predominantly entered employment in the UK in forms of employment that were accessible to them, given the relatively low skill nature of many of the jobs in these sectors, and often used agencies as a means of connecting with employment opportunities in the British labour market (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269094212463301">Geddes and Scott, 2010</xref>). Agency work, agricultural jobs and back-of-house hospitality roles may be the most accessible forms of employment for those lacking sufficient English language skills or recognised qualifications or experience to obtain employment in other, more ‘desirable’ parts of the labour market. There is a high incidence of temporary work and agency working amongst recent migrants and in jobs at the bottom end of the labour market (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269094212463301">Jayaweera and Anderson, 2008</xref>), with employers valuing the ‘flexibility’ that this source of labour affords them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0269094212463301">Thommes and Weiland, 2010</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec9-0269094212463301"><title>Relative significance of A8 migration across different sectors</title>
<p>The analysis described above reveals the aggregate number of WRS registrations in various sectors of the UK labour market. In this section estimates are given of the relative importance of A8 migration to particular parts of the economy. These are produced by comparing the total number of registrations May 2004–April 2011 in a given sector by the total number of employees working in that sector in 2011. These crude calculations are not intended as detailed estimates of the specific proportion of A8 migrants in each sector but to hint at the relative importance of A8 migrants to key sectors of the economy. The results of these calculations are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0269094212463301">Table 3</xref>. Registrations in the ‘administration, business and management’ category are not included in this analysis since these are mostly agency workers engaged in a variety of industries and not employees actually working in this sector.

</table-wrap></p>
<p>What is perhaps most striking about the findings is the extent to which A8 migrants form a relatively significant proportion of the UK agricultural workforce. Less than 1% of all jobs in Britain are in agriculture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0269094212463301">ONS, 2011a</xref>), yet the data suggest that up to a quarter of all employees in this sector in 2011 could have been A8 workers. This finding ties in with previous analysis of WRS registrations and the belief that the agribusiness sector is particularly reliant on migrant labour as employers in this industry perennially struggle to source labour domestically, even in times of recession (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269094212463301">Findlay et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269094212463301">McCollum and Findlay 2011a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269094212463301">2011b</xref>). A8 migrants also constituted a relatively significant part of the hospitality workforce, perhaps reflecting employers’ use of migrant labour in response to labour shortages in this sector prior to the recession.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec10-0269094212463301"><title>The geography of A8 migration: Government Office Region level</title>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0269094212463301">Figure 4</xref> shows the total number of WRS registrations May 2004–April 2011 as disaggregated by Government Office Region. The regions with the greatest inflows of migrants were the more economically buoyant labour markets such as London, the South-East and East of England. The North-East, Wales and Northern Ireland are the regions which received the fewest A8 migrants. This may be expected since these regions have relatively low resident populations generally and are geographically and economically peripheral parts of the country, which may mean that they are seen as less attractive destinations than areas such as the buoyant South-East of England.

<p>As with the sectoral analysis, the relative significance of A8 migration to particular regions of the UK can be estimated by comparing the total volume of registrations May 2004–April 2011 against the number of workforce jobs in each region in 2010 (the most recent data available at the time of analysis). These calculations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0269094212463301">Figure 5</xref>) show that regions such as the East Midlands and East of England received high numbers of registrations and that A8 migrants made up relatively large proportions of their workforces. The North-East and Wales received low numbers of registrations and in these areas A8 migrants made up relatively minor segments of their workforces. On the other hand Northern Ireland had few registrations, but these migrants made up a relatively significant part of their workforce. These estimations point towards a more complex geography of A8 migration than is initially apparent when one looks at absolute numbers of WRS registrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0269094212463301">Figure 4</xref>), meaning that it is worth exploring the pattern of migration at more subtle spatial scales than regions.

<sec id="sec11-0269094212463301"><title>The geography of A8 migration: Local authority level</title>
<p>The WRS also allows for analysis of registrations at the local authority level. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0269094212463301">Table 4</xref> displays lists of the ‘top 10’ local authorities in terms of total WRS registrations May 2004–April 2011 along with estimates of the proportion of their workforces that are A8 migrants. The local authorities with the greatest inflows of A8 migrants are a mix of metropolitan boroughs (Westminster, Camden, Birmingham, Leeds and Edinburgh) and towns and rural areas such as Northampton, Peterborough, Herefordshire and Boston. This mixture is a notable fixture of A8 migration to Britain. Unlike many previous waves of immigration, the initial destinations of East-Central European migrants have been remarkably geographically dispersed as opposed to being centred on major conurbations with an existing history of receiving immigrants. For example, analysis has shown that the historical settlement pattern of Black, Minority and Ethnic (BME) migrants is noticeably dissimilar to the geography of WRS registrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269094212463301">Local Government Association, 2007</xref>). The final column in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0269094212463301">Table 4</xref> identifies the local authorities with the biggest inflows of A8 migrants relative to their labour force size. This time the ‘top 10’ is dominated by rural local authorities where labour-intensive arable farming is an important part of the local economy. In line with the sectoral analysis, it is reasonable to infer that A8 migrants constitute an important part of the UK’s seasonal crop production workforce and that this is reflected in the geography of A8 migration.

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0269094212463301">Figure 6</xref> shows the volume of quarterly WRS registrations from April 2006 to April 2011. What is most noticeable is the steady drop off in registrations from late 2007 onwards. The steep drop off from late 2010 may be a consequence of fewer new migrants registering as the end of the seven year transitional measures neared.

</fig></p>
<p>The downward trend in A8 migrants coming to the UK in line with the recession, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0269094212463301">Figure 6</xref>, is in marked contrast to the significant inflows observed in the years immediately following the A8 accession. What is interesting however is that large numbers of A8 migrants have nevertheless continued to enter the UK at a time of rising unemployment. There were 416,755 new registrations between January 2008 and the ending of the WRS in April 2011 and although some A8 migrants undoubtedly left following the start of the recession, the UK still gained more A8 migrants than it lost throughout this period (ONS, 2011b). Based on these trends, it is worth considering why immigration to the UK from the A8 countries has continued despite Britain being in recession and experiencing declining employment rates.</p>
<p>One reason for overseas workers continuing to arrive is the so-called ‘complementary’ nature of much of the work undertaken by A8 migrants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0269094212463301">Tamas and Munz, 2006</xref>). A body of evidence indicates that many migrants accept jobs in the UK that employers find hard to fill from the domestic labour market (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269094212463301">Cangiano et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0269094212463301">Rogaly, 2008</xref>), even during periods of economic downturn. Although agriculture, like other sectors of the economy, has been affected by the recession, demand for migrant labour remains because of the labour intensive production systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0269094212463301">Rogaly, 2008</xref>). In industries such as agribusiness migrant labour is therefore complementary to the UK labour force, and thus during the recession the stock of A8 workers has not decreased significantly. The spatially concentrated nature of these production systems has in turn produced geographically uneven patterns of migrant labour demand during the recession (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269094212463301">Findlay et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269094212463301">McCollum and Findlay, 2011b</xref>).</p>
<p>The second quarter of 2008 is widely seen as the last quarter of ‘normal’ economic activity before the onset of the recession. ONS records this as the quarter that saw an end to 16 years of unbroken GDP growth, followed by an increase in the unemployment claimant count and redundancy levels and a fall in job vacancy levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269094212463301">ONS, 2009b</xref>). By quarter two of 2009 the economy was at the lowest point of the recession and new WRS registrations were in a trough. Thereafter the decline in the fortunes of the economy began to slow and WRS registrations picked up slightly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269094212463301">ONS, 2009a</xref>). In order to analyse the overall effects of the recession on migration in more detail, new migrant registrations in the second quarter of 2008 are compared with those of the second quarter of 2009.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0269094212463301">Table 5</xref> shows the change in WRS registrations between 2008 (quarter two) and 2009 (quarter two) for the top 10 sectors in which A8 migrants were employed. All of these sectors recorded a drop in new WRS registrations, but the level of contraction was uneven. When the overall rate of decline in new registrations (all sectors) of 43.8% was compared with the decline in each individual sector, it was found that the recession resulted in a disproportionately large reduction in new A8 migrants in the real estate and construction sectors compared to the overall trend. When compared using Chi-square tests, the difference between observed and expected reductions in the transport and manufacturing sectors, as well as real estate and construction, were also shown to be statistically significant from what would be expected had the change in registrations been uniformly distributed across all sectors. Conversely, there was a much lower than expected reduction in the inflow of migrants to the agricultural and food processing sectors. There is therefore not a straightforward correlation between aggregate labour market conditions and demand for migrant labour. This finding has implications for how the relationship between business cycles and international labour migration is understood (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269094212463301">Findlay et al., 2010</xref> for discussion of the drivers of differentiated sectoral demand for migrant labour in the economy).

<p>Since the enlargement of the EU in 2004, large numbers of migrants from the A8 countries have elected to participate in the UK labour market. The research described in this report analysed administrative data from the WRS to shed light on spatial, sectoral and temporal trends in these significant flows. Migrants from the A8 countries were required to register under the WRS if they took up employment in the UK for a period of one month or longer between May 2004 and April 2011, meaning that this dataset represents a uniquely detailed source of information on East-Central European migration to the UK from the accession to the recent recession. Despite its limitations (such as the fact that self-employed and non-employed migrants were not required to register, and that many employed migrants did not register under it), the WRS is the only dataset which allows for analysis of the initial labour market characteristics of A8 labour migrants at the national scale and at lower geographies and which allows for consideration of change over time.</p>
<p>The analysis has confirmed that the volume of labour migration flows from East-Central Europe was substantial, with well over a million WRS registrations approved between May 2004 and April 2011. These labour migration patterns have been linked to specific segments of the British labour market, with most A8 workers engaging with the hospitality and agriculture sectors and often working through recruitment agencies as opposed to directly for employers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0269094212463301">Figure 3</xref>). The concentration of registrations in these categories may be a consequence of the ‘entry-level’ nature of many of the jobs in these sectors, meaning that they represent the easiest route into work for many newly arrived migrants. Agency work, agricultural jobs and back of house hospitality roles may be the most accessible forms of employment for those lacking sufficient English language skills or recognised qualifications or experience to obtain employment in other, more ‘desirable’, parts of the labour market.</p>
<p>Another important finding from the research was that A8 migrants constitute a substantial part of the UK’s agricultural and hospitality workforces (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0269094212463301">Table 3</xref>). Sectoral analysis of the change in WRS registrations over the recession points towards continued demand for migrant labour in the agribusiness sector relative to other parts of the economy (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0269094212463301">Table 5</xref>). These trends lead to the supposition that employers in other sectors drew on migrant workers as a flexible source of labour to supplement existing labour supplies in the economic boom times prior to the recession, but with the onset of the economic downturn the requirement to turn to migrant labour to fill labour and skills shortages has to a large extent diminished. However, in the agribusiness sector employers can struggle to source labour regardless of prevailing economic conditions, hence the relatively strong and continued demand for migrant labour into the recession (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269094212463301">McCollum and Findlay, 2011a</xref>).</p>
<p>These trends are observable when one considers the geography of A8 migration to the UK. In terms of absolute numbers of registrations largely urbanised regions and urban local authorities were often the most popular destinations for migrants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0269094212463301">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0269094212463301">Table 4</xref>). However, A8 migrants appear to constitute the most significant proportions of the workforces of rural local authorities, especially in the arable farmland areas in East England and the East Midlands (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0269094212463301">Table 4</xref>). The seasonal aspect of agricultural and hospitality jobs has implications for how local authorities plan services for A8 migrants. The cyclical nature of recruitment and employment in these sectors is likely to result in relatively transient migrant worker populations, often in rural areas (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269094212463301">Green et al., 2009</xref>). This remoteness and the high rate of ‘churn’ in these sectors are likely to present particular challenges for local authorities seeking to engage with and provide services for East-Central European workers. Another challenge for policy makers will be provision for the non-working migrants who are family members of the WRS registered workers documented in this analysis. In a study of A8 migrants in Liverpool, around half were in partnerships and around a quarter had children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0269094212463301">Scullion and Morris, 2009</xref>). At the UK level around 14% of A8 migrant workers had at least one dependent (non-working partner or child) with them when they registered under the WRS, i.e. upon or soon after arriving in the UK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269094212463301">Glossop and Shaheen, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The analysis of the WRS also shows clear impacts of the recession in terms of the volume and nature of migration flows from the A8 countries to Britain. The overall volume of registrations declined markedly in a way that mirrored the onset of recession and worsening of the UK labour market conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0269094212463301">Figure 6</xref>). This may be expected since the recession would have resulted in a decline in the demand for workers from overseas since the quantity and quality of the labour pool locally available to employers would have increased with rising unemployment levels. This development is reflected in the finding that the number of WRS registrations fell in all of the sectors analysed (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0269094212463301">Table 5</xref>).</p>
<p>However, the volume of new registrations varied across different sectors and substantial numbers of migrants from the A8 countries continued to arrive in the UK despite its economy being in recession. Quarterly WRS registrations remained in excess of 20,000 throughout the economic downturn (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0269094212463301">Figure 6</xref>). The continued migration of A8 nationals to the UK may be due to continued demand for migrant labour in particular locations and parts of the economy in spite of the recession. In line with this theory, WRS registrations have remained relatively steady in the agriculture sector (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0269094212463301">Table 5</xref>). Qualitative research with employers and recruitment agencies in this industry imply that this part of the economy struggles to attract indigenous labour regardless of prevailing economic conditions and is thus reliant on migrant labour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269094212463301">McCollum and Findlay, 2011a</xref>). Conceptually this points to migrant labour serving a ‘complementary’ function in the agricultural sector and a ‘substitutional’ role relative to domestic labour in other parts of the economy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269094212463301">Findlay et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>This analysis has shed light on a very significant recently emerging immigration flow to the UK. It is hoped that this work can contribute to both our specific understanding of the nature of A8 migration trends to the UK and the more general relationship between international labour market migration and recessionary circumstances. This research can potentially inform how immigration policy and how local authorities respond to flows. For example, the analysis has shown the parts of the country and economy which have high and low absolute inflows of A8 migrants and their relative significance to regional and local labour markets and segments of the economy. The relative estimates may prove more useful for local authorities than relying on absolute numbers of registrations alone. For example, they could help organisations to ‘target’ their resources and support services towards particular locations or industrial sectors. Local authorities and other organisations such as colleges can play an important role in helping migrants advance in the labour market, particularly if they are under-employed in the UK. This could be achieved through enhanced provision of and accessibility to services such as English language classes. For example, English as a Second Language (ESL) classes often run at times and locations which made it difficult for workers to fit them round their working hours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269094212463301">Cook et al., 2010</xref>). Many local authorities are developing strategic responses to migration in order to sustain and grow their populations to counteract the challenges of an ageing population and to develop their local economies. Building a strong local population evidence base is an important element of these efforts and it is hoped that this analysis represents a useful contribution in this respect.</p>
<p>The research identified the agricultural sector as being reliant on migrant labour in spite of recession and high UK unemployment levels. This has implications for how the Government might legislate for short-term immigration to address seasonal spikes in demand for labour in the agribusiness sector. The Seasonal Agricultural Workers Scheme (SAWS) currently permits Romanians and Bulgarians to enter the UK and work on farms on a short-term basis. However, in 2011 only 21,250 SAWS permits were issued and the future of the scheme is uncertain. These findings could potentially be used to argue for continued or even extended provision for agribusinesses to draw on seasonal migrant labour. This is of importance because farmers in the UK report labour shortages, even with A8 workers potentially available to them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269094212463301">Local Government Association, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Conceptually, the research, in identifying and considering the uneven effects of recession on immigration patterns, has aided understanding of the nature of the relationship between international labour migration and business cycles. East-Central European migration has been shown to serve two distinct labour market functions. In most cases migrants act as a flexible supply of labour that can be drawn on in times of economic boom when labour demand exceeds local labour supply. The demand for migrant labour serving this function is highly sensitive to business cycles since recession results in immigrants no longer being required to boost labour supply (this was shown to be the case in sectors such as construction, see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0269094212463301">Table 5</xref>). In sectors where employers find it difficult to source labour regardless of prevailing economic conditions overseas workers form a more important if not core part of the workforce. Demand for this ‘complementary’ labour is, in turn, less sensitive to recession.</p>
<p>Despite its significant flaws the WRS formed the basis of this research as it represents the only dataset that permits analysis of spatial, sectoral and temporal trends in A8 migration flows to Britain. The results from the latest decennial UK national census (held in 2011) should be available in the near future. This will contain a wealth of information for researchers on A8 migrants since the census contains much more detailed information than the WRS and has much wider coverage as it surveys the whole population and not just those East-Central Europeans who were employed and completed a WRS form. A valuable piece of future research in this respect would be analysis which sets out the socio-demographic and labour market profile of citizens from the A8 states in Britain and compares their labour market profile against other migrant groups and the workforce generally.</p>
