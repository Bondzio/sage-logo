<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Schizophrenia is a severe form of mental illness affecting about 7 per 1000 adults globally. Although the incidence is low, the prevalence of schizophrenia is high as it is a long-term chronic illness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-2045125312474019">World Health Organization, 2011</xref>]. Antipsychotic medication plays an important role in schizophrenia treatment and symptom control. Effective management of schizophrenia requires continuous long-term treatment in order to keep symptoms under control and to prevent relapse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2045125312474019">American Psychiatric Association, 2006</xref>]. Despite the critical importance of medication, nonadherence to prescribed drug treatments has been recognized as a problem worldwide and may be the most challenging aspect of treating patients with schizophrenia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-2045125312474019">World Health Organization, 2003</xref>]. Data from the Clinical Antipsychotic Trials of Intervention Effectiveness (CATIE) study showed that 74% of patients had discontinued medication within 18 months due to insufficient efficacy, intolerable side effects or for other reasons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-2045125312474019">Lieberman, 2005</xref>].</p>
<p>Nonadherence to medication includes a range of patient behaviours, from treatment refusal to irregular use or partial change of daily medication doses. Partial adherence to medication is at least as frequent as complete nonadherence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-2045125312474019">Svestka and Bitter, 2007</xref>]. There is no single theory that explains adherence issues, but rather a range of theories with their own strengths and limitations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-2045125312474019">Weiden, 2007</xref>]. Potential factors for nonadherence may be related to disease severity, treatment characteristics or even external environmental factors such as therapeutic support [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-2045125312474019">Llorca, 2008</xref>]. Adherence factors may also be unique to the characteristics of schizophrenia; factors such as cognitive impairment or lack of illness insight may play an important role. A recent retrospective database study in schizophrenia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-2045125312474019">Liu-Seifert, 2012</xref>] found that the best predictor of good adherence was a significant improvement in positive symptoms, hostility and depressive symptoms, regardless of treatment.</p>
<p>Nonadherence to medication has a negative impact on the course of illness resulting in relapse, rehospitalization, longer time to remission, and attempted suicide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-2045125312474019">Leucht and Heres, 2006</xref>]. A recent retrospective database study which analysed data from 861 patients in Sweden [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2045125312474019">Boden, 2011</xref>] linked nonadherence to antipsychotic medication shortly after discharge to early rehospitalization. The consequences of nonadherence contribute to the already high costs of the disease to healthcare systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-2045125312474019">Knapp <italic>et al</italic>. 2004</xref>]. Thus, nonadherence can have a substantial negative impact on patients’ health and functioning as well as a financial impact on society. Reducing nonadherence to antipsychotic medications has the potential to reduce psychiatric morbidity and costs of care substantially. That would improve the welfare of patients with schizophrenia and reduce the use of resources for acute psychotic episodes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2045125312474019">Byerly <italic>et al</italic>. 2007</xref>]. Therefore it is important to identify the key factors contributing to nonadherence in schizophrenia, and their consequences. In addition, assessing causes and consequences of nonadherence together may highlight the importance and complexity of adherence to medication in schizophrenia. However, we are not aware of any comprehensive review of both the causes and consequences of nonadherence in schizophrenia. Furthermore, there is a need for a review that investigates whether the data allow for a quantitative assessment of the specific link between nonadherence and hospitalization.</p>
<p>The objective of this study was to perform a systematic review of the factors that influence adherence in schizophrenia and of the consequences of nonadherence for the patient, healthcare system and society. Particular attention was given to the effect of nonadherence on hospitalization rates, as a key driver of increased costs of care.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-2045125312474019" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>A systematic literature review was conducted to include English-language manuscripts published from 2000 in OVID. Four electronic databases (MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process, EMBASE and the Cochrane Library) were searched to identify potentially relevant articles. Conference abstracts were not included in this review. The search combined free text and medical subject headings (MeSH) disease terms with adherence terms for psychosis or schizophrenia AND adherence or compliance or persistence. As the outcomes of interest included all factors and consequences of nonadherence, no search terms were included for specific outcomes, as this may have resulted in missing some outcomes. One search was conducted for both sets of outcomes. Thus a very broad search strategy was adopted in order to avoid missing potentially relevant information, with the identification of relevant studies per outcome (i.e. nonadherence drivers or consequences) based on abstract screening [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-2045125312474019">Liberati <italic>et al</italic>. 2009</xref>].</p>
<p>The abstract screening for identification of relevant data was based on the following predefined criteria: populations comprising adult patients with schizophrenia and disorders with psychotic features, psychosis and schizophrenia spectrum disorders; oral antipsychotic interventions were included, and subanalysis of the impact on adherence on hospitalization rates focused on studies of oral interventions comparing once daily dosing with multiple daily dosing; studies were excluded based on comparison if they were comparing interventions or drugs which were not of interest; outcomes including factors influencing adherence rates and consequences of nonadherence; study designs including phase II or III randomized controlled trials, observational studies such as prospective and retrospective studies, cross-sectional questionnaire-based studies, economic and epidemiologic studies, meta-analyses and qualitative reviews; and a focus on studies with larger sample sizes and more recent publications (publications after 2001) due to the large expected number of studies identified.</p>
<p>Two research facets were assessed qualitatively: drivers of nonadherence and consequences of nonadherence. In addition, for a particular consequence of nonadherence, namely hospitalization, the feasibility of quantitative meta-analysis was assessed for the link between nonadherence and hospitalization.</p>

<title>Study selection</title>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-2045125312474019">Figure 1</xref> presents the flow chart of identified studies. The OVID search identified 3832 abstracts for screening. Due to the large number of abstracts identified and the need to answer three different research questions, the first stage of screening involved sorting the abstracts according to the three outcomes of interest: drivers of nonadherence, consequences of nonadherence, and studies on nonadherence and hospitalization rate. During this first screening, any abstracts that clearly did not match the inclusion criteria were also excluded. Thus in the second, outcome-specific, phase of screening, there were 149 potentially relevant abstracts on drivers, 408 on consequences and 109 on hospitalization due to nonadherence. There were 37 full papers included in total: 15 studies on nonadherence drivers and 22 on consequences of nonadherence, of which 12 focused on the specific link between nonadherence and hospitalization. A quantitative meta-analysis was not performed for the link between nonadherence and hospitalization, due to lack of data on comparable outcome measure. Thus, a qualitative approach was taken for all outcomes.</p>

In fact, the survey involving clinical experts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-2045125312474019">Velligan <italic>et al</italic>. 2009</xref>] rated poor illness insight as the most important factor contributing to nonadherence. Another cross-sectional study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2045125312474019">Aldebot and de Mamani, 2009</xref>] reported that individuals who dealt with the stress of their illness by ignoring their illness or the magnitude of their symptoms were less adherent to their medication. The author hypothesized that patients who refused to accept being ill may not believe that their symptoms are something that can be managed, and thus, may be less motivated to take steps to resolve their symptoms, such as taking medication.

The higher rates of adherence observed with clozapine could be explained by superior efficacy or the requirements for close monitoring when using clozapine.</p>

Another retrospective database study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-2045125312474019">Valenstein <italic>et al</italic>. 2002</xref>] which analysed data from 67,079 patients and measured adherence by MPR found that patients with MPR less than 80% had a significantly higher hospitalization rate compared with adherent patients (OR 2.4; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001). For patients with a MPR over 120%, hospitalization rates were significantly higher compared with adherent patients (i.e. MPR close to 100%; OR 3.0; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001).

<p>In all other studies, there was heterogeneity in definition of adherence and measures of adherence used, such as medication gap, consistency, persistency and other subjective measures such as surveys.

<p>Suicide is one of the leading causes of premature death in patients with schizophrenia, but it is highly preventable. Nonadherence to antipsychotic medication is one of the risk factors for the development of suicidal behaviour in patients with schizophrenia. Four reviews [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-2045125312474019">Leucht and Heres, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-2045125312474019">Llorca, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-2045125312474019">Svestka and Bitter, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-2045125312474019">Velligan <italic>et al</italic>. 2009</xref>] looked into suicide rates as a result of nonadherence and reported a trend where nonadherence was related to a significant increase in the risk of suicide. A review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-2045125312474019">Leucht and Heres, 2006</xref>] reported that nonadherence to schizophrenia medication increases the risk of suicide fourfold (relative risk adjusted for age and gender 4.2, 95% CI 1.7–10.1) while another review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-2045125312474019">Llorca, 2008</xref>] reported that nonadherent patients (documented refusal of oral or depot injection) were at seven times greater risk of suicide.</p>

<p>Nonadherence may cause psychotic symptoms in patients, thus leading to serious consequences. One review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2045125312474019">Byerly <italic>et al</italic>. 2007</xref>] reported that repeated psychotic relapses, particularly in the early stages of the illness, may worsen the course and prognosis of the patient, as it may result in resistance to antipsychotic medications and to the development of chronic psychotic symptoms.</p>

<title>Consequences to healthcare systems</title>
<p>Nonadherence to medication can lead to relapse, which can mean more visits to the emergency room, rehospitalizations and increased need for clinician intervention – all of which lead to increased costs to healthcare systems.</p>
<p>A large multisite prospective study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2045125312474019">Ascher-Svanum <italic>et al</italic>. 2006</xref>] which included 1906 patients concluded that nonadherence was significantly associated with poorer outcomes, including a greater risk of psychiatric hospitalizations and use of emergency psychiatric services. Compared with adherent patients, those who were not adherent during the first year were more likely to be hospitalized in the following 2 years (OR 1.55; 95% CI 1.21–1.98) and more likely to use emergency psychiatric services in the following 2 years (OR 1.49; 95% CI 1.12–1.98). These were all drivers of direct medical cost. A survey study of 95 patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-2045125312474019">Rittmannsberger <italic>et al</italic>. 2004</xref>] reported that nonadherent patients were hospitalized for significantly longer periods than adherent patients. In a large retrospective database study which analysed data from 67,709 patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-2045125312474019">Valenstein <italic>et al</italic>. 2002</xref>], patients with poor adherence were 2.4 (95% CI 2.3–2.6) times more likely to be admitted to the hospital during the study year than patients with good adherence. Poor adherence during the outpatient periods in the study was also associated with psychiatric admissions in the following year. Patients reporting nonadherence were predicted to have excess inpatient costs of approximately £2500 (around €2000) per year in a survey study conducted in the UK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-2045125312474019">Knapp <italic>et al</italic>. 2004</xref>]. In this study, predicted excess total service costs for patients reporting nonadherence was over £5000 per year compared with total costs for adherent patients.</p>
<p>A retrospective database study which analysed data from 35,815 patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-2045125312474019">Marcus and Olfson, 2008</xref>] reported that the fraction of acute care inpatient admissions attributable to not receiving antipsychotic medications was 12.3% (95% CI 11.7–12.6%) and the fraction of inpatient days attributable to not receiving antipsychotic medication was 13.1% (95% CI 9.8–16.5%) when a 15-day gap in the prescription record was used. Therefore, improving adherence by eliminating gaps in antipsychotic medication treatment could lower the number of acute care admissions and inpatient days.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Antipsychotic medication is recognized as an essential component in the treatment of schizophrenia, and adherence to medication plays a critical role in preventing symptoms and costly relapses. This study therefore reviewed the main factors and consequences of nonadherence based on 37 full papers.</p>
<p>Several patient-related factors may contribute to increasing or decreasing medication adherence. The evidence suggests that sociodemographic factors such as gender [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2045125312474019">Acosta <italic>et al</italic>. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-2045125312474019">Linden <italic>et al</italic>. 2001</xref>] and family/marital status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2045125312474019">Acosta <italic>et al</italic>. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-2045125312474019">Linden <italic>et al</italic>. 2001</xref>] do not influence adherence as the association between nonadherence and these variables were not significant in most studies.

The author of this study mentions that the contrary finding may be due to the selection of patients with expected better adherence.

<p>Treatment-related factors were also reviewed. Patients and experts reported adverse events to be a barrier to adherence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-2045125312474019">Hudson <italic>et al</italic>. 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-2045125312474019">Loffler <italic>et al</italic>. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-2045125312474019">Velligan <italic>et al</italic>. 2009</xref>]. However, in two studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-2045125312474019">Linden <italic>et al</italic>. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-2045125312474019">Rettenbacher <italic>et al</italic>. 2004</xref>] adherence was good despite the presence of adverse events. Due to the mixed results, it is difficult to make a conclusion on the causal relation between adverse events and nonadherence. Patients who were on atypical agents tended to have better adherence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-2045125312474019">Valenstein <italic>et al</italic>. 2004</xref>]. However, this may be related to other factors; different patient characteristics using atypical agents as opposed to typical agents or treatment monitoring that is required for the use of a specific drug. Given these confounding factors, conclusions about adherence and type of antipsychotic remain challenging.</p>
<p>External or environment-related factors included relationship with physician, stigma of disease, living situation and family support. The evidence suggests that a therapeutic relationship with monitoring and guidance in drug intake are important contributors to good adherence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-2045125312474019">Loffler <italic>et al</italic>. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-2045125312474019">Rettenbacher <italic>et al</italic>. 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-2045125312474019">Velligan <italic>et al</italic>. 2009</xref>]. Other environmental factors that influence adherence positively include family or social support [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-2045125312474019">Velligan <italic>et al</italic>. 2009</xref>] and greater social activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-2045125312474019">Novick <italic>et al</italic>. 2010</xref>]. Stigma of taking medication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-2045125312474019">Hudson <italic>et al</italic>. 2004</xref>] and lack of social support [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-2045125312474019">Hudson <italic>et al</italic>. 2004</xref>] were found to negatively influence adherence.</p>
<p>There are serious consequences, such as hospitalization and suicide, associated with nonadherence to treatment. Studies consistently showed that nonadherence was significantly associated with poorer outcomes, including greater risk of hospitalization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2045125312474019">Ahn <italic>et al</italic>. 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2045125312474019">Ascher-Svanum <italic>et al</italic>. 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2045125312474019">Eaddy <italic>et al</italic>. 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2045125312474019">Gilmer <italic>et al</italic>. 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-2045125312474019">Kozma and Weiden, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-2045125312474019">Law <italic>et al</italic>. 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-2045125312474019">Morken <italic>et al</italic>. 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-2045125312474019">Svarstad <italic>et al</italic>. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-2045125312474019">Valenstein <italic>et al</italic>. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-2045125312474019">Weiden <italic>et al</italic>. 2004a</xref>], greater use of emergency services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2045125312474019">Ascher-Svanum <italic>et al</italic>. 2006</xref>], longer length of hospital stay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-2045125312474019">Rittmannsberger <italic>et al</italic>. 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-2045125312474019">Valenstein <italic>et al</italic>. 2002</xref>] and greater risk of suicide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-2045125312474019">Leucht and Heres, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-2045125312474019">Llorca, 2008</xref>]. The consequences to society included having to deal with the consequences of violence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2045125312474019">Ascher-Svanum <italic>et al</italic>. 2006</xref>], substance abuse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2045125312474019">Ascher-Svanum <italic>et al</italic>. 2006</xref>] and criminal behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2045125312474019">Ascher-Svanum <italic>et al</italic>. 2006</xref>]. Thus, improving adherence is likely to reduce medical costs as well as societal costs.</p>
<p>The most recent comprehensive review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-2045125312474019">Velligan <italic>et al</italic>. 2009</xref>] on nonadherence in schizophrenia, which involved both a literature review and experts’ ratings on the findings in the literature, found that poor insight and lack of illness awareness, a belief that medications are no longer needed, and lack of treatment efficacy were key factors that contributed to adherence problems. In that survey, experts gave more prominence to side effects as a contributor to adherence problems than has been reported in surveys of patients and other studies in the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-2045125312474019">Velligan <italic>et al</italic>. 2009</xref>]. Lack of disease insight is also found to be an important driver of poor adherence in our review. Yet for medication side effects, we found mixed results; in fact, two studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-2045125312474019">Linden <italic>et al</italic>. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-2045125312474019">Rettenbacher <italic>et al</italic>. 2004</xref>] found that adherent patients experienced more adverse events than nonadherent patients. Hence the literature does not seem to fully support the experts’ view that side effects are highly important for nonadherence.</p>
<p>For the consequences of nonadherence, another recent review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-2045125312474019">Llorca, 2008</xref>] reported that nonadherence and partial adherence can set in motion a ‘downward spiral’ of events resulting in inconsistent symptom control, relapse and rehospitalization, which in turn can lead to long-term functional disabilities, loss of autonomy, education or employment possibilities, homelessness, a likelihood of dropping out of care completely and even suicide. A clear link between nonadherence and an increased risk of hospitalization is found in our review; we also found support for the link between poor medication adherence and suicide risk.</p>
<p>This review is associated with at least three limitations. A first limitation of this review relates to the fact that there was heterogeneity in the definition of adherence and methods to measure medication adherence. Some studies used objective measures such as MEMS and medication gaps while others used subjective methods such as patient self-report questionnaires and patient interviews. Thus, it was difficult to compare results and make systematic conclusions. Second, study designs varied considerably, including prospective studies, retrospective data analyses and cross-sectional surveys. With different study designs, comparison of results becomes difficult. Third, due to the large amount of data identified, one criterion for inclusion in this review was study quality as measured by study size and design, which can be subjective, and recent publications were prioritized.</p>
<p>Despite these limitations, this is the first study, to our knowledge, to systematically and comprehensively explore both the factors and consequences of nonadherence in schizophrenia, with a particular focus on the link between nonadherence and hospitalization rates.</p>
<p>Our review found a large amount of heterogeneity in the definition and methods used to assess medication adherence. Thus, there is a great need for future research to use a consistent definition and measure of adherence in patients with schizophrenia in order to enable an unbiased and meaningful comparison of results. Moreover, additional large, prospective adherence studies would allow us to assess the causes of nonadherence with greater accuracy as the same patients are observed over time.</p>
<p>Our systematic review identified a wide range of factors and consequences of poor adherence in schizophrenia. Based on the evidence found, the most frequently reported driver and consequence of nonadherence appeared to be the lack of illness insight and greater risk of hospitalization, respectively. Factors positively related to adherence included a good therapeutic relationship with physician and perceiving the benefits of medication. Practicing physicians should be aware of the importance of building a therapeutic relationship with the patient based on trust as well as educating the patient on the medication’s impact on the symptoms and illness. Considering the substantial burden of nonadherence in schizophrenia on patients and society as a whole, improved adherence in schizophrenia is of great value to patients and society. As our review shows, nonadherence is a complex behavioural issue; therefore measures will need to address nonadherence from many angles and take a multifaceted approach with patients and healthcare providers.</p>
