<title>Children’s Hospital at Westmead, Sydney, Australia Objective:</title>
<p>The authors describe the development of a new, more objective method of distinguishing experienced competent nonexpert from expert practitioners within pediatric intensive care.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0018720812448475">
<title>Background:</title>
<p>Expert performance involves the acquisition and use of refined feature-event associations (cues) in the operational environment. Competent nonexperts, although experienced, possess rudimentary cue associations in memory. Thus, they cannot respond as efficiently or as reliably as their expert counterparts, particularly when key diagnostic information is unavail- able, such as that provided by dynamic cues.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0018720812448475">
<title>Method:</title>
<p>This study involved the application of four distinct tasks in which the use of relevant cues could be expected to increase both the accuracy and the efficiency of diagnostic performance. These tasks included both static and dynamic stimuli that were varied systematically. A total of 50 experienced pediatric intensive staff took part in the study.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0018720812448475">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>The sample clustered into two levels across the tasks: Participants who performed at a consistently high level throughout the four tasks were labeled experts, and participants who performed at a lower level throughout the tasks were labeled competent nonexperts. The groups differed in their responses to the diagnostic scenarios presented in two of the tasks and their ability to maintain performance in the absence of dynamic features.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0018720812448475">
<title>Conclusion:</title>
<p>Experienced pediatricians can be decomposed into two groups on the basis of their capacity to acquire and use cues; these groups differ in their diagnostic accuracy and in their ability to maintain performance in the absence of dynamic features.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0018720812448475">
<title>Application:</title>
<p>The tasks may be used to identify practitioners who are failing to acquire expertise at a rate consistent with their experience, position, or training. This information may be used to guide targeted training efforts.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Concerted efforts have been undertaken to improve the diagnostic performance of intensive care unit staff, with the goal of reducing the rate of patient misdiagnosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0018720812448475">Litchfield, Ball, Donovan, Manning, &amp; Crawford, 2010</xref>). Stemming from the observation that accurate and efficient diagnostic performance becomes stable only with a high degree of specialist expertise within medicine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0018720812448475">Patel &amp; Groen, 1991</xref>), extensive training and clinical experience is provided to practitioners to facilitate the acquisition of expert knowledge and skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0018720812448475">Ericsson &amp; Lehmann, 1996</xref>). However, the efficacy of such programs is debatable, with repeated observations that the diagnostic erformance of experienced and qualified medical practitioners is little better than that of novice graduates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0018720812448475">Norman, Coblentz, Brooks, &amp; Babcook, 1992</xref>).</p>
<p>Part of the problem relates to the conceptualization of expertise within health care, whereby individuals with relevant experience and qualifications are designated as experts in their domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0018720812448475">Coderre, Mandin, Harasym, &amp; Fick, 2003</xref>). However, it is apparent that many experienced and qualified practitioners never genuinely attain domain expertise and instead achieve only a level of diagnostic performance that could be described as competent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0018720812448475">Gray, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0018720812448475">Groves, O’Rourke, &amp; Alexander, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0018720812448475">Loveday, Wiggins, Harris, Smith, &amp; O’Hare, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0018720812448475">Schneider, 1985</xref>).</p>
<p>There is, therefore, utility in being able to distinguish between competent nonexperts and genuine experts for the purposes of remedial training and program evaluation. Thus, the general aim of the present study was the development of a tool capable of distinguishing competent from expert practitioners within an experienced and qualified population of intensive care unit staff.</p>
<sec id="section8-0018720812448475">
<title>An Objective Conceptualization of Expertise in Health Care</title>
<p>In the present study, we base our conceptualization of expertise in medicine on the distinction made by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0018720812448475">Croskerry (2009)</xref> between System 1 and System 2 decision making. System 1 is an approach to diagnosis based on clinical intuition, which facilitates rapid and accurate diagnosis by nonconsciously matching patterns of symptoms to appropriate treatment heuristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0018720812448475">Croskerry, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0018720812448475">Schmidt, Norman, &amp; Boshuizen, 1990</xref>). By comparison, System 2 is a slow and deliberate process, whereby practitioners form an initial diagnosis when presented with a range of symptoms and then test it by deducing what further symptoms should be present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0018720812448475">Croskerry, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0018720812448475">Gilhooly, 1990</xref>). It is well established that expert medical practitioners are much more likely than their nonexpert peers to engage in System 1–type pattern recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0018720812448475">Coderre et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0018720812448475">Groves et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0018720812448475">Norman, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0018720812448475">Young, Smith, Guerlain, &amp; Nolley, 2007</xref>), although nonexperts may also do so when presented with typical or common cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0018720812448475">Croskerry, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0018720812448475">Klein’s (1989)</xref> recognition-primed model of decision making (RPD) proposed that experts engage in pattern recognition through the nonconscious extraction and use of combinations of cues and their associations in memory. In the health care context, these cues would represent associations in memory between diagnostic <italic>features</italic> and patient <italic>events</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0018720812448475">Schmidt &amp; Boshuizen, 1993</xref>). Cues facilitate efficient and accurate diagnosis by priming the most appropriate response and may also provide a basis to discriminate relevant from less relevant information in the environment by directing attention toward a particular task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0018720812448475">Rasmussen, 1983</xref>).</p>
<p>There is extensive evidence to indicate that although all levels of diagnostic performance require the acquisition of task-relevant cues, expert performance is characterized by the capacity to draw on stronger and more nuanced associations in memory, thereby producing consistent, accurate, and efficient diagnoses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0018720812448475">Cellier, Eyrolle, &amp; Marine, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0018720812448475">Lipshitz, Klein, Orasanu, &amp; Salas, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0018720812448475">Müller, Abernethy, &amp; Farrow, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0018720812448475">Schriver, Morrow, Wickens, &amp; Talleur, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0018720812448475">Wiggins, 2006</xref>). By contrast, competent practitioners, with only weak or rudimentary associations, may focus on only the most salient or common cues during diagnosis rather than the most relevant, given the circumstances, resulting in less efficient and less accurate diagnostic performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0018720812448475">Cellier et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0018720812448475">Lipshitz et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0018720812448475">Schriver et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0018720812448475">Wiggins, 2006</xref>). Consequently, in the present study, we distinguish the stages of expert skill acquisition in terms of the capacity to extract and use diagnostic cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0018720812448475">Cellier et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0018720812448475">Lipshitz et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0018720812448475">Schriver et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>On the basis of this conceptualization of expertise, it should be possible to distinguish competent nonexperts from genuine experts within intensive care, given diagnostic tasks in which the extraction and use of cues is advantageous. The Expert Intensive Skills Evaluation (EXPERTise) is an assessment tool that has been designed to measure discrete components of cue extraction and/or use using a series of four tasks, namely, the Feature Identification Task (FID), the Paired Association Task (PAT), the Feature Discrimination Task (FDT), and the Transition Task (TT). The utility of EXPERTise has been established in a number of domains, including power system control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0018720812448475">Loveday et al., 2013</xref>).</p>
<p>The FID measures the ability to extract diagnostic features from the operational environment and recall those features when required (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0018720812448475">Loveday et al., 2013</xref>). It was developed from observations that experts are typically primed by a small subset of cues in the environment that are associated with critical events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0018720812448475">Müller et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0018720812448475">Schriver et al., 2008</xref>). These cues both generate the initial recognition of a critical condition and prime or restrict the search for further cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0018720812448475">Rasmussen, 1983</xref>). Consequently, these cues produce greater efficiency in diagnosis while maintaining a high level of diagnostic accuracy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0018720812448475">Coderre et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0018720812448475">Croskerry, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0018720812448475">Schyns, 1998</xref>). Modified for the medical domain, the FID can be used to measure the speed and accuracy with which a practitioner is able to identify patient features indicative of critical illness. Expert practitioners would be expected to respond faster and more accurately than their nonexpert peers.</p>
<p>The PAT measures the perceived strength of association between features and outcomes in the domain by presenting domain-relevant word pairs and measuring response latency or ratings of relatedness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0018720812448475">Morrison, Wiggins, Bond, &amp; Tyler, 2009</xref>). Experts who possess more nuanced and refined feature-event cue associations in memory respond faster and with greater variance to pairs than nonexperts, for whom all pairs are similarly associated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0018720812448475">Ackerman &amp; Rathburn, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0018720812448475">Schvaneveldt, Beringer, &amp; Lamonica, 2001</xref>). This task can be easily modified for medicine with diagnostic words and symptoms drawn from patient reports and charts.</p>
<p>The FDT measures the perceived utility of individual features within a diagnostic scenario. It is based on the Cochran-Weiss-Shanteau index, with which expertise can be measured by a ratio of discrimination to consistency, whereby discrimination is calculated as the variance in ratings for different features within a scenario and consistency as the variance in ratings for the same feature between scenarios (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0018720812448475">Weiss &amp; Shanteau, 2003</xref>). The FDT, which involves more complex, less standardized scenarios than those described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0018720812448475">Weiss and Shanteau (2003)</xref>, uses only the discrimination component of that formula. The task can be modified to closely reflect the types of information available in patient handover notes. Expert medical practitioners would be expected to demonstrate greater discrimination in their ratings of utility during a diagnostic scenario, resulting in greater variance of ratings.</p>
<p>The TT measures the sequence with which features are acquired during diagnosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0018720812448475">Wiggins, Stevens, Howard, Henley, &amp; O’Hare, 2002</xref>). The task is based on the observation that experts and nonexperts differ in the sequence in which they acquire diagnostic information. Typically, nonexperts will acquire information in the sequence that it is presented, whereas experts, who are guided by cue associations between features and events, acquire information in a sequence based on relevance and context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0018720812448475">Wiggins &amp; Bollwerk, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0018720812448475">Wiggins &amp; O’Hare, 1995</xref>). The TT operationalizes the sequence of information acquisition by presenting a list of feature categories. When clicked, these categories provide more detailed information. The sequence in which the category is accessed can be operationalized as the ratio of categories inspected in order of appearance to the total number of categories inspected prior to diagnosis. Therefore, expert practitioners would be expected to demonstrate a lower ratio of categories accessed in the sequence they were presented than that demonstrated by nonexpert practitioners. This task can be modified to closely reflect the types of information available in a patient report albeit with a novel structure. It can also be appended by a patient bedside-monitor output.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0018720812448475">
<title>The Present Study</title>
<p>Although previous applications of EXPERTise have been limited to power control, there are fundamental similarities between patient diagnosis in medicine and electrical network fault diagnosis. Power control operators monitor the power network using a standardized display, which both alerts the operator to line faults and facilitates fault diagnosis through prominent visual cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0018720812448475">Loveday et al., 2013</xref>). Although the cues used are arguably more complex and dynamic, intensive care staff also must extract relevant diagnostic information from standardized bedside monitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0018720812448475">Norman et al., 1992</xref>). Therefore, it may be possible to identify genuinely expert health care staff with the use of EXPERTise, in much the same way that EXPERTise has been used to identify expert network operators.</p>
<p>A limitation of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0018720812448475">Loveday et al. (2013)</xref> was that it made use of static stimuli, in which the available cues may have lacked information inherent to dynamism, such as the rate of change, the magnitude of change, and the presence or absence of change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0018720812448475">Tversky, Morrison, &amp; Betrancourt 2002</xref>). Likewise, most of the studies of expert health care diagnosis have opted to present diagnosticians with static patient summaries, listing patient symptoms, history, and demographics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0018720812448475">Coderre et al., 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>This use of static information is problematic for research on expert diagnosis within intensive care, where time pressures mean that practitioners frequently assess the efficacy of their treatment response on the basis of observable changes in conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0018720812448475">Rasmussen, 1993</xref>). It is only in highly specific circumstances that practitioners attempt to infer patient changes in conditions from static information, such as X-rays.</p>
<p>A failure to replicate actual field conditions may significantly impair performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0018720812448475">Shanteau, 1992</xref>). The extent of this impairment may depend on whether the individual is a competent nonexpert or a genuine expert. Compared with their expert counterparts, competent nonexperts have greater difficulty interpreting dynamic environments using static cues in isolation. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0018720812448475">Lowe (2001)</xref> had participants predict and draw meteorological markings on a map of Australasia using a static meteorological map of the Australian mainland. It was observed that nonexperts produced very simple forecast maps compared with those produced by experts.</p>
<p>Because of the potential significance of dynamic features in diagnostic performance, there is a need to assess performance in the presence or absence of dynamic cues. By including both static cues and dynamic cues, the present study was designed to examine differences in performance between expert and competent nonexpert intensive care staff within an experienced sample.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0018720812448475">
<title>Aims and Hypotheses</title>
<p>The specific aim of the present study was to establish whether performance on four tasks, designed to assess independent aspects of diagnostic reasoning through the use and extraction of both static and dynamic cues, could be used to differentiate experienced competent nonexpert and expert staff in pediatric intensive care. In three of the tasks, FID, FDT, and TT, we included both static and dynamic stimuli to examine the extent to which diagnosticians based their decisions on information such as the rate of change and the direction of change.</p>
<p>Because experts possess nuanced cue associations in memory that direct their performance, they were expected to demonstrate consistently superior performance on those reasoning tasks that required the judicious extraction and use of cues. Therefore, we hypothesized the following:</p>
<list id="list1-0018720812448475" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Performance across the EXPERTise tasks would cluster into two levels within an experienced sample.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Reflecting competent nonexperts and genuine experts, the clusters would differ in terms of performance in each of the EXPERTise tasks. Experts, compared with nonexperts, were expected to demonstrate
<list id="list2-0018720812448475" list-type="alpha-lower">
<list-item><p>both shorter response intervals and increased accuracy during the FID,</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>shorter response intervals and larger variance of ratings of association between pairs in the PAT,</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>larger variance in ratings of utility of individual features during the FDT, and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>a smaller proportion of information screens accessed sequentially during the TT.</p></list-item>
</list></p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Overall performance in the tasks would be associated with the choice of response to the EXPERTise tasks (FID and TT) presenting full diagnostic scenarios, with the expert cluster tending to select the optimal response to the scenario.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>If competent nonexperts were unable to impose dynamism on static stimuli, their performance should be worse on static than on dynamic items. This effect should be less pronounced for genuine experts. Thus, the following was also expected:</p>
<list id="list3-0018720812448475" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>4. Across the EXPERTise tasks, competent nonexperts would perform significantly worse when only static, but not dynamic, stimuli were available. Members of the expert cluster would perform similarly regardless of stimuli type.</p></list-item>
</list>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>The participants represented a convenience sample recruited with the assistance of the Children’s Hospital at Westmead during the World Federation of Pediatric Intensive and Critical Care Societies Meeting, held in Sydney, Australia, in March 2011. The participants comprised 50 pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) staff, 34 registered pediatric intensivists, and 16 registered pediatric nurses. Of the participants, 23 were male and 27 were female. They ranged in age from 30 to 63 years with a mean of 42.3 years (<italic>SD</italic> = 8.3). The participants had accumulated between 3 and 26 years of experience beyond residency within pediatric critical care, with a mean of 9.8 years (<italic>SD</italic> = 6.9).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0018720812448475">
<title>Stimuli Development</title>
<p>To develop the stimuli, we conducted cognitive interviews with two subject matter experts from the PICU within the Children’s Hospital at Westmead. The subject matter experts were selected on the basis of their position, peer reference, and the length of their experience practicing in the domain. Initially, the subject matter experts were interviewed as a pair. They were asked to describe a typical but rapidly deteriorating patient and to list the features that may have been available, even if they believed that the information was irrelevant to their final decision. This approach was taken to circumvent the possibility that such a skilled practitioner may have been unaware of the cues that guided their decision making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0018720812448475">Kahneman &amp; Klein, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>We used the features identified to develop a scenario template, which included a catalog of feature categories that an individual may or may not consider during a complex diagnostic task within pediatrics. The subject matter experts were asked to construct scenarios from real incidents and to describe the patient in terms of the features listed in the template. It was emphasized that the incidents reported should be complex because of the potential for uncertainty and should reflect when the subject matter experts felt that their expertise and experience made a critical difference to the outcome. Then, four incidents were organized into timelines reflecting, as accurately as possible, the actual sequence and timing of events. Of these, two of the scenarios were adapted into the FDT (see <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0018720812448475">Appendix A</xref> for an example) and two into the TT (see <xref ref-type="app" rid="app2-0018720812448475">Appendix B</xref> for an example). We used the remaining incidents to develop a catalog of features, which were identified by the subject matter experts. We then paired these features randomly to form the items in the PAT (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0018720812448475">Appendix C</xref>).</p>
<p>The subject matter experts also provided critical patient vital sign ranges, which we entered as variables into Laerdal’s SimBaby™, a pediatric infant patient monitor simulation, to generate <italic>static</italic> patient monitor screen captures, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0018720812448475">Figure 1</xref>, and <italic>dynamic</italic> patient monitor videos using a flashing signal to draw attention to critical patient vitals. These images and scenarios were validated during an untimed pilot test, whereby five senior intensive care practitioners within the PICU at the Children’s Hospital at Westmead identified the abnormal parameters for each of the images and nominated the optimal response options for the scenarios. Only those items with 100% agreement were retained. The resulting scenarios, images, and videos were used across the four EXPERTise tasks.</p>

<title>Stimuli</title>
<p>In the present study, the FID incorporated four stages. In the first stage, the static cue condition, the participants were presented with a static screen capture. In the second stage, the dynamic cue condition, the participants were presented with a video recording of a patient’s bedside monitor. For both the static and dynamic conditions, the monitor output displayed a single abnormal parameter, indicative of a patient in a critical condition. The speed with which the participants were able to identify and click on the abnormal parameter was recorded. Because of the simplicity of the task, it was expected and observed that all participants would correctly identify the abnormal parameter for all items.</p>
<p>In the third stage, the static cue condition, the participants were shown a static monitor screen capture for 1.5 s. In the fourth stage, the dynamic cue condition, the participants were shown a video recording for 1.5 s. During both stages, an abnormal parameter occurred. On a subsequent screen, the participants were asked to identify the abnormal parameter from five possible options, and their responses were recorded.</p>
<p>The PAT incorporated two stages. In the first stage, participants were presented with pairs of feature and event phrases sequentially. For example, the participants might have been shown the words <italic>Breathing</italic> and then <italic>Sedation</italic>. The stimuli were presented as text pairs for 1.5 s. In the second stage, the feature and event pairs were presented simultaneously on the screen for 2 s. The participant was asked to rate the perceived strength of the relationship between the feature-event pairs, which was recorded together with response latency.</p>
<p>The FDT included two scenarios. Both included a brief scenario description and a patient monitor output that indicated the need for further action. However, the first monitor output was presented as a static screen capture, whereas the second was presented as a dynamic video recording. Participants were asked to assess the patient and then, on the same screen, to select one of eight possible treatment responses that included a “Do nothing” option. On the following screen, they rated, on 6-point scales, the perceived diagnostic utility for each of nine individual features of the scenario. The participants’ response to the scenario and their ratings of each feature were recorded.</p>
<p>The TT also included two scenarios. Each scenario included the gender and age of the patient, to provide context, and a patient monitor output. In the first scenario, the monitor output was provided as a static image. In the second, the output was a dynamic video recording. The monitor output and written description were intentionally vague and thus were insufficient for making a diagnosis. This vagueness necessitated the participants’ acquisition of additional information, which was presented as a list of information categories. Each information category, when clicked, revealed more detailed information. Each label was a term chosen to ensure that its contents were clear to participants, which was verified during pilot testing. The sequence in which these categories were accessed was recorded.</p>

<title>Procedure</title>
<p>Groups of 2 to 5 participants were briefed on the purpose of the study and then were asked to sign a consent form if they wished to continue. They completed a brief demographics questionnaire, which captured their pediatric experience and perceived workload, and then began the EXPERTise test battery via laptop computer. We provided noise-canceling headphones to reduce the impact of ambient noise. On completion of EXPERTise, the participants were debriefed.</p>

<title>Correlations With Experience</title>
<p>To investigate the relationship between measures of experience and each of the tasks within EXPERTise, we performed Bonferroni-adjusted bivariate correlations between years of experience in the domain (years in PICU), years of senior experience (if consultant in charge of PICU), workload (hours in typical week, patients admitted to unit per year), and performance on the EXPERTise tasks.</p>
<p>There were no statistically significant correlations between measures of experience and task performance, with the exception of years of PICU experience, which was moderately correlated with sequential PAT reaction times, <italic>r</italic> = .33, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05. There was also a moderate correlation between workload, as measured by consult hours in a typical week, and ratings variance in the static FDT, <italic>r</italic> = .40, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05.</p>

<title>Cluster Analysis</title>
<p>The primary aim of the present study was to investigate the feasibility of classifying PICU staff into a limited number of groups on the basis of observed levels of performance across the EXPERTise tasks. Because the sample comprised experienced individuals, it was expected that performance would decompose into two groups, reflecting competence and expertise. Therefore, a <italic>K</italic>-means cluster analysis was undertaken in SPSS, with <italic>K</italic> = 2 clusters.</p>

<p>Cluster 1 (<italic>n</italic> = 24) comprised those individuals who, although experienced, demonstrated a lower level of performance across the EXPERTise tasks than did the members of Cluster 2. Therefore, the participants in this cluster were described as “competent nonexperts.”</p>
<p>Cluster 2 (<italic>n</italic> = 26) comprised those individuals who performed at the highest level across the EXPERTise tasks.

<title>Comparison Between Clusters for Scenario Response</title>
<p>If the clusters formed reflected two distinct levels of expertise, a significant relationship between cluster membership and diagnostic outcomes should have been observed. However, because the clusters were not significantly different in the dynamic forms of the FDT and TT, only the diagnostic outcomes for the static forms of the FDT and TT were considered. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0018720812448475">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0018720812448475">3</xref> illustrate the relationship between cluster membership and the choice of response to the FDT and TT, respectively.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The primary aim of the present study was to determine whether performance on four diagnostic tasks, in which the extraction and use of cues was advantageous, could be used to differentiate nonexpert and expert practitioners within an experienced sample of pediatric intensive care staff. These tasks had already been used to distinguish novice, competent, and expert practitioners in power control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0018720812448475">Loveday et al., 2013</xref>) and were considered appropriate for the assessment of diagnostic expertise within an experienced pediatric intensive care sample, given prior evidence that experienced practitioners transition to expertise only with the acquisition of cue associations in memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0018720812448475">Cellier et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0018720812448475">Lipshitz et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0018720812448475">Schriver et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0018720812448475">Wiggins, 2006</xref>). Therefore, expertise was expected to result in consistently superior performance across the tasks.</p>
<p>A secondary aim of the study was to examine the relationship between expertise and performance in the presence and absence of dynamic information. It was expected that in the absence of dynamic features, competent nonexperts would perform at a lower level than would otherwise be expected. Thus, it was hypothesized that the difference between competent and expert practitioners would be greatest for those tasks that presented static, rather than dynamic, stimuli.</p>
<p>The first hypothesis, that performance on the EXPERTise tasks could distinguish competent and expert practitioners within an experienced sample, was supported. Performance clustered into two levels across all four diagnostic assessment tasks. The expert cluster comprised those participants who were faster, more accurate, more discriminating in their selection of diagnostic cues, and less likely to inspect information in the order in which it was presented. By comparison, the competent nonexpert cluster comprised those individuals who were slower, less accurate, less discriminating, and more sequential in the acquisition of information. Consequently, the groups differed in their diagnostic outcomes, with members of the expert cluster more likely to select the optimal diagnostic response, lending support to the view that the groups genuinely reflected distinct levels of diagnostic performance.</p>
<p>The present sample was restricted to qualified practitioners, ensuring that members of both groups possessed sufficient experience to acquire expertise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0018720812448475">Simon &amp; Chase, 1973</xref>). As expected, a sizeable proportion of the sample failed to meet a level of performance that could be described as expert. This finding supports the view that expertise does not develop as a linear function of experience but, rather, develops with the capacity to extract and use agnostic cues in the environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0018720812448475">Cellier et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0018720812448475">Lipshitz et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0018720812448475">Wiggins &amp; O’Hare, 2003</xref>). This finding is also supported by the weak correlations between years of experience in the domain and performance on each of the EXPERTise tasks. However, this analysis should be interpreted with caution because of the restricted range of experience within the sample and the general measure of experience.</p>
<p>The third hypothesis, that the competent nonexpert cluster would perform at a significantly lower level than the experts when static, but not dynamic, stimuli were available, was also supported. Although the performance of the competent cluster appeared to diminish in the absence of dynamic information, the members of the expert cluster performed equally well with both static and dynamic stimuli.</p>
<p>Both dynamic and static stimuli were included to replicate distinct real-world conditions. Although medical practitioners in the PICU will usually have live updates of a patient’s vital signs, in some circumstances, the bedside monitoring equipment may not receive the necessary trace feeds, in which case the vital signs are updated only sporadically. However, dynamic (or live) information can provide a wealth of unique cues that are generally regarded as being very diagnostic, including the rate, direction, and type of change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0018720812448475">Tversky et al., 2002</xref>). These cues are not available in static conditions, and this absence presumably affects diagnostic performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0018720812448475">Shanteau, 1992</xref>). Notably, the present results suggest that experts are able to maintain performance in the absence of dynamic information, whereas experienced, but only competent, practitioners are less able.</p>
<p>This study is not the first to show that the distinction in performance between nonexperts and experts is greater with the use of static stimuli. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0018720812448475">Lowe (2001)</xref> observed that nonexperts produced very simple and inaccurate forecasts compared with domain experts when asked to predict weather patterns based on static meteorological maps.</p>
<p>In terms of expert assessment, it appears that static scenarios provide the greatest distinction between competence and expertise. Therefore, future cue-based assessments of expertise within experienced samples may benefit from using static stimuli, from which patient trends can only be inferred.</p>
<sec id="section22-0018720812448475">
<title>Implications and Limitations</title>
<p>By distinguishing nonexperts and experts within an experienced sample, the present results support the use of EXPERTise as a method of monitoring the performance and skill acquisition of experienced practitioners. By expanding the range and number of practitioners within the EXPERTise database, it will be possible to develop standardized norms of performance. These norms can be used to determine whether practitioners are developing expertise at a rate that is typical of their experience, position, or training in comparison with their peers. Furthermore, because EXPERTise measures four independent facets of expert performance, it may be used to identify the specific component skills of cue-based diagnosis that competent nonexperts are yet to acquire. This assessment can inform specific cue-based remedial training strategies, which have already achieved successes in aviation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0018720812448475">Wiggins &amp; O’Hare, 2003</xref>), mining (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0018720812448475">Blignaut, 1979</xref>), and general medicine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0018720812448475">Litchfield et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>It is, however, necessary to address one of the limitations of the present study before EXPERTise can be used as a normative assessment of performance. Specifically, in the present study, we demonstrated only that there are two levels of performance within a sample of experienced practitioners. We did not attempt to demonstrate that there is a relationship between the EXPERTise and on-the-job performance. Therefore, there is an opportunity to investigate the relationship between expertise and objective, on-the-job measures of performance, albeit in other domains.</p>
<p>A second limitation of the present study is that we considered only the relationship between performance and the presence and absence of dynamic information. However, dynamism is a more nuanced facet of the operational environment than operationalized here. For example, in the present study, we did not consider whether dynamism might also act as a distracter. In the present study, dynamism may have facilitated performance by drawing attention to relevant diagnostic cues through visual changes, such as parameters flashing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0018720812448475">Beck, Lohrenz, &amp; Trafton, 2010</xref>). However, in some circumstances, the most relevant patient parameter may not be that highlighted by the bedside monitor. Therefore, dynamism-generated salience may, in some cases, impair performance. In the future, re- searchers might compare competent and expert recall for patient parameters that are paired with a parameter in its alert sequence.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The present study was designed to determine whether the application of four independent cue-based assessments could, collectively, distinguish competent from expert practitioners within an experienced sample of PICU staff. Overall, performance on all four assessment tasks successfully differentiated the two groups, whereby experienced staff could be divided into competent and expert practitioners on the basis of their capacity for using cues.</p>
<p>In this study, we also examined the relationship between performance and dynamic information. Consistent with predictions, competent nonexperts performed nearly as well as genuine experts when dynamic information was made available but less well when only static features were available. This finding suggests that competent individuals may be less able to reason about dynamic systems on the basis of static sources of information. However, additional research is required to determine which aspects of dynamism facilitate competent performance in nonexperts and to identify potential remedial training targets to improve performance when patient vitals are only sporadically updated.</p>
