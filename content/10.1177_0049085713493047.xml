<p>This book is of great significance for anyone who believes in a universal, comprehensive and free public health services system and advocates strengthening the public health system for greater equity as opposed to leaving health to market forces. It is also of importance to anyone attempting to make sense of systemic transformations that take place in health services systems that is determined by the dominant politics and economics of the times. The health services system in question here is the National Health Service (NHS) of England that was built as a free, universal system for the people of the country based on principles of equity and social justice and has been a ‘fixture of British life and values’ (p. 1) ever since it came into existence post-Second World War. It gives the reader an account of the transformation of the NHS from a public service to a market place of health services. The authors’ concerns are raised in the first few pages and give the reader a sense of what to expect from this book—‘The NHS has been a fundamental component of social solidarity and equal citizenship for over 60 years. If it goes, we will eventually find ourselves living in a very different kind of society’ (p. xi). The purpose of the book is to reach out to a wider audience, not only professionals or scholars in public health but all those who feel NHS is a public service and must be saved from market forces.</p>
<p>The book is highly relevant today in the Indian context in light of the 12th Five-year Plan that proposes a system of managed care that will be driven by for-profit interests within the public health system and outside it. This is a critical juncture for us where the pendulum could sway either way—further marketisation and privatisation or bringing back the central role of the state and strengthening the public health systems. In India we have witnessed greater privatisation of public health services at different levels over the past two decades in the name of reforms. These have been in the form of user fees in the public institutions; forms of public–private partnerships in clinical and non-clinical services; and more recently the newer forms of financing that show a clear purchaser-provider split and greater role for the private sector.</p>
<p>The book unravels what the authors call a ‘plot’ to dismantle the NHS and gives a detailed account of what was happening at the policy level in the name of administrative reforms from 2000. The narrative reaches to the end of the decade when the Conservatives come in to power in 2010 and introduce massive cuts in the NHS and propose further radical reforms but the authors emphasise that the radical moves would not have been possible without the spaces that were already created by the New Labour Party before them. In the context of UK this was a significant move as the private sector always had a minimal role to play as compared to any other European country due to the state funded, provided and regulated NHS that reached out to all. Opening the NHS to the markets was first witnessed during the Thatcher regime where outsourcing of the non-clinical services was introduced. The authors stress on the decade beginning 2000 because there is a distinct and qualitative shift in the market principles that get introduced in the NHS. In the next few chapters they provide a detailed analysis of what transpired within the Department of Health, the insiders who were involved in subtly pushing and lobbying for opening the NHS to the markets and corporatising it. This is where the story seems to lie that requires the readers to see the systematic dismantling of a comprehensive and universal public health system that has been around for more than 60 years. The authors stress on the word ‘plot’ as these changes were introduced without a democratic mandate within a system such as the NHS that was created by and for the people. They see it as a well-thought and conceived plan to slowly fragment the NHS and create a market leaving the NHS to serve simply as a ‘kitemark’ (p. 1).</p>
<p>The authors, step-by-step, spell out the process by first listing three major reforms that were undertaken and necessary to progress to the next stage of reforms. First, openings were created for private companies to provide health care for high volume treatments at secondary level like cataract surgery and knee and hip replacement. The primary level NHS trusts were arm-twisted into signing contracts with privately owned Treatment Centres. Second, NHS bodies were converted to foundation trusts. Each hospital was given managerial independence but was to be supervised by an independent private regulator that set target-based contracts that were legally enforceable. Hence, if the institution went bankrupt due to non-performance, a new set of providers would take charge which in all possibilities would be the private sector. The third and the most important reform without which the authors feel the process of reforms would have been incomplete was that of ‘detaching the clinical workforce from the NHS’ and this included the consultants, GPs and community health staff. The authors here show how the plan was put to work by creating an environment to lure the GPs by hiking their pay and creating spaces in out-of work hours where the private companies could contract their services. For consultants first there was a ploy to create dissatisfaction by linking increase in payments to performance but later they were allowed to come together as groups to form companies and sell their services back to the NHS. While the links of GP and consultant workforce had significantly weakened from the NHS by 2010, the policy-makers were unable to detach the third of the workforce, that is, community health staff from the system due to a political uproar for millions of votes depended on them as they were under the local authorities. All this provides evidence towards the flow of public money to the private sector.</p>
<p>While these reforms gradually took shape, the book highlights in the following chapters, how policies in health were dictated and influenced by US policy advice. The Department of Health over this decade had brought in innumerable management consultants from the US to put forth proposals of reform who become the main actors in the plot. There seemed to be an urgent need to accelerate this process of reforms and several proposals were developed and piloted during this period. Two significant proposals were that of the introduction of polyclinics at the primary level to be operated and owned by private firms; and the other was the Kaiser model of insurance which is a competitive model of care and talks of integrated care and private sector provisioning.</p>
<p>In the chapters that follow, the reader gathers the emergence of several private companies that have established themselves in England and have created a complex set of provisioning. Each of them works at providing different set of services. Some specialise in acute care, some have contracts to provide GP services, while some are engaged in out-of-hours primary care and so on. This clearly shows numerous possibilities of entry created by the government for the private sector that has fragmented a comprehensive system. The role of private equity firms and big capital in transforming the NHS into a health care market is significant where US based firms play a significant role. The authors provide an interesting flowchart of network of actors who quit government positions to join key positions in the private firms. The nexus between the public and the private comes out well in the illustration. Most of those who have benefited from these reforms seem to be these individuals.</p>
<p>What emerges from this entire narrative is that in the guise of administrative reforms, each document that was presented in the parliament became a new entry point for privatisation. The impact of a market driven system has already had effects on quality, has increased costs of operation due to the price competition and the authors note an increase in malpractice, irrationality of services and unequal treatment. All these qualities are an anti-thesis of what the NHS stood for in the past.</p>
<p>The authors end by showing how Scotland and Wales have retained the NHS as a public service with minor reforms. Scotland, in fact, did a reversal of the purchaser-provider split and took over the direct administration by closing market options and Wales did not adopt the foundation trust model and have re-emphasised free access and commitment to social democracy. They have been able to move away from the dominant ‘there is no alternative’ slogan. As a public health scholar it is important to note how governments represent and facilitate private and corporate interests and have increasingly started behaving like the for-profit sector in the name of choice, plurality and financial efficiency and have moved away from values like justice and equity.</p>
<p>By the end of the book the reader realises the significance of the word ‘plot’, that may have seemed value laden in the beginning, but through the excellent unravelling of the process and sequence of events that follow over the decade, the word used seems apt. The book demands the reader to see the need to defend and strengthen public health systems. Probably, the only thing lacking in the book is the public perception to the changes. Even if people were unaware of the changes at the policy level what were their experiences with the system? There is only one instance given where the community health staff resisted major changes but it would be interesting to note other voices of resistance and dissent within the system and the Labour Party itself, the Party that created the NHS as a public service in 1948 and was considered its proudest achievement.</p>
