<abstract>
<p>The effect of 10-hydroxy-<italic>trans</italic>-2-decenoic acid (10H2DA), a major fatty acid component of royal jelly, was investigated on LPS-induced cytokine production in murine macrophage cell line, RAW264 cells. 10H2DA inhibited LPS-induced IL-6 production dose-dependently, but did not inhibit TNF-α production. 10H2DA inhibited LPS-induced NF-κB activation in a dose-dependent fashion. In addition, NF-κB activation induced by over-expression of either MyD88 or Toll/IL-1 receptor domain-containing adaptor inducing IFN-β (TRIF) was also inhibited by 10H2DA. Degradation of IκB-α and phosphorylation of IκB kinase-α were not inhibited by 10H2DA. On the other hand, reduction of LPS-induced IκB-ζ expression was discovered. Production of lipocalin-2 and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), which is dependent on IκB-ζ, was also inhibited by 10H2DA, whereas that of IκB-ζ–independent cytokines/chemokines, such as IFN-β, murine monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (JE), macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1α and MIP-2, was not. Together, 10H2DA specifically inhibited LPS-induced IκB-ζ expression, followed by inhibition of IκB-ζ-dependent gene production. These results suggest that 10H2DA is one of the components of royal jelly to show anti-inflammatory effects and could be a therapeutic drug candidate for inflammatory and autoimmune diseases associated with IκB-ζ and IL-6 production.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1753425911416022" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>TLRs are innate immune receptors recognizing microbial components such as bacterial LPS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1753425911416022">1</xref></sup> The TLR4/MD-2 complex recognizes LPS and its signaling activates NF-κB in two independent pathways, such as MyD88-dependent and Toll/IL-1 receptor domain-containing adaptor inducing IFN-β (TRIF)-dependent pathways.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1753425911416022">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>As many inflammatory cytokines and chemokines are produced under the regulation of NF-κB, activation of NF-κB is strictly regulated in several ways.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1753425911416022">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1753425911416022">4</xref></sup> Nuclear factor-κB proteins are homodimers or heterodimers of the NF-κB family including p65 and p50. IκB-ζ, a member of IκB family, can be a component of an active NF-κB complex, especially in activating IL-6 promoter induced by LPS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1753425911416022">5</xref></sup> NF-κB p65 is sequestered in the cytoplasm through association with IκB in unstimulated cells. During LPS stimulation, p65 is released from IκB-α, a typical member of IκB, followed by nuclear translocation of the p50/p65 heterodimer.</p>
<p>Royal jelly is produced by the hypopharyngeal and mandibular glands of worker honeybees as a food essential for the growth of the queen honeybee. It has various pharmacological activities, such as vasodilative hypotensive activities, decreasing activity of serum cholesterol levels, anti-tumor activities, protective activity against hemopoietic dysfunction in X-irradiated mice, anti-allergic activities of reducing IgE production and anti-inflammatory activities in inhibiting pro-inflammatory cytokine production.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1753425911416022">6</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1753425911416022">10</xref></sup> Royal jelly contains 10-hydroxy-<italic>trans</italic>-2-decenoic acid (10H2DA) as major lipid component,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1753425911416022">11</xref></sup> which is a natural ingredient almost uniquely found in royal jelly. Therefore, it is possible that 10H2DA is an active component of royal jelly’s pharmacological activities. Indeed, anti-tumor and antibiotic activities have been reported for 10H2DA.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1753425911416022">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1753425911416022">12</xref></sup> However, the molecular mechanisms for the pharmacological activities of 10H2DA are not well known.</p>
<p>In this study, we investigated the effect of 10H2DA on LPS-induced cytokine production.</p>

<p>10H2DA with a purity of above 98% (analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography), was kindly gifted by Api Co. (Gifu, Japan). It was dissolved in ethanol at 500 m<sc>M</sc> and added to culture media at the indicated concentration. LPS from <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> O55 was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St Louis, MO, USA). Antibodies against IκB-α (Sigma-Aldrich), IκB kinase (IKK)-α (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA), and phospho-Ser180 IKK-α (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA) were used.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1753425911416022"><title>Plasmids</title>
<p>Murine Toll/IL-1 receptor domain-containing adaptor protein (TIRAP) gene was amplified from mRNA of RAW264 by RT-PCR and cloned into pENTR/TEV/D-TOPO (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). It was then transferred into pDEST26 (Invitrogen), as recommended by the manufacturer. The MyD88 expression vector<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1753425911416022">13</xref></sup> was kindly gifted by Dr Takaoka (University of Tokyo), whereas TRIF<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1753425911416022">14</xref></sup> was from Dr Komatsu (Aichi Medical University). Promoter regions of TNF-α, IL-6, and IκB-ζ gene were amplified from the genomic DNA of RAW264 by PCR and cloned into a luciferase reporter plasmid, pGL4.26 (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). An NF-κB reporter gene plasmid, pNF-κB-TA-luc, was purchased from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA, USA). A transfection control reporter plasmid, pRL-TK, was obtained from Promega. Plasmids were extracted with GenElute HP endotoxin-free plasmid Midiprep kit (Sigma-Aldrich) for transfection into cultured cell lines.</p>

<sec id="sec5-1753425911416022"><title>Cell culture, 10H2DA treatment and stimulation</title>
<p>The RAW264 murine macrophage cell line was obtained from RIKEN Bioresource Center (Tokyo, Japan) and maintained in Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) 1640 medium containing 5% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS; Invitrogen). The cells were seeded in a 96-well plate at 2 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells/well for cytokine assays or 2.5 × 10<sup>4</sup> cells/well for reporter gene assays. The cellswere pre-incubated with or without the indicatedconcentration of 10H2DA for 30 min then stimulated by adding LPS at the final concentration of 100 ng/ml. After 24 h incubation, the culture supernatants wereused for cytokine assays. The human embryonic kidney (HEK) cell line HEK293 was maintained in minimal essential medium containing 5% FBS and 1% nonessential amino acid (Sigma-Aldrich). The HEK293 cells were seeded in a 96-well plate at a cell density of2.5 × 10<sup>4</sup> cells/well for reporter gene assays. At theend of each assay, cell viability was assayed by AlamarBlue (Trek Diagnostic Systems, West Sussex, UK), as recommended by the manufacturer. In all experimental conditions performed in this study, cell viability was &gt;95% compared with untreated cells.</p>

<p><italic>De novo</italic> synthesis of IκB-ζ has been reported to be critical for IL-6 production in LPS stimulation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1753425911416022">5</xref></sup> After stimulation of IκB-ζ production with LPS through the MyD88-dependent pathway, IκB-ζ interacts with the p50 subunit of NF-κB, following which the active NF-κB complex upregulates IL-6 production.</p>
<p>We revealed specific inhibitory effects of 10H2DA on LPS-induced IκB-ζ production followed by inhibition of IκB-ζ–dependent gene expression, including IL-6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1753425911416022">Figure 8</xref>). IL-6 has been reported to play critical roles in colonic inflammation and colon cancer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1753425911416022">20</xref></sup> Recently, IL-6 was found to be a key contributor in the development of Th17 helper T cells, which critically contribute to autoimmune and inflammatory diseases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1753425911416022">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1753425911416022">22</xref></sup> Lipocalin-2 and G-CSF genes have also been reported to be IκB-ζ–dependent genes, as well as IL-6.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1753425911416022">23</xref></sup> We detected significant inhibition of expression of these genes by 10H2DA, whereas no significant reduction was seen in the expression of IκB-ζ-independent genes, such as TNF-α, IFN-β, JE, MIP-1α and MIP-2, suggesting that a reduction in IκB-ζ expression results in the inhibition of IL-6 production. Lipocalin-2 has been suggested to promote insulin resistance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1753425911416022">24</xref></sup> Furthermore, IκB-ζ is involved in IFN-γ production by TNF-α stimulation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1753425911416022">25</xref></sup> Recently, IκB-ζ has been reported to positively regulate Th17 development in co-operation with ROR nuclear receptors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1753425911416022">26</xref></sup> IκB-ζ-deficient mice showed resistance to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. IκB-ζ expression is supposed to contribute to these various pathological conditions. Therefore, 10H2DA may improve these pathological consequences via its activity in reducing IκB-ζ-induction and IκB-ζ–dependent gene-expression.
<fig id="fig8-1753425911416022" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><p>A schematic of the effect of 10H2DA on LPS-stimulated gene expression. LPS induces expression of NF-κB-dependent genes, such as TNF-α and JE, through MyD88/NF-κB signaling pathway. IκB-ζ is one of the NF-κB-dependent genes and induces the IκB-ζ-dependent genes including IL-6, lipocalin-2 and G-CSF. 10H2DA acid inhibits only a subset of NF-κB, which activates IκB-ζ promoter and is suspected to be in a different state of phosphorylation or other post-translational modifications.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1753425911416022-fig8.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>TNF-α and IL-6 are known to be major pro-inflammatory cytokines induced by MyD88-dependent LPS signaling.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1753425911416022">27</xref></sup> NF-κB is a well known transcription factor responsible for IL-6 production.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1753425911416022">28</xref></sup> In LPS stimulation, MyD88-dependent NF-κB activation is thought to be responsible for IκB-ζ gene expression.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1753425911416022">5</xref></sup> Using a reporter gene assay, 10H2DA inhibited NF-κB activation under LPS and MyD88 induction. In RT-PCR analysis, however, 10H2DA did not affect the production of cytokines or chemokines, including TNF-α and JE, whose expression is supposed to be dependent on NF-κB. Furthermore, promoter activation of IκB-ζ, but not the TNF-α gene, was inhibited by 10H2DA in reporter gene assay. The NF-κB reporter construct that we used has four repeats of the consensus κB sequence, which is identical to that in the promoter region of the IκB-ζ gene. The κB sequence-specific binding of a subset of NF-κB complexes may be the reason that expression of IκB-ζ, but not the other NF-κB-dependent genes, was inhibited by 10H2DA. In fact, we could not detect the inhibitory effect of 10H2DA on the degradation of IκB-α. LPS-stimulated IKK-α phosphorylation was even increased by adding 10H2DA. We could also not detect the inhibition of NF-κB p65 nuclear translocation by 10H2DA (data not shown). These data suggest that at least part of NF-κB was released from the IκBs and translocated into the nucleus in LPS stimulation. Therefore, some NF-κB-dependent genes could be transcribed.</p>
<p>NF-κB activation is controlled by IKKs which are required for phosphorylation-induced degradation of IκBs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1753425911416022">3</xref></sup> Following ligation of TLRs, IKKs are activated by phosphorylation, resulting in IκB phosphorylation and degradation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1753425911416022">3</xref></sup> We could not detect significant inhibition of IκB degradation by 10H2DA, suggesting that NF-κB was at least released from the IκB–NF-κB complex. Full activation of NF-κB needs several post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1753425911416022">4</xref></sup> Activation of p65, a subunit of NF-κB activated in LPS stimulation, is believed to be regulated by phosphorylation of at least four Ser residues. Phosphorylation at Ser 276 is critical for interaction with the transcriptional co-activators cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB)-binding protein and p300,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1753425911416022">29</xref></sup> and is therefore necessary for NF-κB–dependent gene transcription. The other phosphorylation sites may affect specific gene expression. Anrather et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1753425911416022">30</xref></sup> reported that phosphorylation of Ser residues at 205, 276 and 281 is necessary for the expression of MIP-2 and ICAM-1, whereas IL-6 and vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM)-1 are expressed in a phosphorylation-independent manner. On the otherhand, Ser 536 needs to be phosphorylated to produce IL-6 in angiotensin II-stimulated vascular smooth muscle cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1753425911416022">31</xref></sup> They also reported significant amounts of NF-κB were present in the nucleus; however, unphosphorylated NF-κB does not activate gene transcription, even in the nucleus. Although we could not detect an inhibitory effect of 10H2DA on LPS-induced phosphorylation of p65 at Ser 536 (data not shown), regulation of p65 phosphorylation at specific Ser residues may allow modulation of particular gene expression, including the IκB-ζ gene.</p>
<p>Kohno et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1753425911416022">10</xref></sup> showed that royal jelly inhibited LPS- and IFN-γ–induced cytokine production, and identified one of the major protein components, MRJP3, as an anti-inflammatory factor derived from honeybee royal jelly.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1753425911416022">10</xref></sup> They also suggested that royal jelly contains another anti-inflammatory factor with low molecular mass that inhibits TNF-α and IL-6 production. Although we could not detect an inhibitory effect on LPS-induced TNF-α production, 10H2DA may be one of the low molecular weight anti-inflammatory factors in royal jelly.</p>
<p>We showed that 2–4 m<sc>M</sc> of 10H2DA inhibited LPS-induced IL-6 production from murine macrophage cells. Fresh and pure honeybee royal jelly has been reported to contain &gt;100 m<sc>M</sc> of 10H2DA,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1753425911416022">11</xref></sup> suggesting that &gt;2 m<sc>M</sc> concentrations of 10H2DA is conceivable in gut mucosa when raw royal jelly is eaten. Furthermore, we could detect a modest inhibitory effect of 10H2DA, even by addition 6 h after LPS stimulation (data not shown), suggesting that continuous ingestion of 10H2DA in royal jelly may reduce chronic IκB-ζ-dependent gene expression. Together, 10H2DA in royal jelly could reach a high enough concentration, at least in gut lumen, to inhibit the activation of macrophages and other immune cells, and could be effective for expressing anti-inflammatory effects, especially for ongoing chronic inflammation in the intestine.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we demonstrated that 10H2DA inhibited LPS-induce IκB-ζ production followed by gene expression of IκB-ζ–dependent genes, including IL-6. This is, as far as we know, the first report of a specific inhibitor for IκB-ζ induction. Accumulating evidence that IκB-ζ and IL-6 contribute to inflammatory and autoimmune diseases suggests that 10H2DA may be a therapeutic drug candidate for IκB-ζ– and IL-6–dependent disorders.</p>
