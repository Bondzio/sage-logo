<abstract>
<p>New wind velocity measurement method using a light detection and ranging instrument was conducted. Based on the presented experimental data, the airflow characteristics above a forest were investigated: wind velocity distribution, friction (shear) wind velocity, roughness length, stream lines, drag force, and depth of the boundary layer. The results demonstrated that windward the forest, the boundary layer is shifted and sloped above the forest. Thereby, the fluid streamlines cannot abruptly change direction, as a consequence flat wind velocity profiles, wavy inflected wind velocity profiles, eddies, and flow recirculation were developed; hence, flow separation at a forest ratio <italic>x</italic>/<italic>h</italic> of 2, flow contraction at <italic>x</italic>/<italic>h</italic> of 12, and flow expansion at <italic>x</italic>/<italic>h</italic> of 22 appeared. The shear wind velocity was about 1/10 of the mean wind velocity and the roughness length 1/15 of the forest height. Within a boundary layer depth of about 130 m, the drag force of the forest was 1300 times greater than that of the grass. Behind the forest, the air flow expands and eddies were developed at <italic>x</italic>/<italic>h</italic> of about 7. Passing through the agriculture area and the forest, the physical parameters (turbulent kinetic energy, friction wind velocity, drag force, and depth of the boundary layer) are increasing at the point of roughness increase. To decrease such parameters and to avoid energy and friction losses and damage to trees due to divergence, convergence, separation, and recirculation of airflow, the sharp edge of the forest should be rounded in the range <italic>x</italic>/<italic>h</italic> up to 2. A curved cutting of the front area of the forest may allow to decrease the slope of the boundary layer and the streamlines before, above, and behind the forest and hence lead to a quasi-steady and stable flow with less turbulence, momentum, heat, and mass transfer between the canopy and the atmosphere.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0954406211417944"><title>1 INTRODUCTION</title>
<p>Air flow can be divided into three broad categories: mean wind, turbulence, and waves, as reported by Stull [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954406211417944">1</xref></bold>]. Each can exist in the so-called boundary layer separately or in the presence of any of the others. In physics and fluid mechanics, a boundary layer is the layer of fluid in the immediate vicinity of a bounding surface where effects of viscosity of the fluid are considered in detail. In the Earth’s atmosphere, the planetary boundary layer is the air layer near the ground that is affected by diurnal heat, moisture, or momentum transfer to or from the surface. Therefore, this air layer responds to surface forcing such as frictional drag, evaporation and transpiration,heat transfer, pollutant emission, and terrain-induced flow modification. The thickness of the boundary layer is quite variable in time and space, ranging from hundreds of metres to a few kilometres.</p>
<p>Vegetation is present in a large proportion of emerged land and affects consequently the characteristics of the wind in the lower part of the atmospheric boundary layer. In open literature, previous surveys, such as that of Raupach and Thom [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954406211417944">2</xref></bold>], Raupach <italic>et al.</italic> <bold>[</bold><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0954406211417944">3</xref></bold>], Finnigan [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954406211417944">4</xref></bold>], and Finnigan <italic>et al.</italic> [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954406211417944">5</xref></bold>], are focused on the effect of vegetation on wind, in particular on its turbulent features, rather than on the reverse. Many recent reviews exist on specific aspects of the direct or indirect effects of wind on plants. Therefore, Berry <italic>et al.</italic> [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954406211417944">6</xref></bold>] and Cleugh <italic>et al.</italic> [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0954406211417944">7</xref></bold>] investigated the crop dynamics while Gardiner [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0954406211417944">8</xref></bold>] and Moore and Maguire [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0954406211417944">9</xref></bold>] studied the dynamics of trees. The literature addressing also flow and dispersion in urban areas is spread over many disciplines (meteorology, engineering, geography, and others), with each having a fundamental and an operational aspect, as reported by Britter and Hanna [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0954406211417944">10</xref></bold>]. Wind damage is a serious limiting factor to commercial forestry in many countries. The measurements of Gardiner <italic>et al.</italic> [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0954406211417944">11</xref></bold>] showed that the profiles of different mean wind and turbulence characteristics above the forests are remarkably similar when vertical heights are normalized by the height of the tallest tree but differences do exist within the canopy.</p>
<p>De Langre [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0954406211417944">12</xref></bold>] reported about the large variety of mechanical interactions between wind and plants, from plant organs to plant systems. The outcome of his works shows that a strong coupling between plants and wind exists, in which the plant motion modifies the wind dynamics. The fluid mechanics of wind in the presence of plants and the solid mechanics of plants are themselves quite specific: turbulence is different from its counterpart in classical boundary layers and plant structural dynamics is different from its counterpart in manmade structures. However, the interactions that cause the motion of plants or of parts of plants are caused by mechanisms that are well known in flow-induced vibration. Gaining a good knowledge of air motion in forest vegetation is a necessary step towards a better understanding of a number of major abiotic impacts on the trees such as wind risk, pollutant and nutrient deposition, frost,material dispersion, transport, energy, water, and carbon exchanges. Oliver [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0954406211417944">13</xref></bold>] investigated the wind profiles in and above a forest canopy. It was found that the wind profile above the canopy followed a pure log form with the measured roughness length increasing linearly from 0.75 up to 1.23 m, respectively. Outside the stability range, a log-linear profile could be fitted. The regional roughness of the lands forest and surface shear stress under neutral conditions were studied by Parlange and Brutsaert [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0954406211417944">14</xref></bold>]. Mean wind velocity profiles were measured by means of radio wind sonde over the lands region in southwestern France. Their analysis of neutral profiles indicated the existence of a logarithmic layer between surface roughness and the height above the ground. The profiles showed that the surface roughness of the terrain was around 1.2 m and the displacement height 6.0 m. In a recent survey study, Raupach <italic>et al.</italic> [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0954406211417944">3</xref></bold>] reviewed the current state of knowledge about air flow under ideal conditions. Lee [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0954406211417944">15</xref></bold>] extended the knowledge by employingadvances in the understanding of the flow in ‘non-ideal’ situations. He showed that the Kelvin–Helmholtz instability of the plane mixing flow is responsible for much of the mixing in the lee of a forest edge, because turbulence is generated locally by the instability. The non-ideal situations introduce additional complications such as lack of a constant flux layer, the non-negligible role of the (horizontal) pressure gradient.</p>
<p>Forests represent, aerodynamically, a change in roughness, porosity, and effective height of the surface (zero-plane displacement). This combination of aerodynamic changes suggests that the transition process is likely to be more complex than the changes associated with low vegetation. Raynor [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0954406211417944">16</xref></bold>] investigated the wind structure in a coniferous forest and a contiguous field. Wind velocity measurements were obtained using five 14-m high triangular steel towers. The growth of the equilibrium layer downwind of a forest has been observed by Gash [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0954406211417944">17</xref></bold>] using eddy correlation measurements made in real time. Wind velocity and turbulence measurements were obtained on a flat terrain at the Thetford Forest in East Anglia, England. His results demonstrated that the atmosphere adjusts more quickly to the transition from heath to forest than to the transition from forest to heath. Irvine <italic>et al.</italic> [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0954406211417944">18</xref></bold>] studied the evolution of the turbulence across a forest edge. An experiment was set up to investigate the adjustment of turbulence over a roughness transition (moorland to forest). Results from this experiment support the development of an internal boundary layer (IBL) at the transition, which propagates upwards by turbulent diffusion as a function of distance downwind from the transition. Results indicate that fetch should exceed 25 times the height of the measurement above the zero planes for flux equilibrium.</p>
<p>Investigators commonly use classical methods forthe experimental investigation of forests. These methods allow the measurement of a local deformation, displacement, rotation, wind velocity, or acceleration by implementing a strain gauge [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0954406211417944">19</xref></bold>] an optical target monitoring [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0954406211417944">20</xref></bold>, <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0954406211417944">21</xref></bold>], an electromagnetic tracking system [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0954406211417944">22</xref></bold>] an inclinometer [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0954406211417944">23</xref></bold>], a Doppler velocimeter, or an accelerometer. All these techniques are well adapted for large plants and have been developed essentially for trees. Some applications exist for lighter plants, such as crops by Berry <italic>et al.</italic> [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0954406211417944">24</xref></bold>], although their effect on plant dynamics may be difficult to assess. More recently, researchers have used image-processing techniques based on video recording for individual plants [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0954406211417944">25</xref></bold>, <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0954406211417944">26</xref></bold>]. For measuring the motion of a whole canopy, image correlation (similar to particle image velocimetry) from video is well suited, as shown by Py <italic>et al.</italic> [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0954406211417944">27</xref></bold>, <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0954406211417944">28</xref></bold>] for wheat and alfalfa crops and by Diener <italic>et al.</italic> [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0954406211417944">29</xref></bold>] for a small tree. The use of radar-based techniques, which have wider applications in agronomy monitoring, allows the detection of the motion of crops and trees [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0954406211417944">30</xref></bold>]. Video or radar experiments on canopies have the immense advantage of being non-intrusive and yield data for many points at the same time. Light detection and ranging (LIDAR) is an active remote sensing technique using electromagnetic waves, with wavelengths between 250 nm and 11 µm. First mentioned in the 1950s [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0954406211417944">31</xref></bold>], different LIDAR systems were developed in the following decades to measure temperature, humidity, trace gases, and wind in the atmosphere.</p>
<p>Doppler LIDAR is a special type designed to measure wind velocity based on the Doppler effect. The light of an IR laser is scattered by aerosol particles and small hydrometeors which move with the wind. The frequency shift is typically detected using a coherent detection technique. A technical implementation of a Doppler LIDAR system can be found in Grund <italic>et al.</italic> [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0954406211417944">32</xref></bold>]. Today, Doppler LIDARs are reliable instruments designed for operation. There are a wide variety of applications of LIDAR such as in agriculture, archaeology, biology and conservation, geology and soil science, hydrology, military, physics and astronomy, robotics, surveying, and transportation. They are well established in atmospheric boundary layer research under a variety of different atmospheric conditions and scientific questions, e.g. Person <italic>et al.</italic> [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0954406211417944">33</xref></bold>], Lothon <italic>et al.</italic> [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0954406211417944">34</xref></bold>], and Frehlich <italic>et al.</italic> [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0954406211417944">35</xref></bold>].</p>
<p>Most of the present knowledge on the wind-induced motion of vegetation and wind flow near forest is based on experimental data; thereby, strongly influencing models are developed, such as the ones by Tunick [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0954406211417944">36</xref></bold>], Lalic <italic>et al.</italic> [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0954406211417944">37</xref></bold>], Lopes da Costa <italic>et al.</italic> [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0954406211417944">38</xref></bold>], and Kochanski <italic>et al.</italic> [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0954406211417944">39</xref></bold>]. In order to better understand the behaviour of the turbulent flow around forests, numerical simulations have been performed by Frank and Ruck [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0954406211417944">40</xref></bold>], Sellier <italic>et al.</italic> [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0954406211417944">41</xref></bold>], Chamorro and Porté-Agel [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0954406211417944">42</xref></bold>], Dalpě and Masson [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0954406211417944">43</xref></bold>], Dupotd and Brunet [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0954406211417944">44</xref></bold>], Sörgel <italic>et al.</italic> [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0954406211417944">45</xref></bold>], Dupont and Brunet [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0954406211417944">46</xref></bold>], Queck and Bernhofer [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0954406211417944">47</xref></bold>], and Fernando [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0954406211417944">48</xref></bold>]. The results obtained using the proposed methods show good agreement with the measured turbulence intensity; however, the wind speed is often underestimated. Some result shows that a difference between measured and calculated data of about 40 per cent could occur.</p>
<p>In a fluid mechanical context, the most pressing problems include the treatments of atmospheric stability in forest areas and arbitrary spatial variations in surface roughness. The understanding of turbulent behaviour in flowing fluids is one of the most intriguing problems in all of classical physics. Forests are responsible for a substantial part of turbulent transfer of momentum, heat, and mass in the atmospheric boundary layer. In order to better understand the behaviour of the turbulent flow, the purpose of this study is to investigate the flow characteristics of the wind before, over, and behind the forest using an LIDAR measurement device. These flow characteristics are the wind velocity distribution, the frictional (shear) wind velocity, the roughness length, the stream lines, the drag force, and the depth of the boundary layer. Therefore, analytical and experimental investigations are necessary. First, the analytical study is presented in the next section.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-0954406211417944"><title>2 DEFINITION AND ANALYSIS</title>
<p>Surface roughness, often shortened to roughness, is a measure of the texture of a surface. It is quantified by the vertical deviations of a real surface from its ideal form. If these deviations are large, the surface is rough; if they are small the surface is smooth. Roughness plays an important role in determining how a real object will interact with its environment. Rough surfaces usually wear more quickly and have higher friction coefficients than smooth surfaces. Over land, the individual roughness elements may be packed very closely together and then, the top of those elements begins to act like a displaced surface. Generally in some canopies, the trees are close enough together to make a solid-looking mass of leaves, giving a similar effect, namely, the average roof–top level begins to act on the flow like a displaced surface, as reported by Stull [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954406211417944">1</xref></bold>]. The distance (<italic>x</italic>) downwind from a change in the surface roughness is called fetch. By surface-layer measurements, it is necessary to locate the instrument far enough downwind of the border so that the depth of the IBL (<italic>δ</italic>) is greater that the height of the instrument. Thus, with sufficiently large fetch, the surface-layer measurements are characteristic of the local field in which the instruments are located.</p>
<p>Above a canopy top, the wind profile increases logarithmically with height. Therefore, the log wind profile is a semi-empirical relationship used to describe the vertical distribution of horizontal wind speeds above the ground within the atmospheric surface layer. The relationship is well described in the planetary boundary layer literature. The logarithmic profile of wind speeds is generally limited to thelowest 100 m of the atmosphere (i.e. the surface layer of the atmospheric boundary layer). In the free atmosphere, geostrophic wind relationships should be used. The equation to estimate the wind speed (<italic>u<sub>z</sub></italic>) at height <italic>z</italic>(m) above the ground, [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954406211417944">1</xref></bold>] and [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0954406211417944">10</xref></bold>], is
<disp-formula id="disp-formula1-0954406211417944"><label>(1)</label><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954406211417944-eq1.tif"/></disp-formula>
where <italic>u</italic><sub>*</sub> is the friction (or shear) wind velocity, <italic>κ</italic> the von Karman’s constant, <italic>d</italic> the zero-plane displacement, <italic>z</italic><sub>0</sub> the surface roughness, <italic>φ</italic> a stability term, and <italic>L</italic> the Monin–Obukhov stability parameter. Under neutral stability conditions, <italic>z</italic>/<italic>L</italic> = 0 and <italic>φ</italic> drops out. The distance parameters <italic>z, d, z</italic><sub>0,</sub> <italic>δ</italic>, and <italic>x</italic> are defined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954406211417944">Fig. 1</xref>. Zero-plane displacement (<italic>d</italic>) is the height above the ground at which zero wind speed is achieved as a result of flow obstacles such as trees or buildings.
<fig id="fig1-0954406211417944" position="float"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Flow over forest canopy showing the growth of depth, <italic>δ</italic> as a function of fetch, <italic>x</italic> height, <italic>z</italic> surface displaced distance <italic>d</italic>, and roughness length <italic>z</italic><sub>0</sub></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954406211417944-fig1.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>Roughness length (<italic>z</italic><sub>0</sub>) is a corrective measure to account for the effect of the roughness of a surface on wind flow and is between 1/10 and 1/30 of the average height of the roughness elements on the ground. Over smooth, open water, expect a value around 0.0002 m, whereas over flat, open grassland <italic>z</italic><sub>0</sub> &gt; 0.005 m, cropland &gt; 0.1–0.25 m, and brush or forest &gt; 0.5–1.0 m (values above 1 m are rare and indicate excessively rough terrain).</p>
<p>The von Karman’s constant (<italic>κ</italic>) in equation (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula1-0954406211417944">1</xref>) is supposed a universal constant that is not a function of the flow or the surface. The precise value of this constant has yet to be agreed on, but most investigators feel that it is either near 0.35 or 0.4. For engineering purposes, the wind gradient is modelled as a simple shear exhibiting a vertical wind velocity profile varying according to a power law with a constant exponential coefficient based on surface type. The height above ground where surface friction has a negligible effect on wind speed is called the ‘gradient height’ and the wind speed above this height is assumed to be a constant and called the ‘gradient wind speed’. Although the power law exponent approximation is convenient, it has no theoretical basis as reported by Tiwari and Ghosal. [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0954406211417944">49</xref></bold>]. The log wind profile is generally considered to be a more reliable estimator than the wind profile power law which is commonly used when neutral conditions are assumed and roughness information is not available.</p>
<p>Shear wind velocity, also called friction wind velocity or Reynolds stress, is a form by which a shear stress may be re-written in units of wind velocity. It is useful as a method in fluid mechanics to compare true velocities, such as the wind velocity of a flow in a stream, to a wind velocity that relates shear between layers of flow. Shear wind velocity is used to describe shear-related motion in moving fluids. It is used to describe:
<list id="list1-0954406211417944" list-type="alpha-lower">
<list-item><p>diffusion and dispersion of particles, tracers, and contaminants in fluid flows;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>wind velocity profile near the boundary of a flow;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>transport of sediment in a channel.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>Shear wind velocity also helps in thinking about the rate of shear and dispersion in a flow. A general rule is that the shear wind velocity is about 1/10 of the mean flow wind velocity. For the determination of the friction (or shear) wind velocity <italic>u<sub>*</sub></italic> above the forest, under a thermal neutral conditions, the well-known logarithmic law equation (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula1-0954406211417944">1</xref>) can be re-written as

and for the calculation of the friction wind velocity above the open grassland, in front of the forest, equation (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula2-0954406211417944">2</xref>) can be expressed as

<p>Based on the experimental data of the wind speed and the given dimensions of the forest and roughness, the friction wind velocity above the forest and the open grassland can be then determined by equations (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula2-0954406211417944">2</xref>) and (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula3-0954406211417944">3</xref>), respectively.</p>
<p>In fluid dynamics, drag (sometimes called air resistance or fluid resistance) refers to forces that oppose the relative motion of an object through a fluid (a liquid or gas). Drag forces act in a direction opposite to the oncoming flow wind velocity. Wind on a plant surface causes local skin friction and pressure drag. Depending on the scale of interest, the plant or subsets of the plant may be regarded either as a bluff body surrounded by air flow such as an individual leaf or as a porous body with through flow such as a tree crown. The drag load is commonly expressed as

<p>A WindTracer Doppler LIDAR manufactured byLockheed Martine Coherent Technologies was used to measure the wind field across a forest edge. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954406211417944">Figure 2</xref> shows the major exterior system of the WindTracer [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0954406211417944">52</xref></bold>]. These are the scanner head, the air conditioner, GPS antenna, and the boxes of filter, data, and mains power. The air conditioner unit provided an environmental control to the shelter. It is designed to minimize the amount of air exchanged from the outside to the inside of the shelter and to reduce the build-up of humidity on the system.

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954406211417944">Figure 3</xref> shows a typical configuration for ground-based wind sensing. The equipment shelter contains the Doppler LIDAR equipment and is the location from which the actual remote sensing takes place. The environmental equipment shelter includes the scanner, the transceiver, and the signal processor. The laser radiation emanates from the transceiver and is directed into the atmosphere by the computer-controlled scanner. The backscattered laser radiation is collected and processed by the transceiver, control electronics, and signal processor to produce various data products. These data products are then displayed locally and/or broadcast to other locations. The environmental equipment shelter is connectedtothe remaining equipment locations via an Ethernet connection. The remote operator station contains the primary Doppler LIDAR remote control and monitoring station and is connected to the shelter via an Ethernet connection. RASP-GUI stands forreal time advanced signal processor graphical userinterface. Referring to reference [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0954406211417944">52</xref></bold>], the WindTracer provides a peak power of 4.5 kW with a pulse repetition frequency of 500 Hz.

<p>The basic principle operation of the WindTracer is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954406211417944">Fig. 4</xref>. A pulse laser light is generated and emitted into the atmosphere. As the light travels away from the system, small portions of the light are reflected back to the system by very small particles in the air called aerosols. This pulse of light leaves the laser and when the reflected light returned, a distance to the particle that reflected the light can be determined. In addition, by measuring the frequencies of the original pulse and the reflected light, a shift in frequency can be measured (called a Doppler shift). The Doppler shift is induced by the component of the wind velocity of the particle directly towards or away from the laser. By analysing the frequency shift, a direct measurement of the radial component of wind velocity of the aerosol particle is made. The length of the pulses transmitted by the system is in the 50–100 m range and pulses are transmitted roughly 500 times/s. This means that the beam is a series of pencils that are emitted every 2 ms and measure 50–80 m long by 10–30 cm wide, depending on the distance away from the system. LIDAR accuracy is generally stated in vertical direction as the horizontal accuracy is indirectly controlled by the vertical accuracy. This is also due to the fact that determination of horizontal accuracy for LIDAR data is difficult due to the difficulty in locating ground control points corresponding to the LIDAR coordinates. The vertical accuracy is determined by comparing the <italic>z</italic> coordinates of data with the true elevations of a reference (which is generally a flat surface). The LIDAR accuracy is stated as a root mean square error) and is about 0.196 m. Generally, the LIDAR registers a wind velocity range from 0 up to 60 m/s with an accuracy of about 0.2 m/s. To estimate a random error, the autocorrelation function of the measured velocity was calculated. Under optimal LIDAR conditions, that is, a clear butaerosol-loaded non-turbulent atmosphere, the WindTracer has an uncorrelated error of less than 0.15 m/s. Hence, the uncertainty of the measured wind velocity and the shear wind velocity was ±0.1 and ±0.15 per cent, respectively.

<p>To measure the wind field across a forest edge using Doppler LIDAR, a field campaign was performed in Hatzenbühl (southwest Germany) during winter 2010–11. This area was chosen due to the ideal location, measurements conditions, free grass field, and suitable forest height. The chosen forest edge has a length of about 1.8 km and is aligned nearly perpendicular to the main wind flow direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954406211417944">Fig. 5</xref>). The measurement site was located approximately 1.5 km away from the edge in a harvested field. The wind velocity is measured in 120 so-called range gates along the laser beam with a length of 60 m each which can be freely arranged from about 350 m to 10 km away from the LIDAR instrument. The line-of-sight wind velocity is measured with a precision of about 15 cm/s in the high signal-to-noise range. The LIDAR was located in 1250 m far away from the forest edge.

</sec>
<sec id="sec4-0954406211417944"><title>4 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</title>
<p>A series of experiments using the Doppler LIDAR was conducted to measure the wind speed above a forest and hence to apply the wind velocity profiles. As an example, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0954406211417944">Fig. 6</xref> shows the wind velocity profiles of the wind in front of the forest and above it as a function of the altitude <italic>z</italic> and distance <italic>x</italic> (fetch). The wind velocity profiles in wind direction are presented along the fetch by a LIDAR deviation beam angle ranging from 0° up to 10°. In fluid dynamics, the no-slip condition for viscous fluids states that at a solid boundary, the fluid will have zero wind velocity relative to the boundary. Hence, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0954406211417944">Fig. 6</xref>, the wind speed before and above the forest varies approximately logarithmically with height in the surface layer. Frictional drag causes the wind speed to become zero close to the ground (fetch from 400 up to 1250 m) and also direct above the surface of the forest (fetch from 1250 up to 2200 m), while the pressure gradient force cause the wind to increase with height. The logarithmic wind velocity distribution appears to be universal in character, determined only by the wall condition and the distance from the wall.
<fig id="fig6-0954406211417944" position="float"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption><p>Measured wind velocity profile of the wind in front of the forest and above it as a function of the altitude z and the distance x (fetch)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954406211417944-fig6.tif"/></fig></p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0954406211417944">Figure 7(a)</xref> and (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0954406211417944">b</xref>) presents the two selected wind velocity profiles in the front of and above the forest, respectively. Comparison of the two wind profiles at a distance of 1000 m (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0954406211417944">Fig. 7(a)</xref>) and 1750 m (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0954406211417944">Fig. 7(b)</xref>) from the LIDAR clearly shows the influence of theforest on the wind velocity distribution and the shape of the wind velocity profile and hence on the flow characteristic. Collectively, the measured main wind velocity distribution above the ground of the open grassland and in front of and above the forest is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0954406211417944">Fig. 8</xref>; in total, the value of the wind velocity depending on the altitude and fetch was in the range 4 up to 7 m/s. Hereby, the velocity distribution is the vertical distribution of the wind velocities measured in the horizontal direction. If the air flow had the same average wind velocity in all the points, the quantity of the fluid passing upstream would be the same as the actual total flow. The average and the maximum values of the wind velocity at several horizontal positions are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0954406211417944">Fig. 9</xref>. The maximum velocity is spatially and temporally distributed and defined as the highest value that is encountered within a measured profile. The average wind velocity, applied from the measured data, is between 5 and 6 m/s, where the maximum wind velocity is to be arranged in higher range of about 6 up to 7 m/s. Generally, in the turbulent flow, there is random mixing between the layers of fluid. Due to this mixing, the wind velocity distribution is much more uniform. As a consequence, the mixing has a positive effect on heat transfer. The negative effect of this mixing is wind velocity and pressure pulsations, which can be induced and administrated to a diversity in flow distribution and hence to different flow types. Hence, based on the measured wind velocity,the wind velocity profile can be classified into two types. First, the flow type A exists at a distance of about 300–600 m in front of the forest. In this fetch range presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0954406211417944">Fig. 9</xref>, it can be seen that the difference between the average and the maximum values is relatively less than 0.3 m/s. This means that the maximum wind velocity of the wind speed along the altitude remains relatively constant. Therefore, the wind velocity profiles do not seem to be parabolic but rather flatter. The face profile is very flat. The general shape of this profile type is similar to the known profile over a smooth plate. From the distance of 600 m windward, the entire flat face can vary greatly, depending on the distribution of the wind moving upstream the forest edge and on the upstream pressure. Hence, the second flow type, marked as B, exists before and above the forest and can be described as a wavy inflected profile. Hereby, the difference between the average and the maximum wind velocities increased up to 2 m/s.
<fig id="fig7-0954406211417944" position="float"><label>Fig. 7</label><caption><p>Wind wind velocity (a) in front of the forest against altitude; (b) above the forest against altitude</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954406211417944-fig7.tif"/></fig>

<fig id="fig9-0954406211417944" position="float"><label>Fig. 9</label><caption><p>Average and maximum values of the horizontal wind speed as a function of the horizontal positions, fetch</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954406211417944-fig9.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>At a fetch of about 1000 m, which is a distance of about 230 m in front of the forest edge, the maximum wind velocity is about 6 m/s but it increases up to 6.5 m/s at a distance of 1600 m, which is corresponding to a distance of about 370 m above the forest. This increase in wind velocity is due to the flow separationin front of the forest edge. The airflow is unable to follow the sharp edge of the forest. As a result, there is flow separation, creating recirculation in the separation zones of the forest corner. Due to the existence of the forest, the effect of higher roughness on the wind velocity profile is more significant at a distance of more than 1200 m. A consideration of the demonstrated wind velocity profiles in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0954406211417944">Fig. 6</xref> presents that the airflow closer to the forest surface is held back because of the additional shear. This, in turn, causes the wind velocity profile to become a peak in front and hence a maximum wind velocity, which is higher than the average wind velocity.</p>
<p>In the region from 1300 up to 1600 m, above the forest, the difference between the average and the maximum wind velocities of about 1.3 m/s remains constant, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0954406211417944">Fig. 9</xref>, where at a distance of more than 1600 m, this difference implements a substantial change in values. The outcome of this is that the main flow is contracted between the separated flow areas (contraction region 1300–1600 m) and later on expands again to cover the forest (expansion region &gt; 1600 m). Hence, flow recirculation was developed in the lower part of the flow contraction and expansion region, at a distance of 1600 up to 1900 m, expectedly the airflow then slows down. Hence, the wavy inflected profile of type B is quickly replaced by profile type A, the known logarithmic one.The profile is fully equilibrated with the upwardly substantial surface of the forest. The reason for this phenomenon is that fluid streamlines cannot abruptly change direction. In the case of both the airflow abovethe ground of the open grassland and against the sudden change in the roughness height, due to the existence of trees, the streamlines are unable to follow the sharp angle of the forest. The converging streamlines follow a smooth path, which results in the narrowing of the jet (flow contraction). The ratio of the fetch above the forest and the height of the forest (<italic>h</italic> = <italic>d + z</italic><sub>0</sub> = 30 m) is defined as a forest ratio <italic>x/h</italic>. Therefore, the contraction region was identified in a fetch of 370 m above the forest, which corresponds to a forest ratio of about 12.</p>
<p>Flow separation occurs when the boundary layer travels far enough against an adverse pressure gradient that the speed of the boundary layer falls almost to zero. The airflow becomes detached from the ground surface in front of the forest, called detached region, and instead takes the forms of eddies and vortices in eddies region 1000 up to 1250 m. In aerodynamics, flow separation can often result in increased drag, particularly pressure drag which is caused by the pressure difference between the front of the forest and the rear surfaces of the ground as it travels through the fluid. For this reason, much effort and research has gone into the design of aerodynamic and hydrodynamic surfaces which delay flow separation and keep the local flow attached for as long as possible. However, the boundary layer separation occurs when the flow in the boundary layer closest to the forest reverses its direction. As a result, the overall boundary layer initially thickens suddenly and is then forced off the surface by the reversed flow at its bottom. Consequentially and out of the above-mentioned results, interpretations of the trend and gradient of streamlines of the airflow before and above the forest may be reproduced and illustrated as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0954406211417944">Fig. 10</xref>. This illustration is based on the following experimental results:

<p>In total, the boundary layer thickening on the surfaces cause a relatively high displacement of the streamlines. Fluid that was in the boundary layers forms the viscous wake behind the forest edge.</p>
<p>The flow characteristics behind the forest were investigated by measuring the air wind velocity in a direction opposite to the unchanged LIDAR position, even when the wind flows in the opposite way. Again, a series of experiments using the LIDAR instrument was conducted to measure the wind speed above and behind the forest, where the air flows from forest to the open field. Based on the measured data, wind velocity profiles were then applied. As an example, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0954406211417944">Fig. 11</xref> shows a wind velocity profile of the wind down the forest and above it as a function of the altitude <italic>z</italic> and distance <italic>x</italic> (fetch). The wind velocity profiles in wind direction are presented along the fetch by an LIDAR deviation beam angle ranging from 0° up to 10°. They vary approximately logarithmically with height in the surface layer, as expected. The average and the maximum values of the wind velocity for the opposite situation are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-0954406211417944">Fig. 12</xref>. Thereby, the average wind velocity varies from approximately 5.7 up to 11.6 m/s, while the maximum wind velocity was is in higher range of about 7 up to 14.5 m/s. In total, the wind velocity decreases in wind direction with lower altitude and fetch. Based on the measured wind velocity, two different wind velocity profile types A and B are classified. At a distance of less than 600 m away from the LIDAR instrument, it can be seen that the difference between the average and the maximum values is relatively less than 1 m/s. This means that the wind velocity along the altitude remains relatively constant. Therefore, the wind velocity profiles do not seem to be parabolic but rather flatter. The face profile along the altitude is very flat; hereby a wind velocity profile of type A could be identified at the distance 0–600 m. The second flow type marked as B exists at a distance of more than 600 m and forward above the forest. The difference between the maximum and average wind velocity increases from 1 up to 6 m/s direct to the forest edge and up to 3 m/s above the forest. Due to this relative high difference, the type flow B is described as a wavy inflected profile. Close to the forest edge, the flow expands and hence decelerates in wind direction and flow recirculation could be developed as a consequence. Thereafter, the air flows as a fully developed flow and the wind velocity profile type A exists. However, the turbulent transport as a feature of both mixing layers and canopies was affected due to the intersection of wind velocity profile type B with A.

Based on the above-presented LIDAR experimental data of the wind velocity before and above the forest, the friction wind velocity can be then determined using equations (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula2-0954406211417944">2</xref>) and (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula3-0954406211417944">3</xref>), respectively. Herein, the Karman constant <italic>κ</italic> is taken to be 0.4 as reported by most researchers, such as by Britter and Hanna [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0954406211417944">10</xref></bold>] and Kochanski <italic>et al.</italic> [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0954406211417944">39</xref></bold>]. The surface roughness <italic>z</italic><sub>0</sub> represented by the aerodynamic roughness length is defined as the height where the wind velocity of the airflow becomes zero. The ground surface in front of the forest includes grasses that are approximately 3 cm in height. Therefore, the surface roughness length of the open grassland before the forest is taken to be 0.006 m, as suggested by Stull [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954406211417944">1</xref></bold>]. The aerodynamic roughness length above the forest was determined by a graphical method, as presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14-0954406211417944">Fig. 14</xref>, which shows the measured wind velocity profile above the forest against the altitude. By extrapolating all the measured wind speed profiles towards the height, the ordinate axis of the altitude where the wind velocity becomes zero, the displacement <italic>d</italic>, and hence the surface roughness <italic>z</italic><sub>0</sub> were 28 and 2 m, respectively. The surface roughness length of the open grassland in front of the forest (0.006 m) isless than that above the forest (2 m). As expected, higher roughness elements are associated with larger aerodynamic roughness lengths. In all cases, the aerodynamic roughness length is smaller than the physical height of the roughness elements. In total, the roughness length was about 1/15 of the forest height. As an example, the friction wind velocity profiles, calculated by equations (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula2-0954406211417944">2</xref>) and (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula3-0954406211417944">3</xref>), is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15-0954406211417944">Fig. 15</xref> as a function of the altitude. It can be seen that the shape of the friction wind velocity profile above the forest is different from that in front of the forest, due to the different roughness length. The average wind velocity of the profile above the forest of about 1 m/s is higher than that in front of the forest of about 0.02 m/s.

<p>In total, the friction wind velocity distributions windward and above the forest are clearly represented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig16-0954406211417944">Fig 16</xref>. The friction wind velocity varied between 0.15 and 0.385 m/s windward the forest and between 0.4 up to 0.88 m/s above the forest. By the smooth grass surface windward the forest, the friction wind velocity decreases in average from 0.2 to 0.1 m/s at a distance 400 m up to the forest edge at 1200 m. The low friction wind velocity can be identified in the location of the eddy region. Directly at the edge of the forest, the friction wind velocity has then a step increase and it is of about 0.6 m/s in average above the forest. In the contraction, expansion, reattachment, and recirculation regions, the average friction wind velocity decreases slightly up to 0.5 m/s. This phenomenon can be explained as follows: when air flows from a smooth surface to a rough surface, the air in the IBL decelerates above the rough surface. This results in horizontal convergence and upward motion above the boundary between smooth and rough. Therefore, during the surface change from smooth (in front of the forest) to rough (above the forest), the friction wind velocity decreases initially and then has a step increase overshooting its final equilibrium value above the forest. Towards about 2000 m distance, the surface stress represented by the friction wind velocity falls silently to a final equilibrium state that is larger than that over the smooth surface. As a consequence, turbulent kinetic energy increases at the point of roughness increase.

<p>The results obtained for the friction wind velocity windward and above the forest are compared at constant altitude for each location and presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig17-0954406211417944">Fig. 17</xref>. As can be observed, the values applied above the open grassland are not close to that above the forest. The values are uniformly grouped under the diagonal, which represents the ideal case of zero deviation between the values. The friction velocities above the forest are up to 50 per cent greater than that above the ground of the open grassland. In summary, the measurements have confirmed that the kinematic stress directly above the forest varies greatly with height and shows a local maximum in the roughness layer. In total, the shear wind velocity is about 1/10 of the mean wind velocity.

<p>The theory of the Prandtl boundary layer has proved to be exceptionally useful and has given stimulation to research into fluid mechanics since the beginning of this century. One of the most important applications of boundary layer theory is the calculation of the friction drag of bodies in a flow, e.g. the drag of a forest. Based on the LDAR experimental data, the drag force of the investigated forest can be calculated using equation (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula4-0954406211417944">4</xref>). The density of the air at the standard atmospheric pressure is taken to be 1.29 kg/m<sup>3</sup> and the wind speed specific frontal area of the tested forest (30 × 300 m<sup>2</sup>) is 9000 m<sup>2</sup> and that of the tested ground with a grass height of 0.03 m is then 9 m<sup>2</sup>. The drag coefficient of about 1 was taken as an average value of the measurement data of Gromke and Ruck [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0954406211417944">50</xref></bold>], which was delivered for trees from 0.8 up to 1.2. The drag coefficient of grass of about 0.38 was taken as an average value of the measurement data of Gillies <italic>et al.</italic> [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0954406211417944">53</xref></bold>], which was between 0.34 and 0.42. Hence, the drag force with an average wind velocity of 5 m/s, applied from the presented results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0954406211417944">Fig. 9</xref>, was determined using equation (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula4-0954406211417944">4</xref>) to be 58.05 kN by the rough surface (forest) and only about 4.42 N by the smoother surface (grass). The drag force of the forest is then 1300 times greater than that of the grass. Therefore, rougher surfaces are likely to cause more intense turbulence, which increase the drag and transfer rates across the surface. The geometrical parameters for the calculation of the drag forces are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0954406211417944">Table 2</xref>.

<p>The boundary layer depth is simply the thickness of the viscous boundary layer region. Because the main effect of viscosity is to slow the fluid near a wall, the edge of the viscous region is found at the point where the fluid wind velocity is essentially equal to the free-stream wind velocity. Since the thickness of the atmospheric boundary layer is determined by the height at which surface friction no longer affects the general flow of the wind, the boundary layer thickness depends on the shape and condition on the surface of the forest. The boundary layer depth <italic>δ</italic> above the investigated forest and along a fetch of 1100 m was calculated using equations (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula5-0954406211417944">5</xref>) and (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula6-0954406211417944">6</xref>) to be about 130 m. Therefore, the roughness lengths upwind and above of the forest, given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0954406211417944">Table 1</xref>, were taken to be 0.03 and 30 m, respectively. The parameter <italic>a</italic>, determined by equation (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula6-0954406211417944">6</xref>), was equal to about 0.95 and the parameter <italic>b</italic> was taken to be 0.8 for statically neutral condition, as suggested by Panofsky <italic>et al.</italic> [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0954406211417944">51</xref></bold>].</p>
<p>Trees can sustain damage from many different sources. Heavy snows, strong winds, and flooding can all create significant injury at different points in the development of trees. To avoid such damages due to the strong wind, the sharp edge of the front area of the forest should be rounded in a windward distance of 70 m, corresponding to <italic>x</italic>/<italic>h</italic> of about 2. The curved cutting of the trees in front can decrease the slope of the boundary layer and the streamlines before, above, and behind the forest. Consequently, the convergent (contraction), divergent (expansion), separation, and recirculation of the airflow could also be decreased and hence a less energy loss, friction loss, turbulence interchange, mass transfer, and heat transfer.</p>
<p>In literature, the velocity profiles are investigated and discussed at different geometrical and flow parameters as well as measurements conditions and methods. Nevertheless, a qualitative comparison between the presented data and the literature results of references [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954406211417944">2</xref></bold>–<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954406211417944">5</xref></bold><bold>]</bold>, [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0954406211417944">8</xref></bold><bold>]</bold>, [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0954406211417944">10</xref></bold><bold>]</bold>, [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0954406211417944">13</xref></bold><bold>]</bold>, [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0954406211417944">15</xref></bold><bold>]</bold>, [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0954406211417944">37</xref></bold><bold>]</bold>, [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0954406211417944">38</xref></bold><bold>]</bold>, [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0954406211417944">40</xref></bold><bold>]</bold>, [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0954406211417944">43</xref></bold><bold>]</bold>, [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0954406211417944">46</xref></bold><bold>]</bold>, [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0954406211417944">48</xref></bold><bold>],</bold> and [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0954406211417944">50</xref></bold>] showed similar behaviours on the velocity distribution, shape, and type of velocity profile, as an example, a flat and wavy inflected profile. The inflexion point plays a critical role in canopy dynamics as reported by Finnigan [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954406211417944">4</xref></bold>]. Therefore, the study of Finnigan [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954406211417944">4</xref></bold>] presented a set of ‘family portraits’ of single-point turbulence statistics measured in near-neutral flow in 12 horizontally homogeneous canopies, ranging from wind tunnel models through cereal crops to forests. Comparison with the statistics and instability modes of the plane mixing layer shows that the latter rather than the boundary layer is the appropriate model for canopy flow and that the dominant large eddies are the result of an inviscid instability of the inflected mean velocity profile. Aerodynamic drag on the foliage is the cause both of the unstable inflected velocity profile and of a ‘spectral short cut’ mechanism that removes energy from large eddies and diverts it to fine scales, where it is rapidly dissipated, bypassing the inertial eddy-cascade. In total, the shear velocity of about 1/10 of the mean velocity and the roughness length of 1/15 of the forest height conformed and met the ranges presented in literature.</p>

<sec id="sec5-0954406211417944"><title>5 CONCLUSIONS</title>
<p>In order to understand the behaviour of the turbulent flow around the forests, the wind velocity distribution measured by LIDAR was analysed to investigate the flow characteristic parameters. The distribution and the rates of mass and heat transfer as well as the turbulent transport depend on the details of separation, contraction, expansion, and reattached flow before and over the forest. A series of experiments were conducted to measure the wind-speed profile above a forest. The wind speed before and above the forest varies approximately logarithmically with height in the surface layer. However, the average wind velocity was between 5 and 6 m/s and the maximum wind velocity in higher range of about 6 up to 7 m/s. Two different wind velocity profile types were demonstrated; the flow type A does not seem to be parabolic but rather flatter and type B described as a wavy inflected profile. The fully developed region described by the profile type A was identified at a distance of 230 m in front of the forest and then an eddy region was developed up to forest edge. Above the forest, different flow regions were defined:
<list id="list4-0954406211417944" list-type="alpha-lower">
<list-item><p>separation region at a forest ratio <italic>x/h</italic> of about 2;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>contraction region at <italic>x/h</italic> of about 12;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>expansion region at <italic>x/h</italic> of about 22;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>reattachment region at <italic>x/h</italic> between 22 and 25;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>recirculation region starting from the sharp edge of the forest up to <italic>x/h</italic> of about 22.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>The flow characteristics behind the forest were also investigated by measuring the air wind velocity in a direction opposite to the unchanged LIDAR position, even when the wind flows in an opposite way. Again a series of experiments using the LIDAR instrument were conducted to measure the wind-speed profile. Thereby, the average wind velocity is varied from approximately 5 up to 11.6 m/s, where the maximum wind velocity was to be arranged in higher range of about 7 up to 14.5 m/s; hereby, the two different wind velocity profile types A and B were classified. Behind the forest, different flow regions were defined:
<list id="list5-0954406211417944" list-type="alpha-lower">
<list-item><p>quasi-fully developed region, above the forest;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>expansion region that existed at 230 m after the edge of the forest at <italic>x</italic>/<italic>h</italic> of 7;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>reattachment region, 630 m away from the forest at <italic>x</italic>/<italic>h</italic> of 21;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>eddies region that exists below the expansion and the reattachment regions;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>fully developed region, windward above the open grassland.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>Large eddies are responsible for a substantial part of the turbulent transfer of momentum, heat, and mass between the canopy and the atmosphere. The surface roughness length of the open grassland in front of the forest (0.006 m) is less than that above the forest (2 m). During the surface change from smooth (before the forest) to rough (above the forest), the friction wind velocity decreases initially and then has a step increase, overshooting its final equilibrium value above the forest. In total, the shear wind velocity is about 1/10 of the mean wind velocity.</p>
<p>The drag force of the tested forest was 1300 times greater than that of the grassland. Therefore, rougher surfaces are likely to cause more intense turbulence, which increases the drag and transfer rates across the surface. The boundary layer depth above the forest was about 130 m calculated in a fetch of 1100 m. The boundary layer depth <italic>δ</italic> above the investigated forest and along a fetch of 1100 m was about 130 m.</p>
<p>As forest edges are often associated with wind damage, it may be of interest to modify the edge region in order to reduce wind-induced risks. To avoid the energy and friction losses and damages to trees due to the convergent, divergent, separation, and recirculation of the airflow, the sharp edge of the forest at the front should be rounded in a range of <italic>x</italic>/<italic>h</italic> of more than 2.</p>
