<abstract>
<p>Trauma is associated with significant acute morbidity and mortality. However, advances in the delivery of trauma care have resulted in considerable improvements in the short-term mortality from trauma. Recent studies have shown that survivors of trauma are at significant risk of delayed long-term mortality that is above that expected for a similar uninjured cohort of patients. Few studies have provided a detailed analysis of the determinants of this increased risk of death, and even fewer publications have examined the causes of death in these patients. This information is relevant because an increased number of patients will survive their injuries as acute trauma care continues to improve. It may also highlight opportunities for interventions that reduce the risk of delayed death in a population of patients that is generally young and healthy at the time of injury. As such, this article will review the literature on the long-term mortality rate and its determinants among patients who are hospitalized for severe injuries.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1460408613492290" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Trauma is the most important cause of preventable morbidity and mortality in the developed world. The bulk of major traumatic injury occurs among young healthy individuals who consequently experience both significant potential years of life lost, and long-term disability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1460408613492290">Laupland, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1460408613492290">Masson et al., 1997</xref>). Major trauma is frequently defined as an injury severity score (ISS) greater than 12–15 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1460408613492290">Gabbe et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1460408613492290">Karmali et al., 2005</xref>) and is associated with an acute mortality rate between 11.0% and 34.5% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1460408613492290">Dutton et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1460408613492290">Laupland et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1460408613492290">Nijboer et al., 2007</xref>). As a result of improved injury prevention measures, implementation of organized trauma systems, adoption of evidence-based treatments and damage-control resuscitation/surgery, the short-term mortality following an episode of major trauma is decreasing over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1460408613492290">Dutton et al., 2010</xref>). This improvement in short-term mortality is not unique to trauma as similar trends in improved survival have been observed for other life-threatening conditions such as acute lung injury (ALI), septic shock and acute myocardial infarction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1460408613492290">Erickson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1460408613492290">Jernberg et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1460408613492290">Levy et al., 2010</xref>). Due to a decrease in short-term mortality following these life-threatening illnesses, many investigators are shifting their focus towards studying the impact of acute illness on both quality of life and survival after discharge from hospital.</p>
<p>Over the past several years, there has also been an increased recognition of the importance of studying long-term outcomes following injury. Such outcomes range from measures of functional independence, quality of life and long-term mortality. The purpose of this study was to review the literature on the long-term mortality rate and its determinants among those who survive their index hospitalization for traumatic injury. Such knowledge is important because it may highlight opportunities for interventions that reduce the risk of delayed death in a population of patients that is generally young and healthy at the time of injury. It may also allow the health care team to better inform patients and their families of the prognosis following admission to hospital for traumatic injury.</p>

<sec id="sec2-1460408613492290"><title>Search strategy</title>
<p>A structured literature review was conducted using PubMed, Embase and CINAHL from the earliest available date to 5 November 2011 with the goal of identifying articles that focused on delayed and long-term mortality following an episode of traumatic injury. The literature search included the terms: <italic>trauma</italic> (restricted to article title), <italic>mortality, survival, long term, and delayed</italic>. Article titles and abstracts were screened for relevance and appropriate full-length articles were retrieved for appraisal. The bibliographies of relevant articles were also screened for other pertinent articles. Articles that included only patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) were excluded from this review as an evaluation of the long-term mortality following isolated TBI represents a distinct and non-comparable cohort. A total of 33 full-length manuscripts were retrieved for detailed review from which 14 articles were excluded based on failure to report long-term mortality. The remaining 19 articles form the basis for this review (outlined in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1460408613492290">Table 1</xref>).

<sec id="sec4-1460408613492290"><title>Definition of long-term mortality</title>
<p>A discussion of the delayed long-term mortality following acute traumatic injury should begin with an outline of what precisely defines long-term mortality. After reviewing the trauma literature as well as that for other conditions such as sepsis, and acute heart failure, there does not appear to be a universally accepted reporting measure that best represents the delayed long-term mortality following affliction with these conditions. It is common for studies to report any one of a number of measures of long-term mortality including: six-month mortality, one-year mortality, 10-year mortality, etc. This inconsistency likely relates to the variability and difficulty in monitoring patients after hospital admission and trouble in determining the potential long-term effects of hospitalization for a severe acute illness on a patient’s general health (i.e. is survival to one year an adequate measure of recovery from acute illness vs. survival to 10 years?). Nonetheless, mortality up to one-year following hospital discharge is frequently cited as a measure of delayed death among patients with acute illnesses such as septic shock, heart failure, and admission to an intensive care unit (ICU) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1460408613492290">Laupland et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1460408613492290">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1460408613492290">Siirilä-Waris et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1460408613492290">Winters et al., 2010</xref>). Following review of the trauma studies outlined in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1460408613492290">Table 1</xref>, it appears that death up to one year post-discharge is also commonly reported as a measure of long-term mortality for trauma patients (4/19 studies). On the other hand, it is also clear from <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1460408613492290">Table 1</xref> that the majority of studies report a wide range of measures. In spite of this inconsistency and the consequential inability to generate a summary measure of long-term mortality following acute traumatic injury, a review of the existing literature with a focus on study quality and need for future research is presented in the remaining sections of this manuscript.</p>

<sec id="sec5-1460408613492290"><title>Long-term mortality rates</title>
<p>The heterogeneity within the reported measures of long-term mortality among the studies examined for this review is a reflection of the variability within the study populations and sample sizes. Many of the included studies are limited by small sample sizes and focus on specific/narrow populations. In addition, the data on which several studies base their estimate of long-term mortality are outdated (&gt; 20 years old) and do not necessarily provide an accurate representation of the current quality of care provided to injured patients admitted to a major trauma centre. Furthermore, five studies focus on the long-term survival among elderly patients, which greatly limits their generalizability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1460408613492290">Battistella et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1460408613492290">Carrillo et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1460408613492290">Day et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1460408613492290">Gubler et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1460408613492290">McGwin et al., 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Another notable finding from this review is that the majority of studies reporting long-term mortality following traumatic injury did not focus on major trauma, but rather studied a broader group of patients with injuries of lesser severity. Only nine studies focused on patients suffering from major trauma according to the generally accepted ISS-based criteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1460408613492290">Brenneman et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1460408613492290">Day et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1460408613492290">Gabbe et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1460408613492290">Laupland et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1460408613492290">Probst et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1460408613492290">Redmill et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1460408613492290">Zarzaur et al., 2010</xref>), or by virtue of including patients who required admission to the ICU following their injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1460408613492290">Ulvik et al., 2007a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1460408613492290">2007b</xref>). This is important as patients suffering from major trauma are more likely to die in the acute phase of their injury or suffer life-altering injuries (e.g. TBI and spinal cord injury) that place them at greater risk of delayed long-term mortality.</p>
<p>In spite of the aforementioned limitations of the majority of studies reporting on the rate of delayed death following trauma, significant knowledge can be gleaned from examining a few of the studies in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1460408613492290">Table 1</xref>. The study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1460408613492290">Cameron et al. (2005)</xref> was the first large, population-based study to assess the long-term mortality following trauma. This matched cohort study used administrative databases from Manitoba, Canada to obtain data on 18,210 adult patients hospitalized due to injury between 1988 and 1991. Mortality outcomes over a period of 10 years following injury were compared to a matched non-injured cohort. While the authors found that the greatest mortality rate occurred within the first 60 days following injury (adjusted mortality rate ratio (MRR) 7.29, 95% confidence interval (CI) 4.53–11.74) there was a consistent trend towards increased mortality in the injured group throughout the 10-year follow-up period (overall MRR 1.70, 95% CI 1.54–1.87). Unfortunately, the data used in this study are more than 20 years old and the authors derived the MRRs using statistics appropriate for unmatched data, therefore their estimates for the association between injury and long-term death may be overstated.</p>
<p>A more recent large cohort study is that of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1460408613492290">Claridge et al. (2010)</xref>. These authors also employed administrative data to study mortality after hospital discharge for 15,285 patients admitted to a level-one trauma centre in Cleveland, Ohio, from 2000 to 2005. Interestingly, the in-hospital mortality rate (3.3%) was lower than the mortality rate after hospital discharge (4.8% over a mean follow-up of 2.8 years). The relatively low in-hospital mortality rate is likely a reflection of a population of patients who suffered mild-to-moderate traumatic injury as the mean (standard deviation, SD) ISS was only 11.4 (0.1). However, the reasons for the comparatively increased long-term mortality are not clear as the patients were generally young with a mean (SD) age of 36.8 (0.2) years. Furthermore, the authors do not provide an analysis of the determinants of the long-term death.</p>
<p>The largest study evaluating long-term mortality and its determinants following an episode of trauma is that of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1460408613492290">Davidson and colleagues (2011)</xref>. They used the Washington State Trauma Registry to obtain data on 124,421 injured adults admitted to a trauma hospital from 1995 to 2008. Similar to the results of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1460408613492290">Claridge et al. (2010)</xref>, these authors also found an increased mortality after discharge from hospital compared to the in-hospital mortality (in-hospital mortality rate: 5.8% vs. mortality rate within the first-year after discharge from hospital: 7.2%). These authors also identified that in-hospital mortality rates decreased over the 13-year study period whereas the post-discharge mortality rates generally increased. Patients with the greatest risk of death within the first year after hospital discharge were older males, who suffered from a blunt injury or fall, and had a systolic blood pressure less than 90 mmHg and a Glasgow Coma Scale score less than nine in the emergency department (44% risk of death with all five risk factors). Although this large study provides a detailed analysis of the determinants of long-term mortality (outlined in a later section of this manuscript) the majority of included patients suffered from mild to moderate injuries (mean (SD) ISS 10.9 (10.0)), so these results cannot necessarily be applied to patients suffering from major trauma as patients suffering from major trauma are more likely to die in-hospital from the effects of their injuries.</p>
<p>The study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1460408613492290">Zarzaur and colleagues (2010)</xref> is one of two large cohort studies to address the long-term mortality of patients suffering from major trauma. The study population included 1914 adults with an ISS &gt; 15 who survived to hospital discharge after suffering a blunt injury without TBI or spinal cord injury. The patients had a mean (SD) ISS of 23.2 (7.2) indicating moderate-to-severe injury. Given that the authors focused on patients who survived to hospital discharge, there is no mention of in-hospital mortality; however, the two-year mortality was found to be 3%. Unfortunately, these authors did not provide an analysis of the determinants of this two-year mortality. Furthermore, the results of this study are also limited by the exclusion of patients who suffered from TBI or spinal cord injury, two conditions potentially associated with increased long-term mortality.</p>
<p>Finally, the largest study of long-term mortality following major trauma published to date is that of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1460408613492290">Laupland et al. (2010)</xref>. Using an inception cohort design, these authors examined the long-term mortality and its determinants among 2630 residents of the Calgary Health Region who were admitted with major trauma (ISS ≥ 12) between 1 April 2002 and 31 March 2006 to one of two tertiary care trauma centres in Calgary, Canada. The study population had a median (interquartile range) ISS of 19 (16–25) and 27% required admission to the ICU. The 28-day case-fatality rate was 11.0%, and 3% of those who survived to 28-days died within the first-year following their initial injury. Factors associated with delayed long-term mortality according to their detailed regression analysis included age ≥ 65 years, injury mechanism that included an unintentional fall and patients hospitalized at day-28 post-injury.</p>
<p>The studies outlined in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1460408613492290">Table 1</xref>, including those described in detail above, suggest a significant risk of long-term mortality following hospital admission for trauma. For mild-to-moderate traumatic injury this risk tends to exceed the risk of in-hospital mortality for reasons that are unclear but may relate to the effects of injury on pre-existing chronic conditions. The opposite seems to be true for major trauma where the risk of short-term death outweighs the risk of long-term death, likely because of the greater acute effects of the severe injury. Furthermore, there remains a persistent risk of long-term death following major trauma that according to some studies is above that expected for a similar uninjured group of patients. Further insight into these interesting observations may arise from examining the reported determinants and causes of long-term mortality following injury.</p>

<sec id="sec7-1460408613492290"><title>Determinants of long-term mortality</title>
<p>Among the 19 studies included in this review, only five provided an analysis of the determinants of long-term death following hospital admission for trauma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1460408613492290">Claridge et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1460408613492290">Davidson et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1460408613492290">Gabbe et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1460408613492290">Laupland et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1460408613492290">Ulvik et al., 2007a</xref>). A summary of these determinants is given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1460408613492290">Table 2</xref>. Increased age was predictive of increased long-term mortality in three of the studies that provided a complete multivariable regression analysis. This is not surprising and makes intuitive sense, as increased age is often associated with decreased physiologic reserve and an increased burden of medical comorbidities that challenge the individual’s ability to recover from a severe acute illness. Another factor predictive of long-term death found in two of the five studies was a mechanism of injury that included a fall. This is also a logical conclusion as falls are a marker of frailty that frequently reflect an individual’s burden of underlying medical illnesses and signify a risk for future falls and potential injury that intuitively places patients at increased risk for death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1460408613492290">Ganz et al., 2007</xref>).

<p>Discharge of patients to a location other than home, particularly to a skilled nursing facility was also independently associated with an increased risk of long-term mortality following hospitalization for trauma. Although the studies citing this as a risk factor for long-term death were not able to explore this issue further, it is likely that the skilled nursing facility is merely a marker of problems encountered by patients dependent on others for care. Such patients may be at increased risk for pneumonia and other infectious problems due to trouble with dysphagia/aspiration, frequent antibiotic exposure, decreased mobility and recurrent encounters with the health care system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1460408613492290">Poch et al., 2009</xref>). Furthermore these patients are also at risk for falls due to weakness and limitations in mobility, which serves to further increase their risk for death following an episode of trauma.</p>
<p>Severe neurological injury and prolonged hospital admission were two other commonly cited risk factors for long-term mortality. Although patients with severe TBI are frequently young and healthy, those who survive their index hospital admission often have some degree of dependency on others for care and thus are not discharged home but rather to rehabilitation or skilled nursing facilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1460408613492290">Hukkelhoven et al., 2003</xref>). The same is true for patients who end up paraplegic or quadriplegic from a significant spinal cord injury. These patients also tend to have increased hospital lengths of stay compared to other trauma patients due to issues with weakness and difficulty adjusting to the effects of their neurological impairment which places them at further risk for long-term death.</p>
<p>Although, relatively few studies have examined the determinants of long-term mortality following an episode of trauma, it is clear from the data provided in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1460408613492290">Table 2</xref> that factors associated with long-term mortality are mostly unrelated to the nature of the initial injury. The exception to this observation is the presence of a neurological injury in the context of a fall as the initial mechanism of injury. It is not clear whether some of these factors are a marker of increased risk or represent an opportunity for intervention and resource allocation to help reduce the risk of long-term death in patients who survive their index hospital admission for trauma. Further information may arise from examining the reported causes of death in these patients.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-1460408613492290"><title>Causes of death among those suffering delayed long-term mortality</title>
<p>Given that documenting the cause(s) of death is often wrought with ambiguity and uncertainty, it is not surprising to find only three studies reporting cause of death information on patients who die months to years following their index hospitalization for trauma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1460408613492290">Claridge et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1460408613492290">Laupland et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1460408613492290">Probst et al., 2009</xref>). The study by Claridge et al. simply reported the likelihood that the long-term mortality was related to trauma (i.e. deaths not related to trauma, possibly trauma-related deaths and trauma-related deaths) rather than cite the individual causes of death. They found that among patients less than 40 years of age, long-term death was more likely to be trauma-related, and for those greater than 40 years of age, long-term death was more likely not to be attributable to trauma.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1460408613492290">Probst and colleagues (2009)</xref> were the first group of authors to provide a detailed report on the causes of death in patients who suffered long-term mortality after trauma. They used patient charts, death certificates and phone calls to patient’s relatives to determine the causes of death in 103 patients who survived an admission for polytrauma (ISS ≥ 16) in Germany between 1973 and 1990 and died before 2003. Causes of death were grouped according to organ system to facilitate description. The most common cause of death in this relatively young population (mean (SD) age 35.6 (17.2) years) was cardiovascular (22.6%) which included arrhythmias, myocardial infarctions and heart failure. A second trauma was the next most common cause of death (19.1%), followed by disorders of the nervous system (15.5%) and respiratory system (10.7%). In addition to the proportion of patients who died due to a second trauma, suicide was responsible for 9.5% of deaths, indicating that intentional/unintentional injury was responsible for 28.6% of all long-term deaths. Similar trends in causes of death were reported in the previously described study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1460408613492290">Laupland et al. (2010)</xref> except that in their study population the most common cause of long-term death was related to trauma (41%). Cardiovascular causes were responsible for 23% of deaths. Other causes of death included malignancy, chronic pulmonary disease, infection and other chronic organ failures.</p>
<p>The results of these three studies suggest that a significant proportion of long-term deaths are related to repeat trauma and other chronic organ failures. Unfortunately, the authors do not provide a direct comparison to a non-injured cohort to determine whether this represents a difference in comparison to the general population. Nonetheless, this finding remains interesting as it suggests many of these delayed deaths may be preventable with increased attention to trauma prevention strategies and optimized medical management in patients with chronic diseases.</p>
</sec>

<sec id="sec9-1460408613492290" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In conclusion, long-term mortality following discharge from hospital after trauma is significant, and consistently increased when compared to a similar cohort of uninjured patients. It also appears to be increasing over time. Few studies within the existing literature have examined the determinants of this long-term death and larger, epidemiologic studies are required to improve the identification of patients at risk for this phenomenon. The current literature suggests that older patients with neurological injury, and increased hospital lengths of stay whose disposition from hospital includes a location other than home, are at highest risk for long-term death. Furthermore, the few studies that have examined the causes of death in these patients suggest that many die due to the effects of a second trauma (intentional or unintentional) or chronic diseases. This suggests a role for trauma follow-up clinics with attention to trauma prevention, mental health and optimizing medical therapy for those with chronic disease as a strategy that may reduce the rate of long-term death following trauma.</p>
