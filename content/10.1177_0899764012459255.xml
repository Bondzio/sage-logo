<abstract>
<p>In this study, the authors explore how the dynamics associated with the founding of new nonprofit organizations, the characteristics of the founders, and the developmental life cycles of nonprofit organizations contribute to the seemingly fragmented landscape of the nonprofit sector. Based on data collected from interviews with 31 nonprofit organizations, we find that new nonprofits are being created by passionate, entrepreneurial individuals who hope to make a difference in the community.  Although these organizations are typically small, with few staff members and small budgets, the extent to which they rely on volunteers and are connected to the broader community varies considerably. Moreover, many founders had little experience volunteering or working in the sector. The findings from this study have important implications for the professional development of nonprofit staff, leaders, and volunteers, and they shed new light on how we think about and describe the founders of nonprofit organizations.</p>

<p>The purpose of this study is to explore the dynamics associated with the founding of new nonprofit organizations. Using data gathered from interviews with the founders of new nonprofit organizations, we explore why the founders created a new nonprofit organization—especially during a time when foundations, governments, and citizens are complaining that there are too many nonprofit organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0899764012459255">McLaughlin, 2010</xref>). We also explore the different roles of the boards of directors, the extent to which these new organizations are working with others in the community, and the range of their accomplishments during their inaugural years. The findings from this study have important implications for the professional development of nonprofit staff, leaders, and volunteers, and they shed new light on how we think about and describe the founders of nonprofit organizations.</p>
<sec id="section1-0899764012459255">
<title>Context for the Study</title>
<p>In theory, the free market and competition for scarce resources would ensure that the number of nonprofit organizations would remain in check (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0899764012459255">Norris-Tirrell, 2001</xref>). Yet, according to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), there are more than 1.5 million registered nonprofit organizations in the United States, with 958,398 of these being 501 (c) 3 charitable organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0899764012459255">Wing, Roeger, &amp; Pollak, 2010</xref>). The number of these organizations, at least on the surface, appears to be growing, with the IRS approving between 45,000 and 50,000 new 501 (c) 3 organizations each year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0899764012459255">Reich, Dorn, &amp; Sutton, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0899764012459255">Wilhelm, 2010</xref>). Although we are able to gather some information about these organizations through the IRS Form 990, data kept by state government agencies, and other sources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0899764012459255">Abzug &amp; Sabrin, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0899764012459255">Grønbjerg &amp; Clerkin, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0899764012459255">Grønbjerg &amp; Paarlberg, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0899764012459255">IRS, 2011b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0899764012459255">Lampkin, 2010</xref>), empirically, we will still know comparably less about why these new nonprofit organizations continue to be founded.</p>

<title>Literature Review</title>
<p>According to the literature, the founders of new nonprofit organizations are often ideologically motivated and have a passion surrounding the mission of the organization they seek to create (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0899764012459255">Frank, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0899764012459255">James, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0899764012459255">Rose-Ackerman, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0899764012459255">Young, 1986</xref>). Founders are often described as being personable, charismatic, and inspirational (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0899764012459255">James, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0899764012459255">Stevens, 2001</xref>, p. 28). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0899764012459255">Miller (1998)</xref>, founders create new organizations because they are close to the problem and “this closeness to the problem can lead to new insights and innovative solutions that might be missed by larger, more established organizations whose leaders have lost touch with the grass roots” (p. 95). Yet, at the same time, we know that some organizations suffer from “founder’s syndrome,” with the founder exercising too much power and influence in the organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0899764012459255">Block &amp; Rosenberg, 2002</xref>), and other nonprofit organizations struggle with leadership transitions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0899764012459255">Adams, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0899764012459255">Allison, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0899764012459255">Balsar &amp; Carmin, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0899764012459255">Hernandez &amp; Leslie, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>From a theoretical perspective, founders create new nonprofit organizations as a result of government failure, market failure, or contract failure. Government failure suggests that founders create nonprofit organizations to address needs in the society that are unserved or underserved by government (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0899764012459255">Hansmann, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0899764012459255">Young, 1998b</xref>). Similarly, market failure suggests that founders create nonprofit organizations to fill the gaps left unserved or underserved by the market (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0899764012459255">Young, 1998a</xref>). Contract failure suggests that founders create nonprofit organizations to provide services in niche markets where consumers feel particularly vulnerable and are wary of profit-driven providers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0899764012459255">Grønbjerg, 1998</xref>). Typically, these nonprofit organizations will be service oriented, and they are created to ameliorate social problems in areas such as education, health, and human services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0899764012459255">Handy, Mook, &amp; Quarter, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0899764012459255">Salamon &amp; Sokolowski, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Other theories suggest that founders create nonprofit organizations for expressive purposes, which goes along with spirit of democracy and its associated values, such as freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, freedom of expression, and pluralism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0899764012459255">Knutsen &amp; Brower, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0899764012459255">Mason, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0899764012459255">Moulton &amp; Eckerd, 2011</xref>). These organizations help individuals behave and act collectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0899764012459255">Brudney, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0899764012459255">Green &amp; Haines, 2012</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0899764012459255">Handy et al. (2007)</xref>, “Expressive nonprofits serve to actualize values or preferences and include culture, sports, recreation, environmental protection, political expression, advocacy, labor unions, and professional and business associations” (pp. 80-81).</p>
<p>A number of factors have been found to contribute to the success of these nonprofit organizations as they develop. These include having a clearly defined mission and vision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0899764012459255">Crutchfield &amp; Grant, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0899764012459255">Jeavons &amp; Cnaan, 1997</xref>); identifying stakeholders and cultivating a strong base of support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0899764012459255">Chambré, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0899764012459255">Jawahar &amp; McLaughlin, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0899764012459255">Nitterhouse,1997</xref>); developing sound organizational strategies, internal processes, managerial controls, and financial expertise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0899764012459255">Chambré &amp; Fatt, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0899764012459255">Frank, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0899764012459255">Nitterhouse, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0899764012459255">Strichman, Bickel, &amp; Marshood, 2008</xref>); and cultivating a strong and responsive board of directors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0899764012459255">Mathiasen, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0899764012459255">Miller-Millesen, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0899764012459255">Strichman et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0899764012459255">Zald, 1969</xref>). Moreover, researchers have noted how nonprofit organizations tend to evolve and grow over time according to specific developmental life cycles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0899764012459255">Cameron &amp; Whetten, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0899764012459255">Light, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0899764012459255">Simon, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0899764012459255">Whetten, 1987</xref>). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0899764012459255">Stevens (2001)</xref> presents seven developmental stages of the nonprofit life cycle. The first four stages are related to the idea, startup, growth, and maturity phases of developing the organization. The last three stages are related to the organization’s decline, as the organization loses its relevance, needs to move in a new direction, or experience its demise.</p>
<p>For this study, we were most interested in the early stages of the nonprofit life cycle—the idea and start-up phases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0899764012459255">McCambridge, Crosby, Pratt, &amp; Rodriguez, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0899764012459255">Salamon, 2010</xref>). In reviewing the literature, we found some theoretical work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0899764012459255">Brudney, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0899764012459255">Salamon, 1999</xref>), anecdotal stories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0899764012459255">Schambra, 1997</xref>), and normative and prescriptive advice for founders about how to get started (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0899764012459255">Grobman, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0899764012459255">Howe, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0899764012459255">Mancuso, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0899764012459255">Murphy, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0899764012459255">Pakroo, 2009</xref>). Descriptive research and case studies about founders have also looked more closely at founder’s syndrome or the “influential powers and privileges that the founder exercises” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0899764012459255">Block &amp; Rosenberg, 2002</xref>, p. 354) and the complexities associated with the transition and succession of founders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0899764012459255">Adams, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0899764012459255">Allison, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0899764012459255">Balsar &amp; Carmin, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0899764012459255">Block &amp; Rosenberg, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0899764012459255">Hernandez &amp; Leslie, 2001</xref>). There is still, however, much to learn about how or why founders create new organizations to begin with. This study is intended to fill this gap.</p>

<title>Data Collection and Methods</title>
<p>We obtained the Business Master File from the National Center for Charitable Statistics to use as our sampling frame. This file contains descriptive information for all of the active 501 (c) (3) organizations registered with the IRS. We used this file instead of the Core Files because it allowed us to include smaller nonprofit organizations that are exempt from filing the IRS’s Form 990 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0899764012459255">National Center for Charitable Statistics, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>We identified 231 nonprofit organizations created between January 2007 and March 2008 in Charlotte, North Carolina, and the surrounding county (according to the “Date of Origin” field). Given the heterogeneity of the organizations in the Business Master File, we focused on public service and expressive nonprofit organizations.</p>
<p>We excluded 44 religious and spiritual development organizations (National Taxonomy of Exempt Entities [NTEE] code = X) and 25 philanthropic and grant-making organizations (NTEE Code = T) because the regulatory context in which these organizations operate is inherently different from the other types of nonprofit organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0899764012459255">Chaves, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0899764012459255">Slater, Constantine, &amp; Braverman, 2004</xref>). Unlike other nonprofit organizations, religious organizations do not have to file a Form 1023 to be considered exempt from federal taxes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0899764012459255">IRS, 2010</xref>), so barrier of entry is lower. They also do not have to file a Form 990, so the accountability expectations are lower (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0899764012459255">Stevenson, Pollak, &amp; Lampkin, 1997</xref>). Conversely, foundations are subjected to greater regulations, such as the payout rule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0899764012459255">Lenkowsky, 2002</xref>), as well as the income, asset, endowment, and support tests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0899764012459255">IRS, 2011a</xref>).</p>
<p>We selected a random sample of half (81) of the 162 nonprofit organizations that remained. Next, we compiled as much contact information as we could find for each organization using the information from the Business Master File, internet searches, and directory searches. We were unable to locate phone numbers for 13% of the sample organizations and email addresses for 12% of the sample organizations. We invited each of the 81 organizations to participate in the research project initially by letter. We followed up with at least two emails and two telephone calls whenever possible, as well as a second letter. For 13 organizations, the letters were returned as “undeliverable” and we were not able to reach these organizations via email or telephone. Five organizations declined to participate in the project, and the others never responded to our requests. After 4 months of data collection, we conducted interviews with 31 of the 68 organizations (46%) who received the invitation to participate in the study.</p>
<p>The interviews were conducted according to an open-ended interview protocol. The interviews were recorded and transcribed, and we conducted a conventional content analysis allowing codes to emerge from the data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0899764012459255">Hsieh &amp; Shannon, 2005</xref>). During the analysis, we examined patterns of content and frequencies of the codes to identify the most important findings and themes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0899764012459255">Potter &amp; Levine-Dotterstein, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0899764012459255">Silverman, 1993</xref>). We also analyzed the data to see which, if any, of our hypotheses were supported.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0899764012459255">
<title>Sample</title>
<p>Eighty-seven percent (27) of the 31 people we interviewed described themselves as “a founder,” with 9 describing themselves as a cofounder or one of several founders. The remaining 4 (13%) of the people we interviewed were board members (3) or an executive director (1). More than half (16) of the organizations focused on providing services to youth, such as youth education and youth development programs, youth sports leagues, and school athletic and band booster clubs. Twenty-two percent (7) provided services for adults, including treatment for those with addiction, mental illness, and other diseases; mentoring; spiritual counseling; and other supportive services. Nineteen percent (6) focused on broader community services, such as literacy, foster care and adoption, community development, community theatre, music, and the arts. Six percent (2) of the organizations were very specialized, with one organization collecting and donating stuffed toys to children who are hospitalized and another providing safety and health training for professionals.</p>
<p>For the most part, these organizations were very small in terms of budget and staff. Only one organization, a counseling organization, had a sizable budget or staff, with close to 50 FTEs and a budget of almost US$3.5 million. The organizations varied in the extent to which they relied on volunteers, with those most likely to rely on volunteers working in the areas of foster care, education, youth development, recreation, and sports. With respect to the budgets, most were small, with 45% (14) reporting revenues of less than US$50,000 each year. We did, however, received some surprising answers to the question, “What is your annual budget?” Thirteen percent (4) said they didn’t know. Six percent (2) said, “It varies,” and three percent (1) said, “We don’t disclose.” Most organizations raised funds from individual donors and special fundraising events. Fewer received funds from foundations, fees, dues, or ticket sales, corporate sponsorships, or government sources (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0899764012459255">Table 1</xref>, Descriptive Characteristics of New Nonprofit Organizations).</p>

<title>Findings</title>
<sec id="section7-0899764012459255">
<title>Why create a new organization?</title>
<p>We asked the interviewees the open-ended question, “Why did you (or the founder) feel the need to create a new organization?” For 22% (7) of the organizations, the responses to this question fit with the reasons predicted by government failure (Hypothesis 1). Three of these organizations were booster clubs created by parents to fundraise for school athletics or the band. Although these activities are supported by the local public schools, they are underfunded and the schools lack the resources to pay for athletic uniforms, equipment upgrades, and transportation. The booster clubs help to make up for the budget shortfalls. Similarly, the other four organizations were created in response to the perceived shortcomings of government relating to education, foster care, dislocation, and workplace safety.</p>
<p>Forty-two percent (13) of the interviewees described the founding of the organizations in ways that were consistent with reasons predicted by market failure (Hypothesis 2). These organizations worked in the areas of education, counseling, youth development, and community improvement, with the founders describing how there was an unmet need in the community. Another 10% (3) of the organizations were also founded in response to an unmet need in the community, yet these founders emphasized how they created the organization to cater to a specific population, such as adults with a debilitating illness or children with developmental disabilities. These reasons are consistent with contract failure, which suggests that nonprofit organizations provide services in niche markets where people may feel vulnerable and are wary of profit-driven providers (Hypothesis 3). Twenty-six percent (8) of the interviewees described the founding of their organization in response to expressive needs, with the nonprofit organizational form providing the vehicle for organized activities, such as sports, music, and theatre (Hypothesis 4).</p>
<p>Although many of the interviewees described that they created the organization in response to an unmet need, when we asked how they knew about this unmet need, almost all of the respondents described the needs in an informal way. For example, one founder said, “We felt like there was a need.” Other founders said they “just knew” about the need based on their personal experiences or work experiences. As one founder explained, “I asked around,” and two founders were inspired to create their organizations because the topics were covered in the media.</p>
<p>Three organizations, however, were formal about assessing the “need.” A new faith-based nonprofit school conducted a comprehensive feasibility study and also visited other schools to interview leaders and board members. Another founder conducted web searches to see whether there were organizations that provided similar services. Another created his organization after he looked at research and statistical data from the county health department about high morbidity zip codes and concluded a new organization was needed to increase education and awareness regarding drugs, alcohol, and STDs in these neighborhoods. Yet, with these three exceptions, most founders did not conduct formal studies or a needs assessment.</p>
<p>Also notable was the “personal” calling to create the organization. For example, the founder of an organization that helps high school and college students find scholarships explained how he was inspired by his own personal experiences growing up, as the first person in his family to go college. This, coupled with his experiences volunteering with Junior Achievement, made him realize that not only do today’s youth not have access to career counselors but that kids and parents don’t know how to look or apply for scholarships.</p>
<p>Others also described how they created the organization because of their own personal interests and experiences. For example, the organization that provides stuffed toys to children in the hospital was created in memory of a daughter who died of cancer. Her mother said, “It is that act of kindness that I know that certainly helped our daughter, and helped us get through those really tough times. So we saw a need, a way that we could help children. Sometimes it’s those small things that make a big difference.”</p>
<p>Similarly, as the founder of a new nonprofit that provides supportive services to parents of children with special needs explained, “Because you have a personal interest, because of your personal situation, you have something that you can share with other parents and help them, and maybe make their journey a little bit easier.” The founders of two counseling organizations described this same theme as well, with one saying, “If I needed [counseling], I believed that other[s] needed it as well.”</p>
<p>Finally, many described how they were inspired to “make a living doing what I love.” This sentiment came up in more than half (16) of the interviews. For 19% (6) of the interviewees, the nonprofit organization was their primary livelihood. For 16% (5), working on behalf of the nonprofit organization (either as paid staff or a volunteer) was a second career or something that complemented their professional work. Nineteen percent (6) described how they hoped working on behalf of the new organization would eventually blossom into a full-time career.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0899764012459255">
<title>Why a nonprofit organization?</title>
<p>We asked the interviewees, “Why did you decide to become a nonprofit organization, as opposed to some other type of organization?” Most of the interviewees reported that they did not even consider incorporating as another form. They described how the nonprofit form simply fit with the proposed mission. As one founder explained, “This is not a money making proposition. I’m trying to provide a service that is not out there.” Yet, others identified some of the tangible and intangible benefits of being a nonprofit organization, including the ability to solicit tax-deductible contributions, the ability to apply for grants, and the “respect” or “social capital” that you need “to be legitimate.” None of the people we interviewed mentioned the advantage of not having to pay income or sales taxes.</p>
<p>Two organizations had originally operated as for-profit entities but later converted to a nonprofit organization. According to the executive director and founder of one organization, “I changed over from a for-profit to a nonprofit because I felt in [my service field] you are more apt to get grants.” The other organization had operated as a Limited Liability Corporation for more than 12 years. This founder, however, reported that he had invested close to US$800,000 of his personal income into the organization during that time, taking out second mortgages and investing “everything we have.” By converting to a nonprofit organization, the organization became able to accept tax-deductible contributions and apply for operating grants from a local funder.</p>
<p>We also asked the interviewees whether the founder had previous experience working or volunteering for a nonprofit organization. Fifty-eight percent (18) did not have any experience working or volunteering for a nonprofit organization. Twenty percent (6) had experience as volunteers. Just 10% (3) reported having experience working for a nonprofit organization. Thirteen percent (4) described how they believed their education (i.e., counseling, human services) prepared them to work in the nonprofit sector.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0899764012459255">
<title>Boards of directors</title>
<p>We asked the interviewees to tell us about the boards of directors. Specifically, we asked about the size of the boards of directors, how often they met, and what role they played in the organization. For the most part, the boards of directors were very small. Fifty-five percent (17) of the organizations had between three to six board members. Nineteen percent (6) organizations had between seven and nine board members. Ten percent (3) had between 10 and 12 board members, and one organization that relies solely on the work of the board members to produce an annual conference had 25 board members. Sixty-four percent (20) of the boards met monthly or quarterly. Ten percent (3) met more frequently, as needed (i.e., weekly or biweekly). Nineteen (6) percent met less frequently, with four organizations meeting annually as required by North Carolina law and two meeting semiannually.</p>
<p>In spite of the legal requirement to have a board of directors, two organizations reported not having a board of directors. One founder blamed the ailing economy, saying, “We don’t have a board of directors yet. We tried to do that last year . . . with the economic state, a lot of people are busy with their time right now.” Another founder said her organization did not have a “traditional” board of directors, explaining, “That kind of stuff becomes cumbersome and gets top heavy, nobody is really doing anything. We have the president and vice president [of the organization], and we all work together.”</p>
<p>In analyzing the descriptions of the role of the boards, we found four types of boards. Twenty-nine percent (9) described having a hands-on board that “does all of the work.” For these organizations, the board members were not only responsible for fundraising and strategy development but were also responsible for the daily operations of the organizations. A theme we heard repeatedly was, “They do everything,” or “They are the organization.” Twenty-six percent (8) described boards that echoed traditional governing boards—boards that are responsible for legal compliance, the finances, strategic planning, and ensuring that the mission is being fulfilled. Nineteen percent (6) described boards that played more of an advisory role, with three organizations describing their boards as “sounding boards.” Nineteen percent (6) described fundraising boards, where the main purpose of the board was raise funding by coordinating annual fundraising events or hosting special fundraising events.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0899764012459255">
<title>Collaboration</title>
<p>We asked the interviewees, “Do you collaborate, partner, or work with other nonprofit organizations?” Again, there was considerable variability here. Thirty-two percent (10) organizations reported that they did not collaborate or partner with other organizations—with some simply responding “No” or “We don’t” to this question, and others saying we “keep in touch” or “we talk” with other organizations. Others reported how they “have good relationships” with organizations, but they don’t collaborate or partner with them. Twenty-nine percent (9) described in general terms how they work with other organizations in their same field, such as churches, schools, a state agency, and other nonprofit organizations, whereas 39% (12) were more descriptive. For example, a sports organization works closely with the Department of Parks and Recreation to secure space for their activities. An arts organization gets together with the other theater companies and the Arts and Science Council each year to plan community arts programming. Another founder said he is “always on the lookout” for organizations to partner with—either for profit or nonprofit, explaining, “The more people you work with, obviously, you get your name out there and if you treat them fairly and do a good job, you get positive word of mouth, and being a small business owner, that is nothing but positive for me.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0899764012459255">
<title>Accomplishments</title>
<p>We asked the organizations, “Since coming into being, what would you say your biggest accomplishments have been?” Sixteen percent (5) of the interviewees described how their biggest accomplishment was simply creating the organization—getting incorporated, securing the tax-exempt status, and writing the bylaws. Sixty-one percent (19) described the accomplishments in terms of organizational milestones (i.e., becoming accredited, hiring staff, and “getting that first grant”), outputs (i.e., sending eight students to camp, awarding six scholarships) or outcomes (i.e., seeing families improve), whereas 23% (7) thought about their accomplishments more generally, in terms of moving forward with the mission.</p>

<p>Overall, the new nonprofits in Charlotte are being created by passionate individuals who hope to make a difference in the community. These organizations are typically small, have few staff members, and small budgets. These organizations also provide a wide range of services and cover the gamut of subsectors within the field, yet the growth is concentrated in the areas of education, human services, and religious organizations (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0899764012459255">Table 3</xref>, Nonprofits by NTEE Code).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Three of the four hypotheses for this study suggested that founders would create new nonprofit organizations in response to some type of unmet service need created by government failure, market failure, or contract failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0899764012459255">Grønbjerg, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0899764012459255">Hansmann, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0899764012459255">Young, 1998a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0899764012459255">1998b</xref>). These unmet needs, however, are defined by their own personal experiences and observations, as opposed to a formal study or needs assessment to determine the actual need for services. These perspectives still aligned with the experiences of many of these organizations in that the founders were defining unmet needs on the basis of their own personal experiences and observations. In other words, these data suggest many new organizations are being formed in response to perceived government, market and contract failures rather than substantiated government, market failures, and contract failures.</p>
<p>The last hypothesis suggested that founders would create new nonprofit organizations as expressive vehicles so that individuals may act collectively, often because of similar values and preferences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0899764012459255">Green &amp; Haines, 2012</xref>). On one hand, we did find new organizations, such as a youth soccer league, an athletic booster club, and a community theatre, being created so that people with similar interests could work together toward a common goal and contribute to the greater good. Yet at the same time we found some organizations being created by founders, with very little, if any, input, support, or demand from other members in the community. These were the organizations that did not have active or engaged boards. They did not rely on volunteers, and they did not work with other organizations in the community. Rather, they were created by passionate individuals who seem to have created a new organization, with at least the partial goal of self-employment and the ability to make a living doing what they love. Indeed, we consider this to be one of the important findings of this study—that a desire for self-employment is another motivation for creating a nonprofit organization beyond any government, market, or contract failures.</p>
<p>There are, however, some limitations associated with this study that are important to note. The study is based on the experiences of a small sample of organizations in one city in the south. Therefore, caution needs to be exercised when interpreting the results. And although the nonprofit landscape in Charlotte, NC, is fairly similar to other parts of state in terms of the number and types of nonprofit organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0899764012459255">National Center for Charitable Statistics, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0899764012459255">Niggel &amp; Nesbit, 2010</xref>), the experiences of nonprofit organizations in Charlotte may be different from those in other cities given that it is large, growing city with many resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0899764012459255">Bryant, 2011</xref>). The study also relies on self-reported information from the interviewees. In most cases (87%), we interviewed a founder. However, in some cases, we interviewed board members (10%) and an executive director (3%). It is possible that their responses to our questions or their recollection of these events might be different from those of the original founders.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0899764012459255">
<title>Implications</title>
<p>The findings from this study make several contributions and have important implications. First, these findings shed some light onto the issues relating to fragmentation, competition, and capacity. For example, for years, the nonprofit sector has been criticized for the duplication of services and inefficiencies. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0899764012459255">Salamon (1995)</xref> describes the risk as philanthropic particularism or the tendency for nonprofit organizations and their funders to provide certain types of services to specific groups of the people based on their own particular interests and preferences (p. 46). In this study we see some evidence of this, with most of the founders creating new organizations based on their specific, personal experiences. Just three of the founders tried to conduct some type of formal study or needs assessment.</p>
<p>Nonprofit organizations have also been criticized for not collaborating with each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0899764012459255">Yankey &amp; Willen, 2010</xref>). Indeed, in Charlotte, local funders have been very explicit about the need for nonprofit organizations to collaborate more with each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0899764012459255">Price &amp; Frazier, 2009</xref>). In this study, we found that many of the new nonprofit organizations are not collaborating at high levels with other organizations. They tend to operate in isolation and show little interest in fitting their work within the larger nonprofit sector—at least at this stage in their development. They partner with other organizations solely on an opportunistic basis and they do not actively engage in boundary-spanning activities. Part of this might be a consequence of the lack of professional nonprofit experience of the founders. Because most have not worked in other local nonprofit organizations, they have very few, if any, local contacts with other nonprofit organizations.</p>
<p>Capacity is yet another perennial issue for the nonprofit sector, with long-standing questions about the trade-offs between the quality of service, the size of the nonprofit organization, and the scale of its operations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0899764012459255">Bradach, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0899764012459255">Kapucu, Healy, &amp; Arslan, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0899764012459255">Stoecker, 1997</xref>). For example, for some of these organizations, their biggest accomplishment was simply creating the organization. Other organizations, run solely by volunteers or limited staff, reported not being able to provide the mix or level of services that they would like because they simply didn’t have the capacity at this stage of development.</p>
<p>Competition within the nonprofit sector over the past couple decades has made it increasingly difficult for these small, new nonprofits to compete and be sustainable. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0899764012459255">Salamon (2002)</xref> describes this problem as a “sustainability chasm” that makes it incredibly difficult for small nonprofits to utilize technology, professionalized marketing, and fundraising to gain access to corporate, government, and nonprofit partners. Indeed, there is some evidence in our study that many of these organizations may fail quickly given the number of organizations that we could not locate or contact. Although this issue is not unique to the nonprofit sector, with only half of new small businesses surviving 5 years or more (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0899764012459255">Bornstein, 2007</xref>), these new nonprofit organizations do not seem to have benefitted from greater competition in the marketplace.</p>
<p>Second, these findings have important implications for the ways in which we teach nonprofit management and leadership to those who are active in the sector. Although many nonprofit organizations are small and run mostly by volunteers, similar to the organizations in this study, nonprofit management education has become more professionalized in recent years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0899764012459255">Tschirhart, Reed, &amp; Freeman, 2009</xref>). Greater numbers of universities and colleges are now offering undergraduate and graduate degrees in nonprofit management and philanthropic studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0899764012459255">Bies &amp; Brimer Blackwood, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0899764012459255">Mirabella, 2007</xref>). The courses focus on developing internal management skills, such as human resources management and financial management, as well as external development skills, like fundraising, advocacy, and marketing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0899764012459255">Mirabella, 2007</xref>). In addition, more than 50 universities and colleges now offer a national certification program in nonprofit management and leadership for students interested in careers in the nonprofit sector. The certification ensures that students have demonstrated competency in a range of areas, including board development, community outreach, fundraising, financial management, program planning, program evaluation, risk management, and volunteer management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0899764012459255">Nonprofit Leadership Alliance, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Although developing the management and leadership competencies for nonprofit professionals is indeed important, given the experiences of these very small and new nonprofit organizations, there is clearly another audience that could benefit from nonprofit management education and training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0899764012459255">Suarez, 2010</xref>). Founders of new nonprofit organizations, their volunteers, and board members could also benefit from learning about the fundamentals of board governance, principals of sound financial management, program planning, and evaluation.</p>
<p>The third implication of the findings from this study has to do with the way in which we typically describe founders. Typically, we describe founders as being altruistic and ideological, with a passion for the mission of the organization, and not motivated by a profit in the pecuniary sense (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0899764012459255">Frank, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0899764012459255">James &amp; Rose-Ackerman, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0899764012459255">Rose-Ackerman, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0899764012459255">Young, 1986</xref>). In our study, we found a group of founders who created their organizations for reasons that align fairly closely with the literature about small business entrepreneurs. Indeed, more than half of the founders (52%) we spoke with described how they had created their organization so they can “make a living doing what they love.” Yet this particular goal that is not unique to the nonprofit sector. Moreover, if we look to the business literature, we can also see that some of these founders were “reluctant entrepreneurs” who created their nonprofit organization as a result of a layoff or they were “refugees” who created their nonprofit organization “to escape an undesirable situation,” such as unemployment and underemployment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0899764012459255">Longenecker, Moore, Petty, &amp; Palich, 2010</xref>, p. 12). Although much has been written about nonprofit founders and how they are different from small business entrepreneurs, this study illustrates that perhaps they are not entirely different.</p>
<p>Our findings also have implications for the theories of the nonprofit sector. In this article, we have discussed four major theories of the nonprofit sector—government failure, market failure, contract failure, and for expressive purposes. We found empirical evidence to support each of these theories. However, our findings call into question the adequacy of these theories to explain the emergence of new nonprofit organizations because they do not take into account the personal, emotional, and economic motivations of the founders (i.e., wanting to make a living doing what they love or feeling “called” to do something in a particular area). Although these motivations seem to fit with the expressive theory of the sector, in our sample the personal calling and self-employment motivations were given for a range of organizations founded, not just expressive organizations. The decision to pursue a new nonprofit organization seems to be based more on personal motivations than nonprofit theorists have previously acknowledged. In addition, our findings highlight the difficulty of distinguishing between these four theories in an empirical setting. Because the founders did not do formal needs assessments, they have very little comprehension of the type of failure—government, market, or contract—that they are trying to address. In particular, distinguishing contract failure from government and market failure is a difficult task. Future theoretical and empirical work is needed to help sort out these issues and to build on our current theories of the sector to include this new information.</p>
<p>Finally, this study illustrates how there are very few barriers for entry into the nonprofit sector. Enterprising individuals can create a nonprofit organization fairly easily. The fees are not prohibitive, the incorporation forms are easily accessible, and technical assistance and advice is widely available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0899764012459255">Mancuso, 2009</xref>). With the exception of some types of organizations, such as hospitals, day care facilities, some counseling organizations, educational institutions, and organizations that receive certain types of government or other philanthropic sources of funding, most nonprofit organizations are not required to produce substantive reports about the results of their activities or demonstrate that they meet quality standards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0899764012459255">Carman, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0899764012459255">Worth, 2009</xref>). Moreover, even with the new changes to the Form 990 and IRS regulations, the federal reporting requirements are not very onerous, and small nonprofits are not subjected to much scrutiny (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0899764012459255">Grønbjerg, Liu, &amp; Pollak, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0899764012459255">Neely, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0899764012459255">Smoker &amp; Mammano, 2009</xref>).</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Although this study was based on a small sample of newly founded organizations in one locality, taken together, the findings do present a compelling description of individuals being called to act and serve others—based on a perceived need or a specific interest or passion—and using the nonprofit organization as the institutional form for action. The organization and its mission are deeply personal for the founder. Given that the nonprofit sector is fairly easy to access and offers considerable advantages, such as access to grants, tax deductible contributions, and legitimacy, it is not surprising that entrepreneurs are gravitating to the nonprofit sector. Yet at the same time these same conditions contribute to the fragmentation, lack of collaboration, and capacity issues that we continue to see throughout the sector.</p>
