<p>Barbara Metcalf’s poignant biography of Husain Ahmad Madani draws necessary attention to him as a central figure in the nationalist politics of the 1915–1947 period. She considers Madani’s engagement with the Congress-led anti-colonial nationalism as a counterpart to the discourse of a distinct Muslim religio-political identity favoured by the Muslim League and which culminated in the separatism of the late 1940s. Metcalf also suggests that she is historicising Madani’s life and work in a corrective to ‘an enduring Western blinder that looks to sacred texts, not geopolitics, to explain the political behavior of Muslims’ (p. 38). This book, published as a part of a popularly accessible series entitled ‘Makers of the Muslim World’, carries forward many themes from Metcalf’s influential study of <italic>Islamic Revival in British India: Deoband, 1860–1900</italic> first published in 1982. Madani was of a few students of Deoband who studied there and then came to serve the school as a teacher of Hadith and as a principal. However Metcalf relegates the <italic>madrasa</italic> to being only one aspect of Madani’s life as he contended with colonial violence, the nuances of the nationalist discourse and politics and challenges from other Muslims in India.</p>
<p>The story begins in 1915–1916 with Madani visiting Mecca in the Hijaz where he had spent much of his life. In December 1916 Madani, his teacher Maulana Mahmudul Hasan, and other Deobandi colleagues and family members, were arrested after their refusal to sign a document that gave ‘complete legitimacy to the Sharif [of Mecca’s] revolt against the Ottoman overlord’ (p. 13). Metcalf draws our attention to British intelligence gathering and surveillance in Mecca described in Priya Satia’s <italic>Spies in Arabia: The Great War and the Cultural Foundations of Britain’s Covert Empire in the Middle East</italic> (New York: Oxford University Press, 2008). Madani and Mahmudul Hasan’s arrests were indicative of their importance in affecting Muslim opinion in India, Metcalf suggests, and their loyalty to the Ottomans and their subsequent incarceration in a prison camp in Malta for five years should be understood as part of the story of the Great War.</p>
<p>The family (a wife, children, a brother and a stepmother among others) Madani left behind in Mecca was decimated in his absence and the tragedies of the many deaths in the family were reported to him in letters. When Madani and his group were finally released in 1920, they returned to India changed by the experience of incarceration and their time among other prisoners of war. It is now, Metcalf suggests, that Madani emerged as a nationalist thinker, and she devotes chapter three, a ‘flashback’, to describing Madani’s training as an Islamic scholar in the context of his own father’s insistence that he receive a traditional Islamic education and also receive a devotional Sufi training. Both traditions were received through Darul Ulum Deoband—the first through the curriculum, the second through Sufi initiation by one of the founding sages of the Darul Ulum.</p>
<p>Chapters 4 and 5 cover the 1920–1947 period during which Madani’s ‘commitment to Indian nationalism had become central to his commitment to Islam’ (p. 73). Madani’s work through these critical years included teaching at Deoband and in Sylhet, serving in the Khilafat Committee, serving in the newly established Jamiat Ulama-i-Hind, in the Congress party meetings, and supporting other Muslim voluntary associations, <italic>madrasas</italic> and political organisations across India. He expressed his particularly Islamic concerns as being confined to the preservation of Islamic learning and the autonomy of Muslim Personal Law, using the Jamiat Ulama-i-Hind as his primary platform. Both could be served by a religiously undifferentiated electoral system, and it was for this reason that the Jamiat Ulama allied with the Congress party and supported the abolishment of separate electorates (though not of reserved seats).</p>
<p>Madani’s politics were contested, most famously in a bitter exchange with the poet Allama Iqbal. Iqbal argued that Madani’s understanding of a ‘composite’ territorially and historically defined Indian nationalism which included Muslims and Hindus misconstrued the meanings of Arabic words used to describe com-munities in the Quran and in <italic>hadith</italic>. Chapter 5, entitled ‘Who speaks for the Muslims’, does well to point out that even while describing Madani as a ‘Maker of the Islamic World’ we must acknowledge the differences of opinion about what constituted ‘Muslim politics’ in colonial India. Metcalf pointedly sets up much of this discussion around the issue of Muslim League politics, and points to the ‘Madani formula’ of groupings of autonomous provinces as a counterpart to the eventual partition of the subcontinent. But her descriptions of the positions taken by other <italic>ulama</italic>, Muslim secularists, political Islamists like Maududi, and other small Muslim organisations, should serve as a caution against supposing that either group could claim to represent all of India’s Muslims.</p>
<p>In conclusion, Metcalf says that this biography of Madani is written to highlight his contributions to the politics of anti-colonialism in an undivided India. She reflects on Madani’s <italic>jihad</italic> as being his efforts in post-partition India to create an apolitical, educational and self-disciplining objective to Muslim action, and his attempts ‘to try to check the intractable attitude that every Muslim, even those still in India and even those who had fought for a united India, was at some level responsible for partition’ (p. 150). Metcalf holds Madani up as an example of humility for ‘contemporary Indians and Pakistanis’. His legacies, Metcalf argues, are in the avowedly apolitical stance taken by the Jamiatul Ulama-i-Hind after 1947 in India. For the Pakistan-side of the post-1947 equation, she adds that the organisation of the Jamiat Ulama ‘became a political party at times sympathetic to militancy’ (p. 158).</p>
<p>In all, Metcalf’s biography of Madani is intensely readable and evocative. Madani’s life and the time in which he lived are described convincingly and authoritatively with a judicious use of references to Madani’s own writings, bio-graphies written by his friends and admirers and other English-language scholarly works about his life. However certain small contradictions arise when using a nationalist narrative to describe Madani’s contributions to Muslim India. The first of these is in Metcalf’s distancing of Madani from the ‘Silk Letter Conspiracy’ of 1915–1916, a militant movement on the north western border with Afghanistan which went against the Congress-supported Gandhian principle of non-violent resistance. Metcalf reports only Madani and Mahmudul Hasan’s denials of their involvement before the tribunal (pp. 23–26, 30–31) despite Madani’s own detailed descriptions of his knowledge of and support for this movement in his autobiography <italic>Naqsh-i Hayat</italic>.The second is the irony that Metcalf lauds Madani for veering from Deoband’s apolitical stance before 1947, and applauds him for returning to it after. The third is that Metcalf does not discuss the problematic notion of Muslim cultural exceptionalism and unity held to by the Jamiat Ulama Hind and served unfalteringly by Madani, by which the <italic>ulama</italic> claim paternalistic authority over Muslim Personal Law and the private worlds of all other Muslims within the ‘composite nation’.</p>
<p>Metcalf’s account of Madani’s extraordinary life does not only serve a heroic history of a Gandhian and Congress-led Indian nationalism. It highlights the violence of the colonial state inflicted equally on Muslims and Hindus, and the negotiation of culture, law, authority and representation between them in undivided colonial India. In Pakistan, the politics of the Jamiat Ulama take forward Madani’s position on Muslim Law to claim that in the Islamic state, the <italic>ulama</italic> should have authority over all law making and constitutionalism. This too is his legacy, distanced though it is by a border.</p>
