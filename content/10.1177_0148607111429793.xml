<p><italic>Background</italic>: Arginine deficiency and chronic inflammation may cause immune dysfunction. The authors previously showed that a pharmacological dose of parenteral arginine facilitates ornithine rather than nitric oxide production in subacute peritonitis. Herein, they investigated the effects of different doses of parenteral arginine supplementation on immunocytic subpopulation distribution and function. <italic>Materials</italic>: Male Wistar rats that underwent cecal punctures for induction of subacute peritonitis were infused with conventional parenteral nutrition solution (1.61% of total calories as arginine) or solutions supplemented with low-, medium-, or high-dose arginine (2.85%, 4.08%, and 6.54% of total calories, respectively) for 7 days. Distributions of T cells, B cells, and monocytes/macrophages and cytokine productions of peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) and splenocytes were analyzed. <italic>Results</italic>: There were no significant differences in circulating white blood cell numbers and serum tumor necrosis factor (TNF)–α and interferon (IFN)–γ concentrations among groups. Serum nitrate/nitrite (NOx) and interleukin (IL)–2 levels were significantly decreased by arginine in a dose-dependent manner. Animals supplemented with parenteral arginine had significantly decreased productions of concanavalin (Con) A– and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)–stimulated TNF-α in PBLs and splenocytes, spontaneous IL-6 and LPS-stimulated IFN-γ in PBLs, and LPS-stimulated IL-6 in splenocytes. In addition, low-dose arginine significantly increased production of spontaneous IFN-γ in PBLs and splenocytes. High-dose arginine significantly increased spontaneous TNF-α, and Con A stimulated IL-4 and IL-6 in PBLs. <italic>Conclusion</italic>: Parenteral arginine administration at approximately 4% of total calories may alter PBLs and splenocytic immunity, and &gt;6% of total calories might not be of benefit in rats with subacute peritonitis.</p>

<title>Clinical Relevancy Statement</title>
<p>Commercial enteral nutrition formulas with immunonutrition, such as arginine, n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, and glutamine, are widely used in critical care for enhancement of the immune system. The application of chronic exogenous arginine is currently not warranted as a supplement in parenteral nutrition for peritonitic patients who develop arginine deficiency and impaired immune function. The findings of our study showed that a pharmacological dose of parenteral arginine (&gt;6% of total calories) might not be of benefit for the immunity of peripheral blood cells and splenocytes in subacute peritonitic rats, even though the synthesis of ornithine, a precursor of polyamine that has the ability to increase DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis in lymphocytes, was increased.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Chronic peritonitis is a common cause of prolonging the length of hospital stays for patients who underwent abdominal surgery, especially for those with subacute peritonitis resulting from abdominal trauma, intestinal surgery, resection and transplantation, and percutaneous gastrostomy/jejunostomy tube replacement.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0148607111429793">1</xref></sup> Patients with peritonitis have accelerated glucose, lipid, and protein metabolism.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0148607111429793">2</xref></sup> These metabolic alterations mainly result from the oversecretion of various endogenous mediators, such as cytokines and nitric oxide (NO), by cells of the immune system and other tissues and organs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0148607111429793">3</xref></sup> It has been suggested that sepsis, a common complication of peritonitis, is under the condition of arginine deficiency with impaired immune function.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0148607111429793">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0148607111429793"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0148607111429793">6</xref></sup> Decreased food consumption, impaired nutrient absorption, and increased arginine utilization worsen immune function and arginine homeostasis in septic patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0148607111429793">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0148607111429793"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0148607111429793">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>To provide adequate nutrients and improve hypercatabolism, parenteral nutrition (PN) was provided to patients with peritonitis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0148607111429793">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0148607111429793">9</xref></sup> Gardiner et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0148607111429793">10</xref></sup> suggested that the parenteral rather than the enteral route of nutrition support may improve the survival rate of rats with gut-origin sepsis; however, the beneficial effect of PN was not reproduced in rabbits with peritonitis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0148607111429793">11</xref></sup> In the past decade, the immunosuppressive effects of PN have drawn a lot of attention, and consequently, several different immunonutrients, such as glutamine, arginine, n-3 fatty acids, and nucleotides, became regular supplements in PN solutions for clinical use.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0148607111429793">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0148607111429793">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0148607111429793">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>Arginine, a precursor for the synthesis of NO, urea, creatine, glutamate, proline, and polyamines, may be catalyzed by nitric oxide synthase (NOS) by activated macrophages in the early stage of inflammation and by arginase in other immunocytes in the late stage of inflammation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0148607111429793">14</xref></sup> Increased production of proinflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)–α and interleukin (IL)–6, upregulate inducible NOS expression and increase the probability of NO toxicity from inflammation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0148607111429793">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0148607111429793">16</xref></sup> Even though several studies indicated that preadministered arginine significantly improved immune function in septic rats,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0148607111429793">17</xref></sup> adverse effects of arginine have also been reported.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0148607111429793">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0148607111429793">19</xref></sup> More recently, Dioguardi<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0148607111429793">20</xref></sup> indicated that exogenous arginine supplementation should be avoided because it may even worsen the metabolic pathways in which arginine is involved. These conflicting results of arginine supplementation might be due to variations in therapeutic time, dosing, route, and disease severity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0148607111429793">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0148607111429793">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>Using a rat model with subacute peritonitis (ie, nonlethal inflammation), our previous study revealed that administration of parenteral arginine accounting for 6.54% of total calories may facilitate ureagenesis and proline conversion without resulting in elevated serum nitrate/nitrite (NOx) levels.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0148607111429793">21</xref></sup> Even though these subacute peritonitic rats were not under the condition of arginine deficiency, the altered arginine metabolism resulted in an elevation in ornithine production when administered with a high dose of parenteral arginine. It has been demonstrated that arginine may be converted to urea and ornithine and then generates polyamines to augment lymphocyte mitogenesis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0148607111429793">14</xref></sup> Therefore, we further investigated the dose effects of parenteral arginine on systemic immune responsiveness and peripheral and splenic immunocytic subpopulation distribution and function in peritonitis.</p>

<title>Experimental Protocol</title>
<p>The animal facilities and protocols were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) in Changhua Christian Hospital, Changhua, Taiwan. Twenty-four male Wistar rats (National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan) initially weighing approximately 250 g were housed in individual stainless steel cages with free access to water and rat food (1320 Rat &amp; Mouse Maintenance diet; Altromin GmbH, Lage, Germany) in a room maintained at 22°C on a 12:12-hour light-dark cycle for 5 days prior to surgery. After an overnight fast, animals were anesthetized by intramuscular injection with 100 mg of ketamine and 10 mg of xylazine per kilogram of body weight. Subsequently, animals underwent 2 surgical procedures (day 0): cecal punctures for inducing nonlethal subacute peritonitis and catheter placement into the superior vena cava by way of the external jugular vein for infusing PN solutions, as described previously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0148607111429793">21</xref></sup> In brief, rats were subjected to a midline incision in the abdomen and punctures through both sides of the exposed cecum with an 18G needle without causing blood vessel damage. Subsequently, a small amount of fecal material, the size of a grain of rice, was extruded from each of the puncture sites, the cecum was placed back into the peritoneum, and the abdomen was closed with a 3-0 chromic gut suture for the muscle layer and surgical staples for the skin.</p>
<p>After the surgeries, animals were infused with 3.97 g (conventional PN solution without arginine supplementation; CP group), 7.01 g (low dose; LA group), 10.58 g (medium dose; MA group), or 16.15 g (high dose; HA group) of arginine per liter of PN solution for 7 days, which accounted for 1.61%, 2.85%, 4.08%, and 6.54% of the total calories, respectively. The highest dose of arginine (ie, 33.3 g/100 g of amino acids) provided in this study was close to the dose used in the study by Nieves et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0148607111429793">19</xref></sup> (30 g/100 g of protein). A commercially available amino acid solution (Aminosyn 10%; Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL) was used to substitute for arginine supplementation to provide an equal amount of nitrogen in each PN solution. During the experimental period, water was provided ad libitum, and the PN solution was infused gradually from 26 mL on day 0 to 62 mL (979 kJ/kg/d) on days 1–6, which provided 256 kJ of total calories, including 2.6 g of protein and 213.4 kJ of nonprotein calories, which provided adequate parenteral energy and nutrients for healthy rats of this size.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0148607111429793">21</xref></sup> The 4 kinds of PN solutions provided equal amounts of calories per liter.</p>
<p>During the experimental period, body weights of each animal were recorded daily. After being infused with PN solutions for 7 days, rats were killed under anesthesia with intramuscular injections of 100 mg ketamine and 10 mg xylazine per kilogram of body weight. Blood was collected by cardiac puncture, and the whole-blood, plasma, and serum samples were obtained for further assays. When the abdomen was incised for tissue collection, the rats had a muscular and connective tissue composed sac (0.5–1 cm in diameter) that enclosed the 2 cecal punctures and became an intra-abdominal abscess. To avoid contaminating other tissues and organs, the sac and the intestine were moved to the upper abdomen without damaging the structure. Subsequently, the spleen was dissected, weighed, and placed in ice-cold RPMI 1640 cell culture medium containing penicillin (100 IU/mL), streptomycin (100 µg/mL), 10 mM HEPES, 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), and 2 mM glutamine. A final sample size of 6 rats per group had a 100% survival rate.</p>

<sec id="section5-0148607111429793">
<title>Analytical Measurements</title>
<p>A hematology analyzer (GEN; Coulter, Inc, Miami, FL) was used to quantify the number of circulating white blood cells (WBCs). A commercial colorimetric kit (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI) was used to determine serum concentrations of NOx levels, known as an indirect but reliable indicator of NO and ONOO<sup>–</sup> formation in vivo. Serum concentrations of TNF-α, interferon (IFN)–γ, IL-2, IL-4, and IL-6 were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs; DuoSet, R&amp;D System, Minneapolis, MN, and Bethyl Laboratories, Inc, Montgomery, TX). Assays for NOx as well as for cytokines measured by ELISA contained all samples in each assay and were duplicated. The interassay coefficients of variance are 5%−10%.</p>
<sec id="section6-0148607111429793">
<title>Immunocyte suspensions</title>
<p>Peripheral blood was collected in EDTA-containing tubes and kept at room temperature until labeled with the appropriate antibodies. Then, 50 µL of whole blood was added to tubes containing antibodies directed against the appropriate cell surface antigens and incubated at room temperature for 15 minutes in the dark. Following incubation, red blood cells were lysed using NH<sub>4</sub>Cl lysis buffer (Sigma Chemical Co, St Louis, MO), and peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) with 2% FBS and resuspended in 500 µL PBS with 1% paraformaldehyde and 0.1% NaN<sub>3</sub> for flow cytometric analysis. Regarding the remaining peripheral blood, PBLs were obtained via the procedures of lysis, wash, and resuspension for other assays.</p>
<p>The single-cell suspensions of the spleen were prepared by teasing and grinding the tissue apart and flushing the cells through a 100-µm mesh screen to remove capsular material and cellular debris. Red blood cells were lysed from the splenocytes using NH<sub>4</sub>Cl lysis buffer and washed twice in PBS with 2% FBS. Subsequently, the single-cell suspensions were kept on ice until labeled with the appropriate antibodies, and their complete cell counts were quantified using a hemocytometer following trypan blue staining.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0148607111429793">
<title>Two-color flow cytometry</title>
<p>Immunofluorescent detection of cell subsets of PBLs and splenocytes was performed using a Becton-Dickinson FASCScan flow cytometer with excitation capabilities at 488 nm for the measurements of fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)– and phycoerythrin (PE)–conjugated mouse anti-rat monoclonal antibodies (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA).</p>
<p>Splenocytes and PBLs were added to tubes containing antibodies directed against the appropriate cell surface antigens, as reported by Morris and Komocsar.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0148607111429793">22</xref></sup> The cell surface markers included CD3-FITC (clone G4.18), CD3-PE (clone G4.18), CD4-PE (clone OX-35), and CD8b-FITC (clone 341) for T cells; CD45RA-PE (clone OX-33) plus IgM-FITC (clone G53-238) for B cells; and CD11b/c-PE (clone OX-42) for monocytes/macrophages. FITC-conjugated mouse IgG<sub>1</sub> (clone A112-2), IgG<sub>2</sub> (clone G155-178), and PE-conjugated mouse IgG<sub>3</sub> (clone A112-3) were used as nonspecific isotype control antibodies.</p>

<sec id="section8-0148607111429793">
<title>Immunocyte proliferation</title>
<p>In vitro cell proliferation observations in response to concanavalin A (Con A, a T cell mitogen) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS, a B cell and macrophage mitogen) were made using splenocytes. Splenocytes were resuspended at a concentration of 5 × 10<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0148607111429793">6</xref></sup> cells per mL of RPMI 1640 medium, 50 µL/well was plated in triplicate with 50 µL of medium with or without Con A (5 µL/mL) and LPS (10 µL/mL), and cells were incubated at 37°C in 5% CO<sub>2</sub> for 36 hours. Cell proliferation was determined by the MTS method (CellTiter 96 AQ<sub>ueous</sub> one solution; Promega, Madison, WI). Stimulation index of cell proliferation was calculated from absorbance of 490 nm by splenocytes cultured with RPMI 1640 medium and mitogens divided by the absorbance by those cultured with RPMI 1640 medium alone.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0148607111429793">
<title>Cytokine production</title>
<p>To analyze immune function, cytokine production, such as TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-2, IL-4, and IL-6, in PBLs and splenocytes was measured. PBLs and splenocytes (5 × 10<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0148607111429793">6</xref></sup> cells per mL) were cultured with RPMI 1640 medium alone or with Con A (5 µg/mL) and LPS (10 µg/mL) at 37°C in 5% CO<sub>2</sub> for 18 hours. Supernatants were removed by centrifugation and stored at −80°C. Cytokine concentrations of the supernatants were measured using the ELISA method.

<p>Using a rat model with subacute peritonitis, we previously showed that pharmacological doses of parenteral arginine may facilitate the process of ureagenesis, which results in an elevation in ornithine production,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0148607111429793">21</xref></sup> a precursor of polyamine that has the ability to increase DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis in lymphocytes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0148607111429793">14</xref></sup> Herein, we investigated the dose effects of parenteral arginine on the immune system in the peripheral blood and spleen. Our results showed that parenteral arginine at a dose of 2%−6% of total calories may decrease circulating levels of NOx and IL-2 and modulate immunocyte subpopulation and cytokine production. In addition, the parenteral arginine-induced alterations in PBLs and splenocytic immunity are in a U-shape dose-dependent manner, with increased immunity at a dose of 4.08%, not 1.61%, 2.85%, or 6.54% of the total calories as arginine, in rats with subacute peritonitis.</p>

<title>Cecal Puncture–Induced Subacute Inflammation</title>
<p>Cecal puncture and ligation (CPL)–induced peritonitis is commonly used as a clinical related model for acute abdominal sepsis. However, its mortality rate limits its application for the development of nutrition support and adjuvant, and ligation-induced intestinal ischemia and necrosis result in different pathophysiological responses from the hollow-organ perforation found in nonlethal peritonitis. Using an abdominal incision and cecal punctures to develop a nonlethal, subacute peritonitis in rats, we showed that this rat model has a 100% survival rate with a healed abdominal wound, decreased body weight gain, decreased serum albumin and IGF-I,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0148607111429793">21</xref></sup> and elevated serum TNF-α and NOx (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0148607111429793">Table 1</xref>).

<title>Parenteral Arginine Decreased Serum NOx</title>
<p>Dietary arginine supplementation may produce widely different physiologic effects, depending on the enzymes expressed during immune activation. For example, inducible NOS is activated by inflammation and sepsis, and provision of arginine may be potentially deleterious for the excess NO production via activated macrophages and lymphocytes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0148607111429793">23</xref></sup> In contrast, arginase is activated in physical stress, such as surgery, burns, and other trauma, resulting in arginine deficiency; the provision of arginine may restore immune function, especially to induce T lymphocytes toward the noninflammatory Th2 pathway.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0148607111429793">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0148607111429793">24</xref></sup> In our previous study, we showed that serum NOx concentrations were increased approximately 6-fold in peritonitic rats with parenteral feeding when compared to that of the healthy, chow diet–fed rats.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0148607111429793">21</xref></sup> In this study, we found an inverse relationship between the dose of parenteral arginine and serum NOx concentration. The increase in plasma ornithine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0148607111429793">21</xref></sup> and the decrease in serum NOx indicated that parenteral arginine supplementation may stimulate the activity of arginase to produce ornithine, which further inhibits the activity of inducible NOS in subacute peritonitis, as reviewed by Dioguardi.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0148607111429793">20</xref></sup> Further investigation of the dose effects of parenteral arginine on the expression of these enzymes and the subsequent efficacy in different diseases is a worthy endeavor.</p>

<title>Parenteral Arginine and Immunocytic Subset Distribution</title>
<p>The spleen, a representative systemic lymphoid organ that evaluates the immune system’s status, possessing approximately 15% of the total numbers of lymphocytes in the body, plays an important role with regard to the immune system.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0148607111429793">25</xref></sup> Numerous studies have shown that the numbers of peripheral and splenic lymphocytes are reduced during sepsis,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0148607111429793">4</xref></sup> and arginine supplementation may attenuate the sepsis-induced changes in immune function.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0148607111429793">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0148607111429793">26</xref></sup> In surgical patients, dietary arginine supplementation has been found to increase the rate of recovery of T lymphocyte mitogenesis in response to Con A and to increase T cell numbers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0148607111429793">27</xref></sup> However, in rats with gut-derived sepsis, parenteral arginine (2% of total calories) did not alter whole-blood and splenic lymphocyte subpopulation distribution.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0148607111429793">28</xref></sup> In the present study, we show for the first time that administration of parenteral arginine, accounting for more than 6% of total calories, may significantly decrease the numbers of splenocytes but not the spleen weight in subacute peritonitic rats. The decreased splenocytic numbers and unchanged spleen weights suggest that high doses of parenteral arginine might affect the structure and function of the spleen, but the mechanism is unclear.</p>
<p>In addition, subacute peritonitic rats administered with low and high but not medium doses of parenteral arginine had significantly increased percentages of total T cells in the PBLs and decreased percentages of CD4 T cells in the spleen (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0148607111429793">Table 2</xref>). Nevertheless, the abilities of splenocytic proliferation with or without mitogens were not affected by arginine. These changes revealed that parenteral arginine might alter the numbers and subset distribution of lymphocytes in a U-shape dose-dependent manner. Taken together, our findings imply that parenteral arginine supplementation might have beneficial effects in a certain range of doses (ie, approximately 2%−4% of total calories), and pharmacological doses (ie, &gt;6% of total calories) of parenteral arginine might have adverse effects on the splenocytes in subacute peritonitis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section22-0148607111429793">
<title>Parenteral Arginine and Immunocytic Function</title>
<p>Our results also showed that parenteral arginine supplementation significantly decreased serum IL-2, IFN-γ, IL-4, IL-6, but not TNF-α in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0148607111429793">Table 1</xref>). We further investigated the immunity of lymphocytes and found that high doses of parenteral arginine significantly increased spontaneous TNF-α production in PBLs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0148607111429793">Figure 3</xref>) and that low doses of parenteral arginine significantly increased spontaneous IFN-γ production in PBLs and splenocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0148607111429793">Figure 4</xref>) and decreased spontaneous IL-2 production in PBLs. In addition, TNF-α production by Con A– and LPS-stimulated PBLs and splenocytes and IFN-γ production by LPS-stimulated PBLs were significantly decreased by parenteral arginine. These alterations indicated that high doses of parenteral arginine supplementation may augment spontaneous production of proinflammatory cytokines, and low doses may activate mitogen-stimulated cellular immune response in PBLs and splenocytes in subacute peritonitis. These results suggest that there is a U-shape dose response relating parenteral arginine supplementation in modulating immune function.</p>
<p>Moreover, IL-4 production was significantly increased with Con A stimulation and significantly decreased with LPS stimulation in PBLs in a dose-dependent manner. Spontaneous IL-6 production was significantly decreased and Con A–stimulated IL-6 production was significantly increased by parenteral arginine in PBLs, and Con A– and LPS-stimulated IL-6 production was significantly decreased by parenteral arginine in splenocytes. These results suggest that parenteral arginine may elevate the production of noninflammatory (Th2) cytokines in circulating T lymphocytes and may attenuate those productions in T and B splenocytes and macrophages. On the basis of the above results, we reveal that there is a U-shape dose response relating parenteral arginine supplementation to alleviate inflammatory response and to induce T lymphocytes toward the noninflammatory Th2 pathway in PBLs and splenocytes in subacute peritonitis.</p>

<title>Limitations of This Study</title>
<p>The present study, like most others, has several limitations. First, the ex vivo work was performed in immunocytes incubated with RPMI 1640 medium, which provided more essential amino acids, including arginine (1.14 millimolar), lysine, and proline, compared to other media. Thus, the interpretation of these data is difficult. In our pilot study, Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM), a medium suitable for most cells and with zero concentration of arginine, was used to culture the immunocytes obtained from rats. However, the survival rate and the function of those immuocytes obtained from normal rats were only about 30%−50% of those incubated with RPMI 1640. Therefore, in our ex vivo studies, we cultured the immunocytes using RPMI 1640 to show their function. Our results showed the relative comparison of the effects of parenteral arginine when all the immunocytes were cultured in the same condition. Second, the experimental model provided is a large rodent model, which creates significant limitations in the investigation of signaling pathways. Future studies may try to find some gene knockout mice to work on a specific mechanism and pathways.</p>

<p>In summary, using a rat model with subacute peritonitis, our findings suggest that administration of parenteral arginine for &gt;6% of total calories may significantly decrease the number of splenocytes and serum NOx. In addition, parenteral arginine may alter the numbers and subset the distribution of lymphocytes in a U-shape dose-dependent manner in subacute peritonitis without affecting cell proliferation. Moreover, we showed for the first time that a dose-related response in parenteral arginine supplementation differentially modulates the spontaneous and mitogen-stimulated abilities of PBLs and splenocytes to produce proinflammatory and noninflammatory cytokines in subacute peritonitis. Taken together, the results of the present study suggest that an appropriate dose of parenteral arginine supplementation, approximately 2%−4% of total calories, could enhance the function of immunocytes, and supplementation with &gt;6% of total calories as arginine might not be of benefit for rats with subacute peritonitis.</p>
