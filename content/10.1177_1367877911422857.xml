<abstract>
<p>Drawing from Hochschild’s concept of ‘emotional labour’, this article explores the roles performed by Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) masseuses in a large spa complex in a Chinese metropolis. Through an ethnographic study it was found that such roles were constantly shifting according to the dynamics of the service encounter and such shifts exhibited different forms of emotional labour that can actually <italic>accumulate</italic> exchange value in the form of psychological and economic benefits. Moreover, the masseuses had a very strong social identity as massage ‘experts’ that appeared to buttress the negative outcomes often associated with emotional labour. The findings suggest that emotional labour is not a stable and static process as previously thought and that future research needs to take more into account the agency of the worker.</p>

<p>Emotional labour refers to the management of one’s emotions and the work necessary to produce an emotional state in others during interpersonal encounters. Since <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1367877911422857">Hochschild’s (1983)</xref> ground-breaking book on the emotional labour performed by flight attendants, substantial work has been done by scholars in the exploration of the emotional labour performed by workers in different service jobs. The literature has generally focused on three domains of research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1367877911422857">Toerien and Kitzinger, 2007</xref>). One has been the exploration of the psychological effects of emotional labour in terms of the dissonance experienced as a result of having to express emotions in which one does not believe. These studies generally demonstrated the negative psychological and physical costs of emotional labour, such as burn-out and feelings of alienation. Another area of study focuses on the organization/worker dynamic by exploring how service workers use emotional labour to express emotion that is consonant with organization rules and expectations. The third area focuses on the recognition and pay of those performing emotional labour. As emotional labour is often performed by women, researchers in this area wanted to address enduring gender inequalities in the workforce and the unrecognized work involved in emotional labour.</p>
<p>In general, the literature appears to place workers as hapless individuals who often have to fake their emotions and perform roles in accordance with mandated company rules and expectations. In other words, the individuals are ‘performing’ their roles for the benefit of <italic>others</italic> at the expense of the <italic>self</italic>. Thus, the mainstream literature generally views emotional labour as a burden. It downplays the agency of the worker and emphasizes the cost of performing to a prescribed role while downplaying the potential benefits.</p>
<p>This ethnographic study aims to extend the idea of emotional labour and contribute to the literature by exploring the roles performed by Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) masseuses in a large spa complex in a Chinese metropolis. Drawing from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1367877911422857">Goffman’s (1959)</xref> dramaturgical perspective from which emotional labour is derived, as well as from social identity theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1367877911422857">Tajfel, 1972</xref>) and Hochschild’s assertion that emotional labour has ‘exchange value’, this study aims to demonstrate that TCM masseuses employ a variety of interchangeable identities that determine the roles they perform in their interactions with clients. Moreover, certain roles exhibit different forms of emotional labour that can actually <italic>accumulate</italic> exchange value in the form of psychological and economic benefits.</p>
<p>There are two reasons why the emotional labour performed by TCM masseuses are worthy of investigation. First, gendered work in the ‘beauty industries’ has long been an important topic of emotional labour research (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1367877911422857">Paulson, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1367877911422857">Sharma and Black, 2001</xref>). Second, previous ethnographies of migrant Chinese workers in urban cities have tended to focus on the lives and identities of young, low-skilled and low-paid migrant workers, such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1367877911422857">Pun’s (1999)</xref> study of <italic>dagongmei</italic> factory workers in Shenzhen. Yet, the economic development and success of modern China is not defined solely by masses of rural migrant women working under often harsh and difficult conditions. There are also other female migrants who work in relatively ‘respectable’ professions and whose lives and identities also need to be narrated as part of the overall discourse of female migrants working in China’s industrial cities.</p>
<p>This article is structured as follows. First, the pertinent literature on emotional labour is introduced and related to the context of this study. Next, the work of TCM masseuses will be described followed by ethnographic description and analysis of a large spa complex in a Chinese urban city. Semiotic analysis is employed to explain how the signs within the spa serve to accentuate the identities of the TCM masseuses, followed by in-depth interviews with TCM masseuses to find out how they perform emotional labour and the multiple roles they have to play. Implications of the findings to the emotional labour literature and suggestions for further research will be discussed.</p>
<sec id="section1-1367877911422857">
<title>Literature review</title>
<p>Hochschild defined emotional labour as ‘the management of feeling to create a publicly observable facial and bodily display’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1367877911422857">1983</xref>: 7). It involves managing one’s own private feelings while at the same time expressing outward emotions in compliance with organizational norms so as to induce certain feelings and emotions in the client. To accomplish this effectively workers play roles that follow normatively prescribed ‘display rules’ so as to create impressions in front of an observing audience. Thus, flight attendants are required to induce feelings of security and comfort from nervous passengers (e.g. by using an assuring tone of voice, a smile, etc.) regardless of how they actually feel about the passengers. This kind of emotional work is common in other dyadic interactions in such contexts as a hospitals (nurse/patient), schools (teacher/student) and spas (masseuse/client). Yet the gap between the emotions that one privately feels and outwardly expressing emotions that are different to such private feelings can create what Hochschild calls ‘emotive dissonance’. The need to play multiple roles and feign emotions to create certain impressions can be psychologically taxing and can negatively affect individuals’ psychological well-being, and even lead to burnout. This aspect of emotional labour has generated the most research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1367877911422857">Wharton, 2009</xref>) and has been explored in such jobs as waitressing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1367877911422857">Tibbals, 2007</xref>) and prostitution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1367877911422857">Sanders, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Another facet of emotional labour is its relationship with organizational effectiveness and how it can have both positive and negative consequences for organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1367877911422857">Mann, 1997</xref>). The third aspect of the literature is the exploration of the recognition and compensation of workers performing emotional labour, and this is the area in which most studies of the beauty industries have been situated. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1367877911422857">Sharma and Black’s (2001)</xref> interviews with beauty therapists in the UK found that the therapists actually derived a lot of satisfaction from their work but were generally frustrated by the lack of respect for their profession and the perception that their work was ‘trivial’. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1367877911422857">Toerien and Kitzinger’s (2007)</xref> conversation analysis of the interactions between the beauty therapist and the client demonstrated the unrecognized and underpaid expertise required in simultaneously working on the client’s body while engaging in emotional labour. Following from this strand of research this study explores the roles and emotional labour performed by masseuses trained in a technique that is well known and respected in a working environment that is characteristically Asian.</p>
<sec id="section2-1367877911422857">
<title>The TCM masseuse</title>
<p>Traditional Chinese Massage, commonly known as <italic>tuina</italic>, is based on traditional Chinese medical theory and techniques dating back to 2700 <sc>bc</sc> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1367877911422857">Cen et al., 2003</xref>). With their knowledge of acupressure points, joints and ligaments, TCM masseuses can use various techniques to massage parts of the body to stimulate and heal certain ailments and pains. The benefits of tuina are well known in Hong Kong and China, and it has also gained popularity in many Western countries as a valid complementary treatment to traditional Western medicine. Training to become a TCM masseuse can take several years and usually undertaken at TCM units attached to hospitals.</p>
<p>The field side of this study is a spa complex in Shenzhen located in China’s southern province of Guangdong. The massage industry in Shenzhen contributes significantly to the local economy and has over 3000 officially licensed massage spas that employ over 40,000 masseuses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1367877911422857"><italic>China Labour Bulletin</italic>, 2008</xref>). The massive size of the industry is largely due to Shenzhen’s close proximity to Hong Kong. Having a massage is the fourth most popular activity for Hong Kong residents crossing the border to Shenzhen after restaurant consumption, shopping for food and shopping for clothing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1367877911422857">Wang, 2004</xref>). Therefore, a massage can be regarded as a common service encounter in Shenzhen.</p>
<p>The ‘spa complex’ is a relatively new phenomenon in Shenzhen and it is characterized by its massive size and operations that occupy several floors of a building, decadent décor, diverse clientele, and a menu that offers a vast array of massage and grooming services. These complexes are open 24 hours a day and have shuttle services along the China/Hong Kong border checkpoints that transport customers directly to the spas as soon as they exit immigration. With full dining facilities and the provision of overnight accommodation, these spa complexes function almost like hotels. In order to provide the full range of spa services the spa complexes need to hire hundreds if not thousands of masseuses, the bulk of whom are young female immigrants known as <italic>dagongmei</italic>, who immigrated to the city from rural parts of China (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1367877911422857">Pun, 1999</xref>). A small minority, however, are professionally trained TCM masseuses whose skills are actively promoted and accentuated by the spa complexes through their use of signs that delineate the identities of TCM masseuses as skilled practitioners of massage and the other masseuses as cute and playful young girls. Therefore, how TCM masseuses identify themselves and the roles they play in such environments (the ‘back stage’) needs to be explored in addition to the roles they play and the emotional labour they perform during the service encounter. In all, the following research questions are addressed in this article:</p>
<list id="list1-1367877911422857" list-type="order"><list-item><p>How do TCM masseuses distinguish and maintain their identities as professionally trained masseuses in the Shenzhen spa complex?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>How do TCM masseuses use emotional labour during the service encounter?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>To what extent do the experiences of the TCM practitioners confirm or extend the emotional labour literature?</p></list-item></list>
</sec></sec>
<sec id="section3-1367877911422857" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methodology and data</title>
<p>As part of the study I visited one of the spa complexes on four occasions between February and April 2010 to gain an in-depth understanding of the roles and emotional labour performed by three TCM masseuses. Data was collected through interviews with the masseuses during the time of undertaking massage treatments and through participant observation of the interactions between the masseuse and my companion after the completion of my own treatment. The medium of communication was Cantonese.</p>
<sec id="section4-1367877911422857">
<title>The spa complex – a stage of signs and connotations</title>
<p>Before describing and analysing the work of the TCM masseuses it is first necessary to describe the working environment in which all the masseuses work. Such description will show how various signs and symbols are purposefully chosen and used by the spa management to differentiate the identities and roles of TCM masseuses relative to other employees.The field site is a large multi-storey spa complex founded in 2004. According to its promotional literature the complex spans over 480,000 square feet and has over 800 massage rooms. Customers pay an entrance charge of RMB98, which provides them one free drink and 24-hour usage of the spas facilities (e.g. sauna pools, lounges), but the fee is waived if a customer’s accumulative spending exceeds this amount (i.e. the price of one massage). This pricing model is common among spas in Shenzhen.</p>
<p>The customer experience in these spa complexes follows a typical procedure upon receiving their numbered wrist bands (blue for men and red for women). First, they enter separate changing room areas which contain a vast array of spa pools, showers, jacuzzis and steam rooms. Then, after cleaning and changing into loose robes, the customers go to the central lounge area. In the case of this spa, customers who leave the spa pool area take an elevator to the lounge on the third floor. The signification of color and clothing continues as the elevator doors open and the customers enter the lounge area. Young female and male attendants dressed in simple floral shirts welcome and direct customers to the lounge seats.</p>
<p>The lounge floor is essentially a relaxation floor that consists of hundreds of lounge seats, which are fairly large and can be adjusted into a flat bed. Each lounge seat has a large LCD monitor that broadcasts Hong Kong, mainland and international TV programmes and attendants are close by to respond to any requirements made by the customers. Through the signification of color and style of clothing three work roles and identities can be observed on the lounge floor. These are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1367877911422857">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<p>TCM masseuses and regular masseuses do not work on the lounge floor as full body massages are not provided there. Nevertheless, two signs in the lounge area explicitly define the status and role of the TCM masseuse. First, the massage tariff leaflet next to each lounge seat indicates a price premium for a TCM massage. Whereas a normal Chinese, Swedish and Thai massage is priced at RMB188 for a 90-minute treatment plus RMB88 per additional hour, a TCM massage is priced at RMB218 plus RMB98 per additional hour. Based on the pricing alone, TCM massages are accorded a higher status and quality relative to the other massages. The second sign is the photos of the TCM masseuses displayed on the 15-inch LCD screens of the ‘masseuse selection stations’. These electronic stations are placed throughout the lounge floor and the touch-screen monitors allow customers to view and select the masseuses they want for the full body massage. Then, they just provide the number of the masseuse to one of the managers who arranges the treatment rooms on the fourth floor for the customers.</p>
<p>Six masseuse photos are shown at any one time arranged in two rows of three. Accompanying each photo are the masseuses’ age, home town, massage types offered, massage strength (‘soft’, ‘medium’ and ‘strong’) and availability. It is the connotations evoked by the photos that distinguish TCM masseuses from other masseuses. The regular masseuses come from all over China, such as Hunan, Jiangxi and Sichuan. They tend to be younger and their white clothing is mixed with bright coloured (usually pink) clothing. They also have playful and alluring poses and smiles. Cuteness, personality, youthfulness and sexiness are some of the connotations evoked by these photos, and hints that the customer is getting more than a simple massage. Such connotations are amplified by a huge display next to the elevators which shows life-size cut-outs of the ‘masseuse of the month’ with such designations as ‘Miss July’ and ‘Miss September’. It is obvious that these images have polysemic meanings and that the management is not promoting these masseuses based solely on their ability to provide a good massage, but also on their youth and looks. On the other hand, the photos of TCM masseuses show very serious and professional poses. They are dressed all in white and many are in their mid 20s to 30s.</p>
<p>Based on these signs and symbols on the lounge floor, it can be observed that TCM masseuses are accorded a higher status within the overall hierarchy of masseuses, and the roles and identities of TCM masseuses, as perceived by the management and the customers at least, are very clear when compared to the regular masseuses.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1367877911422857">
<title>Social identities in action</title>
<p>Three TCM masseuses were interviewed as part of this ethnographic study and they are referred to by an alias. Their initial selection was made randomly at the ‘masseuse selection stations’ based on the criteria of availability and coming from Guangdong province since Cantonese is typically spoken there. Based on the options on the selection stations the ratio between TCM masseuses to regular masseuses were about 1 to 40. After making their choices of massage type and masseuse, customers are directed to the treatment rooms located on the fourth floor. The standard treatment rooms have two or three treatment beds. They are dimly lit and feature only a phone and a small desk. In compliance with the Shenzhen municipal government directives, all the treatment room doors have small see-through glass windows so it is possible for someone outside to see what is happening in the room. The common understanding is that this directive deters the masseuse from engaging in sexual activities with customers.</p>
<p>The basic biographical information of the masseuses is shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1367877911422857">Table 2</xref>. Though they were not Shenzhen natives, they were born and raised in cities and towns in Guangdong (the province in which Shenzhen is located) and migrated to Shenzhen to work in the spa industry there. They all have various degrees of certified TCM training.</p>

<p>Ah Mei and Ah Hua found their jobs through their personal networks. Ah Ming followed her husband to Shenzhen as he was a supervisor of a factory and had to move there.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1367877911422857">
<title>The ‘expert’ identity</title>
<p>When asked what they thought about their higher tariff for massages and the way they are portrayed by management, particularly the photos in the electronic masseuse selection stations, the masseuses were generally very supportive of the signs and connotations as this reflects their higher status and clear segregation from the regular masseuses. As Ah Hua says:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Of course we should be paid more. We put in a lot of time and energy in studying TCM massage techniques. Can the others diagnose whether a muscle is really sore or not? I don’t think so. The management is right in recognizing and highlighting our specialized skills.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Yet, Ah Mei thought that the price difference of RMB30 should be even higher to really distinguish the quality of what the customers are getting.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>What they are offering … these so-called ‘massages’ … I can get for RMB40 just about anywhere in Shenzhen. I know that they don’t get all the money of course – just a small percentage. But it gives the impression that their massage is almost as good as ours. Which of course it is not.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Ah Ming is the most pragmatic of the three, perhaps due to her older age and longer working time at the spa. She says that many male customers are not really looking for a real medicinal massage, but just want to be felt and touched by a young pretty masseuse and have a chat.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>It’s not all about the massage quality, otherwise they [the regular masseuses] would be paid almost nothing. Customers are paying for the companionship of these young girls and this is what our bosses sell. It gives the men an ego boost and makes them feel like billionaires. That’s fine because it all comes down to what the customers want. For those who want a real massage they know that we are better.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>That they constitute a minority was not a big concern for the TCM masseuses. Moreover, they acknowledged that the success and profitability of the spa complexes are built upon the young masseuses. All three of them have no problems with, and in fact, support, the portrayal of such masseuses as sex objects. As Ah Hua explains:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>By portraying them as sex objects this further accentuates our position as professional TCM masseuses. Look at us. They are not going to put our [TCM masseuses] faces on their posters and advertisements because we are ugly. We cannot do what they do with those sexy poses and sweet smiles. And they cannot do what we can do. If they provide a bad massage or substandard service it does not drag us down, but actually makes us look better.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>For Ah Mei being in the minority is actually a good thing because it makes her feel more important and special.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Being small in number means that the management has to treat us better. You don’t just go out a find a TCM masseuse off a street. We are the ones that give credibility to these places.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The constant emphasis on the collective ‘us’ (TCM masseuse) and ‘them’ (regular masseuse) can be explained by <italic>social identity theory</italic>. Social identity is defined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1367877911422857">Tajfel (1972</xref>: 292) as ‘the individual’s knowledge that he belongs to certain social groups together with some emotional and value significance to him of this group membership’. The central premise of the theory is that the psychological self is construed in terms of group memberships and that individuals have an innate desire to distinguish their group more positively than other groups as a way to maintain positive self-esteem. This is achieved by accentuating intergroup comparisons between one’s own group (in-group) and another group (out-group). Applied to this study context, the psychological concerns of the TCM masseuses are that (1) their group is distinct from the other out-group and (2) their group is the higher-status group. When ‘group identity’ is stronger than ‘personal identity’, group norms, attitudes and values become the basis of individual behaviour rather than individuals’ own attitudes and beliefs. The management addresses their core psychological concerns by adopting signs and symbols that accentuate intergroup comparisons between the workers, which, in turn, increases the salience of their identity as TCM masseuses.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1367877911422857">
<title>The ‘urbanite’ identity</title>
<p>According to social identity theory individuals can have multiple identities and which identity is chosen as the basis of attitudes and behaviour depends on which identities are salient. Whether an identity is salient depends on certain contextual factors and situations. The ‘expert’ identity was adopted by TCM masseuses to distinguish their professionalism in comparison to the regular masseuses. Yet another strong identity was revealed when the TCM masseuses were asked how they thought that they ‘fitted in’ with fellow workers in the spa.</p>
<p>The TCM masseuses actually have few opportunities to interact socially with the regular masseuses. They are more economically secure so they rent their own apartments and are therefore not part of the group-based dormitory life experienced by the regular masseuses. Within the spa complex itself, the worker’s lounges in the basement are separated and the TCM masseuses have their own smaller lounge. When not on duty all masseuses must sit in the lounge during their shift and be ready at a moment’s notice to serve customers. While they are waiting the masseuses usually watch television and chat with each other.</p>
<p>Even though the spa management does not interfere with the interpersonal and group dynamics on the basement floor, there exists an implicit understanding among TCM and regular masseuses that they do not enter each other’s lounges. Ah Mei recalled that when she first started at the spa she was reprimanded by her peers for entering the lounge of the regular masseuses to borrow a hair clip.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>When I told the other [TCM] masseuses a few days later in our lounge they gave their disapproval and told me that we don’t encroach into <italic>dagongmei</italic> territory. If I ever needed anything and no one is around I should go directly to one of the supervisors instead.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>What would have happened to Ah Mei if she had continued to disobey her peers? According to Ah Mei, the consequences are subtle but can be very harmful to her livelihood since a lot of her income is derived from tips, which in turn, depends on a constant stream of customers. As she explains:</p>

<p>The experienced masseuses have a lot of return customers. When they bring someone new with them, such as a co-worker or a friend, they telephone in advance to set up the time and ask the masseuses to bring along someone ‘good’ for their companions. By pairing up with some of the experienced masseuses in this way I was able to develop a set of regular clients myself. But of course I won’t be asked to pair up if I don’t follow the rules.</p>

<p>During the interviews, <italic>dagongmei</italic> was a term frequently used by TCM masseuses to refer to the regular masseuses. When talking about themselves as a collective the TCM masseuses refer themselves as ‘we’ or ‘we city people’. Thus, the urban/rural distinction is another important identity that accentuates intergroup comparisons among the workers. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1367877911422857">Pun (1999)</xref>, the Chinese term <italic>dagongmei</italic> is composed of two separate parts. ‘<italic>Dagong</italic>’ refers to the idea of working for a boss and selling one’s labour. ‘<italic>Mei</italic>’ refers to a single and young female. As it also means ‘younger sister’ the connotation is one of lower status. But, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1367877911422857">Pun (2004)</xref> later asserted, the term is not necessarily a negative one, but serves as a collective identity to describe and place the millions of female rural workers working in China’s industrial cities within a social hierarchy. Moreover, it is a term that signifies their transient status as ‘outsiders’.</p>
<p>In a workplace where almost all the workers are female there is a lack of what can be considered a sense of ‘female solidarity’ between the two groups of masseuses. Such a situation is consistent with the assumptions of social identity theory. The TCM masseuses adopt ‘expert’ as the common superordinate identity and overriding basis of intergroup comparison. The salience of such identities is accentuated by structural dynamics of the workplace and the variety of signs and symbols presented by the management. Below the superordinate identity is that of the ‘urbanite’ identity, which is used by TCM masseuses to further segregate themselves based on their perceived prejudices against <italic>dagongmei</italic>. These identities are so powerful that they override the common identity of ‘woman’ that could nurture a sense of togetherness and solidarity among the female workforce in the spa.</p>
<p>To summarize the findings in relation to the first research question, the interviews with the TCM masseuses show that ‘expert’ and ‘urbanite’ are the identities they most commonly adopt in their working environment (i.e. the back stage). By adopting such identities, and behaving in ways consisting with such identities, they reinforce and accentuate their positive group distinctiveness in relation to the regular masseuses. Because of such intergroup comparisons, certain stereotypes and prejudices are also displayed when talking about the out-group. The TCM masseuses clearly perceive themselves as professionals and city dwellers while the regular masseuses are perceived as amateurs and uncultured people. But, at the same time, they recognize the necessity of such masseuses and tolerate them as long as group boundaries are rigidly enforced. This is achieved through (1) the signification practices of the management, whose commercial interests align with the TCM masseuses’ need for group distinctiveness; and (2) implicit and explicit in-group norms and practices that sanction those who ‘cross the line’ and interact with the regular masseuses.</p>

<title>The service encounter</title>
<p>In the case of a full-body massage the customer would actually have few opportunities to observe the facial and bodily display of the masseuse. The only observable aspect is the voice and touch of the masseuse. Moreover, what happens in the treatment room is a ‘private performance’ that is not subject to surveillance from management or other customers. In such an environment the TCM masseuses actually have a high degree of autonomy to assume different identities and roles as part of their interactions with the client. The adoption of an identity during the service encounter is not fixed. Instead, different identities are <italic>constantly adopted and shifted between</italic> during the massage treatment.</p>
<p>When asked how they interact with new customers the answers were very consistent among the interviewees. One of the most important tasks at the beginning of the treatment is to establish one’s credentials as a TCM masseuse. Therefore, the ‘expert’ identity is adopted as the ‘default’ role for most initial encounters. As Ah Hua explains:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The first step is always the diagnosis. We ask the customers first if they have any particular areas of the body that have muscle soreness. If they say no we try to look for a sore spot ourselves … the back, shoulders and neck are the places where we can usually feel the lumps. We just have to exert some slight pressure at those points and the customer can feel the discomfort. This usually impresses them a lot.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Through the adoption of such a role, the TCM masseuses use their professional knowledge to talk with the customers and diagnose any bodily problems they may have. The combination of hand movements along the customer’s body together with caring, yet authoritative, voice are aimed at producing an emotional state of reassurance and trust within the customer. This is usually followed by some in-depth questions and small talk about the customer’s lifestyle that could have led to their muscle discomfort. The typical opening lines include: ‘You must be in a job where you sit a lot’, ‘How much sleep do you get each night?’ and ‘Wow … you are so tired’. Ostensibly, these short questions and statements are part of the diagnostic process of finding out more about the antecedent conditions leading to the customer’s muscle pain. However, they are also probing questions that the TCM masseuses use to test the extent to which the customers want to engage in conversation. This is particularly important in massage treatments lasting many hours.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1367877911422857">Hochschild (1983)</xref> call these kinds of masseuse/customer interactions ‘surface acting’, which entails displaying feelings that are not genuinely felt by the masseuse. Previous emotional labour research has attempted to show that such repeated surface acting can potentially lead to burn-out and psychological problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1367877911422857">Wharton, 2009</xref>). Yet, in this study context, the surface acting is essential as part of one’s professional identity and the need to create an atmosphere in the treatment room to reduce the monotony of the work. Ah Ming elaborates further:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>For those who want to talk, it doesn’t require much prompting from me to get them to talk. For those who don’t want to talk there is nothing I can do. These customers just want to close their eyes and sleep, especially during the late evenings. This is great if I am not in the mood for talking myself. But it can feel like a long session if I want to have a chat.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The ‘urbanite’ identity is not called upon often. The few times it is adopted are when the customers assume that the TCM masseuses are from the countryside or speak to them as if they were <italic>dagongmei</italic>. Ah Mei recalled a conversation with a customer about the price of televisions and the topic moved on to High-Definition TVs. Assuming she was from the countryside the customer said in derogative way, ‘You probably don’t know what I mean as you haven’t seen one before.’ This activated Ah Mei’s urban identity and she quickly emphasized her background and life history to demonstrate that she was someone from the city.</p>
<p>As these interactions show, the identities of ‘expert’ and ‘urbanite’ adopted in the back stage are also adopted in various degrees on the front stage. In the back stage, the most generic identity is that of ‘employee’ – someone who enters a contractual agreement to perform a service in exchange for a salary over a period of time. ‘Expert’ is the default role in both the back stage and front stage. In the back stage, its purpose is to create a positive intergroup comparison relative to the regular masseuses. On the front stage, it is used to demonstrate one’s professionalism when interacting with a customer.</p>
<p>Hochschild’s conceptualization also sees emotional labour as a commodity that has <italic>exchange value</italic>. One of her concerns, which was shared and explored by subsequent researchers, was that the value generated through the customer–client exchange benefits only the employers and their profit margins at the expense of the psychological health and well-being of the workers. Yet interviews with the TCM masseuses suggest that they proactively attempt to accumulate exchange value for themselves and one common way to do this is the switch to the ‘inquirer’ identity after establishing the initial ‘expert’ identity. The inquirer identity essentially involves the purposeful collection of knowledge that has potential economic or psychological benefits.</p>
<p>For Ah Ming, she and her husband have investments in the Shenzhen stock exchange. Therefore, customers with business backgrounds are always potential informants for latest market trends and developments. As she says:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>As soon as the customer reveals himself to be someone in the business field I immediately begin to ask questions about his business and his opinion on latest market trends. However, I cannot do it directly. Most cases I have to pretend that I do not know much but show some small interest. This is often enough to get the customer to talk.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Ah Mei is particularly interested in and curious about what is happening in Hong Kong as it is her aspiration to settle there eventually. Therefore, any Hong Kong customer is always a source of information for her. Anything related to the latest living standards and celebrity gossip are things she pays particular attention to. As she explains:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I plan to go and live there in a few years time. So it is important that I be well prepared and gather all the information I need. This information is always useful for future interactions with the Hong Kong customers.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>However, even when the TCM masseuses adopt the ‘inquirer’ role they can never stray too far. At a moment’s notice they must be ready to switch back to the ‘expert’ role to demonstrate that they are paying attention to the customer’s body with such prompts as ‘How does it feel here?’ and ‘This place is quite sore. I’m going to press a little harder. Tell me if you feel any pain.’ Ah Mei found out the hard way in her early days at the spa when one customer said: ‘I am paying you to treat my body. Not to answer your questions.’ The customer ended up paying no tip at all at the end of the treatment, which is considered a very ungracious act since tipping is expected.</p>
<p>While both the ‘expert’ and ‘inquirer’ identities can be considered surface acting, it is apparent that the ‘inquirer’ identity provides a much higher exchange value. Not only does the identity break up the monotony of a long massage, but the TCM masseuses consciously adjust their own identities and feelings in order to extract useful information from the customers that can be put into immediate or future use. In many cases the customers were happy to oblige, not knowing that their feelings and responses are being directed and manipulated by the TCM masseuses for their own purposes.</p>
<p>The second way to perform emotional labour is through <italic>deep acting</italic>, a process in which the TCM masseuse tries to experience the emotions they want to display or elicit from the customer. While not often used for new customers the TCM masseuses often have to switch to deep acting when interacting with their regular customers. For Ah Hua, deep acting is necessary because, over time, return customers tend to disclose more of their feelings and personal lives. Therefore, the masseuses often feel compelled to relate to their customers and draw upon their own life experiences in the process. As she says:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Customers come back to me regularly because they think I am really good with my skills and my ability to take care of their body. Many times, they also feel that I am a good companion and an outlet for them to disclose their innermost thoughts.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>For Ah Mei such innermost thoughts can be positive or negative, but it is the negative news that is more common as her customers use her as an outlet to express their frustrations, usually those to do with their work and relationships.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>One female customer was telling me about her husband seeing another woman. It was a very awkward situation as I had to be very sympathetic to what she was saying. I have never experienced something like that … but, as a woman I can understand what it feels like.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Such a ‘confidant’ role is an important one for the masseuses since it is a ‘value added’ service that they provide to return customers and is one important way to encourage customers to stick with the same masseuse. Yet, while the emotional labour performed can be demanding the exchange value is relatively low as the focus is on relating to the feelings and emotions of the customer.</p>
<p>Another important role is that of the ‘friend’, a role that is very demanding in terms of emotional labour but provides a higher exchange value. This role comes into play when the relationship between the masseuse and the customer becomes synonymous with a real friendship, where anything can be freely discussed and disclosed during the treatment. Going a step further, it may even mean meetings outside the treatment room. Ah Mei has done this a few times, taking some of her customers to Shenzhen restaurants that she recommended during the treatments. However, she points out that the TCM masseuses will never initiate an outside meeting themselves but only do so when the customers offer them the opportunity to do so. In particular, she would be very careful if a male customer were to invite her out. Refusing such an invitation could jeopardize her relationship with the client, but, at the same time, it can give the wrong impression to the customer. One way to get over this is to ask the customer if she could bring a fellow masseuse.</p>
<p>The role of ‘friend’ can be quite rewarding for the TCM masseuse. For example, Ah Mei stayed at the house of one of her regular customers during her trip to Hong Kong, thus saving on accommodation expenses. A stock tip from a customer helped Ah Ming get a 30 percent return on a stock in her portfolio. Based on the description of the different roles and their varying potential in generating exchange value, a simple typology based on the two dimensions is presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1367877911422857">Table 3</xref>.</p>

<p>In relation to the second research question on how the TCM masseuses use emotional labour during the service encounter, it is apparent that such roles are very flexible and dynamic. The TCM masseuses adopt the roles interchangeably, based on the shifting demands of the service encounter. At the most basic level they have to conform to their professional identities as ‘experts’ since this is the role expected in both the back stage and front stage. Yet, in order to maximize exchange value, the TCM masseuses would proactively test and push the boundaries by adopting other roles to extract useful information. As customers make repeat visits over time the ‘confidant’ and ‘friend’ roles come into play.</p>
<p>Despite these multiple roles it is apparent that the TCM masseuses still maintain a strong sense of professional identity and the responsibilities that such an identity entails. This means that they can never stray too far from the ‘expert’ role for too long. Even when they are playing the ‘confidant’ or ‘friends’ roles they still have to return to the ‘expert’ role intermittently.</p>

<title>Discussion, implications and future research</title>
<p>Providing a massage is not just physical labour. In most cases, a massage is also a social encounter and masseuses have to perform emotional labour by conversing with the customers. The third research question asked to what extent the experiences of the TCM masseuses in this ethnographic study confirm or extend the emotional labor literature. The TCM masseuses in this study did not openly reveal any details that resembled the idea of ‘burn-out’ or ‘mental fatigue’. Another strand of the emotional labour literature focused on the power relations between the employer and the employee, and the extent that emotional labour performed by the workers is organizationally constrained. Again, the TCM masseuses did not say that they were pressured or forced by the spa management to express certain identities or emotions stipulated by the management.</p>
<p>There are two possible reasons for this. First, the relative privacy of the service encounter means that there was no way for the management or an ‘external audience’ to observe the performance. Without the ability to observe the practices of the TCM masseuses no sanctions can be exerted for inappropriate actions. This provides the TCM masseuses with leeway as to what emotions they wanted to express and the roles they play. Such roles are interchangeable and depend on the context of the service encounter. Moreover, TCM masseuses actively look for ways to use emotional labour to accumulate value for themselves. They take advantage of the privacy by extracting clients’ knowledge to develop their own knowledge of the world (e.g. latest Hong Kong gossip, stock market tips, etc.). Yet such agency does not mean that the TCM masseuses can assume any role they like. They are still bounded by the power dynamics and expectations of the service encounter. In order to maintain return visits and receive a good tip, the TCM masseuses still have to provide a good massage accompanied with appropriate diagnoses, advice and prescriptions for the customers’ aches and pains. Therefore, they are careful not to push the boundaries too far away from the ‘expert’ identity. Even if they assume other identities during the interaction, they have to be ready and able to shift back to the ‘expert’ identity instantaneously.</p>
<p>The second reason is that the TCM masseuses have very strong identities as TCM professional masseuses. They are proud of their recognition and status and are motivated psychologically to maintain their position in the hierarchy. According to social identity theory, this entails a shift in the self, and individuals perceive themselves as belonging to a group of professionals rather as idiosyncratic individuals. Ashforth and Humphrey elaborate:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Individuals who regard their roles as a central, salient, and valued component of who they are – are apt to feel most authentic when they are <italic>conforming</italic> to role expectations, including display rules. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1367877911422857">1993</xref>: 98)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In the context of this ethnographic study it can be observed that the roles as <italic>expected</italic> by the spa management and the professional identity are very closely aligned. The interviewees see themselves as proud professionals who work in a respected profession. Such an identity is accentuated by the spa management’s use of signs and the back stage dynamics, where the presence of <italic>dagongmei</italic> provides a strong basis for intergroup comparison. Therefore, it seems that strong identification with the role actually heightens the positive effects of emotional labour while diminishing its negative effects.</p>
<p>To conclude, the data in this study does not necessarily challenge the mainstream assumptions of the emotional labour literature, but makes several modest suggestions and extensions. First, previous studies of emotional labour and their psychological outcomes have generally explored low-status jobs, such as waitressing and factory work, which does not evoke a strong sense of collectivism or group identity. The importance of a professional identity, as conceptualized by social identity theory, cannot be overlooked in future research of ‘respectable professions’, since such identities can influence the outcomes and effects of emotional labour.</p>
<p>Second, emotional labour is not a stable and static process. Instead, it is dynamic and constantly shifting according to the flow and demands of the service encounter. This study shows that the ‘expert’ identity to be the default identity and this influences the behaviours of the TCM masseuses. However, the dynamics of the interaction means that TCM masseuses are able to shift identities to obtain certain outcomes. Quantitative methods may not be able to capture the nuances of such role shifting. Instead, conversation analysis may provide deeper insights by exploring the specific linguistic cues that signal such identity shifts.</p>
<p>Third, future qualitative research needs to take into account the agency of the individual. The previous literature has tended to focus on the ‘exploitation’ of workers by management that coerces them into performing emotions that are consistent with the values and rules of the management. This study shows that within such an organizational dynamic and worker/customer boundaries, workers are still in a position to extract value for themselves and, to some extent, even exploit the customer through the use of emotional labour.</p>
<p>Several limitations of this study and suggestions for further research should be noted. First, this study focused on identities at the intergroup level but did not explore potential intragroup differences among the TCM masseuses themselves. Due to language limitations I focused only on masseuses from Guangdong. Interviewing TCM masseuses from other provinces would have allowed for exploration of potential differences in their performance of emotional labour. Second, the study only focused on the identities of workers inside the spa but ignored their identities outside of the workplace. Workers can have multiple identities and the management of multiple identities can be psychologically demanding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1367877911422857">Wharton and Erickson, 1993</xref>). Finally, it should be noted that TCM masseuses are the minority in the overall ‘labour aristocracy’. The majority is the thousands of masseuses working in the ‘dormitory labour regime’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1367877911422857">Pun, 2004</xref>). How these masseuses perceive their own identities and how they perform emotional labour is another important avenue of future research.</p>
