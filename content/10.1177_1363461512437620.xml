<p>Barbara Helen Miller’s book presents a case study of two Sami healers who live in the far north of Scandinavia. Miller has a most unusual and diverse background. She first trained as a concert cellist, then studied to become a Jungian analyst, before doing her doctoral field work in Norway. Her ethnography is based on interviews, video and photographic analysis of both healers and their patients. The best parts of the book are the detailed case studies and life histories of two Sami healers, a mother and son. Their main treatment modality involves cupping. Unlike cupping in other traditional medicine, Sami practice involves drawing of blood: “First a razor is lightly and quickly tapped on the skin forming a surface incision, the incisions are always made in the same direction to facilitate the closing and healing of the cuts. A cup is applied to this area and a partial vacuum is produced extracting blood.” A number of cups are applied at each session and the cupping is often repeated each month, preferably at the new moon. The entire process is illustrated by a revealing series of 32 color photographs that show a step-by-step account of the entire process.</p>
<p>The mother recounts how in her youth cupping was common but now she is the only practitioner left. This highlights how easily healing traditions may be lost. For her, however, cupping is not only a treatment but serves diagnostic functions: the quality of blood, whether thick or thin, indicates different types of maladies. She also uses other procedures for diagnosis, such as following the pulse with her fingers up the left arm of a patient. In the process, a picture of the illness forms between the person and herself. In another technique, she diagnoses the patient by feeling the patient’s body in her own. She can also freeze people at a distance if they have wronged her. The mother describes how she was selected to become a healer and how she sought an heir and finally chose one of her sons. Yet much of the healing itself is secret and she told the author that she is not allowed to talk about it.</p>
<p>A large section of the book is given over to well-researched historical dimensions of Sami shamans and other spirits. Miller explores in depth whether contemporary healers, who are all Lutherans of a unique Sami tradition, display continuity with traditional shamans, who went on spirit journeys, used drums as trance inducers and could heal and kill at a distance. Sadly, it seems that the shamanistic tradition has not survived, although some minor parallels do exist.</p>
<p>My critique of this well-written work is twofold. First, despite the depth of the author’s historical discussion, there is no comparative material from other shamanistic traditions. Nor does she use any theory or theoretical constructs to help understand the healing process and its transmission. Instead, this is a straightforward classical ethnography without any of the reflexivity that characterizes contemporary forms of “writing culture.” The second issue concerns the absence of any integration between her anthropological and Jungian training. There is no reference to Jung or post-Jungian theory and yet many of her descriptions do lend themselves to a Jungian interpretation, such as the night-sea journey and the descent into the collective unconscious, Lévi-Bruhl’s notion of <italic>participation mystique,</italic> Jung’s psychology of the transference, and the mutual influence of Self and ego.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Barbara Miller’s book does provide the first book-length study of Sami healers available in English. To that extent, it makes a most valuable contribution to the study of a healing tradition in danger of extinction.</p></sec>
