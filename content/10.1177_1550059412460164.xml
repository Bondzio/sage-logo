<p>This study examines the simultaneous exposure of 2 brain areas in the location of central electrodes (C3 and C4) to a weak and pulsed extremely low-frequency magnetic field (ELF-MF) on the electroencephalogram (EEG). The intent is to change the EEG for a therapeutic application, such as neurofeedback, by inducing the “resonance effect.” A total of 10 healthy women received 9 minutes of ELF-MF (intensity 200 μT) and sham in a counterbalanced design. ELF-MF exposure frequencies were 10, 14, and 18 Hz. The paired <italic>t</italic> test revealed that local pulsed ELF-MF significantly decreases beta (15-25 Hz), sensorimotor rhythm (13-15 Hz), and theta (4-8 Hz) powers at a frequency of 10 Hz in C3 and C4 regions (12.0%-26.6%) after exposure, in comparison with that achieved during the exposure (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05). Variations during the exposure were transient and different from those after. The resonance effect was observed nowhere around the regions. The study suggests that this technique may be applied in the treatment of anxiety; however, further investigation is needed.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The effect of electromagnetic fields (EMFs) on human EEG has attracted much attention in recent years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1550059412460164">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1550059412460164"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1550059412460164"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1550059412460164"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1550059412460164">5</xref></sup> Investigations of ELF-MF on human physiology have shown heart rate variability, melatonin suppression, sleep disturbance, deterioration of standing balance, and analgesia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1550059412460164">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1550059412460164">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>Bell et al were the first to propose the “resonance effect” for MFs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1550059412460164">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1550059412460164">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1550059412460164">8</xref></sup> The resonance effect is related to the synchronization of therapeutic stimulation parameters with endogenous rhythms. Bell et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1550059412460164">4</xref></sup> studied the effects of 1.5- and 10-Hz EMFs, 0.2- 0.4 gauss, on the intrinsic electrical activity of the human brain and concluded that the ELF-MFs altered ongoing brain activity at exactly the frequency of stimulation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1550059412460164">4</xref></sup> According to this resonance effect, when a periodic signal of a characteristic frequency is applied to a system, synchronization may appear in an underdamped system.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1550059412460164">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>Moreover, the “correction” or “modification” of a patient’s EEG is one of the therapeutic methods used in psychiatry. One such method is “neurofeedback,” which refers to a form of behavioral training aimed at directing self-regulated brain activity toward learning conscious skills.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1550059412460164">10</xref></sup> In neurofeedback training, in order to achieve the optimal behavioral mode, the patient tries, through learning and concentrating, to modify his electrical brain activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1550059412460164">7</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Our previous research,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1550059412460164">1</xref></sup> which was aimed at detecting the effects of locally asynchronous (separated) pulsed ELF-MF exposure over central brain areas, was based on the resonance effect. The results showed that local pulsed ELF-MF exposure to one of the central areas, changed EEG power not only in the same area, but also in other central areas. On the other hand, Othmer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1550059412460164">11</xref></sup> stressed the shift and redistribution of EEG frequency bands when a stimulus is applied to one of the brain hemispheres, believing that interhemspheric neurofeedback training may be more powerful in its effects than in training each hemisphere separately.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1550059412460164">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>Considering the findings of Othmer,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1550059412460164">11</xref></sup> as well as the theory of resonance effect, and the fact that EEG power changes are not restricted to the exposed areas,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1550059412460164">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1550059412460164">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1550059412460164">13</xref></sup> this study was performed to investigate the EEG power changes when interhemispheric area pairs (C3 and C4) are simultaneously exposed to a weak and pulsed ELF-MF (10, 14, and 18 Hz each at 200 µT). This study aims at changing EEG band powers through the simultaneous exposure to weak and local ELF-MF pulses at C3 (left central fissure) and C4 (right central fissure) regions.</p>
<p>Some researchers believe that the induced electric field is proportional to the rate of variation in the MF,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1550059412460164">14</xref></sup> and that the effects of pulsed MFs are significantly greater than those in a pure sinusoidal field.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1550059412460164">6</xref></sup> Perhaps the body’s response to an <italic>abrupt</italic> time-changing ELF-MF is greater than a <italic>slow</italic> time-changing one. Therefore, we compared time-changing ELF-MF rates, as a secondary aim of our study.</p>
<p>We tested the following hypotheses: (1) Simultaneous local ELF-MF exposure at C3 and C4 at 10 Hz frequency increases the α band (8-13 Hz) power of EEG; at 14 Hz frequency, it increases the sensorimotor rhythm or SMR (13-15 Hz) power of EEG; at 18 Hz frequency, it increases the beta band (15-25 Hz) power of EEG over both exposed regions. (2) Increasing the time-changing ELF-MF rate, increases spectral power of the EEG.</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>Because of the dependence of ELF-MF effects on gender,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1550059412460164">8</xref></sup> only female participants were selected for the study. A total of 10 healthy, right-handed female participants, aged 23 to 30 years, voluntarily participated. All were students, who gave consent, and provided complete personal information. None had psychological, neurological, or cardiac diseases, addiction to any drug or was pregnant. All were nonsmokers. In addition, during the experiment, all participants were outside the period of menstrual bleeding. The study has been approved by Ethics Committee of the Medical Faculty of Tarbiat Modares University (Tehran, Iran).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1550059412460164">
<title>Data Acquisition</title>
<p>In this study, ELF-MF was delivered at intensity of 200 µT. Frequencies of 10, 14, and 18 Hz. C3 and C4 regions were selected, as in neurofeedback treatment of disorders such as depression, ADHD, autism, and migraine.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1550059412460164">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1550059412460164">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1550059412460164">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1550059412460164">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>Signal acquisition was performed in 2 sessions; the exposure session and the sham session (without MF exposure). The participants were blinded to exposure condition, and none knew the order of exposure and sham sessions. To control for other effective factors on EEG, participants were asked to avoid coffee, cacao, and other foods which contain caffeine at least 2 hours before the test. For each session, the participant sat on a comfortable chair inside a Faraday’s cage, in a quiet laboratory. The electrodes were attached to C3, C4, Cz, and Fp2 (to detect eye movements) with an electrolyte paste, according to the International 10-20 System. C3 was referenced to A1 (left ear), whereas C4 and Cz were referenced to right ear A2, and the ground was on the forehead.</p>
<p>At the beginning of each session, the EEG signal was recorded for 3 minutes with the eyes open and 3 minutes with the eyes closed. The 6-minute recording for each session was considered the baseline. The coils were placed on C3 and C4, so that the electrode was at the center of the coil without any connection. ELF-MF intensity (200 µT) was set at a distance of 1.5 cm from the coil center and on its axis, because the average distance of cortex from the external surface of skin is 1.2 cm<sup>21</sup>, the ELF-MF intensity was measured with a teslameter (Holaday Industries, Eden Prairie, Minnesota) with a precision of 10 µT.</p>
<p>The method and timing of experiments were the same as in our previous study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1550059412460164">1</xref></sup> The EEG signal was recorded for 2 minutes with eyes open and then 2 minutes with eyes closed. During these 4 minutes the coils were off and no exposure was applied. The test with closed eyes was repeated with the coils on. At the first frequency of 180 seconds (9 seconds on and 7 seconds off intermittently), the C3 and C4 areas were simultaneously exposed. During the exposure, when the coils were off, EEG was recorded. After the exposure period, when the coils were off, EEG was recorded with closed eyes and then open eyes, each for 2 minutes. After a 10-minute pause, the next frequency was chosen. Exposure at the intended frequencies (10, 14, and 18 Hz) was randomly selected for all participants.</p>
<p>The second frequency was selected with the same protocol. After a 10-minute pause, the third frequency was applied. After the exposure of all the 3 frequencies and the removal of the coils, the EEG baseline was recorded for 3 minutes with open eyes and 3 minutes with closed eyes.</p>
<p>The sham session was performed another day with the same protocol as the exposure session. The only difference was that the coils were off and no exposure was performed. Thus, the experiments were performed in the 20 counterbalanced sessions for all participants, with random frequency and sham/exposure order. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1550059412460164">Figure 1</xref> illustrates the block diagram of this study.</p>

<title>Exposing and Recording Apparatus</title>
<p>The digital signal generator, made by the electronic engineering faculty of “Tarbiat Modares” University (Tehran, Iran), generated pulse current with rectangular, triangle, and sinusoidal waveforms. Also, it could be regulated to automatically control pulses. EEG acquisition was with band-pass filter from 1 to 50 Hz, a 50-Hz notch filter, and a sampling rate of 992 Hz using the 8-channel EEG recorder (Thought Technology, Montreal, Canada). The gold electrodes were 10 mm in diameter. The recording was performed with the ear as a reference and a ground at the forehead.</p>
<p>In order to create a localized pulsed MF, coils with 2 cm in diameter and 250 turns were made. They were isolated with thin aluminum sheets. On the lower surface, a rigid plastic loop was connected to prevent the direct contact of the coil with skin. The induction constant of the coils was 8.3 × 10<sup>−5</sup> H. A lacquered wire loop was also placed on one of the coils and connected to one of the EEG recorder channels, so that ELF-MF pulses could be rigorously monitored. To ensure accuracy of the production of pulses, ELF-MF intensity was measured at a distance of 1.5 cm from the coil center and on its axis several times during the experiment. Furthermore, to avoid environmental noise, a Faraday’s cage (1 m × 2 m × 2 m) was used.</p>

<title>Features of Exposure Pulses</title>
<p>Exposure pulses were designed based on pulsed MF exposure being more effective than continuous MF <sup>7</sup>. The waveform was rectangular and monophasic, with the slope of 10 V/µs, assuming that the brain is more responsive to intensive than slow variations.</p>
<p>The study also investigated the time-changing ELF-MF rate on the power of EEG bands. To achieve this aim, the rates of ELF-MF intensity (d<italic>B</italic>/d<italic>t</italic>) were computed for all 3 frequencies using the following equation:

<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>All the data of 20 sessions were reviewed through MATLAB-2008a (MathWorks, Natick, Massachusetts) toolbox for EEG analysis, EEGlab, and then separated from artifacts (caused by eye, head and face movements). The algorithm was executed for the periods with the least noise (EEG which contained artifact had been removed). Fourier analysis was performed with a Hanning filter<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1550059412460164">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1550059412460164">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1550059412460164">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1550059412460164">16</xref></sup>, and frequency band absolute powers were extracted. To extract frequency relative powers as a contribution of each EEG band, required calculating the average of the power spectra of the twelve 7-second segments (for 3-minute time intervals) or the eight 7-second segments (for 2-minute time intervals) to obtain a power spectrum.</p>
<p>Statistical analysis was performed through SPSS (V 17.0, SPSS Inc, Chicago, Illinois). To compare experimental and sham groups, an independent <italic>t</italic> test was used and to compare the inner groups, a paired <italic>t</italic> test was applied. In order to compare the effectiveness of frequencies, or the effectiveness of time-changing ELF-MF rates, repeated-measure analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used. All statistical analyses were performed with a significance level of 0.05.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>The comparison of absolute and relative powers of EEG bands for experimental and sham groups during 3 minutes of exposure did not show any significant results; but the comparison of before, after and baseline, showed significant results only in experimental groups.</p>
<p>The comparison of EEG band power before and after exposure showed that simultaneous-local exposure at interhemispheric area pairs, electrodes C3 and C4, at the frequency of 10 Hz caused reduction in absolute beta power of C3 (20.7%) with eyes closed, absolute delta power (2-3.5 Hz) in C3 (19.0%) and C4 (27.0%), and absolute power of beta band of Cz (26.6%) with eyes open (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05). Exposure at 14 Hz led to a reduction in relative SMR power at C3 (16.1%) with closed eyes and absolute beta power of Cz (20.0%) with eyes open (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05). ELF-MF at the frequency of 18 Hz led to reduction in relative SMR power of C4 (19.2%) with eyes closed and an increase in relative power of this band in the same region (12.1%) with eyes open (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05).

<p>By comparing EEG band powers during and before exposure, a significant result was obtained; a reduction in relative delta power of region C4 (15.7%) during the exposure at the frequency of 10 Hz (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05). When the exposure was off at this frequency, the absolute power of beta (15.1%, 12.0%, and 17.6%), SMR (20.0%, 17.7%, and 18.1%), and theta (4-8 Hz; 16.2%, 26.6%, and 23.2%) bands decreased in all 3 regions of C3, C4, and Cz, and also relative alpha decreased (6.9%) in C3 (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05; see supplementary <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1550059412460164">Figure 4</xref>). The absolute theta power in C4 (11.8%) decreased with exposure at the frequency of 14 Hz; and at the frequency of 18 Hz, the relative SMR power in Cz (12.0%) also showed reduction (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study, based on Othmer’s research,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1550059412460164">11</xref></sup> investigates the simultaneous exposure of both C3 and C4 regions to resonance induction, as the EEG power spectrum changes caused by local and separate ELF-MF exposure are not limited to the exposed area.<sup>1</sup> The use of a 2-session design for the ELF-MF exposure and sham may be a better alternative than using a single session, because EEG changes due to the decreasing arousal during the session can be eliminated by this method. So, in this study, the identical EEG changes that were observed in both groups were excluded from the results. These included the significant reduction in absolute SMR power at C3 and C4 at the frequencies of 10 and 18 Hz, in closed eyes, comparison of before and after the exposure that were observed either in sham or in exposure groups. In addition, according to the findings of Cook et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1550059412460164">6</xref></sup> the change in EEG activity was transient and there were no significant changes in EEG power over approximately 7 minutes after a 15-minute exposure to a pulsed ±200 µT MF. Therefore, relying on these findings, we set the time interval between 2 exposures for 10 minutes (more than 7 minutes) with a different frequency. Moreover, in this study, the EEG band powers were recorded and compared before, during, and after the exposure for each frequency. Using such a method could reduce the interference by MF exposure in a session, or the existence of “cumulative effect.”</p>
<p>The results of the study illustrate that the simultaneous exposure of ELF-MF pulses in both C3 and C4 regions significantly changes the EEG power distribution of EEG bands of these 2 zones as well as Cz. Similar to the study conducted by Cook et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1550059412460164">8</xref></sup> as well as our previous study,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1550059412460164">1</xref></sup> the variations gained during and after the exposure are different from each other. It seems that the EEG power changes observed during the exposure are transient. In addition, the induction of the resonance effect was not proved in any regions of C3 and C4, nor in any of the frequencies. Resonance also was not observed in the Marino et al study,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1550059412460164">17</xref></sup> the research of Shafiei et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1550059412460164">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1550059412460164">13</xref></sup> and our previous study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1550059412460164">1</xref></sup> Moreover, no difference is observed in the effectiveness of 3 ELF-MF rates.</p>
<p>After exposure with eyes closed a reduction was observed in the power of SMR band. Changes of separate exposure have already been reported in the previous study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1550059412460164">1</xref></sup> The SMR may be associated with thalamocortical inhibition.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1550059412460164">10</xref></sup> SMR power changing can be shown in the variation of thalamocortical inhibition. This may be due to ELF-MF changing the concentration, or function, of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors.</p>
<p>Additionally, in all 3 regions, at the frequency of 10 Hz, the power of beta, SMR, and theta bands decreased immediately after the exposure was off. This is the only case in which the EEG change is observed in all 3 zones. This suggests that the simultaneous reduction in these band powers immediately after the exposure is due to the coordinated activity or synchronization of the 3 regions to a simultaneous stimulus. After the exposure with open eyes at the same frequency, a reduction in delta band of C3 and C4 regions was observed; this consistency was not observed at the 2 frequencies in exposed zones. Reduction in delta band power can be considered a reduction in cortical activity, because it is independent of subcortical activity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1550059412460164">18</xref></sup> Researchers believe that individuals with attention deficits, or abnormal activity related to brain injury, often have too much power in the delta and theta frequencies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1550059412460164">19</xref></sup>; therefore, the low-frequency inhibition bands in the central region of the brain, as in therapeutic methods, are clinically useful particularly in ADHD. The results of our research may be useful in the treatment of ADHD, but more investigation is needed because of the parallel reduction in beta and SMR power by ELF-MF exposure.</p>
<p>More important, abnormal alpha asymmetry, has been observed in “depression.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1550059412460164">19</xref></sup> In other words, the alpha power of left and right hemispheres is different in patients with depression, and the treatment of depression with neurotherapy often is to normalize the symmetry between right and left alpha band power.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1550059412460164">19</xref></sup> In our study, immediately after the exposure at C3 and C4, the relative alpha power was reduced only in C3. This finding suggests centrally (C3-C4) interhemispheric EEG training in depression, but needs more investigation.</p>
<p>On the other hand, what is more definite is the application of ELF-MF in the treatment of “anxiety.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1550059412460164">19</xref></sup> The regional excess of high frequency, such as beta, in any brain area, is often observed in anxiety. According to our experiment ELF-MF exposure decreased beta power in some regions and frequencies, and might be applied in the treatment of anxiety and insomnia.</p>
<p>In this study, the comparison of the effects at frequencies 10, 14, and 18 Hz did not lead to any significant results. Further studies need to be done in this field.</p>
<p>Simultaneous exposure of C3 and C4 zones did not lead to a resonance effect, neither did it cause any changes in EEG baseline activity. In comparison with separate exposure of each region, it seems that simultaneous exposure of both regions reduces the durability of these effects.</p>
<p>As for the resonance effect, the theory of neural system MF perception, based on interactions of glycoproteins of neuron membranes is logical because, the interactions appear to be maximal when the EMF frequency corresponds to a frequency of an ongoing physiological activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1550059412460164">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1550059412460164">9</xref></sup>. On the other hand, the occurrence of frequency resonance may not be present in all intensities. Further research with a larger sample size should be performed.</p>
<p>Neurofeedback training is done with different procedures, one of which is a particular and new type, known as low-energy neurofeedback system (LENS). LENS training differs from other forms of neurofeedback in that it introduces an ELF-MF pulse as a feedback, instead of audio, visual, or audiovisual feedbacks.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1550059412460164">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1550059412460164">20</xref></sup> Scientists claim that this ELF-MF pulse helps the patient to modulate his EEG pattern more quickly while the voluntary role of patient is very weak in LENS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1550059412460164">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1550059412460164">20</xref></sup> Therefore, one therapeutic application of ELF-MFs is LENS. Cook et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1550059412460164">6</xref></sup> justified their results (increasing alpha activity over the occipital regions) with “habituation” or “conditioning” to a repeated stimulus. Capone et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1550059412460164">5</xref></sup> reported neurophysiological changes after ELF-MF exposure in humans. They particularly considered increasing “intracortical facilitation” after 45 minutes of pulsed mode ELF-MF exposure. Other neurofeedback researchers believed that the brain electrical patterns are a form of behavior, and neurofeedback modifies behaviors through “operant conditioning.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1550059412460164">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1550059412460164">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1550059412460164">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1550059412460164"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1550059412460164">23</xref></sup> In addition, neurofeedback can cause morphologic and functional changes in the brain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1550059412460164">21</xref></sup> Therefore, the way in which neurofeedback operates, together with the results gained from recent studies,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1550059412460164">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1550059412460164">6</xref></sup> may indirectly confirm the advantage of ELF-MF in a new neorofeedback method LENS.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Our results are that the absolute beta, theta, and SMR powers of central brain regions decreased after pulsed ELF-MF exposure. Findings also indicate a coordinated activity of central region under a simultaneous stimulus. The study suggests that ELF-MF may be effective in the treatment of anxiety and insomnia, through decreasing beta band power in brain central areas, which needs more investigation. Moreover, in this study the resonance effect was not observed. Hence, our current findings, as well as the results of previous research, suggest that the resonance effect may not occur at all intensities.</p>
