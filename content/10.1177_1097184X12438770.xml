<p>Recent decades have seen an intense proliferation of scholarship in the field of gender studies (including the rise of feminist musicology), the dispersal of gender studies away from Centers for Women’s Studies and into disciplinary homes, and a rise of masculinity studies, as the editors of this volume suggest in their introduction. In all of this, work on masculinity has tended to be focused on visual and literary texts, while work in musicology on gender has most famously focused on the place of women, as composers, performers, characters in musical narratives, and bearers of ideological burdens (see e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1097184X12438770">Abbate 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1097184X12438770">Citron 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1097184X12438770">Clément 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1097184X12438770">McClary 1991</xref>). This collection, then, is one of a comparatively small group of emerging work concerned with music and masculinity, and it is an important contribution to a growing field.</p>
<p>The editors acknowledge the risk here that, in moving beyond synonymizing “gender studies” and “women’s studies,” the turn to contemplating the place of masculinity across histories and cultures may result in a sneaky return to a masculine hegemony in the field; as Bruce Traister has also argued, “One of the effects of this recent critical interest in heteromasculinity … has been a restoration of the representations of men—produced by men and analyzed for the most part by men—to the center of academic cultural criticism. With the rise of masculinity studies … we are bearing witness to the emergence of a ‘new’ category of literary and cultural criticism: phallocriticism” (2000, 276). The effect, he says, in terminology similarly used by Biddle and Gibson, is to “[crowd] out the women and the texts responsible for the rise of feminism” (276).</p>
<p>The editors' response to this potential threat is first explicated in the introduction, where they outline “some of the implications” of their project of “unsettling musicology’s disciplinary autonomy” (10). But more significantly than that, the collection as a whole is clearly committed to challenging disciplinary norms in such a way that masculinity is never allowed to adopt an untroubled and hegemonic stance but is instead laid open to question and query throughout the volume. Thus, this is by no means a canonical or canon-(re-)producing book. The likes of Beethoven and Wagner, for instance, two of the great “heroes” of masculine musicality (or musical masculinity), find their places in the index, but are not placed at the center of the overall project, and so the very notions of canonicity and men’s place therein are troubled from the outset. Chronologically, geographically, and methodologically, the coverage is impressive, and while this breadth may for some scholars lead to a sense of omission of some of the central parts of the canon, I see it as performing the rather more important task of problematizing the canonizing process. Indeed, the coverage is such that the canonical figures are far from absent. Haydn and Brahms find their place here in a chapter by Marcia Citron, but beyond the Austro-German center, so do Edward Elgar (Corissa Gould), Manuel de Falla (Esther Zaplana), and Tippett (Iain Stannard). Chronologically, coverage is impressive; here, we do not find a focus on the nineteenth century (however long it may be conceived as being), but contributions spanning the history of western musical practice from the Middle Ages (from Elizabeth Eva Leach), through the Classical period (Irving on Haydn), up to the mid-twentieth century (Stannard on Tippett). In terms of scholarly approach and methodology, the collection is also impressively varied and clearly operates in a contemporary mode of musicology. The variety of approach is summed up by the editors in the Introduction thus, “the gendering of music pedagogy, the voice, music theory and reception, figurations of national identity through the gendering of the composer figure and his music, the masculinization of creativity and cultural-historical constructions of the male body, especially that of the male listener” (pp. 11–12). Readers from nonmusicological backgrounds will find some sections challenging for their technical language; Richard Wistreich (on Monteverdi), Fred Everett Maus (on Berlioz as Beethoven's successor), and Taylor-Jay (on early twentieth-century German music) pursue music-analytical approaches. Overall, though, readers from outside of the discipline will find the general tone of the collection accessible, and many contributions here work with theoretical approaches that do not require musicological backgrounds.</p>
<p>Holding together an edited collection thematically is notoriously difficult, but the editors have largely overcome that challenge. The section introductions each attempt to cover the key issues that bond the ensuing chapters; these introductions often tend toward theorization not typically found in musicology, but it is a welcome and pertinent approach, given the project of the collection overall. It is in these introductions that the reader will find summaries of individual chapters, the editors having chosen to give more space in the introduction to a broader theorization of the issues at stake. The reader would do well, then, to take these section introductions as postscripts to the main introduction and, if deciding to read the collection as a whole, perhaps to start by reading all four introductions before taking on individual chapters. The final section, “Identities, Voices, Discourses,” is perhaps the least coherent of the three; the three chapters contained in the section (Annamaria Cecconi on nineteenth-century Italian opera; Ian Biddle on the vocal fetish; Stannard on Tippett) can be seen as dealing primarily with one of those terms individually, and it is less clear here what groups the chapters logically. Indeed, the book’s introduction reveals how Cecconi’s chapter might have been better grouped with the others on national identities, as she is listed with Zaplana and Taylor-Jay, while Biddle and Stannard are paired off as being complementary according to their topics (12). The pragmatics of balancing section lengths have probably prevailed here over the intellectual ideal, but such is the challenge of editing, and the placement of Cecconi’s chapter at the beginning of the final section ensures that it leads on well from the previous section on nationalisms, a testament to the thoughtful approach taken by the editors towards such challenges.</p>
<p>Overall, this collection contains many excellent essays that will satisfy and challenge readers, and holds together impressively as an insightful and essential volume for any scholar or student in the field.</p>
