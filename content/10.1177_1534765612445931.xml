<abstract>
<p>This study expands our understanding of treatment attrition by investigating factors predicting treatment dropout in a large national data set of clinic-referred children and parents seeking trauma-specific psychotherapy services. Using de-identifed data (<italic>N</italic> = 2,579) generated by the National Child Traumatic Stress Network Core Data Set collected between spring 2004 and fall 2010, the study uses sequential logistic regression analyses to assess prediction of the probability of a given subject having prematurely dropped out of treatment. The findings of this study suggest that African American race, placement in state custody, and a diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, and major depressive disorder predict treatment attrition. Based on the findings of this study, dropout management recommendations are made, as are implications for further research and ongoing practice.</p>

<p>Children are exposed to violence and severe maltreatment at high rates and endure high rates of physical, developmental, and mental health problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1534765612445931">Corwin &amp; Keeshin, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1534765612445931">Finkelhor, Turner, Ormond, Hamby &amp; Kracke, 2009</xref>). Trauma-exposed children frequently experience compromised developmental trajectories leading to disproportionate involvement in the mental health, juvenile justice, criminal justice, and social service systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1534765612445931">Cahill, Kaminer, &amp; Johnson, 1999</xref>). Compelling neurobiological evidence has emerged indicating that chronic stress weakens the fundamental brain architecture of children and can derail lifelong social, emotional, and cognitive development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1534765612445931">Shonkoff &amp; Phillips, 2000</xref>). The Adverse Childhood Events Study has demonstrated the significant and deleterious health and behavioral health outcomes for adults exposed to multiple stressors in childhood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1534765612445931">Anda et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite the “bad news” about the long-term effects of childhood traumatic stress, the “good news” about the effectiveness of preventative and treatment interventions creates hope for children and adults struggling with traumatic stress disorders. Early and effective interventions are recognized as essential for preventing lifetime psychiatric conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1534765612445931">Lampinen &amp; Sexton-Radek, 2010</xref>; National Research Council &amp; Institute of Medicine, 2009). Indeed, the successful development of evidence-based practices has galvanized professionals to make effective, trauma-informed interventions widely available for children and families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1534765612445931">National Child Traumatic Stress Network, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Evidence-based interventions stipulate that children and caregivers must participate in treatment for at least the minimum prescribed times that have been found to establish and consolidate therapeutic effects. Unfortunately, premature treatment dropout is a significant problem in the field of child psychotherapy, with 48% to 62% no-show rates for initial intake appointments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1534765612445931">Harrison, McKay, &amp; Bannon, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1534765612445931">McKay, McCadam, &amp; Gonzales, 1996</xref>), and 25% to 60% of children and families terminating services early (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1534765612445931">Andrade, Lambert, &amp; Bickman, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1534765612445931">Cohen &amp; Mannarino, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1534765612445931">Kazdin, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1534765612445931">McKay, Lynn, &amp; Bannon, 2005</xref>). Numerous studies document that clients who drop out are less likely to reap the symptom reduction benefits of psychotherapy compared with treatment completers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1534765612445931">Cohen &amp; Mannarino, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1534765612445931">Kazdin &amp; Wassell, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1534765612445931">Prinz &amp; Miller, 1994</xref>). In addition to costs at the individual level, high dropout rates stall the field of child psychotherapy research. Case attrition threatens the experimental validity of research studies by altering the composition of randomly assigned groups, limiting statistical power, and introducing threats to internal validity.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there are limited data about the factors that influence a child trauma treatment. In fact, the majority of what we know about treatment completion comes from the general psychotherapy literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1534765612445931">Gopalan et al., 2010</xref>). Clearly, there is a critical need to understand which variables differentially influence treatment completion, especially as they affect this more recent wave of evidence-based and trauma-informed practices. This study expands our understanding of treatment attrition by investigating this phenomenon in a large national data set of clinic-referred children and parents seeking trauma-specific psychotherapy services.</p>
<sec id="section1-1534765612445931">
<title>Literature Review</title>
<p>There is no widespread, consensual conceptual or operational definition of premature termination or dropout. Therefore, a review of the literature will raise as many questions about this phenomenon as it answers. Several studies have noted that children with more serious Axis I disorders tend to stay in treatment longer than those with adjustment problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1534765612445931">Miller, Southam-Gerow, &amp; Allin, 2008</xref>), especially if the diagnoses is a mood or anxiety disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1534765612445931">Baruch, Vrouva, &amp; Fearon, 2009</xref>). Gender may also be a significant factor with boys and girls dropping out of treatment at different rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1534765612445931">Griffin, Cicchetti, &amp; Leaf, 1993</xref>), although across interventions and problem types these gender effects tend to decrease as the child ages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1534765612445931">Wise, Cuffe, &amp; Fischer, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>The overall predictive power of a child age at the time of treatment is equivocal, with contradictory findings emerging in several recent studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1534765612445931">McKay &amp; Bannon, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1534765612445931">Wise et al., 2001</xref>). In treatment studies involving young children ages 3 to 10 years, the functioning of the parent is paramount to understanding attrition. Increased levels of parental distress are consistently noted as a predictors of treatment dropout from parent training programs, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) treatment, and general psychotherapy services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1534765612445931">Fernandez &amp; Eyberg, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1534765612445931">Thompson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1534765612445931">Werba, Eyberg, Boggs &amp; Algina, 2006</xref>). Child welfare–involved families have been noted to have high rates of dropout (up to 70%) from parent training programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1534765612445931">Lundquist &amp; Hansen, 1998</xref>). Other researchers have found that families that are chaotic or face financial obstacles to regular participation exit treatment long before they receive adequate intervention doses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1534765612445931">Baruch et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1534765612445931">Kazdin &amp; Wassell, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>A number of studies have found noncompletion or low frequency of attendance to be strongly associated with client race/ethnicity. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1534765612445931">Diala et al.’s (2000)</xref> secondary data analysis of the <italic>National Co-Morbidity Survey</italic> revealed that even though African American parents were more likely to hold positive attitudes about using mental health services than their White counterparts, they were less likely to use these services and more likely to negatively appraise services after initial participation. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1534765612445931">Kerkorian, McKay, and Bannon (2006)</xref> found that African Americans were more likely than Whites to report “feeling disrespected” in their child’s last treatment episode and doubtful about using services in the future. Poor outcomes also contributed to their pessimism. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1534765612445931">Snowden and Yamada’s (2005)</xref> review of cultural differences research cited only one study of “premature termination,” which found that Hispanic youth outpatient dropout was predicted by parental education, perceived barriers to treatment, belief in the need for increased discipline to solve emotional and behavioral problems, and client–therapist ethnic match (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1534765612445931">McCabe, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1534765612445931">Gopalan et al.’s (2010)</xref> metareview revealed that dropout discrepancies across study samples might be attributable to their differing socioeconomic status, and geographic characteristics. Child and youth clients living in urban, poor, and single-parent families appear especially challenging to retain. Children and teens with high levels of disruptive behavior disorder, family hostility, parent–child disagreements about treatment needs and goals, and family psychopathology and stressors or homelessness are very difficult to retain in treatment.</p>
<p>Despite these findings about the predictors of treatment completion and failure in the general psychotherapy literature, the manner in which these variables may affect dropout in the context of trauma-specific treatment is unclear. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1534765612445931">Gopalan et al. (2010)</xref> urge researchers to attend to the effects of disruptive and trauma disorders as they may create specific threats to engagement that could significantly affect treatment attrition. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1534765612445931">Gonzalez, Weersing, Warnick, Scahill, and Woolston (2011)</xref> used multivariate logistic regression to analyze a sample of 127 clients (5-18 years) seeking outpatient psychotherapy for significant anxiety symptoms and found that comorbid depression predicted dropout after six “eclectic, treatment as usual” sessions. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1534765612445931">Chasson, Vincent, and Harris (2008)</xref> analyzed a trauma focused–cognitive behavioral therapy (TF-CBT) sample of 99 child and adolescent trauma clients and measured them at pretreatment and just prior to termination. Increased avoidance behavior just before termination as well as high intrusion and depression levels just before termination predicted dropout. This finding suggests that stressors related to the treatment context or problem type could have generated or exacerbated client distress levels, which contributed to premature termination—specifically, clients’ anticipatory distress related to upcoming TF-CBT exposure components.</p>
<p>As noted, there are a limited number of studies that identify predictors of treatment completion during a course of trauma-focused intervention. The <italic>National Child Traumatic Stress Network’s Core Data Set</italic> is a unique database compiling treatment episodes for a nationwide, community-based, diverse population and presents a unique opportunity to explore this phenomenon. This study uses secondary data analysis to evaluate the impacts of child and family characteristics, problem type, and trauma type on treatment dropout in traumatized children receiving trauma-informed evidence-based practices. We hypothesize that baseline family characteristics such as race, ethnicity, age, gender, custody of the child, refugee status, non-English language status, being from outside the United States, and type of public versus private insurance utilization (i.e., indication of economic status) will increase the likelihood of treatment dropout. In light of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1534765612445931">Chasson et al.’s (2008)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1534765612445931">Gopalan et al.’s (2010)</xref> recommendations to attend to the effects of baseline traumatic disorders on treatment completion, we also hypothesize that mental health diagnosis and trauma type at baseline will predict treatment dropout over and above the aforementioned baseline child and family characteristics.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>This study uses de-identified data generated by the National Child Traumatic Stress Network (NCTSN) Core Data Set (CDS) collected between spring 2004 and fall 2010 and contains the records of more than 14,000 children and adolescents. The NCTSN is a collection of 60 academic and community-based service centers that provide trauma-informed, evidence-based intervention to children with traumatic stress symptoms across the country. These centers are funded by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration through a competitive process that supports the delivery of services and collection and entry of clinical data into the CDS. The CDS stipulates a specific standardized protocol of instruments. Sites may have varied in rates of completion based on the specific services provided or population served. Thus, the type of agency or organization, services offered, local institutional review board (IRB) requirements, and funding cycles contributed to the amount of data contributed by sites. Data quality was ensured using both automated computer checks and manual review in addition to ongoing monitoring by statistical, clinical, and data management staff.</p>
<p>In general, the CDS collected information from NCTSN centers regarding children and youth served, treatment(s) received, and outcomes of those treatments. This information was then available for Network clinicians, researchers, and other professionals to guide decision making about the best ways to assist children and youth exposed to traumatic experiences at local and national levels. The CDS collected information on (a) demographics, (b) domestic environment and family characteristics, (c) health insurance, (d) trauma exposures and experiences, (e) service use, and (f) behavioral problems, distress reactions, and functioning.</p>
<p>Data from centers participating in the CDS were entered into a validated, central NCTSN, InForm™ database at the Duke Clinical Research Institute (DCRI). Access to the data was controlled by individual user–level security. Data quality was ensured using both automated computer checks and manual review, in addition to ongoing monitoring by statistical, clinical, and data management staff. All data received by DCRI were identified with a Study ID number. A client log or “crosswalk” contained information that links this ID and the individual participant’s identity and was maintained by the participating center. The Duke University Health System served as the IRB of record for the activities of the NCTSN (Duke) and the DCRI, as it related to the activities of the CDS. Additional approval was secured from the University IRB of record, and a Data Use Agreement was secured between Duke and the University of Kentucky that operationalized the terms of use for the data analyzed in this study. Contributing NCTSN sites delivered a range of interventions including parent training programs such as parent–child interaction therapy, cognitive-behavioral-based treatments such as Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and Alternative for Families: A Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy, relational interventions such as Child–Parent Psychotherapy or Infant–Parent Psychotherapy, as well as Structured Psychotherapy for Adolescents Responding to Chronic Stress, Trauma Affect Regulation: Guidelines for Education and Therapy, and other trauma-informed evidence-based practices.</p>
<sec id="section3-1534765612445931">
<title>Measurement</title>
<p>Clinicians collected baseline data regarding demographics, domestic environment and family characteristics, insurance coverage, presenting problems and experiences, and prior services received. A common battery of measures were used across NCTSN sites and entered into the CDS. These measures included the following:</p>
<sec id="section4-1534765612445931">
<title>Trauma History Profile</title>
<p>This instrument documented the types of trauma experiences the child/youth had been exposed to prior to treatment entry. In addition to trauma type, additional information was collected about the age(s) of the trauma exposure, the chronicity of exposure, and the setting(s) and perpetrator(s) associated with the exposure. The information was collected by the clinician from a caregiver, relevant collateral, and the child/youth at intake/and at every 3 months of treatment participation. In addition, additional trauma exposures discovered during treatment were entered into the CDS in real time.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1534765612445931">
<title>Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL)</title>
<p>The CBCL/1 1/2-5 and 6-18 was completed by a parent or caregiver. This widely used measure consists of 118 items scored on a 3-point scale ranging from 0 (<italic>not true</italic>) to 2 (<italic>often true</italic>) and yields scores on two broad band scales—internalizing and externalizing behaviors—as well as scores on <italic>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</italic>, 4th edition (<italic>DSM-IV</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1534765612445931">American Psychiatric Association, 1994</xref>) oriented scales, and empirically based syndrome scales that reflect emotional and behavioral problems. The measure has sound psychometric properties with respect to reliability and validity, across racially and ethnically diverse samples.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1534765612445931">
<title>Trauma Symptom Checklist for Children–Alternate (TSCC-A)</title>
<p>The TSCC-A is a 44-item measure used to assess posttraumatic symptoms in children ages 8 to 16 years. The TSCC-A has two validity scales that assess underresponding and hyperresponding and five clinical scales that assess anxiety, depression, anger, posttraumatic stress, and dissociation (with two subscales Fantasy and Overt Dissociation). This measure has strong construct validity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1534765612445931">Elliott &amp; Briere, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1534765612445931">Singer, Anglin, Song, Lunghofer, 1995</xref>) and convergent and discriminant validity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1534765612445931">Briere, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1534765612445931">Friedrich &amp; Jaworski, 1997</xref>). It has been standardized on a large sample of racially and economically diverse children.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1534765612445931">
<title>University of California, Los Angeles(UCLA) Posttraumatic Stress Disorder–Reaction Index (PTSD-RI)</title>
<p>The UCLA PTSD-RI is a questionnaire that screens for exposure to traumatic events and for PTSD symptoms in school-age children and adolescents. It assesses the frequency of occurrence of PTSD symptoms during the month preceding completion (rated from 0 = <italic>none of the time</italic> to 4 = <italic>most of the time</italic>). The items map directly onto the <italic>DSM-IV</italic> Criterion B (intrusion), Criterion C (avoidance), and Criterion D (arousal) for PTSD. Twenty items directly assess PTSD symptoms, whereas two additional items assess associated features: fear of recurrence and trauma-related guilt. Scoring algorithms permit tabulation of total PTSD-RI total score, and B, C, and D symptom subscale scores. Psychometric properties are robust and have been previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1534765612445931">Steinberg, Brymer, Decker, &amp; Pynoos, 2004</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1534765612445931">
<title>End of treatment status</title>
<p>This variable indicates the reason why treatment ended. Choices included “treatment is completed as planned,” “child dropped out prior to end of planned treatment,” or “case is lost, and no follow-up assessments performed.” For purposes of this study, only participants who completed treatment or dropped out of treatment were included, since the end of treatment status for the “lost” group was unknown. This variable was dichotomized (treatment completed as planned/treatment dropout).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1534765612445931">
<title>Demographic variables</title>
<p>Demographic variables included gender, guardian (relative placement/state), and ethnicity (Hispanic/Latino/not Hispanic/Latino, etc.). <italic>Gender</italic> was coded as <italic>male</italic> (0) or <italic>female</italic> (1) in this study. <italic>Guardian</italic> was determined based on the identified guardian of the child with a parent coded as 0 and relative placement and state coded as 1. <italic>Ethnicity</italic> was coded at baseline as “Hispanic or Latino” (1) and “Not Hispanic or Latino (0). <italic>Race</italic> was categorized as (1) “American Indian/Alaskan Native,” (2) “Asian,” (3) “African American,” (4) “White,” and (5) “Multicultural.” <italic>Insurance Type</italic> was coded as “Public” (1), “Private” (2), or “Combined” (3).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1534765612445931">
<title>Clinician evaluation of clinical problems, symptoms, and disorders</title>
<p>Clinical evaluation data consisted of ratings of the degree to which clinical problems, symptoms, or disorders (e.g., Depression, Generalized Anxiety) were displayed by the child at baseline. Ratings were on a 3-point scale consisting of 0 (<italic>not present</italic>), 1 (<italic>possibly present</italic>), and 2 (<italic>definitely present</italic>). Ratings were dichotomized (possibly present/definitely present = 1/not present = 0). This analysis examined PTSD, major depressive disorder (MDD), substance abuse, oppositional defiant disorder (ODD), conduct Disorder, and ADHD.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1534765612445931">
<title>Trauma history</title>
<p>The Trauma History portion of the CDS was derived from the Trauma History component of the UCLA PTSD Reaction Index (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1534765612445931">Steinberg et al., 2004</xref>). As used in the CDS, it was completed by the provider at intake or early in the course of services. Information about trauma, loss, and separation history was obtained from multiple informants, including the child or adolescent, parents/caregivers, and other relatives. It was designed to be periodically updated as new information was learned about traumas that were documented at baseline, as new traumas were revealed during treatment (traumas that occurred prior to treatment but were not known at baseline), and any new traumatic events that occurred during the course of treatment or services. The Trauma History portion included a comprehensive list of trauma, loss, and separation exposures, including (a) sexual maltreatment/abuse, (b) sexual assault/rape, (c) physical abuse/maltreatment, (d) physical assault, (e) emotional abuse/psychological maltreatment, (f) neglect, (g) domestic violence, (h) war/terrorism/political violence inside the United States, (i) war/terrorism/political violence outside the United States, (j) illness/medical, (k) injury/accident, (l) natural disaster, (m) kidnapping, (n) traumatic loss/bereavement, (o) forced displacement, (p) impaired caregiver, (q) extreme personal/interpersonal violence (not reported elsewhere), (r) community violence (not reported elsewhere), (s) school violence, and (t) other trauma (any other type of trauma not captured by this list). Definitions were supplied for all trauma types based on the National Child Abuse and Neglect Data System Glossary. For each trauma type, providers were asked to check whether the trauma had occurred or if it was suspected to have occurred. Data for this analysis were limited to the presence or absence (1 = <italic>yes</italic>, 0 = <italic>no</italic>) of each trauma type based on child and/or parent self-report.</p>

<title>Sample</title>
<p>The research hypotheses for this analysis determined how the final study sample was derived from total number of cases in the CDS. Because this study concerned the treatment completion and noncompletion of trauma-exposed children, a large number of cases in the CDS were not applicable to this analysis. For example, several NCTSN sites provide only trauma assessment or crisis intervention/disaster response services, resulting in no follow-up data (only 7,751 cases had any follow-up data). Other sites, although contributing multiple sets of data per child to the CDS, ceased collection when their grant award periods ended, so the treatment completion status of their cases were neither tracked nor recorded. The “end of treatment” variable was used to determine the appropriate sample for this analysis, and the study data set included 2,759 cases, with 1,842 completing treatment and 917 dropping out of treatment.</p>
<p>For this total study sample containing both treatment completers and dropouts (<italic>N</italic> = 2,759), the children ranged in age from birth to 20.9 years of age with a mean of 11.45 (<italic>SD</italic> = 4.34) years. The majority were female (55.9%) and White (53%), with African American children making up 34.2% of the sample. Nearly a third of the sample (31.9%) was of Hispanic ethnicity. Refugee and immigrant children consisted of 5.8% of the sample, and 10% of the sample reported not being born in the United States. Nearly one fifth of the sample (18.4%) did not list English as their primary language. In addition, nearly one fifth of the sample (19.9%) either was in state custody or placed in out-of-home care with a relative. More than half (57.8%) of the sample received public assistance. With regard to treatment attrition, 66.8% of the sample completed treatment and 33.2% of the sample dropped out of treatment. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1534765612445931">Table 1</xref> provides details on the demographic profile of the study sample broken down by the dropout and treatment completion variable.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>To ascertain if the treatment outcome groups differed on the basis of predictor characteristics, a multinomial regression analysis was conducted using the three outcome data categories (0 = <italic>treatment completion</italic>, 1 = <italic>drop out</italic>, 2 = <italic>lost missing data</italic>) with the six demographic variables. Two variables proved to be significant (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) individual predictors of dropout when compared with the lost missing category data cases. Hispanics and children in state custody were 3.79 and 1.20 times more likely, respectively, to be in the dropout versus lost category. There were no significant differences in age, gender, race, and insurance type by treatment completion category. Although the analysis does indicate significant differences between the dropout and lost groups, these differences are in the direction of dropout and are not significant predictors of the lost cases. Further inclusion of the category of lost cases was not indicated.</p>
<p>Power analyses were conducted using PASS software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1534765612445931">Hintz, 2005</xref>) for all bivariate analyses and for the hierarchical logistic regression model using categorical variables. All analyses conducted had a power of at least .80 or above, meeting the standard suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1534765612445931">Cohen (1988)</xref>. Several demographic variables (i.e., refugee status, non-English speaking, born outside of the United States) were dropped from the logistic regression analyses because of seriously decreasing the sample, that is, decreasing power well below the .80 standard.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1534765612445931">Table 1</xref> provides details of the bivariate analyses of the demographics variables with treatment dropout and completion of treatment. Males were significantly more likely to drop out of treatment than were females, whereas Hispanics were less likely to drop out of treatment than were non-Hispanics. African American children were more likely to drop out of treatment than all other races of children. Those who were of refugee status, not U.S. born, and who did not list English as their primary language were significantly less likely to drop out of treatment than those who were not listed as refugee status, who were born in the United States, and who spoke English as their primary language. Children who were in state custody or living with a relative in an out-of-home placement were less likely to drop out of treatment than those living with a biological parent. There were no significant dropout differences between children who have public assistance insurance only, private insurance, or who have some combination of private and public insurance.</p>
<p>Bivariate analysis was also conducted with each of the predictor variables compared with the dependent variable of dropout and treatment completion. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1534765612445931">Table 2</xref> provides the <italic>p</italic> value, Phi coefficient, observed frequency, and percentage for each comparison. For the demographic variables, gender, race, ethnicity, refugee status, not being born in the United States, not speaking English as a primary language, and guardianship were all significant at or below .05. Insurance type was not significant. For the trauma exposure variables, only trauma from medical illness, community violence, school violence, and the category of other trauma were significant at .05 or below. Two other trauma exposure variables, serious injury from accident and traumatic loss, demonstrated a trend (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .10) but did not reach significance at or below .05. For the diagnostic variables, PTSD, MDD, ODD, conduct disorder, ADHD, and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) were significant at or below .05. Other diagnoses, and those who were suicidal, were not significant on the dropout variable. For the continuous variables of age, internalizing and externalizing behaviors as measured by the CBCL, and PTS as measured by the TSCC-A and UCLA-PTSD, only the externalizing behaviors on the CBCL had a significant mean difference as indicated by independent <italic>t</italic> tests with those in the dropout group having a significantly higher mean on externalizing behaviors (<italic>M</italic> = 63.31, <italic>SD</italic> = 11.36) than those in the treatment completion group (<italic>M</italic> = 61.19, <italic>SD</italic> = 11.57).</p>

<title>Logistic Regression</title>
<p>All variables that were significant in the bivariate analysis, with the exception of those that seriously decreased sample size, were included in subsequent analyses. A sequential logistic regression analysis was performed using SPSS 18.0 to assess prediction of the probability of a given subject having prematurely dropped out of treatment (<italic>treatment completion</italic> = 0 or <italic>treatment dropout</italic> = 1). The model was first fit using the five demographic variables, followed by the addition of six trauma exposure variables on the second step and the six diagnostic variables on the third step. The demographic variables were gender (male, female), ethnicity (non-Hispanic, Hispanic), Race (Caucasian, non-Caucasian), Guardian type (state or relative, biological caregiver), and age of child as a continuous variable. The trauma exposure variables were trauma from a medical illness (yes, no), school violence (yes, no), community violence (yes, no), other trauma (yes, no), family violence (a combined index variable of domestic violence, sexual maltreatment, physical maltreatment, and emotional abuse), and a combined index variable of assault (physical assault, sexual assault). The diagnostic variables were PTSD, MDD, GAD, conduct disorder, ODD, and ADHD (all six variables had categories of no, yes, or suspected).</p>
<p>To determine whether clinicians’ diagnoses were consistent with psychometric tests of the same construct, we performed a correlational analysis between the clinician diagnosis variable of PTSD and the total PTSD score on the UCLA PTSD RI (η = .323, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .0005) and the total <italic>T</italic>-score on the TSCC-A (η = .279, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .0005). Results indicate that clinician diagnoses of PTSD for children were consistent with results of the psychometrically validated measures of PTSD for children. The clinician diagnosis of MDD (η = .265, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .0005) was significantly correlated with the internalizing total score on the CBCL. This suggests that the clinician diagnosis of MDD was consistent with psychometrically validated measures of depression in children. Finally, the three clinician diagnoses of conduct disorder (η = .180, <italic>p</italic> &lt;.0005), ADHD (η = .299, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .0005), and ODD (η = .290, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .0005) were significantly correlated with the CBCL externalizing total.</p>
<p>Goodness-of-fit is formally evaluated using the Hosmer–Lemeshow statistic, where a good model produces a nonsignificant chi-square (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1534765612445931">Tabachnick &amp; Fidell, 2001</xref>). There was a good fit (discrimination among groups) on the basis of the five demographic predictors alone using the Hosmer and Lemeshow test, χ<sup>2</sup>(8, <italic>N</italic> = 1,405) = 7.61, <italic>p</italic> = .47. Similarly, there was a good fit after addition of the six trauma exposure variables, χ<sup>2</sup>(8, <italic>N</italic> = 1,405) = 11.37, <italic>p</italic> = .18, and the diagnostic variables on the third step, χ<sup>2</sup>(8, <italic>N</italic> = 1,405) = 6.86, <italic>p</italic> = .55. The first step with just the demographic variables in the model was significant, χ<sup>2</sup> (11, <italic>N</italic> = 1,405) = 45.37, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .0005, Nagelkerke <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = .045. Comparison of log-likelihood ratios for models with and without the trauma exposure variables showed reliable improvement with the addition of trauma exposure variables, χ<sup>2</sup>(11, <italic>N</italic> = 1,405) = 65.76, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .0005, Nagelkerke <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = .065. Comparison of the models with and without the six diagnostic variables on Step 3 showed reliable improvement, χ<sup>2</sup>(<italic>N</italic> = 1,405) = 127.94, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .0005, Nagelkerke <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = .124.</p>
<p>Overall classification was unimpressive. Based on the five demographic variables alone, correction classification rates were 100% for treatment completion and 0% for dropout; the overall correct classification rate was 71.1%. The overall prediction rate decreased to 70.7% with the addition of the six trauma exposure variables; however, dropout prediction increased by 0.7%. For the third and final step, with the diagnostic variables included in the model, the overall prediction rate increased to 72.2% with the prediction of dropout increasing to 15%. Clearly, cases were overclassified into the largest group: treatment completers.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1534765612445931">Table 3</xref> shows the results of the final model. Three predictors from the demographic, one from the trauma exposure, and four from the diagnostic variables reliably enhanced prediction. Outcome was predictable from ethnicity, race, guardian status, other trauma, MDD, PTSD, GAD, and ODD. Hispanic children were 42.2% less likely to drop out of treatment than were Caucasian children. Since more than 33% of the subsample for this study came from centers that served high rates of Hispanic/Latino children, a random effects model controlling for center contribution was conducted. The findings indicated that ethnicity was no longer significant (Wald χ<sup>2</sup> = .53, <italic>p</italic> = .47) with this inclusion. Children of another race were 57.5% more likely to drop out of treatment than were Caucasian children. A bivariate analysis of the “other” race category showed that African American children were significantly more likely to drop out of treatment than were other racial groups (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1534765612445931">Table 2</xref>). Children in state custody were 34.3% less likely to drop out of treatment than were children with their biological caregivers. For the trauma exposure variables, only the “other trauma” category was significant and these children were 45.3% less likely to drop out of treatment. As for the diagnostic variables, children who were diagnosed with MDD or suspected of having MDD were 2.08 and 1.72 times more likely, respectively, to drop out of treatment than children who were not depressed. Children who were diagnosed with PTSD were 1.57 times more likely to drop out of treatment than those who were not diagnosed with PTSD. Children in the suspected PTSD category were not significantly more likely to drop out of treatment than those who were not diagnosed with PTSD. The interaction of PTSD and MDD was also included in one model to investigate if comorbidity of PTSD and MDD had an effect on dropout, but the interaction at all categorical levels was not significant.</p>

<p>Children with ODD and suspected of having ODD were 1.67 and 1.89 times more likely, respectively, to drop out of treatment than those not diagnosed with the disorder. Because ODD was found to be a significant predictor of dropout and because the externalizing measure of the CBCL was significant to treatment dropout in the bivariate analysis, CBCL externalizing scores were included as a fourth step. This did not significantly add to the model. Children diagnosed with GAD and suspected of having the disorder were 26.6% and 46.1% less likely, respectively, to drop out of treatment than those not diagnosed with GAD. ADHD and conduct disorder diagnoses were not reliable predictors of dropout.</p>
<p>To verify the bivariate finding that African Americans drop out of treatment more, a model was run that included just White and African American children. The results indicated that the race variable was more significant than in the total model (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .0005) and increased the Nagelkerke <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> from .124 to .142. This also increased the prediction of dropout from 15% to 19%, indicating that African American children were 85.4% more likely to drop out of treatment than White children.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Premature treatment dropout is a significant problem in the field of child psychotherapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1534765612445931">Harrison et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1534765612445931">McKay, McCadam, &amp; Gonzales, 1998</xref>). High treatment attrition may indicate that the prescribed intervention is ineffectual for addressing the needs of the target population, and those who drop out early may fail to realize any or only limited symptom relief and/or improvement in functioning. Furthermore, clinical researchers have noted that early dropouts can skew baseline data toward treatment completers, eventually limiting the generalizability of treatment outcome findings. With the current socioeconomic climate dictating the public and private sectors’ embrace of managed care and program efficiency standards, service investments must be targeted toward those clients who are most likely to benefit from scarce resources. Therefore, an investigation of the predictors of treatment dropout rates is crucial to fully understanding the function of psychosocial treatments for child traumatic stress. This study expands the knowledge base regarding treatment completion by examining dropout rates in the context of a clinically focused, community-based service delivery setting, as opposed to the more empirically driven randomized control trial. In this way, our understanding of the utility of evidence-based treatment in real-world settings is enhanced.</p>
<p>The dropout rate in this sample was 33.2%. This rate is on the higher end of attrition outcomes ranging from 14% to 40% in adult trauma studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1534765612445931">Foa et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1534765612445931">Zayfert et al., 2005</xref>), although very few studies examine treatment completion in the context of child trauma psychotherapy in clinical settings. Adult psychotherapy studies of treatment completion for depressive disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1534765612445931">Persons, Burns, &amp; Perloff, 1988</xref>) and bulimia nervosa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1534765612445931">Steel et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1534765612445931">Waller, 1997</xref>) indicate that dropout rates in clinical practice can be twice the highest randomized control trial rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1534765612445931">Barlow, Craske, Cerny, &amp; Klosko, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1534765612445931">Telch et al., 1993</xref>). Although this rate of attrition is consistent with findings from other studies, the loss of one third of help-seeking families from the therapeutic arena represents a significant clinical problem in the field of child traumatic stress treatment.</p>
<p>This study identified several factors that significantly predicted dropout from trauma-informed evidence-based treatment provided by NCTSN centers across the country. The study findings suggest that race, ethnicity, placement in state custody, mental health status as determined by clinician at initial assessment, and trauma type are important factors that influence treatment completion in a clinical sample of help-seeking, trauma-exposed children and their families. Although some of these findings are congruent with treatment attrition discoveries in the general psychotherapy literature, this investigation provides insight into how previously established predictors of treatment completion and dropout function in a sample of clinic-referred children receiving trauma treatment services.</p>
<p>The finding that African American families were more likely than their White counterparts to drop out of treatment is consistent with other treatment outcome literature. Several studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1534765612445931">Harpaz-Rotem, Murphy, Berkowitz, Marans, &amp; Rosenheck, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1534765612445931">Miller et al., 2008</xref>) have documented that minority membership predicts mental health treatment dropout. Hypothesized reasons for this include clinician failure to effectively engage these families, the relative lack of resources required to attend therapy, a tendency to prefer informal sources of assistance, and/or the lower prioritization of mental health to competing needs as identified by some African American communities. Although initial regression results indicate that Hispanic children were significantly more likely to complete treatment, these differences disappeared when center effects were examined, suggesting that the difference was related to center characteristics as opposed to client ethnicity. This finding also suggests that targeted services that specifically address the cultural practices and behaviors of a population can be effective at engaging families that might otherwise face considerable barriers to treatment completion.</p>
<p>Placement in state custody significantly predicted treatment completion in this study. This might be because many children in state custody were mandated into treatment by child protection, or because their treatment was otherwise monitored for compliance by state oversight agencies or the courts. For such families there may have been considerable externally imposed incentives for completing treatment. In many cases, caseworkers or foster parents may have assumed responsibility for keeping and scheduling appointments, and transporting children to therapy, thereby reducing naturalistic barriers to attendance. Since all children in state custody receive Medicaid coverage, naturally occurring barriers related to parental access to and affordability of mental health care are decreased. Interestingly, these results are consistent with findings from other studies that document the positive role that external forces can play in the overall progress toward psychotherapeutic change and attendance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1534765612445931">Cahill, Adinoff, Hosig, Muller, &amp; Pulliam, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1534765612445931">DiClemente, Bellino, &amp; Neavins, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1534765612445931">Ryan, Plant, &amp; O’Malley, 1995</xref>). However, these studies also raise questions about the long-term stability of therapeutic gains that are not driven by internal motivation and, instead, are sustained by mandated, external structures and monitoring. In other words, external agencies such as child protective services might improve treatment retention in the short run, but the long-range benefits of these therapeutic encounters are unclear if caregivers abandon behaviors and learning acquired during treatment when the mandated controls are removed. Further research is needed to determine the durability of therapeutic benefits gained under such circumstances.</p>
<p>The presence of MDD, ODD, or PTSD significantly predicted treatment dropout while GAD significantly predicting treatment completion. The interaction of PTSD with Depression was nonsignificant in predicting treatment dropout, suggesting that each condition makes a unique contribution to treatment failure. It is a robust finding that children with externalizing behavior problems such as ODD experience higher dropout rates from a variety of treatment approaches, across many service settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1534765612445931">Baruch et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1534765612445931">Burns, Cortell, &amp;, Wagner., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1534765612445931">Robbins et al., 2006</xref>). This study of trauma intervention episodes replicated previous results. Similarly, children with anxiety typically complete general psychotherapy treatment at higher rates than children with other conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1534765612445931">Burns et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1534765612445931">Johnson, Mellor, &amp; Brann, 2008</xref>). However, although previous studies documented that mood disorders predicted higher completion rates, our study found the opposite. Several factors may account for these different findings among youth with trauma-related depression and for PTSD predicting treatment dropout.</p>
<p>The NCTSN centers that contribute to the CDS specialized in trauma-informed, evidence-based service delivery for child traumatic stress and, as such, may not have as their primary focus of treatment childhood depression. It is possible that treatment dropout for depressed children was related to a lack of “goodness of fit” between the child’s presenting problem and the default expertise of the treating clinician. In these cases, children and their parents may have dropped out of treatment because of a lack of congruence between their perceived needs and the services they were receiving.</p>
<p>Another important consideration in any course of child-focused psychotherapy is the role of the parent or caregiver. Unless children are placed in out-of-home care, parents are the gateway through which all child-focused service acquisition and delivery occurs. Parental motivation toward treatment is crucial for completion, and treatment dropout may be indicative of poor parental engagement, trumping even the baseline psychological condition of the child. What might challenge parental motivation? Any type of child therapy can generate negative self-attributions for the caregiver (e.g., “If I were a better parent my child wouldn’t have this problem”). Even more than other clinical situations, the diagnosis of child traumatic disorder frequently elicits accurate and distorted parental beliefs that the parent is responsible for their child’s injury, or similarly troubling, that the parent failed to foresee and/or protect the child from danger. The upshot is that the parent may be confronted with a critical failure in his or her primary role as a parent. Recounting the child’s traumatic experiences may serve as “trauma reminders” to the parent who already feels guilt about harming or failing to protect their child. In addition, for parents with their own trauma history, talking about the child’s trauma may elicit traumatic memories and make the child’s therapy particularly painful and difficult for the parent. Avoiding these painful thoughts and feelings may be a strong incentive for parents of traumatized children to avoid or exit therapeutic encounters. In contrast, symptoms related to more generalized anxiety (e.g., clinging to parent, afraid to sleep alone) may be more directly troublesome to the parent than depression or PTSD, and thus parents have more incentive to attend therapy to address these symptoms. The fact that such processes can operate outside of the awareness of clinicians, parents, and children presents a daunting challenge to trauma treatment completion.</p>
<p>Finally, children exposed to “other traumas” were more than 45% more likely to complete treatment in this sample. Endorsement of “other trauma” indicates that the stressor was not identified in the list of 19 other potentially traumatic events and may not have met Criterion A1 for PTSD. It is possible that the emotional and psychological experience and profile of these children was qualitatively and quantitatively different from children exposed to one of the other types of traumatic events.</p>
<p>Currently, there are only limited focus group and ethnographic studies that explore why parents and children drop out of evidence-based interventions for child traumatic stress. Such qualitative research studies would helpfully supplement and elucidate emerging quantitative findings. The careful analysis of convergent evidence across studies using multiple research methods might better facilitate the design of interventions to achieve improved treatment completion rates for children participating in trauma-informed therapies.</p>
<sec id="section16-1534765612445931">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>One limitation of this study is that it included dropout rates from a variety of different interventions, using diverse inclusion/exclusion criteria across different types of treatment settings, and requiring dissimilar time commitments. Therefore, it is possible that one or more interventions will have differentially contributed to dropout, though inclusion of treatment type in this analysis was not possible because of missing data concerns. Treatment engagement and therapeutic alliance are variables that were unavailable in this data set, and these will be important to consider when developing new models of treatment dropout. Unfortunately, there is limited consensus among psychotherapy researchers about how to operationally define or measure these constructs. In fact, differing methodologies and sample selection procedures across studies make application of these variables difficult in studies of treatment completion and dropout (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1534765612445931">Kazdin &amp; Whitley, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1534765612445931">McKay et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1534765612445931">Prinz &amp; Miller, 1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1534765612445931">1994</xref>).</p>
<p>The inclusion of children in “relative placements” in the child welfare involved group may have inadvertently included those whose placement in out-of-home care was precipitated by factors other than statutory kinship care. However, when out-of-home placement is required, child protection laws and agency procedures stipulate placing these children with relatives in most states. As a prerequisite for receiving funding for child welfare services, federal law requires states to “consider giving preference to an adult relative over a nonrelated caregiver when determining placement for a child, provided that the relative caregiver meets all relevant State child protection standards” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1534765612445931">State Plan for Foster Care and Adoption Assistance, 1996</xref>). Therefore, it is likely that this classification of children was proper and includes a majority of children who are child welfare involved.</p>
<p>Finally, there is considerable debate in the literature about the best way to define treatment dropout. In this study, treatment completion status was determined by the treating clinician, based on the therapeutic goals set forth during the course of service delivery. Of particular concern was the large number of cases that were excluded from the analysis because the treatment completion status was noted as “lost”—presumably because of loss of center funding and/or incomplete data records. These records may represent a particularly significant subgroup of cases that could have shed light on the treatment attrition phenomenon, although inclusion of these cases would have diluted the integrity of the criterion because they could not be unobjectionably defined. Other studies of treatment completion define treatment based on the number of encounters dictated by the treatment method or capricious thresholds based on average numbers of sessions by population or therapy characteristics. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1534765612445931">Baruch et al. (2009)</xref> offered a valuable comment relevant to this current work: [We] may be distorting the therapeutic model applied in practice . . . too much in favor of long-term treatment when short-term therapeutic work may be achieving favorable outcomes with some young people that drop out” (p. 75). They suggest that researchers should not choose arbitrary thresholds but instead should use outcome data to help define the number of sessions that represent noncompletion. Clinician judgment regarding when treatment is complete will naturally include outcome information, but such clinician appraisals can be distorted by other factors (clinician fatigue, caseload demands, loss of funding). The scientific challenge will be to operationally define dropout in such a way that it can be widely accepted and included in the growing body of evidence-based practice research. The hope is that evidence-based practice manualized approaches will generate increased precision in the delivery, dosing, and control over contextual variables and thereby enhance treatment completion rates.</p>

<title>Implications</title>
<p>Many intervention studies, such as those published by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1534765612445931">Prinz and Miller (1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1534765612445931">1994</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1534765612445931">Kazdin and Whitley (2003)</xref>, take a proactive approach with caregivers to identify and address any issues that might lead to treatment dropout. Including dropout management services such as trackers, incentives, and outreach staff that specifically target African American children could effectively respond to the fears and needs of biological parents and children. In addition, approaches that address specific symptoms that interfere with treatment engagement should be specifically integrated into treatment episodes. The inclusion of motivational interviewing, along with parent training, has been found to be effective in increasing treatment retention among clients from child welfare populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1534765612445931">Chaffin et al., 2009</xref>) and may prove to have utility with other clinical populations as well.</p>
<p>The capacity of any evidence-based approach to include or integrate dropout prevention strategies may ultimately speak to its feasibility and utility in real-world treatment settings. Preventing the premature termination from a trauma treatment should be considered as fundamental to effective service delivery as ensuring the clinical fidelity to the essential elements of that treatment.</p>
