<abstract>
<p>In this article, we present a case report of a 62-year-old patient who previously underwent an above-the-knee amputation for vascular disease and we performed a total hip replacement on him because of hip osteoarthritis. As the only postoperative complication, the patient developed a methicillin-resistant <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> surgical site infection, which was successfully treated. The surgical technique and the postoperative rehabilitation program are described in detail in an attempt to detect and face the challenges that patients with major lower limb amputations may present. The literature is reviewed and all known cases of hip replacements in amputees are presented.</p>

<p>Total hip replacement (THR) is an effective procedure for improving functionality and pain in patients with severe hip osteoarthritis. These replacements have evoked major interest and have been a main topic of several reports in otherwise fit patients. Nevertheless, there is very little information about the peculiarities of the performance of a THR in patients with an ipsilateral above-the-knee amputation (AKA). In this article, we present a case of a patient who underwent THR in the ipsilateral amputated limb. We have revised the literature until the present time and focused on reporting the challenges of the surgical technique as well as the postoperative rehabilitation program, aiming for a quick exoprostheses reposition.</p>
<p>Revising the existing literature, there is only one case reported in indexed journals of a THR in an ipsilateral AKA.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1534734613479380">1</xref></sup> We present here, to our knowledge, the first case of a THR in a dysvascular ipsilateral AKA.</p>

<title>Case Report</title>
<p>We present a case report of a 62-year-old male patient, with a past medical history of typhoid fever in his childhood, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, ex-smoker of 3 to 4 packs per day, pneumonia, high blood pressure, chronic vascular disease of both lower limbs with an iliofemoral bypass in the left lower limb, ectasy of the superficial femoral artery, and left knee osteoarthritis. In the right lower limb, he had a past history of popliteal artery aneurism and acute ischemia that lead to AKA 2 years ago from his referral. At the time of presentation, the patient was complaining of severe right hip osteoarthritis that was causing difficulties for the use of the exoprosthesis due to severe pain. He was using a total-contact quadrilateral socket with a locking monocentric knee and SACH foot type. On plain X-rays, there was evidence of right hip grade IV osteoarthritis. The patient did not improve after rehabilitation treatment and analgesic medication until the opioid step of the analgesic ladder. After a multidisciplinary team assessment with the Departments of Orthopaedics, Rehabilitation and Vascular Surgery and with the consent of the patient, a right THR was considered. A primary hybrid metal on poly THR with porous coated shell and a collared femoral cemented stem was performed without intraoperative complications (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1534734613479380">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Surgical Technique</title>
<p>The patient was set up in a lateral decubitus position secured with 2 supports, one anterior and one posterior acting over the pelvis. The stump was prepped and covered with a transparent adhesive drape to ensure correct astify and secure manipulation. The hip was approached by a posterolateral standard Moore approach. Some centimeters proximal to the gluteus maximus insertion to the femoral shaft were dissected to allow the insertion of a big self-retaining bone clamp. This clamp would be helpful when performing the joint dislocation and a landmark for space orientation to insert the femoral stem in a correct version. Placing the clamp in the more fragile trochanteric area should be avoided, so that one can proceed with the powerful manipulation of the limb with a minimal risk of bone injury. The acetabular and femoral components were inserted in a correct position obtaining good stability. The incision was closed up in layers as usual. A drain was placed during 24 hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1534734613479380">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1534734613479380">3</xref>).</p>

<p>During the immediate postoperative time, the patient was clinically stable without any complications and underwent regular rehabilitation program for THR. Care was taken to avoid stump edema by means of compressive dressings. He was allowed to be seated and isometric exercises commenced at 48 hours after the procedure. He was able to mobilize with some help at 72 hours. Five days after surgery the exoprosthesis was replaced and well tolerated while mobilizing without the need to change any characteristics of the exoprosthesis or the socket. At 6 days postoperatively, the patient was discharged and was mobile with 2 crutches. As a delayed postoperative complication, after 15 days there was evidence of serohemorrhagic discharge oozing from his surgical site wound and the samples taken were positive for methicillin-resistant <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>. With the suspicion of acute prosthetic infection, at 18 days postoperatively the patient underwent surgical washout and debridement of the hip and revision of the modular components of the prosthesis (polyethylene and femoral head). The samples taken intraoperatively confirm the etiologic diagnosis of methicillin-resistant <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> infection. During the hospital stay, the rehabilitation program was suspended. The patient received intravenous antibiotic treatment with daptomycin and after clinical improvement, he was discharged switching to oral cotrimoxazole and rifampicin. The rehabilitation therapy was resumed at discharge. At the 10-week follow-up the patient was pain free, able to mobilize without crutches and was able to replace the exoprosthesis by himself. Inflammatory markers such as white cell count, C reactive protein, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate went back to normal. At 12 months after surgery, the patient remains within excellent degrees of satisfaction.</p>
<p>The WOMAC questionnaire for assessment of hip osteoarthritis was performed before surgery with a score of 18 and at 10 weeks postsurgery the score improved to 9. Postoperatively at 10 weeks with the intention to assess the functionality the following questionnaires were performed: Locomotor Capabilities Index, as part of the Prosthetic Profile of the Amputee, with a score of 40; Houghton Scale, with a score of 7; Questionnaire on the satisfaction of patients with lower limb amputations toward their prostheses (Sat-pro), with a score of 37 and the 2-minute walking test with a score of 56 meters.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1534734613479380">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1534734613479380"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1534734613479380"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1534734613479380"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1534734613479380"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1534734613479380">7</xref></sup></p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Patients with lower limb amputations can suffer from musculoskeletal complications such as osteoporosis (in the amputated limb), osteoarthritis (either the amputated or the nonamputated limb), and spine-related problems.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1534734613479380">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1534734613479380">9</xref></sup> Furthermore, the majority of these patients use an exoprosthesis to mobilize that requires special care and follow-up. Because of various idiosyncratic aspects, when these groups of patients are candidates for the performance of a THR, there are some peculiarities that must be considered regarding the surgical indication, the THR surgical technique, and the postoperative rehabilitation program.</p>
<p>Depending on different reports, the incidence of hip osteoarthritis in amputated patients varies from 5% to 61%. As expected, the longer the follow-up the greater the osteoarthritis incidence, but in the long term, the risk to develop hip osteoarthritis compared with general population is double in the nonamputated limb and 6 times higher in the amputated limb. Likewise, in the ipsilateral hip and in above-the-knee amputees, hip osteoarthritis is reported more frequently and more severely.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1534734613479380">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>Reviewing the literature, we have found few amputated patients with subsequent insertion of a THR.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1534734613479380">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1534734613479380">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1534734613479380"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1534734613479380"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1534734613479380"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1534734613479380"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1534734613479380">15</xref></sup> Results are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1534734613479380">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<p>We have not found in the literature any case that described a THR in a dysvascular AKA. Because of the short life expectancy registered in the past of the dysvascular amputated patient, many of them are not prone to develop hip osteoarthritis in the amputated extremity and if so, in these cases, conservative management was recommended. In cases with high surgical risk, such as a dysvascular amputee, guidelines advocate a conservative therapy based on pharmacology with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in addition to physical therapy and rehabilitation, with the aim of maintaining a correct functional capacity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1534734613479380">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1534734613479380">17</xref></sup> Nevertheless, on some occasions, like in our case, this treatment is not enough to fulfill this functional capacity.</p>
<p>At the present time, we might be experiencing an increase of dysvascular amputated patients with hip osteoarthritis presenting to our clinics because of increased longevity following better control of vascular disease. During the past 20 years, patients with dysvascular amputations have benefited from secondary prevention of vascular disease, better cardiovascular surgical techniques, and a higher emphasis on exercise, causing an increase in survival rates of dysvascular amputees and at the same time the higher likelihood of facing some of the musculoskeletal aspects of aging such as osteoarthritis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1534734613479380">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1534734613479380">19</xref></sup> Nevertheless, the cohort of dysvascular amputated patients has higher morbidity– mortality compared with other causes of amputation such as traumatic, congenital, or infectious. In the past, during the 1990s, the mean life expectancy for these dysvascular patients was very low, reported as 1 year and 6 months, for those with below-the-knee amputation (BKA) due to atherosclerosis and of 1 year and 8 months for those with an amputation due to diabetes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1534734613479380">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>Preoperative planning in these patients should consider some specific aspects. It is important to take into account hip radiographs that would include the complete stump to assess the remaining femoral length and the width of its medullary canal with the intention of being able to ensure the insertion of the femoral stem. Templating for these stems is very useful to plan the correct size. In amputated patients, some changes in the bone mineral density and in the distal bony geometry of the stump due to prolonged wear have been registered. It is important to emphasize the decreased cortical area at the end of the stump.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1534734613479380">21</xref></sup> In the femur, it can lead to a widening of the medullary canal that we need to take into account. When facing this situation in a very wide canal it might be possible that we lack the correct stem diameter to fulfill a good primary stability and osteointegration of the prosthesis with a fiber metal coat, in which case, a cemented prosthesis should be used.</p>
<p>During the surgical procedure, the main difficulties faced are related to femoral manipulation and precise stump antistify. We should anticipate the possibility of added gestures that would solve the difficulties that we are going to run into. We recommend draping of the stump with a plastic adhesive drape during the time of the procedure to isolate the distal part of the stump that is presumably a contaminated zone because of its usual inclusion in the closed receptacle of the exoprosthesis and because of its irregular amputation wound formation, which is often encountered. Proper implant positioning is essential for a good outcome after a THR. In amputated patients, we lack references like the knee or the leg axis to obtain an appropriate version of the implant. Prickett and Scanlon<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1534734613479380">11</xref></sup> reported a retroverted femoral stem insertion in a BKA patient. In AKA cases, the risk of malpositioning is even higher. In such a situation of malpositioning, the external prosthesis should be adjusted to amend the lower limb alteration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1534734613479380">11</xref></sup> However, this situation is not desirable because it leads to a higher risk of dislocation, compromised components survivorship, and altered gait kinematics.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1534734613479380">22</xref></sup> Dislocation of the osteoarthritic joint during the procedure, without a good lever arm of the whole lower limb, can be troublesome. The knee and the tibia cannot be used as a fulcrum to apply traction or joint dislocating maneuvers. First, our recommendation would be to use a bone clamp well applied in the proximal diaphysis, just proximal to the gluteus maximus insertion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1534734613479380">15</xref></sup> Apart from allowing dislocation and correct manipulation of the extremity, it can be of use for rotational orientation. If it is placed from the beginning in the sagittal plane of the extremity, we can work out the correct anteversion to be applied when reaming the femoral medullary canal. If the anatomy of the proximal femoral portion is normal, it will also be useful for orientation to properly place the femoral component, taking as landmarks the lesser trochanter and the virtual projection of the linea aspera. An expert surgeon in standard hip replacements is presumed. We also recommend having a sterilized equipment ready, which would allow the insertion of a pin in the diaphysis that can be connected to a temporary bone traction. When unable to proceed with joint dislocation, neck osteotomy might be done in situ. As a last resort, when severe soft tissue contractures or heterotopic ossifications are present, a greater trochanter osteotomy could be performed. The instruments for the following trochanteric fixation must be ready as well.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1534734613479380">1</xref></sup> We recommend trying to avoid this procedure as much as possible, because of its reported complications (the most frequent being nonunion to a rate of 5% to 23%, abductor muscles weakness, Trendelenburg gait, recurrent dislocation), which, in the amputated patient using an exoprosthesis, can lead to major functional problems.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1534734613479380">23</xref></sup> In our case no maneuvers were needed apart from the bone clamp.</p>
<p>Postoperative rehabilitation and an experienced orthotic technician in the team are essential. An intensive rehabilitation treatment has been proved effective in lower limb amputated patients. In particular, Turney et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1534734613479380">16</xref></sup> demonstrated that BKA patients generally obtain better mobility than AKA ones (<italic>P</italic> = .002). Postoperative mobilization with or without crutches must be taken into account to predict the outcome. In an amputated patient with an ipsilateral THR, we should solve the predictable development of hip and knee contractures. A regime focused on strengthening the hip flexors and knee extensors is needed to avoid hip flexion contracture as much as possible. During the surgical procedure, aiming in that direction, some gestures can be added, such as an anterior capsulotomy (that we performed) or tenotomies of the retracted muscular groups in flexion and/or abduction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1534734613479380">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>Total hip replacement in this cohort of patients can prevent their functional deterioration and preserve their limited but precious functional capacity, thus it is a procedure to take into consideration in the multifactorial therapeutic effort in selected cases. From our limited experience after a single case and with a short follow-up, we can find an improvement in functional capacity and pain in the patient. Being an unusual procedure at this moment and with relatively short follow-up along with the similar published cases, there are no guidelines or evidence that could direct the therapeutic plan. Larger series are needed with long-term follow-up to obtain conclusive results.</p>
