<p>With interest I read the article of Atasay and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0091270011398242">1</xref></sup> on the effect of sodium alginate on acid gastroesophageal reflux disease in preterm infants. Several issues raised in this well-written article deserve further discussion. In their introduction, the authors state that sodium alginate is a new drug with increasing use in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs). Could the authors provide more information outlining the frequency of sodium alginate use in NICUs? Furthermore, could more information be provided regarding in which countries the drug is increasingly used in NICUs and how many preterm infants are exposed to this medicine every year? What do we know about the safety of using sodium alginate in preterm infants with gastroesophageal reflux disease, especially concerning the potential aspiration of the nicely formed gel after the infant vomits? What about the potential risks of the aluminum content of the drug? Are all currently available products without aluminum, as introduced by Miller et al?<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0091270011398242">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>As a neonatal clinical pharmacologist I am very interested in how the authors reached their decision to use 1 mL/kg sodium alginate 4 times a day in their study participants. I assume they selected the lowest dose that was used successfully in 76 pediatric patients reported by Le Luyer et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0091270011398242">3</xref></sup> but I request that the authors better explain the rationale for their dose selection.</p>
<p>As far as I am aware, considerable debate exists concerning the diagnosis and treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease in preterm infants, although it seems clear to me that these infants need treatment for quite some time. What was the reason for the short study observation period (48 hours) after the introduction of the sodium alginate? Just as important, can the authors provide any follow-up information on the study infants? Did the infants continue sodium alginate treatment or were they discontinued after study completion? Was there any long-term follow-up of the infants in this study and, if so, did they improve, and in what ways? Is sodium in the alginate formulation systemically available and, if so, please provide an assessment of the amount that an infant may absorb daily with the study dose regimen. I assume no infant developed electrolyte disturbances during drug exposure.</p>
<p>I commend the authors on their research that again demonstrates that neonatologists often prematurely use new and also many old drugs without having the appropriate clinical pharmacology information. This study underscores the need to perform these investigations, and it also indicates that there are no major ethical or practical issues that would prevent us from doing these studies in a scientifically sound way.</p>
