<abstract>
<p>In this study, geometrical features of pedicle screws have been modified and their performances are compared. Performance analysis has been made in terms of pull-out strength and torsional strength. The parameters investigated are core diameter, holes drilled normal to screw axis, angle between sequential holes and distance between holes. Three different core diameter have been studied, which are 4 mm (normal core diameter), 5 mm (medium core diameter) and 5.5 mm (high core diameter). Distance between sequential holes has been arranged such that there is either one hole per pitch or one hole per two pitches. Angle between sequential holes is either 90° or 120°. According to the test results, the screw, with medium core diameter (5 mm) containing one hole per two pitches with 90° angle between sequential holes, has exhibited the optimum performance considering torsional strength and pull-out strength requirements. Its torsional strength is slightly higher than and, when Grade 40 polyurethane foam was used as bone simulating material, its pull-out strength is as good as, an undrilled normal core diameter screw, which is already being used in surgical operations. The fatigue performance of this best performed screw has also been found satisfactory according to the related standard. Its pull-out strength is also tested on a calf vertebra and a promising result has been obtained.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Spinal fixation is the only solution for certain disorders, such as vertebral fractures, scoliosis or tumor causing total replacements of vertebral bones.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954411911434680">1</xref></sup> In 2005 there were 10 million osteoporosis patients in the United States and 35 million people were under the risk of osteoporosis. Osteoporosis is called the silent disease because of its side effects, namely, making bone more fragile and liable to fail with vertebral and traumatic fractures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954411911434680">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954411911434680">5</xref></sup> A widespread method for spinal fixation is operated by pedicle screws. Although there are several other methods, the use of pedicle screws is more common.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954411911434680">6</xref></sup> The most complicated problem in spinal fixation by pedicle screws is encountered on osteoporotic bones. Fixation becomes quite problematic if the bone mineral density is low. A number of studies have been carried out on osteoporotic bones to understand the pull-out strength, which is the key point of fixation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0954411911434680">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0954411911434680">13</xref></sup> Rohlmann et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0954411911434680">14</xref></sup> studied the forces on a vertebrectomy model, which is a reference study to understand the loading of spine. Recent studies have shown that there is a significant correlation between bone mineral density (BMD) and pull-out strength, i.e. the lower the BMD the lower the pull-out strength.</p>
<p>Researchers studied human cadavers, living animals and simulating standard foam materials to clarify the relationship between bone and screw.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0954411911434680">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0954411911434680">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0954411911434680">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0954411911434680">16</xref></sup> Finite element analyses have also been carried out by researchers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0954411911434680">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0954411911434680">19</xref></sup> The common output of those studies is that the most important factor is the bond of the bone–screw interface.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0954411911434680">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954411911434680">2</xref>0–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0954411911434680">23</xref></sup> Cortical bone provides a higher bone–screw interface bonding owing to its higher BMD, while the sponge-like part of bone provides less. On the other hand, the sponge-like part of bone has a higher fusion tendency to support the bone–screw interface.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0954411911434680">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>Increasing the pull-out strength of the screw depends on several factors, such as bone quality, screw design and the bond of the bone–screw interface.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0954411911434680">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0954411911434680">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0954411911434680">24</xref></sup> Several studies were carried out on the cement augmentation of pedicle screws and most of them proved that using cement reinforcement significantly increases the pull-out strength on osteoporotic bones.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0954411911434680">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954411911434680">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0954411911434680">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0954411911434680">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0954411911434680">30</xref></sup> Studies conducted with human cadavers, living patients, living animals or synthetic foams all have shown that using cement with cannulated pedicle screws has clearly brought about improvements on pull-out strength. However, cement augmentation has some disadvantages, such as toxic leakage and secondary material, such as poly methyl methacrylate (PMMA) requirements.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0954411911434680">11</xref></sup> These disadvantages of cement augmentation led the researchers to study and understand the nature of bone and to find solutions by improving the design parameters of pedicle screws. Numerous studies carried out on the core shape of a screw concluded that a conical core gives a better performance than cylindrical cores with regard to pull-out strength.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0954411911434680">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0954411911434680">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0954411911434680">37</xref></sup> The effect of the screw material on pull-out strength for both osteoporotic and healthy bones was also studied and comparison of SS and Ti alloys exhibited that SS has a slightly higher pull-out strength on bone-like synthetic foams.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0954411911434680">38</xref></sup> Researchers also focused on design parameters, such as thread form, pitch, flat overlap area and so on, but they have not reached an outstanding solution, only slight improvements have been obtained.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0954411911434680">32</xref></sup></p>
<p>The next stage of design studies was expandable screws. All studies on expandable screws showed superior pull-out strength for both normal and osteoporotic bones.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0954411911434680">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0954411911434680">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0954411911434680">41</xref></sup> Expandable screws are made up of an outer tube-like threaded shell and an inner mill. Expansion of the screw is achieved by pushing the inner mill with a conical nose, which forces split fins at the lower end of threaded shell to open. Fins are split by cutting the screw parallel to the main axis through its mid length. Despite their superior fixation and pull-out properties, expandable screws have resulted to be detrimental when re-operations are required.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0954411911434680">39</xref></sup> In revision operations, a surgeon should pull out the inner mill first and then back twist the screw. However, back twisting is nearly impossible owing to contra conical geometry of the screw tip side. Furthermore, pulling out the inner mill and back twisting of the screw both result in pronounced bleeding. Another problem with expandable screws can be encountered in re-operations conducted after a two year period. Bone fusion between the gaps of screw fins causes catastrophic failure of bone upon back twisting. These problems have led surgeons to abandon the use of expandable screws.</p>
<p>In this study, a new screw is designed to improve the pull-out strength by a natural process, namely bone fusion. Screws are drilled as normal to the main axis in order to give an opportunity of bone fusion through the holes. It is clear that drilled holes will increase the pull-out strength after fusion and provide a better screw–bone interface bond. However, drilling holes on the main axis of a screw can cause other strength drawbacks. To figure out these drawbacks twenty different designs were prepared and tested according to ASTM F543-07.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0954411911434680">42</xref></sup> The design with the best performance has been determined. Also pull-out tests were carried out on a calf vertebra with the best performed screw design. The study was concluded by performing fatigue tests with the best design in accordance with ASTM F1717-10.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0954411911434680">43</xref></sup> This study aims to develop a higher fusion ability pedicle screw for osteoporotic incidents. In this study only in-vitro tests have been conducted. It is obvious that in-vivo tests are required to observe the advantage of bone in-growth on pull-out strength. However, the objective of this study is to investigate the effect of drilled holes on the mechanical properties of pedicle screws. If the drilled screws meet the mechanical property requirements of related standards, they will undoubtedly exhibit better pull-out behavior in in-vivo conditions than undrilled screws because of bone in-growth.</p>

<title>Experiments</title>
<p>Determining the torsional properties of designed screws is essential. Bones are exposed to torsional stresses upon screwing. Torsion tests have been conducted in accordance with ASTM F543-07.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0954411911434680">42</xref></sup> Test set-up has two collets. One of them is fixed and contains a torque transducer and the other can turn clockwise or counterclockwise with a constant angular speed. The tip side of the screw was fixed with a fixation length of 10 mm to Instron test set-up and the head side was twisted clockwise with a speed of 5 r/min until the screw has broken. Torque values versus angle of twist were recorded. The schematic view of the test set-up is given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954411911434680">Figure 1</xref>.</p>

</fig>
<p>Another critical design parameter for bone screws is pull-out strength. In this study, geometrical features of pedicle screws have been modified in order to improve their pull-out performance. Experiments have been conducted to compare the pull-out strength of original screws with that of modified ones. Grade 40 polyurethane foam was used as a bone simulating material in pull-out tests. Designed screws were screwed to the polyurethane foam to a depth of 20 mm and pulled out with a cross head speed of 5 mm/min. Displacement versus load was recorded. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954411911434680">Figure 2</xref> shows the pull-out test set-up and apparatus. A calf vertebra was also used in this study for the optimized screw design.</p>

</fig>
<p>The design with higher pull-out strength and reliable torsional properties has been selected as the final design. After that, the final design was implanted in a calf vertebra and pulled out to determine the actual pull-out strength on a real vertebral bone. The schematic view of the pull-out test carried out using a calf vertebra can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954411911434680">Figure 3</xref>. Then, static compression and fatigue tests were carried out on the final design according to ASTM F1717-10.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0954411911434680">43</xref></sup> Ultra-high molecular weight poly ethylene (UHMWPE) blocks were used as bone simulating material for these tests. Subassembly construction can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954411911434680">Figure 4</xref>. After determining the static yield load by static compression tests, fatigue tests were conducted at 90% of the static yield value. For fatigue tests, load wave form, load ratio and test frequency were sinusoidal, 10 and 10 Hz, respectively. Withstanding up to 5 million cycles without failure in fatigue tests means that the tested sample is satisfactory for bilateral vertebrectomy model loadings. On the other hand, before clinical usage of a screw type, ASTM F1798 tests should be completed under static and dynamic loading conditions.</p>

</list>
<p>Core diameter is the main parameter for determining the torsional properties. The higher the core diameter the higher the torque values in torsion tests. In this study, standard, medium and higher core diameters were used in the tests. Core diameters for 6.5 × 45 mm pedicle screws were 4 mm, 5 mm and 5.5 mm for normal core, medium core and higher core, respectively.</p>
<p>Holes drilled normal to the screw axis are expected to enhance pull-out strength when placed on a patient’s vertebra. There are no such holes on normal screws. The aim of these holes is to increase the fusion between the sponge-like bone and the screw. Especially, osteoporotic cases need self bonding, i.e. higher fusion ability between the screw and the bone, in the course of time.</p>
<p>The effect of the angle between sequential holes is also investigated in this study. Two different configurations were designed. In one of them, the angle between sequential holes is 90° and in the other one, it is 120°.</p>
<p>The distance between sequential holes determines the number of holes and so torsional properties of screws. To investigate the effect of this distance, holes were drilled such that there is one hole per pitch or one hole per two pitches.</p>

<p>It has been observed that the magnitude of torque necessary for breaking the screws increases with increasing core diameter. Screws with a high core diameter exhibited the highest torsional strength for both drilled and undrilled specimens. This is an expected result because stresses generated by torsional loading decreases as a result of increased area moment of inertia when core diameter is high.</p>
<p>The aim of drilling holes on the screws is to increase the pull-out strength by fusion. When screws with holes are placed in patients, fusion of the bone tissue is expected to occur through the holes resulting in a strong bone–screw interface bond. However, drilling holes on screws means that the screws are damaged to some extent. This is expected to weaken the strength properties of the screws owing to the decrease in moment of inertia and stress concentrations around the drilled holes. It is important to determine the degree of this reduction so that an optimum screw design can be obtained with an outstanding pull-out characteristic and acceptable strength. Zones surrounding the holes are exposed to higher stresses because of stress concentration. This deteriorates the torsional strength of screws. As can be seen in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0954411911434680">Table 1</xref>, the yield and ultimate torque values for the original undrilled screw are 11.1 Nm and 14.26 Nm, respectively. The t-test is performed to see whether the means of two groups are statistically different from each other and P values were 1.29 × 10<sup>−4</sup>and 1.76 × 10<sup>−4</sup> for yield and ultimate values, respectively. However, when holes are drilled on the same screw, these values decrease considerably. For example, if one hole is drilled per pitch and they are vertical to each other, the yield torque is 7.86 Nm and the ultimate torque is 11.92 Nm. Similar results have been obtained for all-drilled screws having the same core diameter as the original undrilled screw. The number of holes normal to the main axis of the screw also plays an important role on screw failure. An increased number of holes causes more damage on the screw and as a result decreases the torsional strength more. The more closely spaced the holes are, the lower the breaking torque. For example, the yield and ultimate torque values for a N1SAP screw, which has one hole per pitch, are 6.45 Nm and 9.21 Nm, while that for N1DAP screw, which has one hole per two pitches, are 8.12 Nm and 10.12 Nm, respectively (P = 4.49 × 10<sup>−4</sup> for yield values and P = 5.9 × 10<sup>−3</sup> for ultimate values.). Other geometrical features (core diameter and angle between the sequential holes) of both screws are identical, apart from the closeness of the holes. Similar results have been obtained for all screw groups. Therefore, it can be claimed that although drilled holes are expected to increase the pull-out strength of the screws when placed in patients, their number should be kept low in order not to deteriorate the other strength properties.</p>
<p>Torsional properties of medium core diameter (5 mm) and high core diameter (5.5 mm) screws are better than that of normal core diameter (4 mm) screws. Especially, high core diameter screws have proven to be very satisfactory in terms of torsional properties. However, their pull-out load values are very low compared with normal core diameter and medium core diameter screws. This is owing to the lower thread depth of high core diameter screws. While core diameters have been increased, pitch diameters of the screws have remained unchanged. As a result, the depth of the threads decreased with increased core diameter, which reduced the grabbing force between the screws and embedding media, so deteriorating the pull-out properties.</p>
<p>When torsional properties and pull-out properties are taken into consideration together, medium core diameter screws exhibited the optimum performance. The pull-out strength of a medium core diameter screw is close to the normal diameter screw and has fair torsional properties when compared with a normal undrilled screw.</p>
<p>Results show that angles between the holes also affect the torsional properties to some extent. The screws with holes that are vertically drilled to each other, have slightly higher torsional strength than the screws with holes having a 120° angle between each other. For instance, the yield and ultimate torque values for a M1DVP screw, where the holes are vertical to each other, are 13.23 Nm and 17.25 Nm, while that for a M1DAP screw, where the holes are angled 120°, are 9.42 Nm and 13.25 Nm, respectively (P = 0.52 × 10<sup>−4</sup> for yield values and P = 0.08 × 10<sup>−4</sup> for ultimate values). This might be caused by the fact that when the angle between sequential holes is 120°, the holes lying on the same transverse plane are closer compared to the case of 90°. For example, when screws having one hole per pitch are considered, the distance between the holes lying on the same transverse plane is 3 pitches, if the angle between the sequential holes is 120°. However, the distance is 4 pitches when the angle is 90°. This means that, for the case of 120°, more material has been removed from the same plane resulting in more weakening compared with the case of a 90° angle. Moreover, when the holes on the same plane are closer, superimposition of stress fields can be expected to be more effective.</p>
<p>Considering sufficient torsional strength and pull-out strength requirements, the screw with medium core diameter, having vertical holes per two pitches, namely the M1DVP screw, exhibited the optimum performance among all screws tested in this experimental study.</p>
<p>Additional pull-out tests were performed for this sample using a fresh calf vertebra and the result is compared with a standard undrilled screw with 4 mm core diameter. On calf tests a M1DVC sample exhibited 84% of a normal screw’s pull-out strength (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0954411911434680">Table 1</xref>). Thread depth of the medium core diameter screw is less than that of normal core diameter. Therefore, there is a reduction in pull-out strength.</p>
<p>Subassembly compression test results showed that normal screws and M1DV samples provide similar yield strengths. Yield values for subassembly of a M1DV and N0– samples are 412 N and 420 N, respectively. Fatigue tests were performed with a load of 90% of yield values of static compression test results, namely, 371 N for M1DV and 378 N for N0–. Both samples withstood up to 5,000,000 cycles without failure, which proves that samples are suitable to be used as pedicle screws for vertebral bones.</p>
<p>As a result of this study, it is proved that the screw with a medium core diameter, having vertical holes per two pitches (M1DV) sample, can be confidently used in surgical operations. It is as safe as normal undrilled screws (approved by FDA and clinically in use for several years). Although its pull-out strength is less than that of undrilled screw with a 4 mm core diameter, its pull-out behavior will be much better owing to the fusion of bone tissue through the drilled holes when they are placed in patients.</p>
