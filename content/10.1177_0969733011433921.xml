<abstract>
<p>The purpose of this study was to determine the professional and personal values among midwifery students in Turkey and to identify whether the years of study affected these values. A total of 192 participants were asked to prioritize 16 professional and 36 personal values. The relationship between the year of study and value ranking was analyzed by Kruskal–Wallis test. The first three of the professional values were justice, equality, and human dignity. Equality ranked sixth among the personal terminal values, and it increased with the years of study. Of personal instrumental values, responsibility and cleanliness ranked second and fifth, which are of central importance for the profession of midwifery. However, the other two important values, privacy and preventing unnecessary suffering, ranked lower when the years of study increased, in other words when the students confront clinics. Since these values are important for midwifery, ethics courses should be given throughout the midwifery education to prepare students for the challenges they face in the clinical environment.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Midwifery is a professional discipline that combines science, art, and strong ethical values. As an ancient profession, for centuries, its perspective did not change and remained as “belief in the normal processes of pregnancy, labour, and birth.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0969733011433921">1</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Midwifery practice is based on professional and personal values formed by the physiological realities of pregnancy and birth and surrounded by cultural values affecting women and babies.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0969733011433921">2</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0969733011433921"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0969733011433921">4</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Taylor et al. (2008) defined <italic>value</italic> as “a personal belief about worth that acts as a standard to guide one’s behaviour.” A system of values involves an organization arranging its components in order of importance to act as a code of behavior.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0969733011433921">5</xref>
</sup> Individuals are not born with a set of values. The values are formed by interactions with environment, family, and culture over a lifetime. The most important factors for values affecting intentional or unintentional decisions are culture, experience, ethnic roots, and education.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0969733011433921">6</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0969733011433921"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0969733011433921">8</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Pregnancy and birth are, in themselves, value-laden experiences. Midwives provide for the physical, educational, and psychosocial needs of mothers and babies during these experiences in a holistic manner. They have many roles as they care for women throughout pregnancy, labor, delivery, and the neonatal period. Midwives are supposed to be <italic>with</italic> women at an intensely intimate time. They have to make critical decisions, rooted in their own personal and professional values, about issues such as giving birth, resuscitation, contraception, assisted reproduction, abortion, and helping women who are exposed to violence. As Thomson pointed out “the marvellous plurality of the world confronts them with the challenge of a multiplicity of values (some of them conflicting), which have emerged within different cultures over time.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0969733011433921">4</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>In this context, awareness of personal and professional values in decision making and the appropriate professional education are important. A legal midwifery practice requires completion of an accredited midwifery education program. In order to retain the legal ability to practice, a midwife must continue to demonstrate appropriate professional values and understanding. An accredited midwifery education program therefore includes training on ethics, values, and professional issues such as respect for privacy, client autonomy, justice, and avoiding harm.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0969733011433921">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0969733011433921">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0969733011433921">9</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Undergraduate midwifery education in Turkey was started in 1997 and graduate education in 2007. The Turkish Association of Midwifery implicitly has accepted the International Code of Ethics for Midwives<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0969733011433921">10</xref>
</sup>; however, it has not yet become a member of the International Confederation of Midwives (ICM). Although the undergraduate education has been provided by 33 universities in Turkey, it still has not been standardized.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0969733011433921">11</xref>
</sup> Institutional competences for midwifery graduates have been determined in terms of skills. However, the national basic competences including professional values have not been finalized. For example, our university introduced undergraduate education for midwives in 1997. We teach certain professional values such as privacy and human dignity as part of the first-year curriculum and ethics in the second year.</p>
<p>Although the current law dated 1928 briefly stated midwifery as a medical practice in Turkey, it is far from meeting modern midwifery standards.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0969733011433921">12</xref>
</sup> Therefore, if the science and art of midwifery is to be established in Turkey upon an appropriate ethical and professional foundation, it is important that both qualified midwives and the students understand ethical and professional values.</p>
<p>Currently, there are very few domestic studies in this area that take into consideration the experience and views of midwifery students.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0969733011433921">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0969733011433921">14</xref>
</sup> Hence, we measured professional and personal values of midwifery students and evaluated the differences among the years of study for the bachelor of midwifery degree.</p>

<title>Research type</title>
<p>This is a descriptive and cross-sectional study.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0969733011433921">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>This study was carried out during the 2010–2011 academic year among the midwifery students (n = 237) in Kocaeli University Health School. Students were informed about the study, and voluntary participation was obtained. Data were collected through the use of anonymous questionnaire, and the students were reminded that returning a completed study form implies informed consent. The study was carried out with the permission of Kocaeli Clinical Research Ethical Committee (Date: 15 December 2009; Number: KKAEK 6/11).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0969733011433921">
<title>Instruments</title>
<p>Two tools were used to collect data as previously applied by Rassin in 2008 and 2009.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0969733011433921">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0969733011433921">16</xref>
</sup> The first was the Rokeach Value Survey, which was previously adapted for use in Turkish by Bilgin and Araz in 1993 with the reliability and validity study implemented by Çalışkur.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0969733011433921">16</xref>
</sup> The Rokeach Value Survey is a grading scale composed of two different subscales each containing a list of 18 alphabetically ordered values with definitions. Participants were asked to give a number between 1 and 18 for terminal values (measuring goals for life), and subsequently repeat the same process for the instrumental values (measuring preferred behavior) in terms of relative importance of these values to themselves.</p>
<p>The second tool was the index of 16 alphabetically ordered professional values produced from the Ethical Codes of the ICM<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0969733011433921">10</xref>
</sup> by the researchers. Each value is followed by a short definition. Participants were asked to order the values from 1 to 16 in the same manner. Additionally, the students were also asked to grade 16 professional values as very significant, significant, less significant, and insignificant.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0969733011433921">
<title>Data analysis</title>
<p>The findings were analyzed by SPSS for Windows. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze the demographic variables. Mean and standard deviations were calculated for each value in the questionnaire. The relationship between the year of study and value ranking was analyzed by Kruskal–Wallis test. The results (as displayed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0969733011433921">Tables 1</xref> to <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0969733011433921">3</xref>) are given in a ranked mean order for easing the evaluation.</p>

<p>A total of 192 students (response rate = 80%), all female, participated in the study, and the mean age was 20.95 ± 1.86 years (range = 18–30 years). Of those, 68 (35.4%) were first-year students, 57 (29.3%) were second-year students, 32 (16.7%) were third-year students, and 35 (18.2%) were fourth-year students. Three students were married and one had a child. Seventy one (37%) students were living in a shared house, 53 (27.6%) were living in dorms, 45 (23.4%) were living with their parents, and 23 (12%) were living alone. Of the respondents, the reasons for choosing to study midwifery were (a) love for the profession (n = 65; 33.9%), (b) high possibility of employment (n = 59; 30.7%), (c) the scores obtained from the university entrance exam (n = 38; 19.8%), (d) a desire to help people (n = 18; 9.4%), and (e) to please family members (n = 12; 6.3%).</p>

<title>Professional values</title>
<p>
<italic>Justice</italic>, <italic>equality</italic>, and <italic>human dignity</italic> were ordered as the first three professional values by midwifery students, while <italic>competence</italic>, <italic>autonomy</italic>, and <italic>cooperation</italic> took the last three places (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0969733011433921">Table 3</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Study cases were limited by the size of the study sample and did not include all the midwifery students in Turkey. Despite the limitations of this study, it was encouraging that many midwifery students had made a positive choice to enter the midwifery profession giving reasons such as good outlook for employability, love for the profession, and a desire to help people. This result is particularly striking in the light of the fact that midwifery has still not completed its professionalization process in Turkey.</p>
<p>
<italic>Family security</italic> was ranked first in the order of personal terminal values among midwifery students. This value was also ranked first in studies carried out with the university students in non-health related areas in Turkey<sup>

</sup>, and in studies carried out with nurses and nursing students in Israel and Lituania.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0969733011433921">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0969733011433921">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0969733011433921">20</xref>
</sup> This result was interpreted by Rassin to imply that nursing was a preferred professional choice for people who are particularly concerned about safety.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0969733011433921">16</xref>
</sup> However, family security was also ranked first in the studies carried out among different study groups, so it is difficult to see nursing students as in any way out of the ordinary. In the present study, priority for <italic>family security</italic> and <italic>salvation</italic> values decreased as the years of study increased, as observed in studies performed with students in other fields too.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0969733011433921">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0969733011433921">21</xref>
</sup> In ranking personal instrumental values, <italic>honesty</italic> ranked first and <italic>obedience</italic> ranked last as reported in the first and last three values by many studies.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0969733011433921">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0969733011433921">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0969733011433921">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0969733011433921">21</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>It is quite difficult to draw conclusions that are specific to midwifery from these rankings and the way in which they change. However, ranking and changes related to the midwifery profession were noted in the personal value orders of students. For instance, the value <italic>responsibility</italic> ranked second in the order of personal instrumental values for midwifery students but was not generally among the privileged values in studies conducted with other student groups<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0969733011433921">18</xref>
</sup> even though it was among the initial values in studies performed with nurse professionals.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0969733011433921">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0969733011433921">20</xref>
</sup> <italic>Cleanliness,</italic> the value ranked fifth by midwifery students, was among the lowest ranking values in the studies implemented with students in nonhealth-related areas in Turkey,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0969733011433921">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0969733011433921">18</xref>
</sup> as well as among student and professional nurses in other countries.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0969733011433921">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0969733011433921">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0969733011433921">21</xref>
</sup> It is pleasing that midwifery students prioritized <italic>responsibility</italic> and <italic>cleanliness</italic> among their personal values, which are of central importance for their study and profession of midwifery.</p>
<p>The importance of <italic>equality</italic> as a value in terminal value order increased with the years of study. This result suggested that emphasis on <italic>equality</italic> from the beginning of the midwifery education program, and in the oath of midwifery (the oath was approved by Kocaeli University High Health School Administrative Council at 15 June 2001 with the decision number of 05/12), can have an effect on the order of students’ personal values. Moreover, <italic>justice</italic> and <italic>equality</italic> were the first two values in the professional value ranking, and students also found them as the most important. Emphasis on justice as a value increased with the years of study, which suggests that having the opportunity to observe discriminatory behavior in a health-care setting causes students to give increasing priority to equality and justice.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0969733011433921">22</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Students ranked <italic>professional loyalty</italic> fifth, seeing it as a very important value. This may be as a result of the emphasis on professional loyalty within the education program. Midwifery is one of the oldest health professions; however, its professionalism process is rather slow.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0969733011433921">23</xref>
</sup> Midwifery education is still in a transition period supported by nurse teachers in Turkey. Its professionalism process should be completed with the participation of midwifery students. In this context, the importance given by students to professional loyalty as a value is significant as it indicates participation by students in the professionalism.</p>
<p>By contrast, students gave the values <italic>competence</italic>, <italic>autonomy</italic>, and <italic>cooperation</italic> much lower ranking. For example, <italic>competence</italic> and <italic>autonomy</italic>, both values particularly emphasized in the teaching of theoretical ethics, were ranked lowest by students in all classes. Moreover, <italic>autonomy</italic>, meaning “respecting the autonomy of women and encouraging them to improve their autonomy” was felt not to be important by 6.8% of the students. This result was disturbing since the midwife is the most available health professional for women especially in rural areas. According to the Turkish Demographic and Health Survey (TDHS), “women mostly conform to traditional values and men’s expectations and this situation was more common in rural areas and Eastern Region where women had over five children and were uneducated or educated to primary school level.” For instance, 20% of the women did not work because their spouse or family did not allow them to, 69% of the married women aged between 15 and 49 years did not go out without permission, and 25% thought that their spouse could legitimately use violence for such reasons as unnecessary spending, burning a meal, or neglecting housework.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0969733011433921">24</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>There could be three reasons behind the disregard by midwifery students of <italic>autonomy</italic> as a value. First, midwifery students are all female and must be seen in the context of Turkish society. Second, as argued by Gilligan, men focus on such values as autonomy, justice, and objectivity, while women focus on the details of interpersonal relations in the cases (cited in Mappes and DeGrazia).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0969733011433921">25</xref>
</sup> Therefore, the reason women gave <italic>autonomy</italic> such a low ranking might be that they perceived it to be a masculine value and therefore not particularly relevant to them. Third, midwifery could not demonstrate itself as an independent profession despite the independent roles of midwives.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0969733011433921">23</xref>
</sup> Midwives in Turkey mostly depend on nurses for their education and on doctors as managers. This idea was supported by the fact that <italic>competence</italic>, including the provision of independent services, was also ranked among the least important values in the present study. For this reason, competencies including professional values should be determined by Association of Turkish Midwives and a midwifery education curriculum developed to help students become fully competent, safe, and reliable practitioners.</p>
<p>The findings of our study indicated that merely determining and earning the appropriate competencies could not be adequate preparation for students entering the clinical environment.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0969733011433921">4</xref>
</sup> For instance, <italic>cooperation</italic> as a value was ranked more highly by the senior students, and <italic>prevention of unnecessary suffering</italic> and <italic>maintaining privacy</italic> were ranked significantly lower by the fourth-year students. The priority of <italic>cooperation</italic> could be attributed to the fact that fourth-year students made their independent internships and stayed in the same unit for long periods of time. In addition, it is disturbing that the ranking of <italic>prevention of unnecessary suffering</italic> and <italic>maintaining privacy</italic>, which are important for all health disciplines including midwifery, went down significantly.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0969733011433921">9</xref>
</sup> This demonstrates the difference between the ideal midwife in theory and in the real world.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0969733011433921">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0969733011433921">26</xref>
</sup> This result, along with an apparent lack of clinical attentiveness witnessed by some fourth-year students in practice placements,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0969733011433921">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0969733011433921">22</xref>
</sup> suggested that routine delivery of care could be misinterpreted by students. For instance, Siegler reported the finding that one patient could have interactions with 75 different people in a hospital, all of whom were in some way responsible for care or support. Studies carried out with doctors and patients found that it was considered acceptable to share patient records in social and professional environments.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0969733011433921">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0969733011433921">27</xref>
</sup> Such examples suggested that students might find themselves becoming desensitized to infringements of privacy. Therefore it is particularly important to ensure midwifery students receive comprehensive clinical ethics education about sensitive issues before they will be exposed to poor ethical practices in clinics.</p>

<sec id="section12-0969733011433921">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Study results demonstrated that students who are concerned with being <italic>responsible</italic> and <italic>clean</italic> are more likely than other students to prefer midwifery as a subject for study. Results also showed that the ranking of both professional values and of personal values were changed by the process of education. With this in mind, it would be useful to determine the core competencies, including professional values, that should be included within an education program and to review how all educational programs approach this topic. Gaining the support and cooperation of the Association of Turkish Midwives will be important in this process.</p>
<p>However, dramatic decreases in emphasis laid on ethical values in the clinical situation indicates the need to prepare students for their ideals to be challenged in the workplace, and to support them during periods in the clinical area. For this reason, more robust ethical teaching (both theoretical and applied) should be available throughout the entirety of midwifery courses. In particular, the clinical ethics education and use of case studies in the fourth year should be emphasized rather than the theoretical ethical education given during just one semester in the second or third year of the program. In addition, studies should be carried out to involve professional midwives in finalizing and publishing codes of professional midwifery ethics and arranging opportunities for midwives working across all fields of practice to discuss professional and ethical issues in a way that will help to eliminate the difference between the theory and application.</p>
