<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Tintin, the brainchild of the late cartoonist Georges Remi (better known as Hergé),<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1358229112454797">1</xref></sup> is experiencing new and exciting adventures these days; not just in the cinema, but in Belgian courts as well.</p>
<p>Bienvenu Mbuto Mondondo, a Congolese national studying in Brussels, filed a lawsuit to obtain an injunction against the continued publication, distribution and sale of the comic book <italic>Tintin in the Congo </italic>(<italic>Tintin au Congo</italic>), as well as seeking to have the book withdrawn from bookshops and libraries in Belgium. Mondondo did so on the basis of alleged violations of Belgian anti-racism legislation (the Anti-racism Act).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1358229112454797">2</xref></sup> In subsidiary order he demanded that a disclaimer be printed on the comic’s cover, warning of its offensive nature, along with the inclusion of an introduction of a similar nature. Mondondo was supported in his claims by the minority organisation <italic>Conseil représentatif des associations noires</italic> (Cran).
<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1358229112454797">3</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>On 10 February 2012, the Brussels Court of First Instance rejected all the applicants’ claims. The Court also rejected the counterclaims by Casterman, the series’ publisher, and Moulinsart, the company that was set up to protect and promote the work of Hergé. Both had asked for EUR 15,000 as compensation for ‘vexatious proceedings’.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1358229112454797">
<title>Tintin in the Congo</title>
<p>The comic <italic>Tintin in the Congo</italic> was first published in 1931, a time when Congo was suffering under Belgian colonial rule. The album graphically depicts the Congolese as monkey-like, and portrays them as stupid, childish and lazy. In later years, when a colour version of the album was published, Hergé made several changes to it, partly because he acknowledged that the work was overly influenced by the colonial ideas of its time. In the new version the stereotypical caricatures of the Congolese were rendered somewhat less extreme, for instance. Several textual changes were made as well, and most references to Congo being a Belgian colony were removed.
<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1358229112454797">4</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>The album has regularly been a cause for debate, particularly in the Anglophone world. Because of ongoing controversies it was not published in English until 1991. The colour edition did not even appear until 2005. When finally it was published (by Egmont Publishing), it included a cautionary wrapper indicating that it contained ‘bourgeois, paternalistic stereotypes of the period’ that may be offensive to contemporary readers. The edition also encompassed an introduction providing additional historical contextualisation. Nevertheless, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1358229112454797">2007</xref> the (former)
<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1358229112454797">5</xref></sup> Commission for Racial Equality (CRE) asked the bookstores Borders and Waterstone’s to stop selling the book, in response to a complaint it had received. The CRE stated that the album contained ‘imagery and words of hideous racial prejudice, where the “savage natives” look like monkeys and talk like imbeciles’:
<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1358229112454797">6</xref></sup>
</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>Whichever way you look at it, the content of this book is blatantly racist. High street shops, and indeed any shops, ought to think very carefully about whether they ought to be selling and displaying it. Yes, it was written a long time ago, but this certainly does not make it acceptable. It beggars belief that in this day and age […] any shop would think it acceptable to sell and display ‘<italic>Tintin In The Congo</italic>’. The only place that it might be acceptable for this to be displayed would be in a museum, with a big sign saying ‘old fashioned, racist claptrap’.
<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1358229112454797">7</xref></sup>
</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The bookstores refused to remove the comic from their shelves entirely, but they did move it from the children’s section to the adult section of graphic novels. Other UK retailers now sell <italic>Tintin in the Congo</italic> along with a label stating that it is unsuitable for readers under the age of 16.</p>
<p>In the USA, plans by Little, Brown &amp; Company to publish the colour version were abandoned altogether in 2007, seemingly on account of the controversies in the UK and Belgium. To this day <italic>Tintin in the Congo</italic> remains the only album in the <italic>Tintin</italic> series never to have been published in the USA. Furthermore, some libraries have restricted public access to the album. Brooklyn public library, for instance, has kept the comic under lock and key since 2007, on account of a request by patrons and library employees,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1358229112454797">8</xref></sup> rendering it available only upon request and appointment.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1358229112454797">9</xref></sup> Other controversial works, including Hitler’s <italic>Mein Kampf</italic>, are readily available in the library’s open shelves.</p>

<sec id="section3-1358229112454797">
<title>Analysis of the ruling</title>
<p>Judged by present-day standards, <italic>Tintin in the Congo </italic>is blatantly colonial, highly paternalistic and offensively stereotypical. The question, however, that the Brussels Court had to answer was whether its present-day publication and distribution could be legally prohibited under the anti-racism legislation. The Court rejected this possibility.</p>
<sec id="section4-1358229112454797">
<title>Direct discrimination and harassment</title>
<p>To begin with, the Court rejected the claims that publishing and selling the comic book amount to ‘direct discrimination’ and/or ‘harassment’ in the sense of the Anti-racism Act.</p>
<sec id="section5-1358229112454797">
<title>Direct discrimination</title>
<p>According to the Anti-racism Act, implementing the EU racial equality directive,
<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1358229112454797">10</xref></sup> direct discrimination shall be taken to occur where one person is treated less favourably than another in a comparable situation, on grounds of racial or ethnic origin, in a context that falls within the scope of the Act (articles 4, 6 and 7 of the Antiracism Act).
<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1358229112454797">11</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>The applicants believed the conditions for direct discrimination to have been met by the (continued) publication and sale of a comic book containing humiliating, degrading and offensive ideas about black people.
<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1358229112454797">12</xref></sup> This was claimed to amount to the required ‘less favourable treatment’ compared with others (i.e. white people), thereby resulting in direct discrimination. The Court, however, rejected this claim, stating that the elements brought forth by the applicants simply ‘correspond with the colonial imagination’, and that – given the prevailing ideas at the time – ‘the comic book in dispute does not in any way glorify the colonial atmosphere within which the adventures <italic>Tintin in the Congo </italic>take place’:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>The applicants would have us analyse the comic book ‘<italic>Tintin in the Congo</italic>’, not from the point of view of the colonial imagination, infused with the paternalism that existed at the time of creation of both editions of the comic, but rather in the light of present-day Belgian values, more specifically those concerning equal treatment.
<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-1358229112454797">13</xref></sup>
</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Going along with the applicants’ reasoning, the Court continues, would necessitate that no consideration be given to the statutorily required ‘comparable situation’ (i.e. that of a standard of evaluation contemporaneous with the work). Therefore the Court concluded that direct discrimination did not occur.</p>
<p>For anyone familiar with the concepts of EU discrimination law, both the claims of the applicants and the analysis by the Court are somewhat surprising. Although the Court rightly concluded that direct discrimination did not occur, the reasoning leading to this conclusion seems to entail an overbroad conception of direct discrimination. Direct discrimination cannot arise from the mere publication and (general) sale of a comic book containing (potentially) offensive images and texts, regardless of who is affected or who feels targeted by it.
<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-1358229112454797">14</xref></sup> The concept requires a treatment that directly disadvantages one or more persons, compared with others, on the grounds of their skin colour or ethnicity, in their access to or participation in the societal contexts in which the legislation applies. Such a disadvantageous treatment does not occur <italic>in casu</italic>. A ‘less favourable’ depiction or representation, in a comic, of certain groups compared with others may be offensive but the prohibition of direct discrimination offers no protection against it. The situation would have been different if, for instance, the sale of the comic had been restricted to persons of a certain colour or ethnicity.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1358229112454797">
<title>Colonial representation and contemporary harassment</title>
<p>The Court subsequently rejects the claim that publishing and distributing the comic amounts to ‘harassment’. Harassment is legally defined as ‘unwanted conduct connected to a person’s race or ethnic origin with the purpose or effect of violating the dignity of a person, and of creating an intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive environment’ (articles 4 and 10 of the Anti-racism Act). According to the applicants this definition was also satisfied by the publication and sale of a comic book containing ideas and illustrations that are offensive, degrading and insulting to people on the basis of their ethnic origin or skin colour.
<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-1358229112454797">15</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>In response, the Court stated that neither the album itself nor its dissemination and sale has the <italic>purpose</italic> of violating anyone’s dignity or creating a humiliating or offensive environment. In light of the legal definition of harassment, the question that remained to be answered – according to the Court – was whether it did not have this <italic>effect</italic> either. The Court again answered this in the negative, judging that: </p>
<disp-quote>
<p>The continued sale, in our era, of a comic book created in colonial times, suffused with the ideas and attitudes of its time of creation, cannot be regarded as violating the dignity of a person, or group of persons, protected by the Anti-racism Act.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-1358229112454797">16</xref></sup>
</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is especially so, the Court continues, since the commercialisation of the album is an integral part of the sale of the complete works of Hergé, ‘without there being placed any special value on the comic book in dispute’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-1358229112454797">17</xref></sup> Although the outcome ultimately is that the sale and distribution of <italic>Tintin in the Congo</italic> cannot be prohibited, the Court again seems insufficiently critical of the premise of the applicants’ arguments, which are based on a mistaken idea of what (legally) constitutes harassment. The applicants believed the prohibition of harassment to entail a general ban on all speech or illustrations that are humiliating or offending to people on the basis of their protected characteristics (in this case their skin colour or ethnic origin). This broad interpretation disregards both the language and the spirit of the harassment provision.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-1358229112454797">18</xref></sup> The prohibition of harassment, derived from (and imposed by) European discrimination law,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-1358229112454797">19</xref></sup> was designed to counter forms of person-orientated harassing, pestering and stalking behaviour in the workplace and other societal contexts, such as the provision of goods and services. The prohibition’s aim is to remove immediate barriers and obstacles to societal participation for individuals belonging to protected groups.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-1358229112454797">20</xref></sup> In Belgium, the prohibition of harassment has been extended to cover the entire scope of the anti-racism legislation. However, and this is essential, it still requires the violation of the dignity of one or more <italic>concrete persons</italic>, and not of an abstract group such as ‘the Congolese’ or black people in general. The legal text explicitly refers to ‘a person’: clearly, this language was not intended to cover mediated and impersonal types of ‘group defamation’ by means of the mass media or comic books. It is limited to (anti-)social situations in which someone is the direct and personal object of unwanted conduct with the ‘purpose or effect’ of affecting one’s dignity.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-1358229112454797">21</xref></sup> In no way was this the case here.</p>
<p>Even if one adheres to this strict, person-orientated interpretation of discriminatory harassment, the concept already yields significant tensions with free speech principles.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-1358229112454797">22</xref></sup> However, if one accepts the ‘impersonality’ premise of the applicants – as the Court did – the anti-harassment provision is rendered virtually limitless, amounting to an open-ended prohibition, targeting all speech that somehow ‘violates the dignity of a group’. This would result in unprecedented, and patently unconstitutional, restrictions on the freedom of expression.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1358229112454797">
<title>Tintin and hate speech</title>
<p>A final set of the applicants’ claims was based on the hate speech provisions contained in the Anti-racism Act. This concerns, first, the prohibition of ‘incitement to discrimination, hatred or violence on the basis of colour and ethnic origin’ (article 20 of the Anti-racism Act) and, second, the ban on the ‘dissemination of ideas based on racial superiority or hatred’ (article 21 of the Anti-racism Act). Both provisions are derived from the UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (CERD).</p>
<p>However, their seemingly broad drafting notwithstanding, these provisions are interpreted very restrictively by the Belgian Constitutional Court. Regarding ‘incitement’ the Constitutional Court requires active instigation of third parties to undertake certain actions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-1358229112454797">23</xref></sup> Apparently finding the term ‘hatred’ too vague and subjective in its generic meaning, it even specified that only incitement to hateful <italic>acts</italic> can be considered unlawful, thereby excluding incitement to mere negative attitudes or feelings from the realm of the provision. Finally, the Constitutional Court requires the presence of malicious intent for the incitement clause to be applied.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-1358229112454797">24</xref></sup> In other words, aside from the requirement that, given the content and the context of the words used, the impugned expressions must incite and provoke violence or discrimination, it must also be demonstrated that the latter was the defendant’s conscious and malevolent intention.</p>
<p>Similarly, the prohibition of ‘disseminating racist ideas’ has been construed narrowly by the Constitutional Court. Here too the Court requires special intent. More specifically the dissemination should have as its demonstrable aim to ‘incite to hatred and to advocate and justify discrimination and segregation’ of the targeted group.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-1358229112454797">25</xref></sup> Regarding content, the speech – in order to be prohibited – must be ‘contemptuous, hateful and malicious’; the Court specifies that it particularly targets expressions of ‘classical’ biological racism.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-1358229112454797">26</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>In the light of this, it was unsurprising that the Brussels Court came to the conclusion that (the publication and dissemination of) <italic>Tintin in the Congo</italic> did not meet the standards of the hate speech provisions, and that an injunction could therefore not be justified on that basis. The Court concluded that the claims failed because of the ‘evident absence of the required malicious intent’, both on the part of Hergé and on the part of Casterman and Moulinsart. Having established this, the Court deemed it redundant even to investigate the additional arguments brought forward by the claimants.</p>
<p>This approach, although justified, is somewhat regrettable. At least, it might have been (even) more convincing<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-1358229112454797">27</xref></sup> if the court had <italic>first</italic> assessed whether the contents of the comic were sufficient to meet the threshold level required for the offences, instead of looking exclusively at the required intent. The former is also clearly not the case if one applies the rather strict requirements adopted by the Constitutional Court. Taking this approach would have served to clearly demarcate the space available for free speech, something which the sole reliance on the – inherently subjective – element of intent fails to do.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-1358229112454797">28</xref></sup> This is all the more important since the fundamental problem with the claims is that they would simply open the floodgates for innumerable additional prohibitions, if they were to be allowed. <italic>Tintin in the Congo</italic> is undoubtedly offensive to many people, but, if its contents were brought under the prohibitions of the Anti-racism Act, then an endless list of other works would also wind up in the crosshairs. This is true of most religious books, as well as many of the great literary works, and the writings of virtually all great thinkers of early modernity. Allowing a legal ban on such speech therefore implies the abolition of freedom of expression itself.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1358229112454797">
<title>Counterproductive</title>
<p>All things considered, it is puzzling that the applicants opted to pursue a judicial solution in this case. In doing so, they could only lose. It was clear, from the start, that the comic’s contents – although offensive – did not amount to a violation of the anti-racism legislation; still less would be publishing and distributing it.</p>
<p>Mondondo indicated that at least <italic>Tintin in the Congo</italic> is now the object of debate and discussion, and that he would persevere on account of that ‘success’; he even claimed to be ready to go to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-1358229112454797">29</xref></sup> Mondondo not only appealed against the civil ruling by the Brussels court, but also initiated criminal proceedings against Moulinsart and Casterman. Moreover, in 2009, he extended his case to France as well.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-1358229112454797">30</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Mondondo’s view, however, ignores the counterproductive effects that the legal approach has for his cause. Admittedly, the complaint as well as the ruling has received significant media attention. However, the content of the coverage was predominantly of a negative, or even mocking, character. Precisely <italic>because</italic> Mondondo and the Cran opted for a legal solution, the applicants were routinely portrayed as overly sensitive, ‘politically correct’ and bent on censorship. Even the Centre for Equal Opportunities – the Belgian agency responsible for enforcing the federal discrimination legislation – warned against ‘over-reaction and hyper political correctness’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-1358229112454797">31</xref></sup> In other words, the legal approach has not given rise to the desired critical discussion about the comic itself.</p>
<p>In fact, quite the opposite is the case. First, there have been unintended commercial effects, to say the least. Sales of the album rocketed, following the UK discussion about a ban, by as much as 3800%.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-1358229112454797">32</xref></sup> The comic even jumped temporarily to fifth place in the Amazon bestseller list, from no. 4343, four days earlier. The lawsuit(s) in Belgium had similar effects, causing the French version of the album to temporarily go out of stock.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-1358229112454797">33</xref></sup> Second, and more fundamentally, the lawsuits shut down discussion rather than promoting it, by the aura of legitimacy that the inevitable rejection of the claims and the equally inevitable acquittal yield. These outcomes wrongly suggest, to the general public, that there is nothing wrong with the ideas on which the work is based, whereas in fact these do require critical debate and analysis.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-1358229112454797">34</xref></sup> However, instrumentalising the law and the court system for the purposes of this debate seems both misdirected and counterproductive.</p>

<p>More specifically, the applicants claimed that the unfavourable treatment resulted from ‘the commercialisation of a comic book that propagates offensive, humiliating, and demeaning ideas regarding black people and that stigmatises the African population’ (translation of: ‘la commercialisation de la bande dessinée qui […] “véhicule des idées vexantes, humiliantes, dégradantes à l’égard des prétendues personnes de race noir“ et qu’elle “stigmatise la population africaine” ’). Said ideas more specifically consisted of the following: ‘caricatured graphic representation of African characters, use of the term “negro” in the first edition of the comic, poor command of French by the African characters, propagation of the idea that “the African” delights in idleness and that he is naturally lazy […], the paternalism displayed by Tintin, taking the infantilisation of the African characters to the extreme’ [translation of: ‘représentation graphique caricaturale des personnages africains, utilisation du terme “nègre” dans la première édition de la bande dessinée, mauvaise maîtrise du français par les personnages africains, mise en scène de l’idée selon laquelle l’africain se complait dans l’oisiveté, qu’il es naturellement paresseux […], paternalisme de Tintin qui pousse l’infantilisation des personnages africains à l’extrême’].</p>

<p>This is not to say that verbal and/or written expressions and statements cannot amount to direct discrimination. However, this requires that those statements themselves constitute an unfavourable treatment of one or more persons, compared with others, on the basis of a ground of discrimination, within the scope of the legislation. For instance, one could think of job vacancies or goods and services announcements that expressly (and without valid justification) exclude (or significantly deter) certain categories of persons.

<p>This is not to say that intent should not be an essential precondition for hate speech to be deemed punishable.
