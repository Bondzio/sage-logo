<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Data collected in developing countries to analyze population dynamics, land use change, and topics related to development are often collected in face-to-face interviews at the respondent’s household. Although computer-aided personal interviewing (CAPI) has become more common in developed countries, the most commonly used method for household surveys in developing countries remains paper and pencil interviewing (PAPI; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1525822X11399704">Rosero-Bixby et al. 2005</xref>). PAPI has limitations such as long time lags to enter, evaluate, and process data; the potential loss of surveys; and data entry errors associated with poor handwriting or enumerator error. Advantages include the ability to take notes and make handwritten sketches on the survey, greater certainty about the intention of answers, and a reduced probability of complete data loss as compared to computer entry. CAPI has the potential to address the limitations of the PAPI approach and, with carefully designed implementation, can also mitigate PAPI advantages, thereby increasing data quality.</p>
<p>Data collection in the developing world can be challenging for many reasons, including lack of accurate, updated regional maps, difficult road conditions, and deficient telecommunication networks. These complexities also extend to the management side of this endeavor, as the geographic remoteness of the survey regions often makes it difficult to supervise the enumerators on site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1525822X11399704">Rosero-Bixby et al. 2005</xref>). These problems are compounded when collecting panel data, where the absence of accurate maps, road signs, and house numbers can greatly reduce the probability of identifying the correct household and lead to critical reductions in sample size. Such management issues are, of course, in addition to the typical tasks faced in any household survey, including enumerator training, supervision of the survey teams, addressing data entry errors, and monitoring data transfer error.</p>
<p>This article reviews the CAPI methodology adopted for the fourth wave of a panel survey administered in 2009 in a remote region of the Brazilian Amazon. In this context, the CAPI approach was used to address both the challenges associated with survey administration in developing countries as well as the drawbacks associated with the use of PAPI. More specifically, our approach included the use of ruggedized touch-screen laptops to meet the following objectives: (1) Reduce the time for, and increase the probability of, identifying the correct survey lot; (2) assist with identifying the correct household to interview; (3) reduce data entry and cleaning time; (4) increase confidence in the recorded data; and (5) collect survey meta-data (such as the day and time of the interview).</p>
<p>Previous survey waves implemented in 1996, 2000, and 2005 in Ouro Preto do Oeste, Rondonia, Brazil, relied on PAPI. Changes in methodology midway through a panel can be problematic, especially if there are mode effects resulting in survey bias and/or a reduction in data quality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1525822X11399704">Laurie 2003</xref>). This article describes the implementation of components in the 2009 campaign to facilitate the transition process (from PAPI to CAPI) and maintain panel data integrity. These components include the development of a comprehensive digital survey with skip patterns and over 40 pages of questions (linked to early PAPI survey aims), the development of GIS (Geographic Information Systems) databases and an embedded GPS (Global Positioning System) interface, and the methods for which these components are merged to facilitate survey acquisition.</p>
<p>In the following sections, we show how the use of ruggedized laptops impacted the field campaign from pre-survey preparation, enumerator training, and data analysis. Because of changes in the survey design, survey enumerators, and local conditions that occurred simultaneously with the transition between PAPI and CAPI, it was not possible to test for mode effects on either survey responses or locating households. However, we took advantage of the panel nature of the survey to examine impacts of survey mode on missing item responses and interview times. We also used our experiences with both modes to draw qualitative conclusions about the challenges and benefits associated with the use of CAPI in a developing country setting.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1525822X11399704">
<title>Existing Evidence on CAPI Methods</title>
<p>CAPI methods are not novel, dating back at least to the 1980s; however, the use of laptops for CAPI and large-scale adoption has lagged in developing countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1525822X11399704">Banks and Laurie 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1525822X11399704">Birkett 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1525822X11399704">Childs and Landreth 2006</xref>). In contrast, CAPI is quickly becoming the most widely used survey method in advanced nations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1525822X11399704">Langhaug et al. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1525822X11399704">Tourangeau and Smith 1996</xref>). Even so, the tests of mode effects and other concerns related to the introduction of new methodology are still relatively new (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1525822X11399704">Shirima et al. 2007</xref>). Potential concerns examined in the literature include technical feasibility, respondent acceptance, interviewer acceptance, effects on data quality, and cost (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1525822X11399704">Baker et al. 1995</xref>). Interestingly, several studies of mode effects have found increased reporting related to sensitive topics (such as illegal drug use and sexuality) with computer surveys in developed and developing country settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1525822X11399704">NIMH Collaborative HIV/STD Prevention Trial Group, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1525822X11399704">Langhaug et al. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1525822X11399704">Palen et al. 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1525822X11399704">Van den Brackel et al. 2006</xref>) along with a reduced rate of missing item responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1525822X11399704">Bernabe-Ortiz et al. 2008</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1525822X11399704">Dielman and Couper (1995)</xref> find the keying error rate to be significantly lower (0.10%) for a CAPI survey conducted on a standard laptop with full screen and keyboard as compared to data entry error for PAPI surveys reported in the literature (0.5–6.2%).</p>
<p>Additional technical issues related to the use of the CAPI method include the effect of the hardware on interviews (such as computer size and weight, type of data entry mechanism, battery life, and screen type and/or resolution) and software choices on overall data entry quality. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1525822X11399704">Couper and Groves (1992)</xref> found weight to be the most important hardware factor for interviewers. In tests of several computers, they found the comfortable carrying weight to be up to 7–8 pounds, but this was only 3 pounds for interviews conducted while standing.</p>
<p>Finally, survey time is an issue of concern, as it is related both the hardware and the software components of a CAPI. Some studies have found CAPI surveys to take longer time to complete (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1525822X11399704">Baker et al. 1995</xref>). This is likely to occur if the survey is designed to include only one or a few questions per screen, if the survey requires a large amount of typing, and if there is difficulty reading the computer screen in poor lighting conditions. However, CAPI can have the opposite effect on survey time when interface and survey design considerations are taken into account. These include the use of automatic skips, arithmetic calculations, and complex survey design (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1525822X11399704">Couper 2000</xref>). Thus, rather than mode, it is more likely that equipment selection and survey design determine survey speed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1525822X11399704">Fuchs et al. 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Prior lessons and considerations are relevant to our adopted methodology in several ways. Although some of these issues have been resolved in developed countries, several questions remain unanswered for fieldwork in developing nations. For example, harsh environmental conditions including high temperatures, frequent precipitation, and/or ubiquitous dust and long traverses over difficult terrain necessitate robust hardware requirements and extended battery life. Additionally, less familiarity with computer use can necessitate additional training for enumerators and can make respondent acceptance more difficult. The following sections examine the extent to which these potential challenges present concerns in practice and ways in which they may be overcome.</p>
<p>Compared to PAPI, CAPI offers important potential advantages related to data entry and response analysis. Advantages include a reduction of missed data (because the survey can be managed with skip patterns and required fields), checks that can be included on data type ensuring that the correct format and type are used for answers, and filters and rosters that can be administered with ease (these can be difficult to implement and are often prone to error on paper surveys). In addition, second-source data entry error is eliminated, complex survey designs are possible, information about the data collection process can be obtained from these results (such as time spent on each section), and post-survey data reports can be administered throughout the survey process to identify problematic questions, outliers, and incorrect responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1525822X11399704">Rosero-Bixby et al. 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1525822X11399704">Gravlee et al. 2006</xref>). As with the potential challenges associated with the use of CAPI, we consider the extent to which these benefits can be achieved in an actual survey setting in the developing world.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1525822X11399704">
<title>Choice of Hardware and Software</title>
<p>To date, few surveys utilizing the CAPI approach have been reported in developing regions, and of these, most have been conducted with hand-held computers often called PDAs (personal data assistants; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1525822X11399704">Jaspan et al. 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1525822X11399704">Seebregts et al. 2009</xref>). These are often the chosen instruments because of cost, size, and weight constraints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1525822X11399704">Bernabe-Ortiz et al. 2008</xref>). Comparably, laptop computers tend to be more expensive, are often at a greater risk for theft, have battery limitations, and are believed to be less reliable and durable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1525822X11399704">Rosero-Bixby et al. 2005</xref>). However, the advent of ruggedized laptops, designed for extreme conditions (albeit with increased expense) are equally (if not more) reliable and durable. And, for complex survey designs, these larger screens can be a significant advantage over PDAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1525822X11399704">Childs and Landreth 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>The ruggedized touch-screen laptops adopted for a fourth wave of our survey panel were equipped with a computer-based survey as well as a GPS receiver, and GIS software including spatial data layers (e.g., roads and survey sample locations). These hardware and software components helped identify household locations (reducing travel time to homes) and the correct household members to interview (by including survey data collected in previous rounds). In addition, the computerized survey permitted the creation of daily error reports used to identify and reduce data entry errors early in the survey process and to identify insular instances throughout the field campaign. The following section elaborates on how hardware and software components were coordinated to meet our research goals.</p>
<sec id="section4-1525822X11399704">
<title>Computer Hardware</title>
<p>Twelve Panasonic Toughbook 19 Touchscreen PC laptop computers equipped with an onboard GPS receiver were purchased for approximately $3,700 each. These computers functioned as both a classic notebook with keyboard and a touch-screen tablet PC and were fully rugged. They were, therefore, designed for use in extreme levels of humidity, dust, heat, cold, and vibration, and the optimized display technology ensured excellent clarity of display even in bright ambient light (in our case, associated with a tropical location in the dry season).</p>
<p>We based the decision to use ruggedized laptops on the following criteria:<list list-type="order">

<sec id="section5-1525822X11399704">
<title>Computer Software</title>
<p>Each field computer’s basic software suite was supplemented with two application-specific packages. Environmental Systems Research Institute’s (ESRI) ArcPad software was installed and a map project was loaded that displayed the study region’s infrastructure. This project included paved and unpaved roads, symbology for town centers, and shaded polygons representing each landholder’s lot within the survey region. Real-time GPS was activated when the map project was opened, enabling interviewers to navigate to survey lot locations and confirm their correct interview site. In addition, the survey and page layouts were designed using WAMP software (a package comprised of Windows, Apache, MySQL, and PHP [or Perl or Python]) with computer screen size in mind. Each page was designed using the same format template, including color and font choices and two icons were repeated on the bottom right corner of each page: (1) an arrow to move forward and backward in the survey and (2) a notes icon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1525822X11399704">Figure 1</xref>
). This notes function allowed enumerators to explain and/or elaborate on an answer to address any problems occurring in the survey process. The laptops had standard keyboards, but most interviewers preferred to use them in tablet form, using the touch screen and stylus only. In these cases, a pop-up keyboard was used to enter notes and alphanumeric fields.</p>

<title>Study Site and Previous Data Collection</title>
<p>The survey region, greater Ouro Preto do Oeste, is located in central Rondônia, an Amazonian state in southwestern Brazil along the border of Bolivia. The sample of farmers was originally drawn in 1996 on a systematic random stratified basis, using colonization agency maps (i.e., Instituto Nacional de Colonizacao e Reforma Agraria [INCRA]) as a sampling frame for each municipality. A longitudinal sample was maintained in 2000 by revisiting each of the original lots and expanded in 2005 and 2009 by revisiting these same lots, tracking households that had moved within the study region, and expanding the original sampling frame to ensure representation of the population and new settlements within the survey region. Because of low literacy rates, all interviews (in each survey wave) were conducted orally. Introductions and permission to conduct the interview were administered according to the same process in each survey year.</p>
<p>In 1996 and 2000, one surveyor conducted all interviews using PAPI and an official INCRA paper map to locate households. Addresses and surveyors names obtained in 1996 were used to facilitate this process in 2000 to ensure the same lots and household members were interviewed in both years. In 2005, several changes were made both to the format of the questionnaire and the survey process. In this year, six enumerators were hired to administer the survey. An updated paper map, derived from the INCRA base map and including interview locations from 1996 and 2000 addresses and GPS points, was used to assist with navigating roads and locating lots. Pre-survey pages, including the household roster and photos from the previous survey year (2000), were printed and attached to the front of each new survey. These pages functioned in much the same way as the pre-filled and feed-forward questions in the electronic survey used in 2009.</p>
<p>In 2009, 12 trained interviewers conducted surveys; six of them were hired from universities throughout Brazil and the other six lived in the local area. The interviewers were paired into six teams (each team had one university intern and one local resident) to maximize the strengths of these individuals, including local knowledge of the region and roads and university experience with computers. A similar sampling process was followed in this year: Households tracked in 2005 continued in the sample, and households relocated since 2005 were tracked to new locations when possible. Feed-forward pages with data and photos collected in 2005 helped identify properties and individuals. Real-time GPS navigation with highlighted lots and roads was significantly more useful in finding households compared to the paper maps and photos used in previous survey waves. Similar to GPS units used in cars, these laptops would indicate current (real-time) location on the survey region map with a blinking dot. With information on current location, survey teams could accurately estimate distance to the next assigned lot and use the system to navigate roads.</p>
<sec id="section7-1525822X11399704">
<title>Survey Administration</title>
<p>Having the laptops changed almost every aspect of survey administration as compared to previous PAPI rounds. We increased the amount of time devoted to training by over 100% (from 2 to 5 full days), altered the ways in which households were located, changed the daily debriefing to include stations for data backup and reviewing bug reports, and changed the way in which the spatial data were collected. Further detail on these changes is provided below.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1525822X11399704">
<title>Training</title>
<p>Training occurred at the central headquarters in the municipality of Ouro Preto do Oeste (the center of the survey region). The majority of the survey team members held at least an associate’s degree, but the six local residents had minimal computer experience compared to the hired university students who had experience with word processing, spreadsheets, and media programs. All interviewers completed 5 days of intensive training, followed by 2 days of supervised interviewing, before beginning independent data collection. Training was conducted in several phases to emphasize the individual components of the survey, including the digital entry of data and the collection of a GPS point at each survey location. The training program included hands on practice with the survey, a survey region map, and a laptop computer to acquire skills needed to identify the lots to be interviewed and navigate the difficult and irregular local roads. As such, each step of the interview was explained in a training manual, orally, and through practical exercises. Throughout this training process, a team of researchers was available to update the survey to address technical issues, interviewer concerns, typos, and changes in phrasing and/or survey language. Researchers followed each interviewer pair for the first 2 field days to answer questions, address any technological problems, and monitor progress.</p>
<p>In previous years, training was solely focused on the survey process. Training was expanded to include methods for data entry, lessons on how to back up data (a flash drive was placed in the laptop at the time of the survey and backup was automatically created when the last page of the survey was completed), and processes to debug software problems along with general computer maintenance and care.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1525822X11399704">
<title>Daily Management Processes</title>
<p>Each morning, interview assignments were distributed to the teams, including addresses and prior contact and personal information (i.e., from 2005). At the completion of each work day, the survey teams would drop off equipment, do a debriefing about the day, and receive feedback about data collected during the previous day. This process was executed via three stations established each evening at headquarters. These were Station 1—equipment drop off; Station 2—mapping and information exchange; and Station 3—data quality control.</p>
<p>Teams first reported to Station 1 where all equipment was dropped off, including the flash drives with back-up survey data, digital cameras, laptops, and back-up laptop batteries. Data downloaded from these laptops included the survey data and GPS position files. GPS data were examined for quality control and compared to a master hardcopy map on which interviewers and survey team administrators verified that surveys were completed at the proper locations. Survey data were merged and backed up to secure the data on a daily basis. All equipment was left overnight with the management team for troubleshooting and recharging as necessary.</p>
<p>Station 2 was set up for transferring local information between enumerators and the research team. This station was equipped with a master wall-sized paper map identical to the GIS map layers contained on the laptops. Interviewers were debriefed each night by the research team to determine the lots interviewed, whether lot information had changed since 2005 (e.g., abandonment, aggregation, or subdivision), and the current road/bridge conditions.</p>
<p>Station 3 focused on data analysis and quality control, using the following three processes: (1) check for potential errors in data collected; (2) elicit correct information from the interviewers; and (3) correct errors in data. Once all the survey data (collected at Station 1) were merged, error reports were run, providing nearly instantaneous feedback. This turnaround provided the opportunity to discuss problematic responses with the surveyors. The main error checks included missing values, outliers in total or relative values, and illogical or inconsistent values (e.g., more than 12 months in a year or greater amounts of crops sold than harvested). Although these checks could have been automated in the initial survey design, most were not programmed because of our short adoption time frame. Results from these daily error reports were discussed and acted on in the same evening and/or following morning prior to the next data collection event.</p>
<p>In comparison to surveys conducted in previous years, two of the three stations were largely altered. Activities performed at Station 2 were similar to those completed in 2005. However, the equipment collection and data retrieval each day at Station 1 represented additional administrative overhead resulting from the use of CAPI. Station 3 simplified data processing relative to previous survey waves in that data quality was monitored on a daily basis. In prior PAPI rounds, only a small subsample of the survey could be entered on site because of time constraints. General problems were noted from these subsamples, but a complete analysis of the individual and combined data was not possible. Most data were entered post-survey (and therefore at a slower pace relative to the CAPI system), thus clarification from the specific interviewer was impossible. The analysis performed daily in 2009 simplified error checking, thus enabling immediate clarification from enumerators, which we believe resulted in improved data accuracy.</p>

<title>Evaluation</title>
<p>Because of the short implementation time frame allotted to the development of the digital survey, and thus the inability to develop two separate protocols, we used the touch-screen laptops for all surveys. The laptops were purchased with supplemental funds acquired only 2 months prior to the field campaign. Given the need for the survey management team to design the survey questions, learn the survey programming languages (to edit the survey on site when necessary), and develop a training program for the use of the laptops, there was no time to develop a similar strategy for a PAPI. With the notable exception of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1525822X11399704">Caeyers et al. (2009)</xref>, such trade-offs appear to be common with grand scale survey changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1525822X11399704">Laurie 2003</xref>). As a result, we do not have a comparison group with which to test for mode effects. However, the panel nature of the study provides the means to compare missing data (i.e., nonresponses) and learning curve effects for the surveys administered in 2005 and 2009. Yet, because of substantial changes in the survey design and length, survey team composition, road network, and use of different maps (i.e., paper vs. GPS/GIS) that occurred between this third and fourth wave of the panel, we cannot test improvements in data quality and/or temporal advantages with a comparison of 2005 and 2009 responses.</p>
<sec id="section11-1525822X11399704">
<title>Nonresponse</title>
<p>Nonresponse rates are low in both 2005 and 2009 and do not vary significantly between the 2 years for any particular category of information (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1525822X11399704">Table 1</xref>
). Nor are they consistently higher or lower for any particular question type. Overall, the comparison suggests that mode effects on response rates are minimal, implying that enumerators’ thoroughness in asking questions and respondents’ willingness to answer were not affected by the use of laptops. One caveat to this assertion is that CAPI allows certain questions to be made compulsory (as is the case for the macro survey data reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1525822X11399704">Table 1</xref> and other questions not included in this table). Because of the short survey design time frame, we implemented this feature to a limited extent in 2009 for certain questions but were not able to add more sophisticated requirements that made specific responses contingent on others. Given additional development time and resources, more of these question types could be required, potentially leading to a more substantial impact on response rates.</p>

<title>Survey Time and Learning Effects</title>
<p>Although we cannot test for differences in survey time for the PAPI (administered in 2005) and CAPI surveys (administered in 2009) because of changes in the survey length and design, we are able to compare changes in survey time by week to investigate learning effects as well as compare variability in survey time by interviewer to infer mode effects. The survey increased in size by 63%, from 619 questions to 1,009 from 2005 to 2009, although this was not accompanied by an equal increase in the time needed to complete the survey (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1525822X11399704">Table 2</xref>
). This suggests that the use of CAPI may have reduced survey time. We expected that the CAPI survey would exhibit a greater reduction in survey time between weeks 1 and 2 as enumerators learned and adapted to the new technology. However, the similar rate of change exhibited between CAPI and PAPI survey waves suggests that the training period and methods utilized in 2009 adequately familiarized enumerators with the technology thereby equalizing learning curve effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1525822X11399704">Figure 2</xref>
). Finally, variation in survey time is significantly greater for the CAPI survey, but the variances for the two surveyors involved on both years exhibit no significant differences. In sum, we find few, if any, significant mode effects attributable to the move from PAPI to CAPI for this panel. This is likely because of the data checking methods and oversight utilized throughout the PAPI and CAPI field campaigns. In both cases, data were checked on a daily basis, surveyors were accompanied by management members as often as possible, and questions were raised and answered at regular meetings attended by the managing staff and enumerators.</p>

<title>Objectives</title>
<p>CAPI surveys can be administered via laptops, PDAs, tablet PCs, and ruggedized touch-screen laptops. Our team had specific objectives driving the transition to CAPI. Some of these were met by the move from paper to computers, but others were only met because of the use of touch screens (or tablet PCs), with further benefits linked to the rugged nature of the computers. The following details how each of the key objectives was met.</p>
<sec id="section14-1525822X11399704">
<title>Objective 1: Increase Confidence in Recorded Data</title>
<p>Methods undertaken both pre- and post-survey enabled data checking at multiple levels. As part of the survey design, skip patterns and data-checking protocols were included to ensure that respondents’ entered in numeric values were appropriate and did not skip required questions. The feasibility and efficiency of data transfer made it possible for research administrators to conduct on-site error reports to isolate problematic questions, persistent errors, and outliers.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-1525822X11399704">
<title>Objective 2: Increase the Probability of Identifying the Correct Lot and Reduce Travel Time</title>
<p>The integration of real-time GPS technology and GIS software on the ruggedized laptops enabled the creation of a map project to facilitate lot identification and travel time. The map project (constructed in ArcPad) enabled survey teams to better identify the shortest route to a desired lot and subsequent routes to proximate survey targets, and the real-time navigation enabled the survey teams to identify their current location relative to the survey lots marked on the map. The importance of a basic base map of labeled infrastructure was critical, given the lack of consistent signage at road intersections and the lack of addresses displayed on households in the survey region. This was especially important because of the extension of interview locations to survey region peripheries and the lack of familiarity of these areas even by the local surveyors. In prior years, extended time was spent in conversation with neighbors to determine directions to specific households (and their current location relative to these destinations).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-1525822X11399704">
<title>Objective 3: Identifying the Correct Household to Interview</title>
<p>This was particularly important for maintaining the survey panel and was accomplished through the development of pre-survey questions, including pre-filled fields with photos and demographic information from previous survey waves.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-1525822X11399704">
<title>Objective 4: Reduce Data Entry and Cleaning Time</title>
<p>All enumerators were supplied with paper surveys in the case of equipment malfunction or failure. However, equipment reliability and appropriate interview training led to the use of a paper survey in only one case, greatly reducing the time required for data entry. Additionally, substantial data cleaning was completed on site, as errors were identified by the bug reports. Survey teams’ notes related to errors and embedded within the digital surveys were later used to correct errors and address questions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-1525822X11399704">
<title>Objective 5: Collecting Survey Meta-Data</title>
<p>Our final objective, the collection of survey meta-data, was met through survey design. Temporal information on survey start and finish along with the specific interviewer was automated. This information was particularly important in deciphering the more complicated cases in which GPS points were not obviously linked to surveys. This problem arose when interviewers incorrectly entered the survey ID number when taking a GPS point. The date and time of the survey along with the interviewer ID made these matches possible and spatial data entry errors correctable.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The large-scale adoption of touch-screen laptops for CAPI has lagged relative to the introduction of CAPI methods in the literature, especially for survey work in the developing world. This is likely to change as the cost of these laptops falls. For example, the World Bank–sponsored Living Standards Measurement Study-Integrated Surveys on Agriculture (LSMS-ISA) project will support the development of a standardized CAPI system for implementation in the second round of data collection as part of the ongoing Uganda National Panel Survey in 2010/11 (World Bank 2010). Although there are limited studies on the impacts of CAPI tools on data quality, several studies suggest that CAPI can result in improvements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1525822X11399704">Caeyers et al. 2009</xref>)<bold>—</bold>or at least not reductions in data quality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1525822X11399704">Birkett 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1525822X11399704">Laurie 2003</xref>) and that interviewers adjust to them relatively quickly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1525822X11399704">Couper and Burt 1994</xref>). Our experience with CAPI in the Brazilian Amazon confirms prior findings and shows that use of CAPI can result in gains in data quality relative to the traditional PAPI approach, while reducing on-site oversight of the survey teams.</p>
<p>This article contributes to the literature on CAPI approaches in three ways. First, we describe methods in which touch-screen laptops can contribute to surveying in the developing world and add to CAPI equipment choice. In addition to the larger screens, ruggedized laptops are more versatile than PDAs, functioning as laptops, tablets, and GPSs. Second, through the analysis of missing data and learning effects of the enumerators, we analyze, but do not find, mode effects. We believe the lack of mode effects results from the extensive training undertaken by the enumerators, the large degree of early field oversight, and the daily data-checking process that occurred under both the PAPI and the CAPI survey waves. The use of CAPI can reduce the number of questionable or missing responses and can help enumerators avoid a large number of other potential errors. It also appears that oversight and daily review (which are time intensive) can be substituted by automatic checks. Therefore, in projects with large survey teams where such extensive daily oversight is not possible, CAPI is likely to provide the potential to make greater improvements in data quality. Finally, we draw on our experiences of both modes to draw qualitative conclusions about the challenges and benefits associated with the use of CAPI in a developing country.</p>
<p>Conducting field research in the developing world, especially in locations with extreme levels of dust, humidity, and temperature and precipitation place heavy burdens on electronic equipment. The integration of ruggedized laptops into the CAPI process greatly reduced the risk of equipment malfunction because these particular units have been specially designed to function in harsh environments. There were no instances of equipment failure or malfunction during the 5-week field season. The electronic storage of surveys also enables efficient data transfer, which further increases the security of the data and reduces the likelihood of data loss. Data were merged on a daily basis and backed up securely in several locations. Although battery life was not as significant a constraint as anticipated, it remains true that the interview teams must have a way to recharge the batteries daily, given present temporal limitations. Likewise, to take advantage of centralized data storage and checking, the field headquarters must support use of multiple computers, an energy-intensive requirement. Another potential problem includes the security of the equipment in a relatively low income and transient area (i.e., located adjacent to a major highway). Our headquarters, a small hotel and nearby rented house, were relatively secure, with an overnight attendant, locked gate, and paid security guard. No robberies or related incidents were noted at headquarters or in the field during the data collection process.</p>
<p>One often-cited benefit of CAPI is that data entry by a second party is not required, thereby enabling rapid data availability and a significant reduction in labor hours. However, these benefits must be evaluated against the considerable time required to develop a functional and facile digital survey. Survey preparation costs should not be underestimated. If design and development are not contracted to a software engineer, this requires a research team with substantial knowledge of software and survey design. The skills of the on-site research team should be carefully considered before undertaking such a methodological change. In our case, it was necessary for at least three of the management team members to master the programming languages used to run the survey and that the full team knew how to administer and trouble shoot the survey to assist with training, data downloads, and supervised interviewing (which continued throughout the field campaign). Additionally, team members with substantial GIS/GPS knowledge were required to maintain, update, and trouble shoot mapping software issues as they arose. Skilled data managers with survey software experience (or the time to learn) are therefore necessary additions to the team.</p>
<p>Overall, our experience indicates that the use of the laptops was highly successful, given the improvement of both the critical spatial and the temporal components of our panel survey. Several elements of our methodology would simply not have been possible without the use of a CAPI system including the GPS/GIS system to navigate roads and identify interview locations, the use of pre-filled and feed-forward pages based on data collected in the most recent prior survey wave, and the generation of data checks both during and post-survey. Hardware and software systems remained stable throughout the 6-week field campaign and performed admirably, given the frequency of use and challenging environmental conditions. Hardware and software problems were infrequent and in each case were corrected prior to the following day’s data collection. Moreover, the dynamic nature of the GIS-based map project enabled a new (additional) stratified random sample to be generated in one afternoon and evening for incorporation into the following day’s interview assignments. This process would have not been possible in such a short period of time with the PAPI method. Battery life and recharge times were the weakest links in our technologically dependent campaign, but we were fortunate in that we experienced few power outages and/or interruptions during evening recharge periods. Although initial hardware costs and software learning curves were high, these costs will be offset in future survey rounds, given the ease of survey and GIS modification and the use of existing equipment and expertise.</p>
