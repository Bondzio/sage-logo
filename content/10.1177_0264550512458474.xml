<title>Introduction</title>
<p>This article discusses the Coalition Government’s proposals to commission probation services<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0264550512458474">1</xref>
</sup> from providers in the private, voluntary and public sectors and to move to a system of paying providers ‘by results’. It sets these proposals in the context of related moves to open up the criminal justice market made by previous governments and in wider developments in social policy and public sector reform. Debates about the marketization of public services and whether punishment can ever be a proper source of private profit are taking place in a number of jurisdictions (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0264550512458474">Teague, 2011</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0264550512458474">Ploeg and Sandlie, 2011</xref> for contrasting perspectives) but the focus of this article is on developments in England and Wales.</p>
<p>The National Offender Management Service (NOMS) defines offender services commissioning as:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>The cycle of assessing the needs of courts, offenders, defendants, victims and communities then designing, securing and monitoring services to meet those needs, while making best use of total available resources. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0264550512458474">NOMS, 2011</xref>: 3)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Whilst this definition is explicit about the link between commissioning and resources, the intention to commission services from the private and voluntary sectors as well as the public sector is implicit here but stated clearly elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0264550512458474">Ministry of Justice, 2011b</xref>).</p>
<p>The article draws on the literature about the relationship between the probation service and voluntary sector since the partnership initiatives of the early 1990s setting this alongside current policy initiatives and practice experience. It identifies a number of themes that emerge from the changing balance between public, private and voluntary sectors and suggests that these can be used to guide responses to new arrangements for service delivery. The Government’s proposals spell change for both the probation service as an organization and for the content and nature of probation services. The article concludes that all schemes intended to reduce re-offending depend on access for offenders to community resources such as jobs, homes and health services, all more scarce in tough economic times. Despite concerns about fragmentation in service delivery and further disadvantage for some groups of offenders, good practice is most likely to emerge if attention is paid to diversity, the development of local links and alliances and staff training and supervision.</p>

<title>A very brief history of probation and partnership</title>
<p>Whilst the current Government’s proposals for commissioning and competition mark a change in the balance between public, private and voluntary sectors in the provision of probation services, they certainly do not represent the beginning of this process. The probation service has its roots in the voluntary sector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0264550512458474">Nellis, 2007</xref>) and throughout the 20th century, voluntary sector organizations have contributed to work with offenders in the community. Some of the activities originally located in the voluntary sector were, with the establishment of the welfare state, subsumed by an expanding public sector, for example the work of the Discharged Prisoner’s Aid Societies became the after-care responsibility of the probation service in the 1960s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0264550512458474">Rumgay, 2007a</xref>). Much of the work of the voluntary sector in the latter part of the 20th century can be categorized as supplementary to the business of the state, with examples of projects in areas such as mentoring, sports, theatre and the visual arts.</p>
<p>The rise of new public management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0264550512458474">Clarke, Gewirtz and McLaughlin, 2000</xref>) and the associated polices of the Conservative Government of the 1980s brought a significant change to the relationship between public, private and voluntary sectors across all areas of social policy. The political argument held that the role of the state was not to provide services that could be more effectively and cheaply delivered in the private or voluntary sector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0264550512458474">Senior, Crowther-Dowey and Long, 2007</xref>). As a result, much work in areas such as social housing and adult social care came to be delivered by the voluntary or private sectors under contract to local authorities and an internal market was created in the National Health Service.</p>
<p>The Conservative Government’s proposals for change in the probation service were heralded both in a series of discussion papers published in the early 1990s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0264550512458474">Home Office, 1990a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0264550512458474">Home Office, 1990b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0264550512458474">Home Office, 1992</xref>) and the creation of the Supervision Grants Scheme under which the Home Office directly funded local ‘independent sector’<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0264550512458474">2</xref>
</sup> projects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0264550512458474">Rumgay, 2007b</xref>). The discussion documents argued that the probation service must not view itself as the sole resource for work with offenders in the community. Providers from the voluntary and private sectors were seen to be able to offer innovation, specialist knowledge and value for money. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0264550512458474">Home Office (1990a</xref>) summarized the position in this way:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>Probation officers must see themselves less as exclusive providers of services and facilities, and more as managers of supervision programmes. They must make greater use of the skills and experience of the voluntary and private sectors.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Partnership work was necessary to ensure the greater use of community sentences. The Government concluded the consultation period with a decision paper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0264550512458474">Home Office, 1992</xref>) that located responsibility for developing partnership work with local probation services and required them to allocate 5 per cent of their revenue budgets to partnership schemes.</p>
<p>There is evidence that these changes were not universally welcomed by the probation service. This contracting out of work was seen, not as partnership, but as threatening the jobs of probation staff and heralding privatization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0264550512458474">Rumgay, 2000</xref>). The 5 per cent target was viewed as a blunt instrument, taking no account of the existing links and contracts that probation areas had with external organizations. The Association of Chief Officers of Probation (ACOP) provided advice to its members about how to approach the new world of partnership with a guidance document about contracts and service level agreements. The response of ACOP demonstrated the level of unease felt at senior levels in the probation service:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>Whilst few, if any, CPOs would have sought the formalisation represented by the Home Office ‘partnerships’ initiative, partnerships should not be viewed as wholly negative but as a potential opportunity. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0264550512458474">ACOP, 1993</xref>: 15)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0264550512458474">Rumgay (2000</xref>) researched the impact of these developments on work with drug-using offenders. She investigated the basis on which probation services chose their partners. Many of the choices were based on traditional links and networks. Few probation areas opted for competitive tendering approaches, either opposing this on principle or arguing that there were too few potential providers for a practical competition.</p>
<p>Partnership work in probation was the subject of a thematic review by Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Probation (HMIP) in 1996. The inspection report described the partnership initiative as requiring a significant cultural change for the probation service and praised the work done by probation staff to develop this area of practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0264550512458474">HMIP, 1996</xref>). The report acknowledged that partnership work had been implemented in a tough financial climate in which probation budgets had been cut and some staff made redundant. The inspectors spoke to some offenders who reported their contact with partner organizations positively, often viewing this as more flexible and approachable than their experience of the probation service.</p>
<p>Alongside its proposals for partnership working in probation, the Conservative Government implemented its policy of contracting with private companies to run prisons. The first private prison, HMP Wolds, opened in 1992. Whilst in opposition the Labour Party had opposed the concept of private prisons but, after winning the 1997 election, the New Labour Government continued with the policy of its predecessor and further private prisons opened.</p>
<p>The Labour Government also exhibited enthusiasm for voluntary sector involvement in the delivery and reform of public services. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0264550512458474">Alcock (2010</xref>) explains how policy initiatives focused not just on traditional voluntary groups and charities but also on social enterprises and community interest companies. The Labour Government argued that this third sector, being not-the-state and not-the-market, could provide choice in the delivery of public services. The Government created an Office of the Third Sector (OTS) within the Cabinet Office in 2006. Its role was to coordinate government policy and provide investment for the third sector. As well as taking on responsibilities for the voluntary sector previously held by the Home Office, the OTS also took over the work of the Social Enterprise Unit from the Department of Trade and Industry.</p>
<p>From the perspective of the probation service, the period of the Labour Government was marked by considerable restructuring and reorganisation. The creation of the National Probation Service in 2001 was rapidly followed by the Correctional Services Review (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0264550512458474">Carter, 2003</xref>) and the arrival of the National Offender Management Service. Local independent probation services became probation areas within a national service and then, following the implementation of the Offender Management Act 2007 , probation trusts delivering services commissioned by NOMS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0264550512458474">Canton, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0264550512458474">Easton and Piper, 2008</xref>). The Offender Management Act 2007 also provided the statutory framework for competition in the probation service, giving power to the Secretary of State to contract with providers outside the public sector for probation services.</p>
<p>During this period, the probation service continued collaborative work with the voluntary sector but a significant development was the growth of formal joint working with other statutory agencies, for example with the police and prison service in Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements and with local authorities in Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnerships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0264550512458474">Rumgay, 2007b</xref>). The word partnership increasingly came to be used in connection with these formal multi-agency structures.</p>
<p>The themes of the voluntary and private sector contribution to criminal justice can be found in the Carter Report, which asserted that introducing competition in prisons had driven up standards in the public sector. This view is not shared by all commentators who have assessed the evidence. It is argued (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0264550512458474">Gelsthorpe and Morgan, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0264550512458474">Liebling, 2006</xref>) that the lessons from prison privatization are complex and, given that prison and probation services have different histories, values and objectives, business ideas do not transfer in a straightforward way.</p>
<p>The Labour Government continued with policies that increased private sector involvement in criminal justice. In addition to prison contracts, commercial organizations were awarded some work in the community, for the example the provision of bail advice and support services and facilities management at probation premises. Towards the end of its period in office, the government was signalling its wish to expand the use of competition for community based services. Unpaid work and victim contact services were identified as candidates for best value review (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0264550512458474">NOMS, 2009</xref>).</p>

<title>The contribution of the Coalition Government</title>
<p>Even a brief review of the events of the past 25 years provides a number of themes against which the intentions of the current Coalition Government can helpfully be assessed. Since the partnership initiatives of the 1990s each successive government has been keen to reduce the service delivery role of the public sector and increase the contribution made by the voluntary and private sectors. Much time and effort has gone into creating structures and financial mechanisms, including best value reviews, purchaser/provider splits and commissioning, to make this happen. Whilst there has been some variation in the tools used to implement policy, the argument for the benefit of this approach has consistently been made on the grounds of economy, effectiveness, flexibility and innovation. The changes experienced by the probation service have been but a small part of the project to reform and modernize the whole of the public sector.</p>
<p>The Coalition Government came to power in the wake of the global financial crisis and with a commitment to a programme of public spending cuts to reduce the deficit. Additionally, since his arrival as leader of his party David Cameron has closely identified himself with the idea of the ‘Big Society’. Both these factors have their repercussions for the aspirations that the Government has for the public sector in general and the probation service in particular.</p>
<p>The Government’s intentions for the probation service can be traced through a number of policy documents, from the Green Paper <italic>Breaking the Cycle</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0264550512458474">Ministry of Justice, 2010</xref>), the response to the subsequent consultation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0264550512458474">Ministry of Justice, 2011a</xref>) and the more technical papers produced by NOMS that set out arrangements for commissioning and competition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0264550512458474">Ministry of Justice, 2011b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0264550512458474">NOMS, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0264550512458474">NOMS, 2012</xref>) to the consultation document <italic>Punishment and Reform: Effective Probation Services</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0264550512458474">Ministry of Justice, 2012</xref>). It is argued that both the private and voluntary sectors should have a significantly greater role in the delivery of probation services because this will produce more efficient services with better outcomes for the public. In an echo of policy documents from 20 years earlier, commissioning and competition are seen as a recipe for innovation and value for money. The policy documents speak of the role that volunteers can play in reducing reoffending, of ensuring that voluntary organizations are integrated into supply chains, of evidence based commissioning and enhancing the element of payback in community sentences.</p>
<p>The consultation document <italic>Punishment and Reform: Effective Probation Services</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0264550512458474">Ministry of Justice, 2012</xref>) sets out the Government’s proposals for reform of the probation service and invites responses to a number of questions about aspects of commissioning and competition. Key aspects of the proposed reform include establishing probation trusts as commissioners of probation services with the implication that this will require fewer larger trusts than at present. These public sector probation trusts would retain responsibility, in line with the requirements of the Offender Management Act 2007, for providing reports and advice to courts. They would also take ‘public interest decisions’ about risk assessment and allocation of resources and retain the management of higher risk offenders. All the other work of the probation service, including the management and supervision of lower risk offenders, would be open to competition with explicit encouragement of providers from the voluntary and private sectors. A purchaser provider split is envisaged, with probation trusts prevented from being both commissioners and providers of services.</p>
<p>At the time of writing (June 2012) the consultation process is still underway. A number of commentators have raised objections to the proposal to remove aspects of the offender management task from public sector probation trusts. Some critics oppose the privatization of probation work in principle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0264550512458474">Ledger, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0264550512458474">Teague, 2012</xref>). Others argue that the plans for offender management are based on a poorly informed understanding of the dynamic nature of risk and will result in confused and unsafe practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0264550512458474">Dobson, 2012</xref>). The task of offender management requires the making of frequent ‘public interest decisions’ about reassessment of risk, allocation of resources and adjustments to the sentence plan. The staff at probation trusts charged with making these decisions would have to work very closely with offender managers employed by another agency, overcoming problems of information exchange and inter-agency communication.</p>
<p>There is no explicit mention in the consultation document of the Government’s Big Society idea. However, the Green Paper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0264550512458474">Ministry of Justice, 2010</xref>: 83) asserts that the plan for change ‘is built on the principles of the Big Society: opening up public services to new and independent providers; increasing social action so that people give time, effort and money; and empowering citizens and communities to hold local agencies to account and share responsibility for making their neighbourhoods safer’. As a political idea, the Big Society draws on a number of traditional Conservative themes about reducing the power and size of the state and encouraging traditions and strengths of civic society. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0264550512458474">Richards (2012)</xref> describes its development as both casual and multi-layered, as separate from and completely bound up with the associated spending cuts.</p>
<p>A number of commentators have been quick to point to flaws and challenges inherent in the Big Society concept, some of which have particular resonance for the probation service. For example, it is strongly argued that communities and individuals living in the most disadvantaged areas are least well placed to benefit from Big Society community action and social entrepreneurship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0264550512458474">Glasman, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0264550512458474">NEF, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0264550512458474">Pattie and Johnston, 2011</xref>). The Big Society does not seem to come with a commitment to social justice or redistribution of wealth. Equally, there is an inevitable contradiction in an idea that has localism as a principle but that is being driven forward by central government action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0264550512458474">Gash, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0264550512458474">Richards, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Whilst the desire to increase the involvement of private and voluntary sector providers in the provision of probation services is familiar, and commissioning and competition are strategies adopted by previous governments, the Government’s chosen financial mechanism of payment by results is new to the criminal justice system. Payment by results is presented in all recent policy documents as a solution to the problem of reducing reoffending in tough economic times (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0264550512458474">Ministry of Justice, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0264550512458474">Ministry of Justice, 2011a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0264550512458474">Ministry of Justice, 2011b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0264550512458474">NOMS, 2012</xref>). This approach can be found in other strands of the government’s public sector reforms, including health, children’s services and the Department of Work and Pensions (DWP) Work Programme.</p>
<p>A number of criminal justice payment by results pilot projects are already underway.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0264550512458474">3</xref>
</sup> At HMP Peterborough, the voluntary sector organization St Giles Trust supports prisoners released from short sentences with the aim of reducing reoffending and is funded by a social impact bond.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0264550512458474">4</xref>
</sup> At HMP Doncaster the private company Serco, working with the voluntary sector organizations Turning Point and Catch 22, has a contract under which payment to the company will depend on the level of prisoner reoffending. Two probation trusts, Wales and Staffordshire and West Midlands (SWM), are to pilot payment by results schemes in the community in a four-year trial due to start in 2013. These pilot schemes require the two selected probation trusts to work with voluntary and private sector providers in what the government describes as innovative commercial partnership.</p>
<p>The mechanism of payments by results has been criticized from a number of angles. One concern about the current proposals is that any increase in the formal contractual relationship between the state and the voluntary sector benefits larger business-focused organizations at the expense of smaller, local or distinctive ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0264550512458474">Clinks 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0264550512458474">Howard League, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0264550512458474">Prison Reform Trust, 2011</xref>). This concern is not new; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0264550512458474">Sampson (2002</xref>) observes that competitive tendering for the provision of drug services in prison led to work being awarded to a small number of larger organizations at the expense of local links and diversity of practice.</p>
<p>Alongside this concern runs the argument that, in adopting the business orientations and growth strategies of the private sector, some third sector organizations have lost their claim to be distinctively different (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0264550512458474">Meek et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0264550512458474">Senior, 2011</xref>). Claims for the innovativeness, effectiveness and flexibility of the voluntary sector may sometimes be over-stated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0264550512458474">Nellis, 2006</xref>) or poorly evidenced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0264550512458474">Mills et al., 2011</xref>) but they remain a key part of the argument advanced by both the Government and the voluntary sector itself in support of current policy proposals.</p>
<p>Much of the discussion about payment by results anticipates that contracts will be won by large private sector companies because these are the only organizations in a position to bear the associated financial risk. Such companies will be prime providers, perhaps sub-contracting work to voluntary organizations seen to have expertise in service delivery. On a practical level, voluntary sector organizations are currently arguing for fair treatment both in the commissioning process and as part of a criminal justice supply chain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0264550512458474">RRTSAG, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>In anticipation of the outcomes of the probation review, trusts are responding by building a range of informal and formal links with neighbouring trusts and voluntary sector organizations. Organizations in the private and voluntary sector are also forming similar alliances and consortia in order to create entities with the financial strength, service delivery credibility and political complexion to appeal to commissioners. For example, the Criminal Justice Partnership is a venture that brings together the private and voluntary sector experience of Sodexo, Working Links and Nacro with the intention of working jointly with public sector probation trusts.</p>
<p>The concept of payment by results also appears to shift the focus of work with offenders from processes to outcomes. This raises many questions about how outcomes will be chosen and how they will be measured. Many voluntary organizations have argued that credit must be given for work with hard to reach and high risk offenders and that payment systems should value ‘distance travelled’ as well as reconviction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0264550512458474">CLINKS, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0264550512458474">Howard League, 2011</xref>). Concern has been voiced about the extent to which current developments are taking account of the needs of female offenders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0264550512458474">Corston Independent Funders’ Coalition, 2011</xref>).</p>

<title>Lessons from history?</title>
<p>Looking back at the way that previous governments have sought to increase voluntary and private sector involvement in the delivery of probation work is more than simply a reminder of past events; it can also serve to highlight opportunities and dilemmas that are present in the proposals being made by the Coalition Government. Strategies intended to influence or shape current policy can be informed by the experience of the past.</p>
<p>Firstly, it is worth making the point that changes to the probation service have always been part of a bigger political programme. Each successive government has had a public sector reform agenda that has been concerned with more than the criminal justice system. For example, the current government’s ideas about competition, commissioning and the Big Society are being played out with considerable political and professional opposition in the National Health Service (NHS). The progress of the controversial Health and Social Care Act 2012, a key element of the Government’s reform programme, was paused to allow for further consultation. Whilst some of the subsequent amendments are supported by the Bill’s critics, concern remains about issues including commissioning, competition and the consequences of considerable organizational change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0264550512458474">King’s Fund, 2011</xref>). Changes to the probation service will not receive the same level of media attention, are not subject to such high profile political and professional opposition and are likely to proceed in line with central government priorities.</p>
<p>Secondly, the experience of the Work Programme gives reason for caution about the likely impact of the proposed probation reforms both on vulnerable service users and many voluntary sector organizations. The DWP has a number of regional contracts with providers who deliver the programme with considerable freedom of approach and are rewarded on a payment by results basis. The list of Work Programme prime contractors is dominated by private sector companies, including G4S, Serco, Working Links and A4e who all also have involvement in the criminal justice market. The Work Programme prime providers work with complex supply chains, often comprising smaller or more local voluntary sector organizations seen as bringing the experience needed to work constructively with disadvantaged and hard to reach unemployed people.</p>
<p>In his evidence review of third sector involvement in the delivery of employment services, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0264550512458474">Damm (2012</xref>) raises a number of points that merit consideration in the probation context. He points to a number of gaps in the evidence base for contracting and commissioning, suggesting that the commitment to private and voluntary sector solutions to social problems is, at present, a political rather than an empirical choice. Damm’s review also suggests that the criminal justice voluntary sector is right to be concerned that working with large private sector prime contractors brings financial, reputational and quality of practice risks. He highlights the incentive, under payment by results, for contractors to work strategically investing most in service users likely to yield successful outcomes. The ‘parking’ of individuals with complex needs and the neglect of holistic solutions to social problems are emerging hazards of the Work Programme model.</p>
<p>The definition of a ‘result’ is a crucial aspect of any payment by results scheme. The Ministry of Justice appears to have a preference for binary measures of results, for example the presence or absence of a reconviction in a twelve month period. Setting aside broader debates about the difficulties of measuring reconviction and extent to which reconviction is a reliable measure of reoffending (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0264550512458474">Merrington and Stanley, 2007</xref>), there is an argument that binary measures are not well-suited to projects that target a wide range of needs and risks and where an improvement in an individual’s circumstances and behaviour is impossible to attribute to the work of a single provider (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0264550512458474">Prison Reform Trust, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Thirdly, as previously noted, the Big Society initiative must manage the tension of being a centrally driven project with a mission to shift power and responsibility to local communities. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0264550512458474">Richards (2012)</xref> argues that the localism aspect of the Big Society was one of the political ideas that was sufficiently attractive to the Liberal Democrats to make the coalition agreement possible. In the probation context, the balance of power and influence between national and local stakeholders is an issue that significantly pre-dates the current Government (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0264550512458474">Canton, 2011</xref>). The probation service has long been managing its own tension, how to respond to nationally set priorities and targets whilst working as a partner with other local agencies to tackle particular patterns of crime and disorder.</p>
<p>The proposal in <italic>Punishment and Reform: Effective Probation Services</italic> gives probation trusts the role of commissioning the majority of services in their area whilst arguing that, for reasons of value for money, some services, like electronic monitoring, may continue to be commissioned at a national level. Probation trusts are encouraged to work closely with local partners where jointly commissioned services make sense. This aspect of the review, a potential move away from national to local, has been positively received by some within the probation service (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0264550512458474">Cox and Hall, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Fourthly, it is important to consider the extent to which the Government’s proposed reforms are capable of producing services that respond to the full range of diversity needs. The network of community projects for female offenders, a practice initiative strongly supported by the Corston Review (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0264550512458474">Corston, 2007</xref>), provides an important example of service delivery which is tailored to local circumstances, draws on the strength of a range of public and voluntary sector partners and is vulnerable to changes in funding mechanisms as well as budget cuts. In order to develop holistic and coherent approaches to women who offend or who are at risk of offending, Women’s Centres have worked closely not just with probation but with the agencies responsible for, among other things, health, housing, community safety, money advice and domestic violence. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0264550512458474">Jones and Askwith (2012</xref>) outline the benefits of single commissioning for women with complex needs and stress the importance of the commitment of the local authority in achieving this. Projects serving particular and minority groups of offenders, including women, could be vulnerable in the current reforms in a number of ways: commissioning plans may not take sufficient account of diversity needs, commissioning mechanisms may not be flexible to allow holistic responses to multiple needs, the outcomes required under payment by results may not be a relevant measure of successful practice, providing a service to small numbers of individuals may not appeal to large prime contractors and small specialist voluntary organizations may be unable or unwilling to take their place in a commercial supply chain.</p>
<p>None of the first payment by results pilots involved work with female offenders. Given the Government’s stated commitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0264550512458474">Ministry of Justice, 2011b</xref>) to apply the principles of payment by results across all offender services by 2015, there is a clear need to spend time now evaluating a wide range of services and assessing the merits of a diverse range of outcome measures. Without this work there is a risk that all offenders may find themselves part of programmes and schemes designed for youngish white men.</p>

<title>Ensuring good practice for the future</title>
<p>Having looked back at the stages in the development of a market in probation services and discussed some of the issues that have emerged from the policies of this Government and its predecessors, this article now seeks to offer some practice principles that are salient in the world of commissioning and payment by results.</p>
<p>One test of the probation service’s response to the current policy environment will be the extent to which the principles underpinning new forms of service delivery support constructive, purposeful and humane practice. Many policy documents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0264550512458474">Ministry of Justice, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0264550512458474">NOMS, 2012</xref>) speak about the importance of doing ‘what works’, recognizing the importance of skilful and committed staff, responding to diverse needs and being flexible to local circumstances. Commissioners of services and managers in agencies from all sectors need to ensure that these principles are not lost in implementation.</p>
<p>Many Government policy documents outlining the payment by results mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0264550512458474">Ministry of Justice, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0264550512458474">Ministry of Justice, 2011a</xref>) appear to make the assumption that, freed from the concerns of process and targets, innovative providers will be able to plan and deliver services that successfully reduce reoffending. However, the recent history of trying to do ‘what works’ to reduce re-offending and the growing understanding about how offenders desist from crime (see for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0264550512458474">McCulloch and McNeill, 2008</xref>) provide the reminder that rehabilitation is a complicated process. Many community programmes for offenders, run both in the public and voluntary sectors, do use approaches that are supported by empirical evidence. For example, they provide practical help in areas such as housing, employment and health, and employ staff who build warm and motivating relationships with service users (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0264550512458474">Hedderman, Palmer and Hollin, 2008</xref>). This approach to work with offenders in the community has much to commend it, but faces real challenges whether delivered in the public, private or voluntary sector and whether funded by throughput or outcome.</p>
<p>A first challenge is the practical one of ensuring that offenders obtain a job, a home and help with a mental health or addiction problem. All of these resources are scarce and, given the predicted lack of economic growth over the coming years, likely to get more scarce. Additionally, offenders, not being viewed as ideal employees, neighbours or patients, can find themselves at the back of queues. New entrants to the probation market may be able to access some dedicated resources on behalf of their service users (for example, a voluntary organization may already work in the areas of social housing or employment support) but all organizations, from whatever sector, will want to avoid being judged on outcomes that are outside their control.</p>
<p>A second challenge is in the area of staffing. Staffing is important because evidence suggests that the nature of the interaction between workers and offenders has an impact on outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0264550512458474">Burnett and McNeill, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0264550512458474">McNeill and Weaver, 2010</xref>) and also because, in a labour intensive business like probation, staffing costs will always be a significant part of any project. Argument about pay levels and pension entitlements is likely to be a prominent part of contract negotiation between commissioners and the commissioned. Moss, reflecting on wider social policy changes, notes problems with staff turnover in Pathways to Work projects. He writes:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>The supply of people to work in providers is one aspect that is often lost in decisions made by Whitehall. Whitehall tends to concentrate on devising structures and incentives, but the question always remains: ‘Who will be the front line workers in the new provider markets?’ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0264550512458474">Moss, 2010</xref>: 6)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>One principle to be maintained through the coming changes in probation is that those who work on the front-line with offenders should have the necessary skills, values, oversight and support. This point cuts across sectors and is particularly salient for organizations dealing with budget cuts facing the temptation to reduce staffing complements or make greater use of workers with less training or experience. This is not to argue that only those with the highest level of professional qualification should be permitted to work with offenders nor that there is no place for volunteers in probation practice. Different tasks require different skills, experience and personal approach. In April 2010, the probation service implemented a new qualification framework that included both Probation Officer and Probation Service Officer grade staff. All new staff who assess and supervise offenders and manage community orders and licences now undergo a training programme in a broad range of practice skills and underpinning knowledge and must achieve the relevant qualification, set at a higher level for Probation Officers than Probation Service Officers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0264550512458474">Dominey and Walters, 2011</xref>). Commissioners of probation services must ensure that all front-line staff, whatever their employing organization, are properly trained and qualified.</p>
<p>A third challenge is to ensure that the commissioning process creates services which meet the needs of the heterogeneous population of offenders. The risks to specialist projects such as Women’s Centres in the current policy climate were discussed in the previous section. Evidence about pathways to desistance reminds us that one size fits all interventions are not adequate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0264550512458474">Weaver and McNeill, 2010</xref>). It is positive that NOMS has committed itself to commissioning services that are responsive to the needs of women, accepting that this may include separate provision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0264550512458474">NOMS, 2012</xref>). The first version of the NOMS Commissioning Intentions document was silent on other aspects of diversity, an oversight that has been partly addressed in version two of this document with a paragraph that acknowledges that people with learning disabilities, people from minority ethnic backgrounds and people who are gay, lesbian or bisexual may not benefit from one size fits all services. Clearly, the strength of these intentions is yet to be tested in the outcomes of commissioning decisions.</p>
<p>Fourthly, the emerging shape of the commissioning framework will give a clear message about whether probation work will go forward as a locally led activity. The arguments for ensuring that, wherever possible, commissioning happens at a local level are powerful: local commissioners have closer links with local communities, coherent commissioning often needs to be undertaken jointly with other statutory agencies in a particular locality and other parallel reforms, for example the advent of police and crime commissioners, have a local focus. However, mergers between probation trusts may create large commissioning bodies that struggle to link well with smaller local authorities and neighbourhoods.</p>
<p>Finally, whilst the Government has committed itself to competition and payment by results in the provision of probation services there are key areas where the evidence base is thin and research could support the development of policy. Relatively little is known about aspects of the interaction between offenders and workers and its implications for offender engagement and compliance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0264550512458474">McNeill and Weaver, 2010</xref>). Less is known about how the different approaches and philosophies of providers competing in a mixed market for criminal justice services impact on an offender’s journey through the system.</p>

<sec id="section6-0264550512458474">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Opening up the criminal justice market has been a policy theme of recent UK governments of all political persuasions. Ideological approval for the involvement of profit-making organizations in the delivery of punishment (as well as education, health and welfare) has been granted by politicians and policy makers across the political spectrum, despite the concept of privatization in criminal justice remaining unacceptable to many in the public sector and beyond (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0264550512458474">Napo, 2011</xref>). There are a number of reasons why managers and practitioners in the probation service, both in the past and in the present, have been resistant to the arrival of new providers; anxieties about jobs, pensions and the future of the service blend with concerns about the risk of producing a service for offenders which is fragmented, lacks stability and neglects the interests of those most difficult to help. However, running parallel to these concerns and in response to the policy frameworks set by government, the probation service can point to many valuable and creative schemes that blend the experience of a range of providers, make use of volunteers (some of them with a history of offending behaviour) and provide benefits for the wider community.</p>
<p>The framework of competition and payment by results set against the background of financial austerity will be a challenging one within which to defend principles of good practice. Whilst the decisions about how, what and from whom to commission will be crucial in shaping the probation future, so will be the initiatives taken and projects developed by local probation managers and practitioners. The first community payment by results projects will set models for future practice and should be subject to rigorous evaluations of their quality, cost and benefits for offenders, local communities and the wider public. Such evaluations provide the opportunity to test some of the often repeated assertions that voluntary and private sector providers offer both cost and innovation benefits not available from traditional public services.</p>
<p>Finally, this article suggests that the development of new projects and programmes should be guided by a commitment to providing appropriate services for all offenders, by focusing on local partnerships, agencies and solutions and by paying attention to the skills, knowledge and experience of front-line staff.</p>
