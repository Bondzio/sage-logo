<abstract>
<p>To lighten structures, many metallic components, such as aircraft wings, are being replaced by composite components. To join these components with the rest of the structure, various joining techniques are used. When using multiple bolted joints, bypass vs. bearing loading is developed around each joint. The ratio of bearing to bypass loading is known to affect the level of load at which failure occurs. There have been many models created to predict failure within composites but very little work has been carried out to investigate how well numerical models predict failure within bolted joints subjected to bearing and bypass loading. In addition, few models have been developed that account for the through thickness stresses that are developed underneath the bearing load. This paper compares a range of failure criteria and degradation models utilizing a three-dimensional model and compares how well they predict failure for bearing vs. bypass loading for a supported-pin-loaded joint.</p>

<p>Multi-fasteners are of interest as they are often used to join composite to metallic structures such as carbon composite aircraft wings onto aluminum fuselages. Multi-fastened joints remove the load gradually, with each row of fasteners removing some of the load (bearing load), while the remaining load is taken up by the following fasteners (bypass load).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021998311427766">1</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0021998311427766">4</xref></sup> This means at each row of joints, different ratios of bypass and bearing load exist. A range of diverse numerical and experimental studies have been carried out on these types of joints.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0021998311427766">5</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0021998311427766">11</xref></sup> The main focus of multi-bolted joints has been on predicting the failure strength and determining the best bolt arrangement.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0021998311427766">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0021998311427766">8</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0021998311427766">10</xref></sup> The numerical work has tended to treat the composite as a two-dimensional (2D) laminate thus neglecting the three-dimensional (3D) stress state that exists around the pin/bolt hole due to pin/bolt deformation. More recent work has started to model composite bolted joints in three dimensions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0021998311427766">11</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0021998311427766">17</xref></sup> McCarthy et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0021998311427766">17</xref></sup> for instance looked at bolt-hole clearance in multi-bolted joints. The work compared results from tests on double lap joints where the bolt-hole clearances were varied. The predictions of strength were underestimated in the models that the authors put down to the failure criteria and property reduction percentages used in the damage progression analysis. There still appears to be no work carried out on evaluating the effect of varying the bearing vs. bypass loading ratio within 3D numerical models vs. experimental data. One of the reasons for this is that the techniques for testing different ratios of bearing vs. bypass are more difficult to perform or require specialized equipment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0021998311427766">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0021998311427766">18</xref></sup> More recent work by Zarco-González et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0021998311427766">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0021998311427766">20</xref></sup> has tried to rectify this by modeling the effect of bearing vs. bypass loading on a single pinned composite laminate allowing for the deformation of the pin. Even though the numerical results obtained correlate well with experiments at bearing dominant loads, there is a significant difference in the results at high bypass loads. One of the reasons given by Zarco-González<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0021998311427766">20</xref></sup> for this is the absence of friction in his modeling work, as well as the failure criteria not being robust enough to cope with the combined effects of tensile and compressive stresses around the hole. From the work carried out for this paper, it is believed there is a discrepancy in the results presented by Zarco-González<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0021998311427766">20</xref></sup> in that the good experimental correlation found at bearing dominant loads are not as good in reality as presented in his work.</p>
<p>A comparison of different failure criteria was carried out in a world wide failure exercise.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0021998311427766">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0021998311427766">22</xref></sup> In this exercise, five models were recommended as the most suitable for a wide range of applications but no model was shown to be robust over a wide range of load applications. Many model developers declined to participate in the exercise, including Prof. Z. Hashin,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0021998311427766">21</xref></sup> on the basis that the models were not able to predict failure in laminates.</p>
<p>The advantage of stress-based criteria such as Hashin’s criteria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0021998311427766">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0021998311427766">24</xref></sup> is that they require limited material data, differentiate between the damage mechanisms, have been validated against a range of problems, and can be relatively easily implemented into numerical codes. In order to maintain numerical stability, these criteria are often implemented utilizing a material degradation model that does not completely degrade the material or degrades the material slowly based on physical properties such as the energy released. Degradation values are controversial as there is often limited physical validity to them and although good results have been obtained for given problems, there is doubt about how robust the models will be when subjected to a different type of loading case. Also as the material in the models is not fully degraded, some criterion must be used to define when the laminate has completely failed.</p>
<p>Within this paper, the initial work carried out by Zarco-González et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0021998311427766">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0021998311427766">20</xref></sup> is taken further by looking at a wide range of currently used stress-based failure criteria and degradation models to evaluate their prediction of damage and ultimate failure in composite pinned joints subjected to bearing vs. bypass loads. Although it is known that bolt stress interaction, bolt clearance, clamping force, and washer diameter have an effect on joint performance,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0021998311427766">25</xref></sup> in this case a simple unclamped neat-fit pinned joint was considered to allow comparison with the initial available test data<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0021998311427766">20</xref></sup> and to reduce the amount of variables to analyze. Friction between the pin and the composite was implemented and different methods were employed to prevent early failure of the models due to numerical instabilities. It is shown that not only is there wide discrepancy among the different failure criteria tested but also that changes in the post-initial failure degradation model have a significant effect in the ultimate load prediction. In addition, the importance of considering the nonlinear and shear terms, the damage parameter and the effect of considering a 2D or 3D analysis is discussed.</p>

<sec id="sec2-0021998311427766"><title>Finite element modeling and procedure</title>
<p>In his work, Zarco-González<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0021998311427766">20</xref></sup> carried out a series of experimental bearing vs. bypass tests to establish bearing vs. bypass curves for a variety of carbon composite laminates. The numerical models presented in this paper used the same materials properties, specimen geometry, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0021998311427766">Figure 1</xref>, and loading conditions for one of the laminates used in the Zarco-González tests. The laminate was symmetric about a mid-plane, running down the center thickness of the laminate, and made of 16 layers of CFRP, with a nominal thickness of 5 mm. Unfortunately, due to confidentiality, the laminate lay-up and properties cannot be disclosed.

<p>Similar to the work of Zarco-González,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0021998311427766">20</xref></sup> the USDFLD subroutine within ABAQUS was modified to enable progressive degradation to be applied during a load step. The load applied is divided into increments. Within an increment, iterations are performed in order to find an equilibrium solution. The code will iterate within the same increment until finding a solution. At the end of the each increment, the structure will be in equilibrium. Within an increment, the failure criteria are evaluated at each integration point of the model. When the stress levels at a given integration point reach critical values as defined by the failure criteria, the material properties at that integration point are reduced to reflect that the material at that integration point is damaged. In ABAQUS, this is achieved by defining the material properties as a function of field variables. The user subroutine USDFLD within ABAQUS provides the user a method to write a program that updates the field variables at every integration point for each increment in the analysis, according to failure criteria values obtained during the solution. At the beginning of each increment, the user subroutine USDFLD, using the utility subroutine GETVRM, accesses the material point quantities for every integration point in the model. The stress and strains components are then used to compute the failure criterion values. If any of the values are greater or equal to 1, the related field variable for the integration point with the highest failure criterion value is set permanently to 1, indicating failure (it is important to note that degradation models implemented within ABAQUS degrade integration points rather than elements). However, the updated values of the field variables do not influence the material properties within the current increment but during the next increment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0021998311427766">26</xref></sup> If more than one integration point field variable is set to fail during an increment, the solution becomes explicit, which makes the accuracy of the results dependent on the increment size used. In order to avoid this Zarco-Gonazales,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0021998311427766">20</xref></sup> selected to fail only the field variable related to the highest failure criterion and used an equilibrium increment between damage increments to redistribute the stresses. Chang and Chang<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0021998311427766">27</xref></sup> achieved this using a Newton-Raphson iteration scheme. However, according to Sleight,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0021998311427766">28</xref></sup> if a small increment is performed, the step of reestablishing equilibrium may be omitted. This saves computational time and it this approach that has been employed in this work.</p>
<p>Commonly, first-order elements are recommended for problems involving contact or large distortions,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0021998311427766">26</xref></sup> therefore an eight-noded linear brick, reduced integration and hourglass control element (C3D8R) was used in the models within this work. Contact between the pin and the hole and the pin support and laminate surface were modeled using the contact pair approach implemented in ABAQUS with a finite sliding formulation. An important issue related to modeling contact in composite materials is that the coefficient of friction in the contact area might vary depending on the ply orientation. In this instance, Ireman<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0021998311427766">11</xref></sup> considered the lowest value of friction (0.2–0.37) found in tests performed in fractured surfaces in end-notch flexure (ENF) specimens. A similar coefficient of friction (0.2) was considered in the bolt-hole contact zone during all simulations. In addition, default contact controls were used and the line search algorithm was included to avoid premature increment cut-back due to large residual forces.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0021998311427766">26</xref></sup> Symmetric boundary conditions were applied down the center of the laminate so that only eight layers of the laminate were modeled (half of the thickness), see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0021998311427766">Figure 2</xref>. Initially, the left-hand end of the laminate was fixed in the longitudinal direction (U1 = 0) and a constant pressure was applied to the right-hand end (bypass load), while the pin and pin support (modeled as one entity) were free to move in the longitudinal direction (low-stiffness springs were applied to the pin to help establish initial contact, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0021998311427766">Figure 3</xref>). A steadily increasing displacement was then applied to the back face of the pin support to induce bearing load in the laminate, while the pressure (applied in the u1 direction to the right-hand end of the laminate) was kept constant (bypass load). The pin support had a contact diameter of 28 mm and was positioned so that it just touched the surface of the composite to replicate the experimental setup. A contact was modeled between the pin support and laminate surface so that it was possible for through thickness stresses to develop during loading due to the laminate expanding laterally under the bearing load.

<p>The loads applied to the specimen in the experiments were reproduced in the numerical models. As in the experimental analysis, each point of the numerical curve corresponds to an independent bearing vs. bypass loading case. Bypass and bearing loads were applied in the same order as in the experimental analysis, that is, a constant bypass load was applied until an equilibrium state was achieved, whereupon bearing load was applied up to laminate failure.</p>
<sec id="sec3-0021998311427766"><title>Mesh convergence</title>
<p>The accuracy of the solution from FEA is affected by the mesh size. Too small a mesh will give accurate results at high computational cost but too large a mesh will run quickly but will give inaccurate results. In order to find an optimum mesh size, which gives accurate analytical results for the minimum computational cost, a mesh convergence analysis was carried out. The finite element code used was ABAQUS Standard 6.5. To reduce computational time only half the laminate was modeled. Four models with different element aspect ratios, and mesh densities around the hole were tested, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0021998311427766">Figure 4</xref>. The longitudinal distance over which the mesh refinement was carried out was equal to the width of the plate. The damage obtained experimentally<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0021998311427766">20</xref></sup> was within this region. All models were analyzed utilizing a 20-kN bypass load and a bearing load corresponding to a pin displacement of 0.9368 mm. The failure criteria employed for these initial models were those used by Papanikos<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0021998311427766">29</xref></sup> (Equation 4 and Equations 8–13).
<fig id="fig4-0021998311427766" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>Finite element model AR3032. Aspect ratio 3.03.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0021998311427766-fig4.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>It was found that the mesh density and aspect ratio affected the final failure load and mesh convergence could not be obtained. It was found that as the mesh density reduced, the predicted failure load tended to 25 kN. It was decided to use 32 elements around the hole with one element per layer. This gave 256 elements at the hole-boundary and a total of 2816 element in the damage zone. The aspect ratio of the elements around the hole was set to 3.03. Using these settings, a failure load of 25.2 kN was obtained, which gives an error of 0.8% compared to the 25 kN trend. A coarser mesh was used away from the hole. The typical mesh, forces, and boundary conditions for the laminate and pin-set are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0021998311427766">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0021998311427766">3</xref>.</p>

<sec id="sec4-0021998311427766"><title>Failure criteria and degradation models</title>
<p>In composite bolted joints, different failure modes can occur depending on the loading conditions and the stress field in the plies. Most of the failure modes can be avoided with careful design, but the net tension and bearing failure modes will still occur depending on the ratio of bearing vs. bypass loads. It is important to notice though, that failure modes are affected by joint parameters such as geometry, laminate lay-up, load direction, and bolt clamping forces.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0021998311427766">30</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0021998311427766">32</xref></sup> Net tension, shear-out, and bearing failure modes may occur simultaneously.</p>
<p>When failure is detected in an integration point, the elastic properties in the affected area need to be reduced. The independent elastic properties to be degraded are strongly related to the predicted failure mechanism. This process is controlled through a degradation model. A parametric study performed by Tan<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0021998311427766">33</xref></sup> showed that the load at which failure occurs in the laminate is very sensitive to the percentage of reduction chosen. Hence, in order to predict the correct damage extension and ultimate failure load not only the ideal failure criteria have to be used but also a proper degradation model.</p>
<p>As previously mentioned, there have been several failure criteria developed to predict the behavior of composite laminates under different loading conditions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0021998311427766">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0021998311427766">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0021998311427766">34</xref></sup> In this work, polynomial stress-based criteria have been chosen as they have been shown to give good correlation with a wide range of experimental data and because they are easy to implement in subroutines.</p>
<p>Early theories used a quadratic set of inequalities, which are satisfied when the corresponding combination of stresses are exceeded. Tsai and Wu<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0021998311427766">35</xref></sup> developed one of the earliest failure criteria. They developed a strength criterion for anisotropic materials that did not account independently for all the distinct failure modes. Hashin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0021998311427766">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0021998311427766">24</xref></sup> proposed a set of failure criteria for predicting failure of unidirectional composites based on each failure mode. He proposed two failure mechanisms, one based on the failure of the fiber and one based on the failure of the matrix. These failure criteria are expressed in terms of quadratic stress polynomials and according to the author, the choice of quadratics is not based on physical reasoning but on curve fitting considerations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0021998311427766">26</xref></sup></p>
<p>Up to date there have been several researchers that have combined and modified different criteria to form a single set of failure criteria in order to predict damage within a composite laminate. Within this paper, there are 24 equations (Equations 1–24) that independently consider the different failure mechanisms, see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0021998311427766">Table 1</xref>.

Modifications include the addition of nonlinear terms and the reduction of shear terms to account for 2D analysis. Ten different sets of failure criteria (combinations of basic criteria and modified criteria) and seven degradation models were used to assess damage in model AR3032. These criteria have been divided into three groups.

<p>In order to assess the independent effect of the shear nonlinear behavior and the nonlinear damage parameter (damage accumulation), criteria C3 was modified in this work, see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table11-0021998311427766">Table 11</xref>. Criteria C3A do not take into account any nonlinear effect whereas criteria C3B and C3C considered the nonlinear shear behavior and the nonlinear shear stress–strain relationship, respectively. Criteria C4 are very similar to criteria C3, but the fiber tensile failure criterion (Equation 24) does not include the shear term (Equation 19).

<p>The numerical model and procedure, discussed in the previous section, were used to perform a comparison among the different failure criteria. In <xref ref-type="table" rid="table12-0021998311427766">Table 12</xref>, the damage generated due to different loading cases is presented. The models were stopped when damage in the load bearing layers (fibers aligned longitudinally) reached 3.5 mm (approximately four elements). In pure bearing, the models stopped due to the fiber compressive failure damage reaching this criterion and in the 50 kN bypass and the pure bypass case the models stopped due to the fiber tensile failure damage reaching this criterion. The reasons the 3.5-mm criterion was used are discussed in more detail below.

<p>Several researchers have considered fiber tensile or compressive failure as the most important failure mechanism when considering final failure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0021998311427766">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0021998311427766">22</xref></sup> This is because most of the time the stiffness of the fiber is much higher than that of the matrix. In <xref ref-type="table" rid="table12-0021998311427766">Table 12</xref>, high amounts of fiber and matrix damaged elements are observed. Since fibers are the main load carrying elements, the laminate is considered damaged when fibers undergo a certain extent of damage, as explained later. For the combined bearing-bypass load case, the fiber tensile failure mechanism is dominant. It is found that as the bearing force becomes dominant, the fiber tensile failure mode diminishes and as bypass force becomes dominant, the fiber compressive failure damage diminishes, which is to be expected. Another important failure mechanism present is delamination. This failure mechanism was induced by the compressive forces acting in the pin-hole contact, where the out-of-plane stresses increased and forced the fibers to split out.</p>
<p>It is important to point out that assessing ultimate failure within a composite numerical analysis is difficult and must be judged with great care. It has been observed in work performed by Tserpes et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0021998311427766">41</xref></sup> and Dano et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0021998311427766">39</xref></sup> that researchers have taken different approaches when selecting the failure load point. The Characteristic Curve Method (CCM)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0021998311427766">42</xref></sup> and the Failure Area Index (FAI) method<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0021998311427766">43</xref></sup> use the stress field with some failure criteria to determine failure. The CCM sets failure as being the point at which the selected failure criterion is exceeded at any point on the characteristic curve on any ply. The FAI method sums up failure values on each ply, and then across the plies, to obtain an overall FAI value. This value is compared to an FAI obtained from a stress field generated numerically, using an experimentally obtained failure load, to determine failure. For progressive models, the approaches include a characteristic failure distance for bearing load defined by geometric parameters of the joint,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0021998311427766">44</xref></sup> or defined by the outer diameter of the washer in a bolted joint,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0021998311427766">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0021998311427766">45</xref></sup> the first peak in a load displacement curve,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0021998311427766">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0021998311427766">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0021998311427766">47</xref></sup> the half of the maximum load just prior to unstable nonlinear behavior<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0021998311427766">48</xref></sup> among others. The reason that this is sometime required with some progressive damage models is that in order to get numerical stability the material properties are given residual material properties after failure which can mask physical instabilities.</p>
<p>The model as proposed by Hung and Chang<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0021998311427766">44</xref></sup> is very appealing as it implements a damage parameter that reduces the laminate stiffness dramatically when the damage area reaches a critical value. The criterion uses two experimental parameters that were found to be reasonably insensitive to load conditions but were developed for bearing load (with and without bolt preload). Ascione et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0021998311427766">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0021998311427766">50</xref></sup> have developed a semiempirical formula for predicting the failure load with varying lamina directions and bolt diameter based on carrying out three experimental tests with different lamina orientations. In this work, both bearing and bypass loads were applied with the additional complication that the laminate was semiclamped with the pressure varying under the pin support as the load was increased. It was therefore decided, knowing that the distance from the hole at which damage causes final failure is geometry and material dependent, to determine the distance from the hole at which damage increased rapidly. This rapid damage growth, sometimes indicated by a flat slope or a drop in load, was evident in most cases but was easier to pick out for some failure criteria than others and was not evident for pure bearing loads. It was found that this rapid growth in damage occurred when the fiber tensile damage or compressive damage extended 3.5 mm in any direction from the hole. Similar observations were made by O’Higgins et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0021998311427766">37</xref></sup> however they did not consider a damaged extension distance as the final failure point. The reason why damage developed in some cases without any clear signal of laminate rupture might be due to the fact that although the stiffness of failed elements is reduced when they fail, it is not reduced to zero. This is to prevent the models becoming unstable but this means that the elements can still support load, which will cause the overall load supported by the laminate to keep increasing as the loading continues even though the damage has become extensive. In reality, although there may be some residual strength in failed material due to friction and interweaving of failed strands, the strength is going to be very low after failure and significantly lower than used in the degradation models. To see the effect of reducing the material strength to zero, models were run where failed elements were manually deleted before applying increased load. Although element deletion is supported in ABAQUS standard, it is not a straight forward task to use it with a damage progression analysis. In order to perform an analysis with this feature, the elements to be deleted have to be known prior to the analysis, but this is not possible until an analysis is performed. An initial analysis is, therefore, required to determine which elements require deleting. A subsequent analysis fails the element with the highest failure criteria value. These two analyses are then repeated until at the set load there are no further elements exceeding the failure criteria. It was observed that at 3.5 mm away from the hole-edge the elements kept failing without applying any extra load. If element deletion is stopped and extra load or displacement is applied the curve will start increasing again, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0021998311427766">Figure 5</xref>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0021998311427766">Figure 5</xref> also shows the difference between elastic property degradation and element deletion. Element deletion is only possible to perform when there is no contact between parts, since failed elements underneath the bolt have to remain in order to account for crushed material.

<p>Based on the damage growth results and element deletion model results, the laminates were considered to fail when the damage extension in the main load carrying layers reached a radial distance of 3.5 mm away from the hole-edge. This was done to provide consistency in comparing the different failure criteria and to speed up the analysis process. It is important to mention that this distance will be laminate geometry and hole-diameter dependent. The method utilized though is not empirical, although validated against experimental data, as the distance can be found numerically, by picking the distance at which damage rapidly increases and verifying using an element deletion model. To check that this distance was not determined by the mesh size, different mesh densities were utilized with similar results.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, not all the material properties were available for the material analyzed in this study, and the transverse and out-of-plane shear strengths were considered similar to the in-plane shear strength, that is, S12 = S13 = S23.</p>

Nonetheless, criteria A2, which includes the nonlinear shear behavior term, gave higher (better) failure load predictions than its counterpart A1. Both sets underpredicted failure for bearing and bypass loads.

<p>The effect of the shear nonlinearity term is to reduce the effect the shear stress has in the criteria and therefore enables the laminate to support more load.

On the other hand, O’Higgins et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0021998311427766">37</xref></sup> using criteria A2, found that the ultimate failure loads for laminates with open-holes subjected to tensile forces agreed well with experimental results.

<sec id="sec8-0021998311427766"><title>Group B</title>
<p>The only difference between criteria B1 and B2 is the fiber tensile criterion. Criteria B1 use the maximum stress criterion (Equation 10), whereas B2 uses the Hashin-type failure criterion (Equation 14). When using degradation model 2, both criteria sets gave reasonable results for the pure bearing case (compressive stresses are dominant). However, it is clear that as soon as tensile stresses become higher (and therefore the shear stresses), the shear term in the fiber tensile criterion of criteria B2 causes the element to fail prematurely, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0021998311427766">Figure 7</xref>. This observation agrees with that made by Tserpes et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0021998311427766">41</xref></sup> The lack of the shear term in the fiber tensile criterion of B1 (Equation 10) allows the laminate to support more tensile load.

<p>When using criteria B1 and B2 with degradation model 3, it was noticed that criteria B2 gave much lower values than criteria B1 for the pure bearing case; this under prediction might be due to the combined effect of the shear term in the fiber tensile criterion of B2 and the degradation model 3, which turned out to be more aggressive than degradation model 2. When comparing criteria B1 with degradation models 2 and 3, the fact that degradation model 3 reduces the stiffness by 90% does have a clear effect. It was observed that by defining different degradation percentages for the different failure mechanisms, it allows the criteria to predict higher failure loads. This observation also agrees with Tserpes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0021998311427766">41</xref></sup> In addition, in degradation model 3, for the matrix tensile and matrix compressive failure mechanism, the shear modulus, G12, and the Poisson’s ratio, N12, are reduced, whereas in degradation model 2 they are not affected. This might also explain why criteria B1 and B2 with degradation model 3 gave slightly lower values in pure bearing than criteria B1 and B2 with degradation model 2.</p>

All of them are 2D Hashin-type failure criteria. As expected, criteria C1 overpredicted failure in bearing and bypass dominant loads since they were proposed for open plates in compression. They include matrix tensile and compressive failure as well as fiber matrix shear-out failure mechanisms, but do not consider a fiber tensile criterion. The lack of this criterion makes criteria C1 unsuitable for bearing vs. bypass analysis. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0021998311427766">Figure 8</xref> shows that criteria C2, C3, and C4 predicted the same failure point for pure bearing and the 20 kN bypass cases. Criteria C2 and C3 are the only ones that include the Hashin fiber tensile failure criterion (Equation 19). In this case, the damage parameter included in these three criteria continuously reduces the value of the shear modulus thus decreasing the shear stresses and allowing the laminate to support higher loads, this behavior agrees with that observed by Dano et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0021998311427766">39</xref></sup>; however in this work, failure load predictions for bearing dominant loads agree with experimental results. This might be due to the degradation models being more stable. Criteria C4 do not include the shear term in the fiber tensile criterion thus supporting high tensile load comparable to criteria C2 and C3.

<p>It is also observed that criteria C3 is very similar to criteria C2, but criteria C3 do not include the fiber matrix shear failure mechanism. It is clear, from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0021998311427766">Figure 8</xref>, that criteria C3 predict lower (better) values than criteria C2 and C4 at 40 kN bypass. This behavior might be attributed to the fiber matrix shear failure mechanism. In all degradation models, fiber matrix shear is related to the shear modulus, when this mechanism is present in failure criteria that consider the damage parameter the shear modulus is further reduced (reducing the shear stresses for a given tensile load). However, if this criterion is not considered (criteria C3), the high shear stresses developed are reduced only by the damage parameter. This theory might also explain why criteria C4 gave higher values than criteria C3. In this case although criteria C4 do not include the fiber matrix shear failure mechanism, the fiber tensile criterion does not consider the high shear stresses developed, thus allowing the laminate to take more load. Since fiber matrix shear failure is driven by compressive stresses, it is observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0021998311427766">Figure 8</xref> that the effects of the fiber matrix shear in criteria C2, at pure bypass loads, is insignificant or not present thus leaving the behavior of the shear stresses to the shear nonlinearity parameter (d). Nevertheless, a more detailed study of the effect of fiber matrix shear and fiber tensile mechanisms on the failure predictions at high bypass stresses is recommended.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0021998311427766">Figure 9</xref>, shows the effect of the shear nonlinear behavior term (criteria C3B) and the shear damage parameter (criteria C3C). It is clear that the shear damage parameter improves results, as aforementioned the shear damage parameter reduces the shear stresses by reducing the shear modulus; this action enables the laminate to support more load (C3 and C3C). When the shear damage parameter is not present, the shear nonlinear term slightly improved results for the pure bearing case when compared to criteria C3A, but surprisingly, this term tended to reduce the ultimate failure load at high bypass stresses, which contradicts the finding for criteria A2.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0021998311427766">Figure 10</xref> shows the failure criteria and degradation models that best predicted failure. It is observed that the reason why 2D criteria predict reasonable results might be due to the inclusion of the shear damage parameter and the lack of out-of-plane shear terms and the delamination failure criterion. Nonetheless, it is important to recognize that bearing failure is a 3D phenomenon,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0021998311427766">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0021998311427766">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0021998311427766">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0021998311427766">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0021998311427766">41</xref></sup> which is affected by different parameters such as friction, stacking sequence, clamping forces, and delamination and the use of 2D criteria has to be taken with care.

When comparing models B1 and B2, utilizing degradation model 2, it can be seen that the extent of damage in model B1 is much greater than in model B2. As discussed earlier this is due to shear terms being added to the fiber failure criterion of model B2, which causes fiber damage to progress more rapidly and prevents other types of damage occurring prior to reaching the 3.5 mm fiber failure condition.

<p>The failure criteria for model A2 are quite different to models B1 and B2 with no delamination or fiber shear out failure and different formulations for matrix tensile, matrix compressive, and fiber tensile failure. Model B2 though is similar to model A2 in that it contains shear terms in the fiber tensile failure criterion. The results are similar to model B2, which can probably be accounted for by the inclusion of the shear terms in the fiber tensile failure criterion.</p>

The results for model C3C are similar to model B1. We might have expected model C3C to give similar results to models A2 and B2 as there is a shear term included in the fiber tensile failure criterion, which caused early failure in models A2 and B2. It would appear though that the effect of the shear term in the fiber tensile failure criterion is being mitigated in model C3C by the shear nonlinearity damage term, which reduces the shear stiffness values. This seems to slow down the fiber tensile failure whilst causing more fiber matrix failure.</p>

<sec id="sec11-0021998311427766" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Different stress-based failure criteria and degradation models have been applied to predict the final failure load and damage extension in a pin-jointed laminate subjected to variable bearing vs. bypass loads. The criteria factors that had greatest effect were the shear term in Hashin’s fiber tensile criterion and the shear nonlinearity damage parameter. It was observed that the use of the Hashin-type fiber tensile criterion may underestimate failure at bypass dominant loads if the damage parameter (shear–stress shear–strain nonlinearity) is not considered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0021998311427766">Figures 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0021998311427766">9</xref>). Moreover, if this damage parameter is considered when including the fiber matrix shear failure mechanism, predictions tend to slightly overestimate failure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0021998311427766">Figure 8</xref>). Additionally, it was noticed that changes in the post-initial failure degradation model had an important effect in the ultimate load prediction and that gradual degradation resulted in a more stable analysis giving improved results. The mesh convergence demonstrated that models with fewer elements gave very similar results to those with higher mesh densities. Furthermore, the criterion proposed to assess the final failure point (radial damaged distance) seems to provide very good results for all the failure criteria tested. The damage extension Figures in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table12-0021998311427766">Table 12</xref> showed a clear change in failure mode for the different bearing vs. bypass cases. It was observed that fiber compressive failure diminishes as the bypass load increases until it completely disappears in the pure bypass case. It is also clear that the tensile failure modes diminish as bearing forces become dominant.</p>
<p>The best overall failure predictions obtained were those made by criteria sets B1, C2, C3, and C4. However, it is very important to notice that criteria in group C are 2D and they do not consider delamination, which is an important failure mechanism. Criteria B1 with degradation model 2 was shown to be a very good choice among the different criteria tested, despite the fact that nonlinear shear behavior and the nonlinear damage parameter were not considered. It is recommended, though, that these parameters be considered in any laminate containing off-axis orientated layers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0021998311427766">51</xref></sup> All of the degradation models apart from model 2 reduce the material properties by 90% of their original value. This would seem a reasonable approach if this value is the lowest that can be reached whilst maintaining stability. Degradation model 2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0021998311427766">29</xref></sup> on the other hand varies the amount of reduction from 60% to 93% depending on the property and the failure criterion. There does not seem to be much basis for why this variation should be used and is questionable without some physical basis for the choices.</p>
