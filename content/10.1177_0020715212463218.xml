<p>This special issue of the <italic>International Journal of Comparative Sociology</italic> represents the inaugural, and long awaited, publication by members affiliated with the Politics and Interlocking Directorates Research Community. Over the half dozen years in which this international group of scholars has grown in numbers and geographical breadth, the members of this research community made several substantive contributions to research on interlocking corporate directors. First, as emphasized by the contributions within this special issue and chronicled in the narrative describing its formation, this group of researchers creates a rich <italic>international</italic> dialogue on interlocking directorate research. Additionally, through their shared research interests and expertise from around the world, the members of this community are purposefully establishing and sustaining a common focus on the relationships between interlocking directorates, the state and politics. As seen in a number of the contributions in this special issue, researchers within the Politics and Interlocking Directorates Research Community explore the political determinants of interlocking directors or articulate the political consequences of interlocking corporate directors. In addition to advancing comparative research on interlocking corporate directors, members of this community of scholars are also generating a strong research agenda that includes the analysis of transnational interlocking directorates. And finally, as the concluding article in this special issue underscores, the research community serves as a means to explore, debate and share new methods of conducting research on interlocking directorates. As the community continues to grow, the discussions concerning quantitative, qualitative and methods for visualizing networks of interlocking corporate directors will only become richer and more innovative. In this introduction to the contributions made by the Politics and Interlocking Directorates Research Community, I will limit my remaining comments to the origins of this group of scholars – a collection of individuals that includes far more researchers than are represented in this special issue. As the Guest Editor of this special issue, I also wish to highlight the momentum that this research community continues to generate, document its future growth, and use this introduction as an opportunity to invite all interested scholars to join our community. Finally, as fitting for an introductory essay, I will provide brief introductions to the four contributions.</p>
<sec id="section1-0020715212463218">
<title>Emergence of the Politics and Interlocking Directorates Research Community</title>
<p>The genesis of this international group of scholars began at the April 2006 International Sunbelt Social Network Conference of the International Network for Social Network Analysis in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. At this gathering, Nicholas Harrigan (Australian National University), Mathew Bond (Oxford University) and Josep Rodríguez (University of Barcelona), joined with a number of other researchers that employ social network techniques to describe and analyze structures of interlocking corporate directors. While research on interlocking directorates – the practice of a single individual serving on two or more corporate boards of directors – dates back to the beginning of the 20th century, recent developments in the analysis of social networks have renewed interest in this area of social research. Consequently, the participants at the Vancouver Sunbelt resolved to create an open community of scholars that would establish an email list and expand this collective by inviting anyone interested in advancing the scholarship in this facet of power structure research to join.</p>
<p>To this end, Nick Harrigan, Mathew Bond, Christofer Edling (Stockholm University), Julián Cárdenas and Josep Rodríguez (both from the University of Barcelona) organized a conference on 28 and 29 September 2006 at the University of Barcelona. Eighteen scholars from Canada, Germany, Poland, Spain, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, United Kingdom, and the United States participated. In addition to two days of outstanding presentations, the group laid plans to organize sessions at the 2007 Sunbelt conference and to seek an avenue to publish some of the members’ research – an initiative which is directly relevant to this special issue. Under the leadership of Bruce Cronin (University of Greenwich) and Mathew Bond, the research community established a Politics and Interlocking Directorates track within the 2007 International Sunbelt Social Network Conference in Corfu, Greece and formally launched the Politics and Interlocking Directorates Research Community. At the Corfu meeting, two sessions featured participants from the research community. In addition, members of the research community participated in a number of other sessions under the themes of international networks, visualizations, and the ontology and philosophy of networks. This gathering at the Sunbelt conference was followed by a similar clustering of papers at the January 2008 Sunbelt conference in Florida. Through all of these meetings, the number of scholars interested in participating in the Politics and Interlocking Directorates Research Community grew.</p>
<p>In addition to becoming a regular feature of the annual meeting of the International Sunbelt Social Network Conference, members of the research community were finding a number of other venues at which the community would gather. In the summer of 2008, Josep Rodríguez and Julián Cárdenas organized a panel of papers for the First International Sociological Association World Forum of Sociology in Barcelona. Seven members of the Politics and Interlocking Directorates Research Community presented papers at a Research Committee 02, Economy and Society session – Georgina Murray (Griffith University), William Carroll (University of Victoria), Vladimir Popov (University of Greenwich), Val Burris (University of Oregon) who presented a paper co-authored with Clifford Staples (University of North Dakota), and Jose Rodríguez, Julián Cárdenas and Anna Ramon (also from the University of Barcelona).</p>
<p>Two years later, the Politics and Interlocking Directorates Research Community organized three of the four interlocking directorates sessions scheduled at the 2010 International Sunbelt Social Network Conference in Riva del Garda, Italy. It is at this meeting that the authors first presented drafts of the articles that appear in this special issue. This was one of the largest meetings of the research community since the 2006 Barcelona meeting. Over two dozen researchers presented 17 academic papers involving interlocking directorates and social network analyses. The participants at this conference left with a renewed sense of engagement and agreed that we should double our efforts at producing a publication showcasing <italic>some</italic> of the work of the members within the community.</p>
<p>In addition to this current publication and the work involved in its production, the momentum generated at the Riva del Garda conference in 2010 also renewed our collective commitment by members of the research community to grow in numbers and scope. In February 2012, at the International Sunbelt Social Network Conference in Redondo Beach, California, Susie Pak (St Johns University) indicated her interest in participating in future gatherings of the community to add her historical perspective on J.P. Morgan &amp; Co. Also, to expand the representation of expertise in Southeast Asia, the research community would welcome participation of Jun Kanamitsu (Kyoto Sangyo University) in future meetings. Most recently in August of this year, members of the Politics and Interlocking Directorates Research Community participated in the Second International Sociological Association World Forum of Sociology in Buenos Aires. In addition to my own presentation of an article co-authored with Val Burris, Eelke Heemskerk and Meindert Fennema (both from the University of Amsterdam), Julián Cárdenas (now at the University of Antioquia), and Antoine Vion (Aix-Marseille University) and colleagues also presented articles at this RC02 session.</p>
<p>I am very encouraged by the growing interest and participation in the Politics and Interlocking Directorates Research Community. This community of scholars has matured to represent a cross-section of scholars in the complementary specializations of interlocking directorates, social network analyses, case studies, and comparative social research. The convergence of these themes produces a rich field in which future studies and initiatives are possible. Not only are systematic comparative studies in the tradition of Stokman, Ziegler and Scott’s 1985 <italic>Networks of Corporate Power</italic> and Paul Windolf’s 2002 <italic>Corporate Networks in Europe and the United States</italic>, possible, new comparative approaches and methodologies can be employed. Furthermore, the participation of scholars from Taiwan and Japan increases the likelihood of including research with a wider geographic scope. These aspirations are not simply idle speculations or wishful thinking as members of the research community are already organizing a series of sessions for the next meeting of the International Sunbelt Social Network Conference to be held in Hamburg, Germany on 21–26 May 2013. Not only will the research include a variety of case studies from a greater number of countries around the world, the expanding areas of expertise will provide an historical perspective. Indeed, the future of research in the area of interlocking corporate directorates is bright, with this special issue of the <italic>International Journal of Comparative Sociology</italic> marking a milestone for this line of scholarship – an area of research that is likely to be built upon in the future.</p>

<title>Interlocking directorates in comparative and historical perspective</title>
<p>The articles in this special issue demonstrate multiple dimensions of comparative sociology that employ a diverse range of levels of analyses – from contrasting case studies of transnational networks, multiple national cases within a single analytical framework, or historical analyses of a single case across time. The first article by Heemskerk, Mokken and Fennema demonstrates the utility of the last approach by developing a deep historical analysis of a single case. As the authors show, the configuration of corporate–state relations within a neo-corporatist political economy of the early 1970s, versus the neo-liberal political economy of the 1980s and 1990s, represent two very different Netherlands. Adopting an alternative comparative perspective, De Graaff contrasts the oil elite networks from the so-called global South with the network of elites from the major Western oil corporations. What makes this contribution unique is that the analyses compare transnational elite networks within the global oil market across the domains of business, policy planning, and the state. The analysis by Cárdenas demonstrates yet another comparative approach – the synthesis of multiple cases within a unified analytic framework. This article utilizes both social network analysis and fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis to identify combinations of factors to explain the emergence of different configurations of national networks of corporate interlocks. To conclude this special issue on interlocking directorates, the final article by Burris and Staples critically examines the methodological implications of how social network analyses have been applied in the prevailing scholarship that uses corporate interlocks to analyze transnational class formation. Through their critique, the authors also offer a number of promising alternatives.</p>
<p>The articles within this special issue also exemplify a variety of ways in which social network analysis can be applied. The article by Heemskerk, Mokken and Fennema uses social network analysis as a means to articulate historical changes in the political economy of the Netherlands at three points in time. The second article by De Graaff applies social network analysis to reveal two very different sets of transnational ties between the directors of the largest oil and gas companies in the world. In his innovative article, Cárdenas uses social network analysis not as a means to explain a particular phenomena such as the role of the state or the formation of an oil elite, but rather to develop a typology of national networks of interlocking directorates. This typology is then treated as the dependent variable to determine how well different financial structures, forms of state intervention, variable ownership structures and levels of economic internationalization predict placement of cases within the typology. In the most self-reflexive essay in this special issue, Burris and Staples critically examine the use of interorganizational data to analyze an interpersonal phenomenon – class formation. With this overview in mind, I will now highlight some of the key features of each individual contribution.</p>
<p>In the lead article, Heemskerk, Mokken and Fennema present an analysis of the changing corporate–state ties over an impressive time span – 1969 to 2006. By covering nearly 40 years of history, the authors are in a position to argue that the differences in network structure they document are reflective of the changing relationship between the state and business. While not squarely taking on the debate over the role of the state in capitalist democracies, the detailed historical analyses do provide an excellent illustration of how the key concepts within state theory – changes in industrial policy, the privatization of state-owned corporations, the emerge of autonomous administrative institutions, and processes of globalization – all contributed to a dramatic thinning of the corporate–government network. The historical shift from the older neo-corporatist political economy to the newer neo-liberal configuration of business–state relations has important implications for understanding the effects of the economic crisis of 2008. In addition to this sweeping historical arc, the article also provides an interesting case study of the changing relationship between business and the state vis-à-vis state universities. While the dominant trend was to reduce state–business ties, Heemskerk, Mokken and Fennema’s deeper analyses of this sphere of state activity demonstrate how neo-liberal policies designed to reform the governance of the Dutch state universities actually ‘re-wired’ the business–state relations within this sector. Although the article concludes in 2006, the authors rightly point out that the thinning of the relations between business and the Dutch state diminished the capacity of both groups to respond effectively with the 2008 economic downturn that was just around the corner. Finally, I would like to note that just as the historical analyses of this article cover a long trajectory, the group of scholars conducting this research also represents a significant historical arc as this research team consists of three ‘generations’ of scholars in the area of corporate network analysis in the Netherlands.</p>
<p>While the first article provides an in-depth historically comparative analysis of business–state relations, the second article moves to a comparison of transnational networks of oil elites. The article by De Graaff provides a systematic analysis of the corporate, policy planning, and state ties of the directors of the 10 largest oil companies in 2007. Readers will be particularly impressed by how it navigates multiple dimensions of the global oil elite network at different levels of analysis. While many studies on interlocking directorates define their ‘populations’ at the national or international level – every corporation in the US Fortune 500 or the corporations included in the Global 500 – this article constructs a unique dataset based on the ego networks of the directors from five major state-owned oil companies called National Oil Companies (NOCs) – Saudi Aramco, the National Iranian Oil Company, PDVSA, China National Petroleum Corporation, and Gazprom – as well as the five largest private oil companies referred to as International Oil Companies (IOCs) – ExxonMobil, BP, Royal Dutch Shell, Chevron and Total. Beginning with a comparison of the social networks formed by the corporate affiliations of the directors from these 10 oil companies, De Graaff documents how the board members of the NOCs are barely integrated within the network formed by the directors of private Western oil corporations (IOCs). Although business ties may not unite the elites from the NOCs, the researcher next explores whether transnational policy planning organizations such as the World Economic Forum or the European Roundtable of Industrialists serve to integrate Western and Southern oil elites. Again, the findings show that while the directors of the International Oil Companies participate in these policy planning groups, the oil elites from the National Oil Companies are largely excluded. The final facet of the research shows how the directors from the Southern oil companies are extensively linked through their ties with the state, while the board members from Western oil companies had limited and advisory ties with the state. Much like the first article in this special issue, the contribution by De Graaff addresses the role of the state since the author argues that the state has many reasons to be closely connected with the oil sector of the world economy. Yet, the neo-liberal project of unfettered markets and minimal state intervention results not so much in a removal of the state, but in a redefinition of its role – a role which produces very different configurations of business–state ties among the International Oil Companies versus the National Oil Companies.</p>
<p>In the previous two contributions, the researchers view social networks as a dependent phenomena affected by larger political and economic trends – whether the forces of increasingly neoliberal policies or the transformation of the global oil market. In the third article, Cárdenas offers another application of social network analysis in which he compares the corporate networks within a dozen advanced capitalist economies: Italy, France, Germany, Spain, Canada, Sweden, Netherlands, Australia, Switzerland, the United States, Japan, and the United Kingdom. In addition to an extensive review and integration of the literature on interlocking corporate directors, this article offers an extremely innovative set of analytic moves to make causal claims about the factors contributing to the type of corporate network observed. The research agenda begins by utilizing the social network measures of density, distance-based cohesion, degree centralization, reachability of the most central node, and multiplicity. The research next employs factor analysis to develop a typology and scale for two types of corporate networks – cohesive and dispersed. In what I consider to be the most ground-breaking aspect of his work on interlocking corporate directors, Cárdenas next employs fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis to confirm the placement of the different national networks of corporate directors within the typology. By examining the conjunctural configurations of different financial structures, forms of state intervention, variable ownership structures and levels of economic internationalization, the article is able to largely validate the categorization of networks as cohesive or dispersed. Not only does this article provide researchers interested in interlocking directorates with a new set of analytic tools, it grounds this analysis in a rich literature on the political economy of advanced capitalist economies.</p>
<p>The final article in this collection offers a compelling critique of the prevailing methods adopted by researchers that use interlocking corporate directorates as the structural foundation for the emergence of a transnational capitalist class. Burris and Staples begin with an analysis of how the very composition of the ‘populations’ used to compare the networks of transnational interlocks over time produce network effects. Specifically, the authors point out that the simple addition of one corporation domiciled in a country not included in the first time period would, on a statistical basis alone, exaggerate the case for an increase in transnational interlocking. While their analyses of this potential effect do not invalidate the trend towards increasing transnational interlocks, they do emphasize the need to consider the relative densities of domestic and transnational ties which appear to inflate the level of transnational interlocking in Europe. This conclusion raises a more essential question of what constitutes a reasonable ‘benchmark’ which would be indicative of substantive progress towards, or the establishment of, a transnational capitalist class. Using the data on the United States – a case representing a large diversified economy in which major corporations are geographically dispersed – the authors make a reasonable case that a ratio of thee local corporate interlocks to one interregional corporate interlock can serve as such a benchmark. Such a threshold would, on the one hand, give us reason to question the claim that a transnational capitalist class is emerging on a global level, but on the other hand, corroborates the research documenting the formation of a North Atlantic capitalist class. Burris and Staples next critically evaluate the specific use of inter-organizational data to evaluate the inter-personal process of class formation. By comparing the densities of intra-national versus transnational interpersonal ties, the authors also conclude that there is evidence showing a strong set of transnational ties within the North Atlantic region among the directors of the Global 500. Furthermore, the use of inter-organizational data obfuscates the complexity of how various configurations of interpersonal ties can form the structural basis for transnational class cohesion. The final contribution of the Burris and Staples article develops the concept of cohesion and argues that small world analyses provide a fruitful means to analyze the emergence of a transnational capitalist class. Their subsequent analyses provide further evidence that, while the directors within the Global 500 do not constitute a small world, the parameters of a small world do exist for directors in the North Atlantic region. In sum, the Burris and Staples article situates itself nicely within the transnational capitalist class debate and offers some interesting methodological critiques and robust empirical findings that support the more modest claim that a North Atlantic capitalist class has emerged.</p>
<p>I am confident that readers will find the articles in this special issue to be substantive contributions to the literature on interlocking corporate directorates. Not only does the quality of these articles bode well for the future of work integrating social network analysis with comparative political economy, I firmly believe that the research community from which these articles originated will begin to thrive and gain momentum with future meetings and collections of articles from this group. In concluding, I wish to express my sincere gratitude to the many anonymous reviewers who brought to bear their extensive knowledge of the field and their methodological expertise to improve the original submissions. I would also like to thank Professor David A Smith for his confidence in, and commitment to, this project. It is through his leadership that this special issue has come to fruition and for that, I will always be grateful. Next, I would be remiss if I did not explicitly thank the authors of these articles. Their timely submission and responsiveness to their reviews has kept this project alive. Finally, I wish to thank the many participants in the Politics and Interlocking Directorates Research Community for their past and future engagement with this growing community of scholars. As noted above, the future of the research in interlocking corporate directorates is promising indeed.</p>
