<abstract>
<p>Using data from a national survey with 1,288 respondents, this study investigates the socio-demographic determinants of the first-order digital divide (access to the Internet) and the second-order digital divide (e-commerce use) in China. The survey employed spatial probability sampling technology so it would encompass migrants as well as registered residents. Multiple logistic regressions were applied to model the associations between access to the Internet/e-commerce use and demographic characteristics, socio-economic attributes, and migration and residency status. The results demonstrate the significant effects of rural-urban inequality and socio-economic divisions in Internet access. Age, gender, education, and residency were identified as significant predictors for individual e-commerce use. The findings provide helpful information for enterprises wishing to broaden their business horizons. The research can also be used in designing effective policies to reduce China’s digital inequality.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>With the rapid development of e-commerce, the Internet has become an important means of acquiring information on products and services. Internet users can now search and compare goods with great flexibility. As e-commerce becomes increasingly common, the digital divide in information and communications technologies (ICTs) in China is a matter of growing concern for researchers, consumers, and marketers. Online consumers are fundamentally different from traditional consumers: information technology has unique characteristics that have led to new types of cultural and social interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0266666912450168">Chau et al. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0266666912450168">Dai and King 2008</xref>). A better understanding of the ways in which the digital divide affects individuals’ e-commerce activities is vital to the development of effective policy strategies to broaden business horizons and reduce inequality in China.</p>
<p>“Digital divide” refers to the separation between those who have access to, and the capacity to use, digital ICTs and those do not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0266666912450168">Dewan and Riggins 2005</xref>). There is a significant global digital divide between industrially developed and developing countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0266666912450168">Billon et al. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0266666912450168">Pick and Azari 2008</xref>). Within countries, the digital divide is closely associated with socio-economic status (DiMaggio et al. 2004; Hsieh et al. 2008). In China, the digital divide is growing between urban and rural populations as their economic and social disparities increase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0266666912450168">Fong 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>To what extent do demographic characteristics, socio-economic attributes, and migration and residency status affect the use of the Internet and e-commerce in China? What are the determinants of the digital divide in the area of individual e-commerce activity? What factors associated with the digital divide are unique to China? Numerous studies have been undertaken worldwide to examine the digital divide at the individual level, and various theories have been offered to explain it. Those researching the use of ICTs in China, however, have conducted few empirical studies, relying instead on descriptive research and theoretical discussions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0266666912450168">Qiu and Chan 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0266666912450168">Kluver and Yang 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Based on data from a national household survey, the present study investigates the socio-demographic determinants of the digital divide in individual e-commerce utilization in China. The divide operates on two levels: access to the Internet (the first-order digital divide) and e-commerce use (the second-order digital divide) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0266666912450168">Zhu 2011</xref>). Our purpose is to analyze the ongoing and foreseeable influence of various demographic and socio-economic factors on the digital divide at the individual level. By testing a series of hypotheses, we aim to provide a more sophisticated understanding of the digital divide in China.</p>

<title>The urban-rural digital divide in China</title>
<p>Since the 1950s, the Chinese government has relied on the household registration (<italic>hukou</italic>) system to restrict the migration of its population, particularly from rural to urban areas. The productivity in rural areas was poor and the process of urbanization was slow until the 1980s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0266666912450168">Chan 1994</xref>). Since the reforms of the 1980s, China’s economic growth has been dramatic: the average GDP growth rate reached over 8 percent per annum. Yet, statistics also show that the average annual disposable income of urban residents was 2.9 times that of rural residents in 2009 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0266666912450168">National Bureau of Statistics of China 2010</xref>). The increase in urban-rural income inequality is a significant obstacle to further economic and social development.</p>
<p>The income gap between urban and rural populations in China is reflected in the digital divide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0266666912450168">Fong 2009</xref>). Although the number of rural Internet users is growing, the urban-rural digital divide has continued to widen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0266666912450168">China Internet Network Information Center 2010b</xref>). As <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0266666912450168">Figure 1</xref> illustrates, nearly 45 percent of urban residents have access to the Internet, compared to 15 percent of rural residents. Urban residents are almost twice as likely to make purchases and payments online.</p>

</fig>
<p>According to the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0266666912450168">China Internet Network Information Center (2010b</xref>), the leading causes of low Internet use in rural areas include the lack of infrastructure and public resources for Internet access and the comparatively high costs for domestic access. Lack of basic knowledge about the Internet and other ICTs among rural residents is also a significant factor. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0266666912450168">Figure 1</xref> indicates that rural Internet users are more likely to be students. However, the dropout rate in rural schools is very high, usually due to economic constraints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0266666912450168">Fong 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Post-1978 economic reforms, which relaxed the strictly enforced limits on rural-to-urban relocation, led to massive migrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0266666912450168">Chan and Zhang 1999</xref>). The rural-to-urban migration of over 200 million people has had mixed effects on the digital divide. As rural-to-urban migrants are typically young, relatively highly educated, and male (and, therefore, likely to be IT-proficient), their abandonment of the countryside further widens the existing digital divide (Chen and Zhang 2009). In cities, however, migrant workers have more difficulties accessing ICTs than urban residents. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0266666912450168">Zhu and Wang (2005</xref>), the migrant population is less likely to have Internet access at home or in the workplace; millions rely on Internet cafés. The public access available at these cafés is often not sufficiently secure to allow for e-commerce activities. In addition, migrant workers are likely to be more restricted in their modes of payment and delivery, which can hamper e-commerce transactions.</p>
<p>The institutionalized urban-rural divide associated with the <italic>hukou</italic> system and the massive rural-to-urban migration are phenomena unique to China. The resultant disparity in access to ICTs is an important measure of the digital divide. The segment of the population that has little or no accessibility to information technologies is denied other social and economic opportunities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0266666912450168">Fong 2009</xref>). In order to address the digital divide, it is necessary for this group to become proficient in the use of ICTs. If effectively used, ICTs can advance the opportunities of people who are socially or economically disadvantaged. Identifying and addressing the factors associated with the digital divide in China, therefore, is crucial.</p>

<title>The development of individual e-commerce in China</title>
<p>The Internet has created opportunities for online purchases of products and services, banking, travel booking, stock trading, games, music downloads, communication with friends, and information acquisition. According to the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0266666912450168">China Internet Network Information Center (2010a</xref>), the number of Internet users in China reached almost 420 million by June 2010. Online shopping, bill payment, and banking are the three top Internet applications, accounting for 142 million, 128 million, and 122 million users respectively (33.8 percent, 30.5 percent, and 29.1 percent of all Internet users). Chinese Internet users were quick to adapt to e-commerce. The Chinese online population is now the driving force of e-commerce expansion in the world.</p>
<p>Accessible means of payment and cheap delivery services are necessary conditions for the expansion of e-commerce (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0266666912450168">Shan and Liu 2009</xref>). There has been a rapid development of various methods of payment across China (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0266666912450168">Li and Buhalis 2006</xref>). According to the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0266666912450168">China Internet Network Information Center (2003</xref>), Chinese e-commerce users do not seem to be troubled by the payment methods available for online purchases: only 3 percent of users complain that they are not convenient. The distribution of products and services has been facilitated by emerging logistics companies and partnerships between online merchants and delivery services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0266666912450168">Efendioglu and Yip 2004</xref>). Only about 10 percent of customers feel that delivery is slow in China; the majority are satisfied with the conditions of e-commerce (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0266666912450168">China Internet Network Information Center 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>It seems, then, that payment systems, delivery services, and related conditions are not the main obstacles to China’s e-commerce development. Our analysis will, therefore, focus primarily on the personal factors affecting individuals’ e-commerce utilization. Such a focus is necessary if we wish to encourage e-commerce and lessen the digital divide in China.</p>

<title>Literature review and research hypotheses</title>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0266666912450168">Dewan and Riggins (2005</xref>), the digital divide occurs at three levels: individual, organizational, and global. At the individual level, “those who are technologically, sociologically, or economically disadvantaged may lack or forgo access to IT, creating a gap between themselves and those who choose to make ICT an integral part of their daily life” (p. 300). The digital divide is also characterized as either first or second order: the first order is unequal access to ICTs, and the second order is the ability, or lack thereof, to use ICTs among those who have access (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0266666912450168">Zhu 2011</xref>). This study examines both orders at the individual level. It takes into account a variety of factors, including demographic characteristics, socio-economic attributes, and migration and residency status. Some of these factors have been routinely identified in the existing literature; others are unique to China.</p>
<sec id="section5-0266666912450168">
<title>The first-order digital divide (access to the Internet)</title>
<p>As noted, the first-order digital divide is based on access to the Internet. In China, certain demographic, socio-economic, and residential factors significantly affect Internet use.</p>
<sec id="section6-0266666912450168">
<title>Demographic characteristics</title>
<p>Research in the US suggests that computer and Internet use by students is widespread and begins at an early age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0266666912450168">DeBell and Chapman 2006</xref>). Younger Americans are much more IT-proficient than older ones (Pew <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0266666912450168">Internet 2003</xref>). Findings on the relationship between gender and access to the Internet are contradictory: Pew <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0266666912450168">Internet (2003</xref>) holds that gender is not a significant factor for Internet use, whereas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0266666912450168">Bimber (2000</xref>) maintains that there is a statistically significant gender gap. Married people are more likely to be occupied by housework and childcare and, therefore, are less likely to spend time on the Internet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0266666912450168">Bimber 2000</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0266666912450168">Fairlie (2004</xref>) reports that racial and ethnic minorities in the US have significantly less Internet access than whites and that this gap cannot be wholly attributed to differences in income. On the basis of the existing research, we construct the following hypotheses regarding the relationship between access to the Internet and age, gender, marital status, and ethnicity in China:

<title>Socio-economic attributes</title>
<p>Digital inequality is closely associated with social inequality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0266666912450168">Norris 2001</xref>). Socio-economic factors play a large role in the first-order digital divide: education and income are the primary factors contributing to Internet use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0266666912450168">Jung et al. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0266666912450168">Lenhart 2002</xref>). Studies consistently show that schools can help bridge the digital divide in computer use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0266666912450168">DeBell and Chapman 2006</xref>) and that better-educated people are more technologically adept than those who are less educated (Pew <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0266666912450168">Internet 2003</xref>). Occupation is an important indicator of socio-economic status. Professionals are more likely to rely on the Internet and, therefore, have ensured access to it. Access to the Internet increases with family income (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0266666912450168">Martin and Robinson 2007</xref>). However, the information collected in social surveys regarding personal and household income is often unreliable. For this reason, we do not include income in our analysis. Instead, we examine another, uniquely Chinese, indicator: membership in the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). Research has shown that CCP membership is associated with higher social status and more political privileges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0266666912450168">Wu and Treimen 2004</xref>). It is therefore likely that CCP members have greater access to the Internet than non-members. On the basis of these socio-economic findings, we posit the following hypotheses:
<list list-type="simple">
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>H1-5. </italic>People who are better educated are more likely to access the Internet.</p>

<sec id="section8-0266666912450168">
<title>Migration and residency status</title>
<p>Increasing urbanization and migration are likely to widen the existing digital divide between the urban and rural areas. The growing number of rural-to-urban migrants prompted the following hypothesis:

<title>The second-order digital divide (e-commerce use)</title>
<p>Demographic characteristics, socio-economic attributes, and migration and residency status also contribute to the second-order digital divide (e-commerce use) among Chinese Internet users.</p>
<sec id="section10-0266666912450168">
<title>Demographic characteristics</title>
<p>Demographic characteristics such as age, gender, marital status, and race/ethnicity are significant indicators of e-commerce activities in many countries. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0266666912450168">Akhter (2003</xref>) found that the likelihood of e-commerce use decreased with age because older people are more committed to existing behaviors and reluctant to adopt new technologies. Gender may also play a role in e-commerce activity, but the results of studies tracking the association between gender and e-commerce are contradictory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0266666912450168">Hwang 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0266666912450168">Slyke et al. 2002</xref>): some researchers found that men were more likely to make online purchases than women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0266666912450168">Akhter 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0266666912450168">Cho and Jialin 2008</xref>), whereas others maintain that women account for most online shopping (Black 2007). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0266666912450168">Liebermann and Stashevsky (2002</xref>), married people are more likely to worry about the risks of e-commerce than unmarried people and are, therefore, less likely to participate. Although in many countries racial and ethnic minorities have less access to the Internet, studies in the US show that race has no significant impact on levels of online shopping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0266666912450168">Horrigan 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0266666912450168">Ono and Zavodny 2003</xref>). Research in Malaysia, however, indicates that race is significantly associated with online shopping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0266666912450168">Harn et al. 2006</xref>). Based on research undertaken in other countries, we propose the following hypotheses regarding the potential relationship between individual e-commerce use and age, gender, marital status, and ethnicity in China:

<title>Socio-economic attributes</title>
<p>Socio-economic attributes may also contribute to the second-order digital divide. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0266666912450168">Akhter (2003</xref>) argues that level of education affects the evaluation of purchases: the decisions of poorly educated consumers are less informed than those of the well-educated. In the context of online shopping, where brands and prices can be easily compared, people with higher education are more likely to be attracted by the availability of information and not be as fearful of the risks associated with online purchases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0266666912450168">Liebermann and Stashevsky 2002</xref>). Few studies have taken occupation into account when investigating individual e-commerce activities. Occupation is highly correlated with education: professionals are likely to make better use of online information and be more engaged in e-commerce activities. Income also has been shown to have a direct influence on e-commerce use. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0266666912450168">Akhter (2003</xref>), the likelihood of on-line shopping increases with income because wealthy people value the time-saving features of the Internet. Without a reliable measure of income, we use CCP membership as an indicator of higher socio-economic status in China. With regard to socio-economic attributes, we posit the following hypotheses:

<p>The rural-to-urban migrant population is likely to have greater access to the Internet in the city and greater exposure to e-commerce than the rural population. Compared to urban residents, however, migrants are at a disadvantage because they often do not have a fixed address to establish Internet access and arrange for deliveries. They may also encounter difficulties when applying for credit cards, which are the preferred method of payment for online transactions. For these reasons, we propose the following hypothesis:

<sec id="section14-0266666912450168">
<title>Sample and data collection</title>
<p>Data for this study come from the national Migration and Quality of Life survey of 1,288 Chinese respondents between 18 and 70. The survey employed spatial probability sampling technology to reach the migrant population. With this type of sampling, physical spaces are selected based on the local population density. This density is computed by combining census statistics with information gained from satellite images. Once each space is enumerated, one adult is randomly selected from each dwelling according to the Kish grid method. The great advantage of spatial probability sampling is that local residents are selected regardless of their registration status. The result is a highly representative sample, which includes migrants as well as registered residents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0266666912450168">Landry and Shen 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>The survey was undertaken during May and June 2011. The 26 primary sampling units (PSUs) and 54 secondary sampling units (SSUs) were spread over 20 provinces, 28 cities, and 33 urban districts or counties. A total of 1,906 household addresses were sampled and 1,288 interviews were completed (a response rate of 67.6 percent). All interviews were conducted in person by trained interviewers. The average interview length was 38.3 minutes. To ensure quality control, a random sample of the participants were called back after the interview to validate the data. Ten cases were excluded due to missing data, leaving a sample of 1,278 for the analysis.</p>

<title>Measures</title>
<sec id="section16-0266666912450168">
<title>Access to the Internet</title>
<p>Respondents answered the following question: “On average, how many days do you go online per week?” The number of days was recoded into a dichotomous variable with “1 = one to seven days” indicating “access to the Internet,” and “0 = zero days” indicating “no access to the Internet.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-0266666912450168">
<title>E-commerce use</title>
<p>The following question was asked in the survey: “Have you participated in online shopping?” The answer was dichotomously coded with “1” indicating “online shopping experience.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-0266666912450168">
<title>Demographic characteristics</title>
<p>Demographic information includes age, gender (1 = female; 0 = male), marital status (1 = married; 0 = other), and ethnicity (1 = ethnic minority; 0 = Han).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-0266666912450168">
<title>Socio-economic attributes</title>
<p>Measures of socio-economic attributes include education (1 = less than middle school; 2 = middle school; 3 = high school or vocational school; and 4 = college or above), occupation (1 = professional/managerial occupation; 0 = other), and CCP membership (1 = CCP member; 0 = not a CCP member).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section20-0266666912450168">
<title>Migration and residency status</title>
<p>Three categories of migration and residency status were coded for the analysis: urban residents (those with urban <italic>hukou</italic> residing in an urban area), rural-to-urban migrants (those with rural <italic>hukou</italic> residing in an urban area), and rural residents (those with rural <italic>hukou</italic> residing in a rural area).</p>

<sec id="section21-0266666912450168">
<title>Analysis</title>
<p>Descriptive statistics (sample means/percentages and standard errors) were computed and reported for the whole sample and two subsamples (Internet users and online shoppers). Multiple logistic regressions were estimated (for both the whole sample and the subsample of Internet users) to model the relationships between respondents’ access to the Internet and e-commerce use and their demographic characteristics, socio-economic attributes, and migration and residency status. Model 1 includes only demographic characteristics (age, gender, marital status, and ethnicity). We added migration and residency status in Model 2 to assess the urban-rural divide when controlling for demographic factors. Model 3 is our full model, which includes measures of socio-economic attributes (education, occupation, and CCP membership). The difference between Models 2 and 3 in the coefficient on migration and residency status demonstrates the extent to which the urban-rural divide persists after controlling for socio-economic factors. Odds ratios and 95 percent confidence intervals were calculated and reported for these multiple logistic regressions.</p>

The mean age of Internet users is 33 and of online shoppers, 32. The majority of Internet users and online shoppers attended high school, and about 40 percent of the Internet users and more than half of the online shoppers have a college level or higher education. About one-third of the Internet users and 43 percent of the online shoppers work as professionals or managers, and nearly 20 percent are CCP members.</p>
<p>In terms of migration and residency status, 39 percent of the whole sample are urban residents; 17 percent, rural-to-urban migrants; and 44 percent, rural residents.

<p>According to Model 2, which includes measures for migration and residency status but not socio-economic factors, the likelihood of access to the Internet for urban residents is five times that of rural-to-urban migrants (odds ratio = .18, p &lt; .001) and more than six times that of rural residents (odds ratio = .15, p &lt; .001). When socio-economic attributes are added in Model 3, these disparities decrease but are still significant. Urban residents’ access to the Internet is double that of rural-to-urban migrants (odds ratio = .46, p &lt; .01) and rural residents (odds ratio = .48, p &lt; .001). All our socio-economic measures are significantly associated with access to the Internet. Most strikingly, respondents with a college-level education or higher are 25 times more likely to have access to the Internet (odds ratio = 25.69, p &lt; .001). A professional or managerial job or a CCP membership doubles the likelihood of having access to the Internet (odds ratio = 2.36, p &lt; .001, odds ratio = 2.12, p &lt; .05, respectively). The regression results in Model 2 and Model 3 support our hypotheses H1-5, H1-6, H1-7, and H1-8.</p>

<p>The urban-rural divide in e-commerce activity is significant, providing some support for hypothesis H2-8. According to Model 2 (which has no controls for socio-economic measures), urban residents are almost four times as likely to shop online as rural residents (odds ratio = .28, p &lt; .001). Even according to Model 3 (which includes socio-economic factors), urban residents are twice as likely to shop online (odds ratio = .51, p &lt; .05). The difference between rural-to-urban migrants and urban residents in terms of their e-commerce use proposed in hypothesis H2-8 is minor and not statistically significant once socio-economic factors are taken into account. Among those who have access to the Internet, a college-level education or higher is a strong predictor of online shopping activity (odds ratio = 5.61, p &lt; .05), which supports hypothesis H2-5. Other socio-economic attributes such as occupation and CCP membership are not significantly associated with online shopping activity as hypothesized in H2-6 and H2-7.</p>

<title>Discussion and conclusion</title>
<p>Using data from a national survey, this study investigates the first-order and second-order digital divides in China. Its findings support most of our hypotheses regarding the relationship between access to the Internet and demographic characteristics, socio-economic attributes, and migration and residency status. The results confirm the existing research: Chinese people’s access to the Internet is stratified according to age, gender, education, and occupation. Marital status and ethnicity are not significant factors. CCP membership functions as a significant socio-economic indicator. There is a striking urban-rural divide in access to the Internet in China. Rural-to-urban migrants still lag behind urban residents in terms of access to the Internet.</p>
<p>The predictors of e-commerce activity chosen for this study do not prove as satisfactory as those related to access. Our research hypotheses are only partially supported by the results. Age, gender, college education, and rural residency are identified as significant predictors for individual e-commerce use. But the relationship between gender and e-commerce activity does not correspond to our prediction: women are more likely to shop online in China. Among those who have access to the Internet, urban-to-rural migrants have more in common with urban residents than with rural residents in terms of online shopping experience after controlling for socio-economic factors.</p>
<p>Based on empirical data, the study provides an in-depth understanding of the first-order and second-order digital divides in China. The findings have implications for the country’s e-commerce development. Technological innovations in information and communication play a central role in economic growth and social development. However, the uneven distribution of ICTs means that groups who have no or limited access may be denied socio-economic opportunities. For underserved populations, gaining access to information and communication is more important than acquiring leading-edge technologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0266666912450168">European Commission 2001</xref>). Bridging the digital divide will contribute to the upward mobility of currently disadvantaged individuals and groups. This study identifies factors that have encouraged the digital divide in China. The results demonstrate the extent of rural-urban inequality and the socio-economic barriers to access to the Internet. Effective policy strategies must be designed and implemented to bridge the digital divide and reduce this inequality.</p>
<p>Innovative trading and transaction platforms for e-commerce have broadened business horizons significantly. Advances in information technology have increased the number of users and accelerated the transactions on these platforms. Many businesses are currently investing in these new opportunities, but their marketing excludes individuals with limited access. Isolating the factors affecting individual e-commerce utilization is critical to planning and implementing business strategies that expand the potential market. Age, gender, college education, and urban residency are identified as significant predictors for individual e-commerce activity in this study. A strategy that focuses not only on reducing barriers to Internet access but also on promoting e-commerce use in groups that have been previous underserved is essential.</p>
<p>The study has a few limitations that could be addressed in future research. There is only one measure for access to the Internet and one measure for online shopping experience. More information regarding Internet usage (e.g., locations of Internet access, frequency of Internet use, major activities on the Internet, and frequency of information searches) and more measures of e-commerce activity (e.g., frequency of online purchasing, items purchased online, amount spent on online purchases, and motivations for online purchase) would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the digital divide. Also, as noted above, our predictors of e-commerce activity do not prove to be as significant as our predictors of Internet access. Future studies should explore other factors that might contribute to individual e-commerce activity in China: there may be, for example, psychological factors that have explanatory and predictive power in the Chinese context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0266666912450168">Ajzen 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0266666912450168">Davis 1989</xref>). Other factor that would be useful to explore are Internet experience and computer skills, which are necessary attributes for efficient e-commerce activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0266666912450168">Howard et al. 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite the limitations noted above, this study represents the first stage of an important investigation of the digital divide in individual e-commerce utilization in China. The findings of a national survey underscore the extent of rural-urban inequalities and the socio-economic barriers to Internet access and e-commerce activity. Based on rigorous empirical investigations, the research represents a provocative and informative glimpse into the digital divide in the Chinese context.</p>
