<abstract>
<p>Postterm pregnancy represents a condition associated with trophoblast apoptosis. Kisspeptin is a peptide able to induce apoptosis by a specific receptor, GPR54, through the upregulation of proapoptotic genes. The aims of the study were to evaluate (1) the messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of kisspeptin, <italic>GPR54</italic>, <italic>Bax/Bcl2</italic>, and <italic>p21</italic> in postterm placentas and (2) kisspeptin ability to act on apoptosis in the third trimester placental explants. Placental specimens were collected from spontaneous term and postterm delivery and kisspeptin, <italic>GPR54</italic>, <italic>Bax/Bcl2</italic>, and <italic>p21</italic> mRNA expression levels were analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Placental explants, collected from elective term cesarean sections, treated with different doses of kisspeptin were analyzed by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL). The expression levels of all the genes studied in postterm placentas were significantly higher than in-term placentas. Kisspeptin-induced apoptosis in placental explants with a dose-dependent effect, and TUNEL assay demonstrated the kisspeptin involvement in the apoptotic placental processes. Our present findings led us to hypothesize that kisspeptin may represent a placental proapoptotic agent acting in physiological and/or pathological pregnancy conditions in which placental apoptosis mechanisms are increased.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Postterm pregnancy is associated with increased trophoblast apoptotic process,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1933719112443878">1</xref></sup> a mechanism implicated in placental senescence and parturition. The rate of apoptosis increases physiologically with advancing gestational age<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1933719112443878">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1933719112443878">3</xref>
</sup>; placental apoptosis increases progressively throughout pregnancy and plays a role in differentiation, syncytial fusion, and degeneration of villous trophoblasts. The association between apoptosis and gestational age suggests that kisspeptin may be involved in placental aging.</p>
<p>Kisspeptins are peptides derived from the primary translation product of the <italic>KiSS-1</italic> gene, a 145 amino acid polypeptide <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1933719112443878">4</xref></sup> that, following a proteolytic processing, results in shorter kisspeptins of 54 (Kp-54, metastin), 14 (Kp-14), 13 (Kp-13), or 10 (Kp-10) amino acids.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1933719112443878">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1933719112443878">6</xref>
</sup> They inhibit metastasis in various tumors and through their receptor, GPR54 (KiSS-1R), induce the apoptotic pathway in malignant cells upregulating different genes as <italic>p21</italic>, which is involved in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1933719112443878">7</xref></sup> During pregnancy, syncytotrophoblast expresses kisspeptins and its receptor, whereas the extravillous cytotrophoblast only expresses the receptor KiSS-1R,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1933719112443878">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1933719112443878">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1933719112443878">9</xref>
</sup> mediating the kisspeptins repressive effect on trophoblast invasion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1933719112443878">5</xref></sup> Additionally, in preterm delivery, KiSS-1 placental messenger RNA (mRNA) expression is elevated,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1933719112443878">10</xref></sup> suggesting a possible role of this protein in the local placental mechanisms leading to parturition.</p>
<p>The present study aimed to evaluate (1) the expression of kisspeptin, KiSS-1R, and apoptotic markers (<italic>Bax/Bcl2</italic> and <italic>p21</italic>) at the mRNA level in in-term and postterm placentas after spontaneous delivery and (2) kisspeptin effect to act on apoptosis in placental explants.</p>

<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<p>A group of women (n = 37) receiving perinatal care at our Division of Obstetrics and Gynecology was included in the present study. Placental specimens were collected from women who underwent spontaneous vaginal delivery, according to the timing of delivery:</p>
<list list-type="roman-lower">
<list-item>
<p>at term (n = 9, gestational age between 38 and 40 weeks);</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>at postterm (n = 10, gestational age &gt;41 weeks).</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>Gestational age was calculated on the basis of the last menstrual period and confirmed by ultrasound evaluation. Additional inclusion criteria were the presence of intact fetal membranes before labor, no preexisting clinical conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, or autoimmune disease, no obstetric complications, and no evidence of chorioamnionitis or any other infections. Women with a previous history of thrombosis, recurrent spontaneous abortions, preeclampsia, fetal demise, or small for gestational age infant were excluded from the study.</p>
<p>Transvaginal sonography was performed for the diagnosis of placenta previa, defined as internal os–placental distance from 20 to 0 mm. All the women with a placenta &lt;20 mm from the internal os required cesarean delivery.</p>
<p>Informed written consent was obtained from all the patients before their enrollment in the study, for which approval was obtained from the local Human Investigation Committee. Tissues collected were immediately submerged in an RNA stabilization reagent (RNA later, Quiagen, Milan, Italy) and frozen at −80°C until assay.</p>
<sec id="section3-1933719112443878">
<title>RNA Extraction and cDNA Preparation</title>
<p>Samples were collected under sterile conditions and immediately snap frozen in liquid nitrogen to preserve RNA from RNase action and then stored at −80°C until assay. Frozen samples were disrupted and homogenized using Mixer Mill MM 300 (Quiagen), and total RNA was extracted with RNeasy Protect Mini Kit and then treated with RNase-free DNase, according to the instructions of the manufacturer (RNase protect Mini Kit Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). RNA was quantified by UV absorption (OD260) using Nanodrop (Celbio, Milan, Italy), and RNA purity was determined from the OD260:OD280 ratio. The purified RNA was stored at −80°C until complementary DNA (cDNA) preparation.</p>
<p>About 1 μg of RNA were reverse transcribed to prepare cDNA. Reverse transcription was carried out in a reaction volume of 20 µL containing 50 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 75 mmol/L KCl, 3 mmol/L MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 mmol/L dithiothreitol, 5 mmol/L random hexamer primers, 2.7 mmol/L deoxynucleoside triphosphate, and 10 U/mL SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (RT; all reagents obtained from Invitrogen Life Technologies, Milan, Italy). Negative control for each reaction consisted of reverse transcription performed in the absence of the RT enzyme  or in the absence of RNA samples (H<sub>2</sub>ORT). RNA was initially denatured at 85°C for 5 minutes. The reaction mixture was then added, and RT was performed at 50°C for 40 minutes. The reaction was stopped by denaturing the enzyme at 85°C for 15 minutes. The cDNA was subsequently subjected to real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (q-PCR).</p>

<title>Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction</title>
<p>Differences in mRNA expression of <italic>KiSS-1</italic>, <italic>KiSS1-R</italic>, <italic>Bax/Bcl2</italic>, and <italic>p21</italic> were compared by qRT-PCR (TaqMan PCR; Applied Biosystems, Weiterstadt, Germany) using an Opticon 2 thermal cycler (MJ Research, Bio-Rad Laboratories, Waltham, Massachusetts). The housekeeping gene <italic>β-actin</italic> (assay identification no. Hs99999903_m1) was used as internal standard. All samples were run in triplicate on 96-well optical PCR plates (Applied Biosystems), optimized to the universal PCR protocol of the manufacturer, with a TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). TaqMan probe for <italic>KiSS-1</italic> (assay identification no. Hs00158486_m1), <italic>KiSS1-R</italic> (assay identification no.

After an initial denaturation for 10 minutes at 95°C, denaturation in the subsequent 40 cycles was performed for 15 seconds at 95°C, followed by primer annealing and elongation at 60°C for 1 minute. The ▵▵CT method was applied as a comparative method of quantification.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1933719112443878">11</xref></sup>

<title>Placental Explant and Treatment</title>
<p>Placental villi were collected from elective cesarean sections at term. Placental explants were extensively washed and dissected under sterile conditions in ice-cold Hanks balanced salt solution supplemented with penicillin and streptomycin. The explants (50 mg/wet weight) were placed in 24-well plastic plates and cultured in Dulbecco Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mmol/L <sc>l</sc>-glutamine, 100 IU/mL penicillin, and 100 μg/mL streptomycin at 37°C under 5% CO<sub>2</sub> and 95% air. The culture medium was replaced with fresh DMEM after 1 day, the explants were treated with different concentration of kisspeptin-10 (Sigma Aldrich, Milan, Italy; 10, 10<sup>−4</sup> nmol/L) or vehicle dissolved in fresh DMEM. Concentrations of kisspeptin were chosen based on similarity to its plasmatic concentrations in healthy pregnant women, in which the range is 1.23 to 9.59 nmol/L. Placental villi clusters were collected after 6 hours of treatment and immediately fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin, embedded in paraffin, and cut into 5-μm sections. To document kisspeptin-induced apoptosis in situ, we used ApopTag In Situ Apoptosis Kit (Chemicon) immunostaining on paraffin sections according to the manufacturer’s instructions.</p>

<title>Detection of Apoptotic Cells Showing DNA Fragmentation</title>
<p>In order to detect apoptotic cells, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) method was performed using an ApopTag Peroxidase In Situ Apoptosis Dectection kit (Chemicon International, Oncor, Maryland). Sections were deparaffinized, rehydrated, and treated with proteinase K (20 μg/mL) for 15 minutes at room temperature, washed in distilled water, quenched of endogenous peroxidase in 2% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in phosphate-buffered saline, and subsequently mixed with digoxigenin-labeled dUTP in the presence of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase followed by peroxidase-conjugated anti-digoxigenin antibody. Nuclear staining in apoptotic cells was detected by 3′,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride dihydrate, according to the manufacturer’s instructions (ApopTag, Oncor, Gaithersburg, Maryland).</p>

<sec id="section7-1933719112443878">
<title>Establishment of AI</title>
<p>Apoptotic cells or bodies can be recognized more easily in semithin resin-embedded sections than in paraffin-embedded sections. We therefore reembedded tissues into Epon-Araldite resin (Monojet, Kildare, Ireland) and stained 1 μm sections with Azur A. First, mean ± standard deviation of the number of intact cells per High Power field (HPF) was registered in 20 randomly chosen HPFs using an oil immersion objective (100×). We then assessed the apoptotic index (AI) by registering the numbers of apoptotic cells or bodies in each HPF of an entire section (often &gt;100 HPF) to obtain AI. With this approach, we obtained an AI that corresponded well with the percentage of cells exhibiting in situ end labeling (TUNEL) of DNA to show strand breaks, with intra- and inter-observer reproducibility of counts at more than 95%.</p>

<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>All data were assessed for normality of distribution using a computer program (Prism 4; Graphpad Software, California). Where the data were normally distributed, the differences among 3 or more groups were analyzed by analysis of variance with Tukey multiple comparison test. Two groups were analyzed using a <italic>t</italic> test. Chi-square test was used to compare proportions. Statistical significance was achieved when <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Kisspeptins are peptides that have a proapoptotic effect through the upregulation of proapoptotic genes. The present study showed for the first time that <italic>KiSS-1</italic>, <italic>KiSS-1R</italic>, and <italic>P21</italic> mRNA expression is higher in postterm than in-term placentas and confirmed that the <italic>Bax/Bcl2</italic> ratio is higher in postterm placentas.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1933719112443878">12</xref></sup> In addition, we also found that KiSS-1 increased the AI in placental explants. All together, these findings suggest a possible modulator role of kisspeptin and its receptor on placental apoptosis, during pregnancy.</p>
<p>Although the dynamics of apoptotic events in placental development is still controversial, some studies showed an increased apoptosis in tertiary villi with gestational age, during labor, and in postterm pregnancy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1933719112443878">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1933719112443878">14</xref>
</sup> Apoptosis is regulated by the Bcl2 family of proteins, of which is Bcl2 that has an antiapoptotic role, whereas Bax exerts an opposite effect, being proapoptotic. The ratio between these 2 molecules will determine whether a cell will survive or will be driven to cell death.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1933719112443878">15</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>An adequate placental development is fundamental in order to achieve a normal pregnancy outcome and parturition, for which apoptosis seems to have an important role. An anomalous apoptotic process may in fact be associated with specific obstetric conditions as preterm birth, preeclampsia, and postterm birth.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1933719112443878">16</xref></sup> The present results showing an apoptotic profile in postterm placentas are in-line with those reported in a recent study showing higher <italic>Bax/Bcl2</italic> ratio in placental tissues collected from postterm placentas.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1933719112443878">12</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>A possible role of KiSS-1 action in the mechanisms involved in trophoblast apoptosis has been recently suggested, probably through its interaction with some pathways of myometrial contractility, leading to parturition.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1933719112443878">17</xref></sup> The high <italic>KiSS-1</italic> and <italic>KiSS-1R</italic> mRNA expression in postterm placentas and the evidences that explants treated with kisspeptin showed a higher AI support the hypothesis of a possible involvement of kisspeptin in the proapoptotic events in postplacenta. Additionally, we also found that <italic>p21</italic> mRNA expression is higher in postterm pregnancies than in-term placentas. Kisspeptin promotes a blockade of the cell cycle at the G2/M border in heptahelical G protein-coupled receptor KiSS-1R-expressing cells, inducing the apoptotic pathway in malignant cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1933719112443878">7</xref></sup> In addition, several genes involved in the control of cell cycle and apoptosis are upregulated by KiSS-1R, of which the most important gene is <italic>p21.</italic>
<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1933719112443878">7</xref></sup> The <italic>P21</italic> gene represents a key regulator of senescence mechanisms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1933719112443878">18</xref></sup> through the inhibition of cell cycle progression, leading to the cell cycle arrest in either G1 or G2, acting in a <italic>p53</italic>-dependent and/or independent fashion.</p>
<p>The placental process involved in postterm pregnancy still remains an open issue. Postterm pregnancies are associated with several adverse outcomes including uteroplacental insufficiency, meconium aspiration, and intrauterine infection contributing to the increased rate of perinatal deaths.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1933719112443878">19</xref></sup> Currently, induction of labor for pregnancies at 41 weeks of gestation remains the only effective strategy to reduce the risk of maternal and fetal poor outcomes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1933719112443878">19</xref></sup> The finding that kisspeptin and its receptor are involved in postterm pregnancy may be useful for understanding placental mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of this condition.</p>
<p>In conclusions, our present findings showing that KiSS-1 and its receptor are expressed at higher levels in postterm pregnancies and that KiSS-1 induces apoptosis in placental explants suggest that these molecules may represent placental proapoptotic agents involved in the placental pathophysiological mechanisms of postterm pregnancy.</p>
