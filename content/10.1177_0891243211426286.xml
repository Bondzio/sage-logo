<p>A 1970s “Kelly Girl” advertisement in Erin Hatton’s new book depicts a young, white woman who is the “Never Never Girl.” According to the ad, the “Never Never Girl” “Never takes a vacation or holiday. Never asks for a raise. Never has a cold, slipped disc, or loose tooth (Not on your time anyway!) Never costs you fringe benefits.” What owner or manager wouldn’t want such an amazing worker?</p>
<p>Hatton explores how the “temp” industry became legitimate work in the United States. Using a content analysis of several documents (e.g., government and industry publications) and popular media (e.g., magazine advertisements) from the 1940s to early 2000s, the book provides ample evidence that the temporary industry convinced business leaders and the public that temp work was good for the economy, business, and workers. Although other scholars have analyzed the rise of temporary work and experiences of temp workers, Hatton’s analysis contributes significantly by demonstrating that temp industry leaders masterfully persuaded various groups that the economy needed temp workers. Macro changes in the economy certainly contributed to the legitimation and use of temp workers, but ads and other material produced by the temp industry were much more significant.</p>
<p>Another contribution of this book is that it shows how temporary industry leaders were instrumental in transforming business philosophy in the United States from emphasizing workers as assets to redefining workers as liabilities. The asset model of work assumes that workers can contribute to profits if they are satisfied and treated well by employers. Not surprisingly, this philosophy undergirds unionizing. The liability model, based on early industrial models of efficiency, assumes that workers are disposable and contribute to lower profits. Since World War II, the liability model has replaced the asset model as the dominant form in our economy.</p>
<p>The temp industry was able to persuade businesses that permanent workers were a liability by changing its marketing strategies over time. First, temp leaders had to convince people that temp work was legitimate: good for workers and business, and a proper way of doing business. According to Hatton, many organizations in the postwar economy followed the asset model to some degree by, for example, agreeing to some union demands. Temp leaders had to consider ways to sell temp work to managers during this time and attract workers who might be willing to do this type of work. During the 1950s and 1960s, the temp industry engaged in a campaign to market temp work as women’s work, particularly white, middle-class women’s work. The “Kelly Girl” marketing strategy became one of the major seeds of the dismantling of the asset model of work by creating a second class of “respectable” work. The Kelly Girl approach seemed to appease both feminists and groups who embraced women’s domestic roles by depicting iconic Kelly Girls (and other similar depictions of temp women workers) as glamorous and independent, but also as feminine. Temp work could provide independence for women but not threaten their roles as wife and mother because they could leave temp work as needed for their family.</p>
<p>Eventually, temp leaders had to move away from the highly successful Kelly Girl strategy, which focused primarily on clerical work, to increase the “need” for temp workers in many industries. Hatton’s analysis suggests that the industry needed to convince employers that male-dominated jobs should use temp workers, and that their businesses would become more productive, efficient, and profitable if they employed more temps. After the 1960s, temp industry campaigns expanded to depict temp work as men’s breadwinning work. Marketing also emphasized how employees are expendable. Several ads depicted temp workers as machines, who were more highly skilled and efficient than permanent workers. Overall, temp leaders were successful in redefining the temp worker as a new type of “semi-permanent” employee: the permatemp. Hiring temps would allow companies to downstaff by having a skeleton staff, replace permanent employees with temps, and employ “permanent temps.” According to the campaign, these business strategies would lead to greater productivity and more profit.</p>
<p>For those interested solely in gender, there are two chapters that aren’t about gender per se. Nevertheless, they provide a larger economic context about the legitimation of, and challenges to, the growth of the industry. For example, one chapter describes how labor organizers and activists were somewhat successful in decreasing negative aspects of temporary work. Another discusses overall transformations in the economy.</p>
<p>Hatton concludes that we need a new asset model of work that allows both management flexibility and eliminates exploitation of workers. Given recent blows to labor organizing in the United States and benefit cuts across most industries, this solution might seem overly optimistic. Hatton notes that moving to a new asset model is “utopian.” Her conclusions do suggest that labor organizers should consider new strategies to access this exploited group of workers.</p>
<p>This interesting book is useful for scholars interested in gender, work and occupations, labor organizing, the economy, and research methods. It would also be effective in graduate or advanced undergraduate courses on work as a contemporary application of Weberian and Marxist frameworks. Finally, the book is ideal for showing the explanatory power of content analyses. Although Hatton did not interview temp workers, owners, managers, or temp industry leaders, the use of various documents and media show the influence of media in shaping economies and culture.</p>
