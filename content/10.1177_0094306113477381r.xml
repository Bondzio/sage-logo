<p>This is a careful, meticulously analyzed study that is an important contribution to the growing category of research on the slums of megacities in the South. It attempts to understand how households cope with poverty that derives from lack of properly-paid employment. All the conventional wisdom holds for the neighborhood where Şebnem Eroğlu has conducted her research in Ankara: the inhabitants are immigrants from poor villages who could no longer hope to extract satisfying livelihoods in the countryside. Attracted by the promise of employment, higher incomes, and education opportunities for the children, they end up in shantytowns at the periphery of the city (in this case, the capital city of Turkey), coping with precarious employment, uncertain prospects in finding secure housing, and a constant struggle to survive.</p>
<p>Against this background, various tactics evolve to tap into resources of households in order to better manage the predicament. Eroğlu’s declared intent is to understand “why some [households] are more successful in reducing their deprivation than others” (p. 1). She develops a “household response model” focusing on intra-household behavior such as expenditure and consumption decisions relating to composition and life-cycle of the family members, but within the constraints of resources available in terms of assets and market and non-market income. Although Eroğlu includes the “wider structure,” that is the external environment, as a variable to study, her approach necessarily pays less attention to more macro determinants of rural-to-urban migration, conditions of acquiring housing in shantytowns, the level of public assistance and social services, and the economic conjuncture. The research was conducted over two long visits to the neighborhood in 2002, among “a random sample of 17 households … chosen from a typical <italic>gecekondu</italic> settlement” (p. 5). The sample is expected to “represent approximately the bottom 15 percent of the Ankara population” (p. 55). It should be mentioned that 2002 was a year of shaky recovery after a downturn of close to 10 percent in per capita incomes and employment, hitting the informally employed population studied in this book most drastically.</p>
<p>Among the households studied here employment is crucial as the principal source of money income. Non-commodified sources of income are insubstantial. We find women in families growing garden plants, baking their own bread, preserving food, but these activities are a small addition to the household budget. There are instances of reciprocity and community-based assistance to the most deprived neighbors, but “the observed non- and semi-commodified practices of consumption were found to contribute very little to household success” (p. 134). Without employment income and state transfers (which at the time depended on the holding of formal employment), fortunes are dire. Two-thirds of the households depend exclusively on labor income, and only 5 out of 17 households have access to “institutional” transfers (p. 67). On the whole, greater income diversification does not seem to correlate with higher success in moving out of deprivation.</p>
<p>To the casual observer, the Turkish shantytown population would appear to be less poverty stricken than their counterparts in comparable countries. This is due in large part to the conditions of housing: most immigrants have found empty land to squat on and politics and law enforcement have turned a blind eye to ongoing construction. Housing (<italic>gecekondu</italic>, a word that describes informally built houses, but also the shantytowns composed of such houses) has been the major store of wealth and survival resource for the new urbanites. Eroğlu’s finding corroborates this claim as she concludes that even though ownership of a dwelling did not generate cash income, “entitlements to <italic>gecekondu</italic> redevelopment made a significant difference to household deprivation” (p. 227).</p>
<p>In Eroğlu’s sample of families, formal employment is a ticket out of poverty because of higher wages and access to social benefits, especially health insurance: “the greater the extent of informal sector participation the less likely the households are to achieve success in reducing deprivation” (p.74). Members of the poorest households do not have access to formal employment; informal employment conditions are harsh, the working week is long, and there is no certainty that the wage will be paid. While all male heads of households work (most as casual employees or in self-employment, p.69), only half the female spouses do; out of those only two are in regular employment. The rest are engaged in home-based work, consisting of activities directed to limited markets, such as baking bread, knitting, and making lace.</p>
<p>There is a cultural factor here due to the reluctance in <italic>Sunni</italic> households to accept women’s employment outside of the home setting. <italic>Alevi</italic> is a heterodox sect in which women are not covered and are much more visible in public—in Eroğlu’s sample 11 out of 17 families were <italic>Alevi</italic>, and their women are more likely to be employed, often in domestic service. Children, mostly after the period of compulsory education, are also placed in “apprentice” positions or in casual employment where the pay barely covers transportation and food expenses: there were two girls and nine boys in regular employment. Surprisingly however, the author finds “that despite its moderate effects on income, deployment of a greater number of labour resources did not bring significant success” (p. 71). Such diversification is perforce the rule, but these households, as similar ones in similar circumstances, hope for more formal exploitation rather than less. It is better to have the male head of the household formally exploited (with social security provided by the state) than the entire family working informally in diverse activities pooling their meager, uncertain, and precarious incomes.</p>
<p>
<italic>Beyond the Resources of Poverty</italic> concludes with policy implications drawn from the analysis. The message is clear and orthodox: what is needed to reduce poverty is an employment-centered approach. Thus, instead of means-tested social assistance, or vague projects to enhance social capital, the author calls for education, job creation, and formalization of employment, with accompanying state-provided social security and health services. Eroğlu provides a thorough review of the concepts and approaches in poverty reduction literature, as well as an excellent report on her research. This is an important contribution; thesis advisors and graduate students might take note.</p>
