<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Bahman Guyuron is recognized throughout the world for his superb lectures and expertise in rhinoplasty surgery. Every live presentation is insightful, beautifully illustrated, and often includes original techniques that are validated by impressive clinical results, usually with long-term follow-up. For many years, his colleagues have awaited a publication summarizing his personal philosophy and surgical techniques developed during the past 31 years. <italic>Rhinoplasty</italic> is that text.</p>
<p><italic>Rhinoplasty</italic> is divided into 21 chapters, each clearly structured and ending with a “textbox” that summarizes the essential points. Each chapter begins with an outline of the contents both for the text and the specific video content, which means that information is easily found. Next, there is a list of 10 to 20 basic principles followed by a description of each technical step, with a list of the different surgical options.</p>

<title>Strengths</title>
<p>Instead of the more common inclusion of DVDs, this book is supplemented by an Internet-based series of detailed, educational surgical videos and case study animations that complement the text, along with illustrations. Together, these aspects render the principles of the surgical procedures quite clear. In the text, high-magnification, detailed clinical photos demonstrate Dr Guyuron’s excellent documentation, with consistent pre- and postoperative positioning. The clinical photo legends often contain a precise list of the surgical steps, which makes it easy to follow and understand each procedure. Often, Dr Guyuron has included treatment algorithms, which are perfect learning tools that did not exist when I began my plastic surgery training.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the text, a very useful “Functional Nose Information Sheet” is presented, which emphasizes the principle that form and function are intrinsic to nasal surgery. Younger surgeons will find the detailed cephalometric examination very helpful in revealing even minor facial asymmetries, of which patients often are unaware. The chapter entitled “Dynamics of Rhinoplasty” is very important, as it emphasizes that the long-term result, rather than the short-term outcome, is the relevant criterion for measuring success. This fundamental principle is further validated in the “Rhinoplasty and Time Element” chapter, where the effects of postoperative swelling, gravity, and aging on the nose are discussed.</p>
<p>For surgeons seeking to improve their rhinoplasty results, there are numerous chapters addressing fundamental subjects (including osteotomies, tip sutures, optimal tip projection, alar base surgery, and alar rim deformities) that require both judicious preoperative decision making and intraoperative judgment. Of interest to experienced rhinoplasty surgeons, this book contains topics that are rarely discussed in other texts, including elongating the short nose, controlling nostril size, treating cleft lip nose deformity, and addressing the cocaine nose. Dr Guyuron reveals his personal approach and surgical techniques for each of these difficult conditions, validated with superb results.</p>
<p>The last chapter, about rhinogenic migraine headaches, is a specific highlight. It demonstrates the unique competence of Dr Guyuron. Most surgeons are not aware that migraine attacks are often triggered from within the nose, and the topic is rarely covered in surgical textbooks. The entire medical community is deeply indebted to Dr Guyuron for his advancement and dissemination of knowledge in this field.</p>

<title>Weaknesses</title>
<p>The “best” approach to rhinoplasty is a subject of much debate in our specialty. It is my personal opinion that Dr Guyuron’s concept of correcting severe septal deformities—which include the s-shaped, anteroposterior, and cephalocaudal deformities—is not far-ranging enough and thus may fail in some cases. Specifically, scoring alone or in combination with spreader grafts does not guarantee long-term stability. Obviously, he is referring to his personal experience and he does not perform extracorporeal procedures, which are a proven alternative in such difficult cases. Also, the recommended use of prefabricated templates for planning rhinoplasty (found in the cephalometric examination section) seems a bit difficult. Readers should consider the information provided in this book within the context of their own experience and weigh the surgical options carefully.</p>

<title>Summary</title>
<p>This book is a “must” for every physician performing rhinoplasty surgery and is of value for surgeons of all levels of expertise. As Dr Guyuron says in the Preface, all of us should learn something new every day that improves our results. This book is a valuable resource that can give any reader many new ideas and proven techniques to better treat his or her patients. I enjoyed reading this beautifully written book with its exciting, Internet-based educational tools.</p>
