<abstract>
<p>Lenalidomide is an immunomodulator used to treat 5q-myelodysplastic syndrome, myelofibrosis, and multiple myeloma. We describe a 55-year-old male who was started on lenalidomide 10 mg daily for 21 days followed by 7 days off therapy for the treatment of early stage post-polycythemia vera myelofibrosis. Following initiation of lenalidomide, the patient was noted to have an asymptomatic increase in unconjugated bilirubin. Alkaline phosphatase, aspartate transaminase, and alanine aminotransferase were normal. During the 7 days off of lenalidomide, bilirubin began to trend down. Re-challenge with lenalidomide in subsequent cycles results in an asymptomatic elevation in unconjugated bilirubin followed by improvement during the 7-day lenalidomide-free period. The patient is a heterozygote for the TA7 allele which can decrease expression of uridine diphosphate glycuronosyl transferase 1A1, the enzyme responsible for conjugation of bilirubin. Therapy with lenalidomide may have unmasked Gilbert’s syndrome in the patient.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1078155212439492"><title>Background</title>
<p>Lenalidomide is an immunomodulator most commonly used for the treatment of deletion 5q-myelodysplastic syndrome and in combination with dexamethasone for multiple myeloma.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1078155212439492">1</xref></sup> Lenalidomide is not known to be metabolized and is excreted unchanged in the urine. In multiple myeloma clinical trials, the most commonly reported adverse events (≥20%) include hematologic toxicities (thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and anemia) as well as non-hematologic toxicities (fatigue, constipation, diarrhea, muscle cramps, pyrexia, peripheral edema, nausea, back pain, and upper respiratory tract infection). Four cases of lenalidomide-induced liver dysfunction have been reported.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1078155212439492">2</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1078155212439492">5</xref></sup> We report a detailed clinical observation of asymptomatic elevations in unconjugated bilirubin in a patient taking lenalidomide.</p>

<sec id="sec2-1078155212439492" sec-type="cases"><title>Case report</title>
<p>We report the case of a 55-year-old male with polycythemia vera (PV), diagnosed in 1998, for which he was originally managed with therapeutic phlebotomy, hydroxyurea, and aspirin. In 2011, the patient was noted to have increasing splenomegaly with constitutional symptoms concerning for the development of post-PV myelofibrosis (post-PV MF). In order to assess the patient for post-PV MF, a bone marrow biopsy was completed on 26 May 2011. The bone marrow biopsy was consistent with known diagnosis of PV, significant for markedly hypercellular marrow with panmyelosis and moderate reticulin fibrosis, and favored early stage post-PV MF. No cytogenic abnormalities were noted on chromosome analysis or on fluorescence in situ hybridization panel, and the patient was determined to be heterozygous for UGT1 A1*28 (UGT1A1: uridine diphosphate glycuronosyl transferase 1A1). The patient was hepatitis B, C, human immunodeficiency virus, and cytomegalovirus negative and had normal renal function. On 26 May 2011, a computed topography scan was obtained and showed marked splenomegaly while his liver was not enlarged. At baseline, the patient’s total bilirubin (t. bili) was 1.1 mg/dL. On 25 June 2011, lenalidomide 10 mg by orally daily for 21 days followed by 7 days off lenalidomide (1 cycle is 21 days on lenalidomide and 7 days off) was started for early post-PV MF. Hydroxyurea was discontinued. Other pertinent concurrent medications include prednisone, allopurinol, and terazosin. Hydroxyurea was subsequently restarted with cycle 2 of lenalidomide. By the second cycle of lenalidomide, an asymptomatic increase in t. bili to a maximum of 2.0 mg/dL (normal: 0.0–1.4 mg/dL) in cycle 4 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1078155212439492">Table 1</xref>) was noted.

<p>During the 7 days of a cycle when the patient is off of lenalidomide, the t. bili declines toward baseline (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1078155212439492">Table 1</xref>). Other liver function tests (aspartate transaminase, alanine aminotransferase) remained within normal limits during the same time period. The asymptomatic elevations in unconjugated bilirubin are reproducible on re-challenge with lenalidomide (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1078155212439492">Table 1</xref>). With subsequent cycles, the t. bili increases in a predictable pattern during the 21 days on lenalidomide before returning to baseline during the 7 days off of lenalidomide, although these effects are most notable in later cycles. As the patient is asymptomatic and the t. bili improves while off of lenalidomide and the patient was benefiting clinically, the decision was made to continue the lenalidomide. While allopurinol can cause a hypersensitivity hepatitis, the patients had been on allopurinol for more than six months prior to the initiation of lenalidomide. The hydroxyurea is unlikely to be the causative agent either as his liver function tests had been stable on hydroxyurea therapy in the past.</p>
<p>Given that the t. bili declines when the patient is not taking lenalidomide and that the bilirubin increases with re-challenge and no other explanations are apparent, we have assigned the case report a Naranjo score of 8, which is consistent with a probable adverse drug reaction (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1078155212439492">Table 2</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1078155212439492">6</xref></sup>

<p>The patient described here presents with elevated t. bili almost all of which is unconjugated, which is inconsistent with previously reported cases of lenalidomide-related hepatotoxicity. One previous case report proposes lenalidomide can increase transaminases through immune reconstitution in the setting of acute hepatitis B or viral liver infection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1078155212439492">2</xref></sup> The patient described here was hepatitis B, C, human immunodeficiency virus, and cytomegalovirus negative. Lenalidomide is largely excreted unchanged in the urine and a second case report suggests that impaired renal function may have contributed to the development of hepatotoxicity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1078155212439492">3</xref></sup> The patient described here does not have renal dysfunction. His serum creatinine has remained within normal limits, ranging from 1.0 to 1.3 mg/dL. A third case report details liver biopsy findings consistent with an immunoallergic reaction to lenalidomide with improvement in liver function test upon lenalidomide discontinuation.</p>
<p>An alternative explanation for the elevated bilirubin associated with lenalidomide administration may be Gilbert’s syndrome. UGT1A1 is solely responsible for conjugation of bilirubin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1078155212439492">7</xref></sup> Gilbert's syndrome occurs in 3–10% of the population and is characterized by mild unconjugated non-hemolytic hyperbilirubinemia in the absence of liver disease and is caused by a variant in UGT1A1. The variant is a dinucleotide repeat polymorphism in the TATA element of the promoter region. Unaffected individuals have six TA repeats (A(TA)6TAA), while an extra TA repeat (A(TA)7TAA) lowers the gene expression and thus reduces enzyme activity. Homozygotes for the UGT1A1*28 are at a higher risk of elevated bilirubin than heterozygotes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1078155212439492">8</xref></sup> However, expression of UGT1A1 is on a spectrum. Homozygotes have lower gene expression than heterozygotes and heterozygotes have lower expression than unaffected individuals. As a result, heterozygotes are also at risk for increased unconjugated bilirubin levels. While the presence of polymorphism is necessary for Gilbert's syndrome, the manifestation of hyperbilirubinemia requires other precipitating factors such as fasting, illness, or drug administration.</p>
<p>Lee and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1078155212439492">9</xref></sup> recently reported the relationship between Gilbert’s syndrome and elevated bilirubin in patients receiving tocilizumab, a monoclonal antibody for rheumatoid arthritis, which is not metabolized by UGT1A1, showing that patients with the UGT1A1*28 allele were at risk for asymptomatic elevations in bilirubin which resolved with discontinuation of the drug. Lee also noted that heterozygous, not just homozygotes, for the UGT1A1*28 were at risk for asymptomatic elevations in bilirubin. In this patient with heterozygosity of the TA7 allele, the asymptomatic elevations in unconjugated bilirubin occurred when lenalidomide was initiated in a manner similar to that described by Lee.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1078155212439492" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title>
<p>We report a case of asymptomatic hyperbilirubinemia probably related to lenalidomide administration. Since the patient was a heterozygote for UGT1A1*28, this may be a potential mechanism.</p>
