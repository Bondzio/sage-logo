<title>New Training Package Could Help Doctors Cut Rates of SCD in Athletes</title>
<p>New online tutorials, which are available free to any doctor around the globe, thanks to the backing of the AMSSM and FIFA, aim to teach physicians how to read heart monitor tracings and spot abnormalities linked to potentially fatal disorders. The tutorials, initiated by AMSSM Immediate Past President Jonathan Drezner, MD, in association with BMJ Learning and the <italic>British Journal of Sports Medicine (BJSM)</italic> and developed and written by international experts in sports medicine and sports cardiology, guide doctors on how to recognize ECG changes that indicate problems rather than healthy cardiac adaptation.

<title>National Athletic Trainers’ Association (NATA)</title>
<p>As a follow-up to the 4th Youth Sports Safety Summit held earlier this year, the National Athletic Trainers’ Association continues to champion young athletes by launching the first-ever Safe Sports School award program. Created to recognize secondary schools around the country that provide safe environments for student athletes, the initiative reinforces the importance of providing the best level of care, injury prevention, and treatment. The application for a Safe Sports School award outlines the specific actions that will lead an athletics program to the highest safety standards for its players. A school may earn a 1st or 2nd Team award. 1st Team is awarded to schools that act on all of the recommended <italic>and</italic> required elements. 2nd Team is granted to schools that have completed only required elements. Schools qualifying for either award will receive a banner and artwork to promote their achievement. For more information contact <email>sad@nata.org</email></p>
