<abstract>
<p>Elementary school teacher time spent on student health issues and the relationship to school nurse services was the focus of this 2-year study. A cross-sectional design was used to survey traditional and exceptional (special needs) classroom teachers about the time they spent on health issues and their perception of school nurse presence. The school nurses were surveyed regarding the impact of their presence on early releases due to illness. Study findings related to teacher perceptions indicate with school nurse presence there are fewer early releases, increased communication, less time spent on health issues, students with chronic illnesses are safer, and there is a resource available for health information. The data provide the groundwork for discussions to improve the communication of the nurses’ schedules, increase teacher confidence in consistent nurse hours at their school and aid the nurse in protecting valuable on-site school hours from other interferences or commitments.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In North Carolina, as in many states, reduction in financial support has forced local school systems to evaluate budgets and to review services essential for student learning. With student attendance often linked to local school funding, frequent absences due to illness and injury can result in reduced government funding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1059840511429684">Dosa &amp; Ilardi, 2003</xref>) as well as have an effect on student achievement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1059840511429684">Allen, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1059840511429684">Foster &amp; Keele, 2006</xref>). Studies related to health issues and early school releases tend to focus on specific illnesses such as asthma and other chronic health conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1059840511429684">Bruzzese et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1059840511429684">Engelke, Guttu, Warren, &amp; Swanson 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1059840511429684">Erickson, Splett, Mullett, Jenson, &amp; Belseth, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1059840511429684">Moonie, Sterling, Figgs, &amp; Castro, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1059840511429684">Taras &amp; Potts-Datema, 2005</xref>) or children with special needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1059840511429684">Kruger, Toker, Radjenovic, Comeaux, &amp; Macha, 2009</xref>) rather than the general elementary school population health issues.</p>
<p>Several studies have focused on the presence of the school nurse and the impact on student absences. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1059840511429684">Wyman (2005)</xref> conducted a study examining the possible link between student attendance and academic success. Early release data for illness and injury were compared to school nurse contact with the student prior to release and found that fewer than 60% of the students seen by the school nurse were released early compared to those that were not seen by the nurse. A review of absenteeism and interaction with the school nurse by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1059840511429684">Weismuller, Grasska, Alexander, White, and Kramer (2007)</xref> found that no referrals were made to the school nurse for absenteeism, although 17% of students were absent 11 or more school days. One of the recommendations of the study was for an attendance referral policy which would create a mechanism for school nurse follow-up and potential intervention.</p>
<p>With more demands being placed on teachers for students’ achievement, time in the classroom is essential to student learning; however, teachers must also meet job description requirements related to health issues. For example, in 2010, a North Carolina county school system advertisement for a teacher position listed 20 performance responsibilities. Responsibility number 6 specifically addressed the teacher’s role in regard to health issues as assessing student needs and cooperating with other professional staff to assist students and parents to resolve health issues and other factors that affect learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1059840511429684">Buncombe County Schools, 2010</xref>). Although a performance expectation, a review of literature at the time of this study did not reveal any research related to teacher time spent on health issues. Recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1059840511429684">Baisch, Lundeen, and Murphy (2011)</xref> published the results of a cross-sectional study comparing the perception of teaching staff, principals, assistant principals, and clerical staff about the time spent on health issues before and after a school nurse was assigned to their school. Based on this recall of past and present perceptions, the data indicated a combined savings among all staff of 13 hr per day, including 20 min of teacher time, when a school nurse was included as a member of the school team. Staff viewed the school nurse interventions as a positive component that impacts student learning and health.</p>
<p>Consistent with concerns found in the literature about health issues impacting student learning, a collaborative partnership was formed in 2003 among a state comprehensive university, community foundation, county public school system, and county health department. The collaborative effort focused on identifying barriers to student learning at one elementary school with low achievement scores and high poverty rate. Discussions among the partners identified health issues as a potential barrier to student achievement. As a result, a survey consisting of the 20 identified health issues was developed and the data were gathered from teachers during a regularly scheduled faculty meeting. Data revealed that on an average day, each teacher was spending 24.43 min on health issues. As a result of these data, several grants were obtained to fund a full-time school nurse at the school for 3 years. With a school nurse on-site less than a year, teaching time lost to health needs decreased from 24.43 min to an average of 8.23 min per day per teacher at this one school. Based on the information gained from the pilot study, the partners, in 2007, decided to repeat the survey, expanding the scope of study to include all county elementary schools and to gather additional data in anticipation of seeking additional funding to increase the number of school nurse hours per school.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1059840511429684">
<title>Method</title>
<p>Human subject approval was granted by the Western Carolina University Institutional Review Board for the Protection of Human Subjects, the county superintendent of schools, and the county health department. Participation in the survey was voluntary. By completing the survey, participant consent was implied.</p>
<sec id="section3-1059840511429684">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>Based on the success of this earlier study, the current study was expanded in 2007 to include all of the elementary schools in the county school system and the school nurses assigned to those schools. The original teacher survey was modified based on participant feedback and analysis to address the following research questions: (a) What is the teacher’s perception of school nurse services and (b) How much time are classroom teachers spending on health issues? A third question was directed to the school nurse and how much direct contact did the nurse have with students who are released early?</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1059840511429684">
<title>Design</title>
<p>This cross-sectional 2-year study compared county elementary school teachers’ time spent on specified health issues on one school day. The survey was distributed by each school principal to teachers during a regularly scheduled faculty meeting in February or March each year of the survey. The school nurse assigned to each school provided data on interactions with students for the same day the teachers completed their survey.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1059840511429684">
<title>Setting and Sample</title>
<p>The setting was elementary schools, both rural and urban, in one county in western North Carolina with a county average of nearly 50% of students eligible for free or reduced meals. The enrollment of these schools was approximately 6,300 students during the 2-year study period (J. Page, personal communication, August 24, 2009). All teachers for kindergarten through fifth grade, including exceptional classrooms (special needs children), were included in the study, as were the school nurses assigned to those 12 schools in Year 1 and 13 schools in Year 2 when a redistribution of teachers, students, and school nurses occurred. The survey was distributed to 435 teachers and 7 school nurses the first year and 442 teachers and 7 school nurses the second year. Because school nurses are assigned multiple schools (two to three schools per nurse), they are present an average of 10–11 hr per school per week per year.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1059840511429684">
<title>Measures</title>
<p>The 2003 pilot teacher survey was reviewed and revised by the partner panel of experts. A nurse survey was designed with input from the school nurse supervisor to capture data required by the state and was, therefore, not piloted.</p>
<p>The teacher survey included four sections. The first section, using a five choice Likert-type scale, consisted of 6 items about the teacher’s perception of school nurse services. Respondents indicated the extent to which they agreed or disagreed with statements related to school nurse presence and early releases, communication, time spent on health issues, safety issues, teaching time, and personal health resources. The second section focused on information specific to the respondent’s classroom such as the type of classroom (regular or exceptional), number of students, whether there was a teaching assistant and, if yes, the number of hours assigned to that class. The third section required the teacher identify the number of minutes spent that day on specific health issues and the final section was for comments. The school nurse survey included the number of students released early due to illness the day of the teacher survey and whether the nurse saw the student prior to release.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1059840511429684">
<title>Data Collection</title>
<p>The survey was distributed by each school principal to teachers during a regularly scheduled faculty meeting either in February or March both years. The surveys were collected, placed in an envelope, and returned to the county school office via interoffice mail. School nurse surveys were distributed by the school nurse supervisor to the school nurses. The school nurse placed their completed survey in an envelope provided by the principal investigator. The teacher surveys were collected from the county school office and the school nurses surveys from the county health department by the principal investigator.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1059840511429684">
<title>Data Analyses</title>
<p>All quantitative data in Years 1 and 2 were entered into the statistical package for the social sciences version 13 and checked for error and missing data. Descriptive statistics, including frequency counts and percentages were calculated for categorical variables (e.g., classroom type) and mean, median, and standard deviations were employed on continuous variables (e.g., time spent on health issues) for the total data set. Cross-tabulation procedures were performed to organize descriptive data by school to give comparison information across the school system. Identical descriptive statistics were performed on the data from Year 2. Additional inferential calculations were done to compare the data of Years 1 and 2 on the variables of interest. Tests of significance used an α of .05.</p>

<sec id="section9-1059840511429684">
<title>Results</title>
<sec id="section10-1059840511429684">
<title>Sample</title>
<p>Demographic data were limited to classroom information identified by the partners as essential to the school system; therefore, teacher and nurse personal demographic information was not collected. In the first year 435 teacher surveys were distributed and 442 in the second year.</p>
<p>Twelve schools participated in Year 1. A new elementary school opened in Year 2 for a total of 13 schools. Elementary school teachers were classified by class type as traditional and exceptional classrooms. Similar teacher sample size and response rates were gathered in Year 1 (<italic>n</italic> = 289, 66.4%) and Year 2 (<italic>n</italic> = 272, 61.5%). Year 1 data reflect a slightly lower return by traditional education teachers (91.5%) versus Year 2 (96.3%) and a higher percentage of exceptional classroom teachers participated the first year (8.0%) than the second year (3.7%). The average class size for each class type remained stable both years at approximately 20 students.</p>
<p>A total of seven school nurses in Year 1 (one full-time at one school and six assigned to multiple schools) and seven in Year 2 (all assigned to multiple schools) were employed by the county department of health during the study period. The number of hours the school nurse was on-site per week per school in Year 1 averaged 10.35 hr and in Year 2 averaged 11 hr.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1059840511429684">
<title>Teacher Perceptions</title>
<p>Perception of school nurse services in Years 1 and 2 revealed more than 80% of the teachers <italic>strongly agreed</italic> or <italic>agreed</italic> that when the school nurse is present, there is increased communication (94.4%; 93%), less teacher time spent on health issues (83%; 83.7%), more time spent teaching (82.6%; 83.3%), and increased confidence that students with chronic illnesses are safer (94.6%; 97%). Teachers’ level of agreement was somewhat lower as to the perception of the school nurse as personal resource for health information (82.7%; 76.4%) and was lower overall in regard to fewer early releases due to illness (63.4%; 70%; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1059840511429684">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<p>These perceptions were supported by teacher anecdotal comments such as “the nurse notices things (aliments) in kids that I miss. She can also better determine real sickness from just whining, than I can. Also- her word is OFFICIAL in children’s minds. They perceive her as the final word.”</p>

<sec id="section12-1059840511429684">
<title>Teacher Time on Health Issues</title>
<p>Teachers estimated the amount of time they had spent on 20 health issues on the day of the survey. The average time spent on all health issues was 73.58 min in Year 1 and 35.86 min in Year 2. The top five health issues and average minutes spent per day in Year 1 were (a) other (22.82); (b) calling parents (5.77); (c) aches/pains (5.51); (d) sleep issues (5.48); and (e) congestion (4.23). During the second year, the top five health issues and minutes spent per day on each were (a) calling parents (4.26); (b) stomach ache (4.11); (c) aches/pains (3.41); (d) cuts/sores (3.29); and (e) lice (2.18; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1059840511429684">Table 2</xref>
). Anecdotal comments by the teachers regarding health issues ranged from “this is a calm day! [I] usually address issues on a daily basis and need nurse’s advice/input” and “it is my professional opinion that too much instructional time is wasted while taking care of students health needs on a daily basis”; to more descriptive comments such as:<disp-quote>
<p>My student w/a diagnosed mental health issue was absent today. Both my assistant and I spent a great deal of time with her. When the school nurse is available, sometimes those students w/aches, pains, etc. are okay and don’t seek more attention after they have seen the nurse. When she is here it is really cuts down on the minutes I spend dealing with the “boomerang” cases (those with little aches &amp; pains who keep coming back to tell the teacher).</p>

<title>School Nurse Presence and Early Release Findings</title>
<p>The number of hours the school nurse was on-site per week per school in Year 1 averaged 10.35 hr and in Year 2 averaged 11 hr. The school nurses who were on-site the day of the survey were there an average of 2 hr in Year 1 and 3.6 hr in Year 2. School nurse hours varied from Year 1 to Year 2 due to the redistribution of the full-time nurse hours and the hiring of an additional school nurse by the health department.</p>
<p>School nurse records were examined for the six early release variables. Of the seven schools in Year 1 with a nurse present, there were a total of 133 students released early. Eighty-eight (66%) of those were released for unknown reasons and 38 (28.5%) were released due to illness. During the average 2.3 hr, the nurse was present, there were 14 students released early. Of those 14, six were seen by a nurse prior to their release.</p>
<p>During the second year, 98 students were released early. Forty-eight (49%) were released for unknown reasons and 50 (51%) students were released due to illness. During the average 3.6 hr, the nurse was present, 28 students were released early. Of those 28, eight were seen by the nurse prior to early release (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1059840511429684">Table 3</xref>

<p>Both years data support anecdotal comments related to the difficulty the teacher had knowing when the assigned nurse was on-site; so therefore, they did not refer students to the nurse on a regular basis. One teacher expressed it as “It’s hard to know when the nurse is here. Would be helpful to have full time nurse.” Another teacher wrote “I don’t even know when the nurse is here, so I (or my assistant) take care of most needs. An inconsistent nurse isn’t helpful.”</p>

<sec id="section14-1059840511429684">
<title>Discussion</title>
<sec id="section15-1059840511429684">
<title>Teacher Perceptions</title>
<p>Teachers’ perception scores were most positive about their communication with the nurses and their belief that students with chronic illnesses were safer because of the presence of the school nurse. Also positive was the perception that the teacher spent more time teaching and less time on health issues when the nurse was present. Perceptions of the nurse as a resource for personal health information were equally positive.</p>
<p>Perception scores were lowest in regard to the nurses’ impact on early releases due to illness. While overwhelmingly positive in their praise for “our school nurse,” teachers expressed uncertainty about when the nurse is on-site and their scheduled hours. Teachers were also cognizant of the multiple additional duties performed by school nurses both at their school and the other schools to which they are assigned. Teachers tended to “take care of it myself” or referred the student to other school personnel due to the nurse not being present on a regular schedule and for limited hours; hence, the lower percentage may be the result of inconsistent communication of the nurse’s schedule with the classroom teachers.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-1059840511429684">
<title>Teacher Time on Health Issues</title>
<p>As an aggregate, teachers in traditional and exceptional classrooms in Year 1 spent approximately 80 min managing health issues the day of the survey compared to 46 min in Year 2. Since there was no significant difference in the total number of teachers or students, the decrease may have been due to a major flu outbreak in Year 1 and the fact that there was a nurse present 2 hr or less in Year 1 compared to 3.6 hr in Year 2.</p>
<p>Not reflected in the quantitative data is the teacher’s commitment to the well-being of the student, and the frustrations about their responsibility for health issues in the classroom, as well as their potential liability. Comments such as “teachers are asked to perform tasks that only an RN (registered nurse) is allowed to do in the real world. Practicing medical assistance is not the role of a teacher” and “I think it is an imperative liability issue that we don’t have a full time school nurse on campus” illustrate their concerns.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-1059840511429684">
<title>Early Releases</title>
<p>The data provide an impressive portrait of the acuity level and variety of health issues, the teacher and nurse monitor and assess on a day-to-day basis. On any given day, half the schools do not have a nurse present. When present, the nurse is there only for a few hours and, due to inconsistent communication, teachers may not know the nurse is at the school. Teachers, assuming there is no alternative, either call the parents or guardian or request office personnel make the appropriate call. Students, therefore, may be released as ill who could have returned to the classroom if they had been evaluated by a nurse. This is best illustrated in Year 1 in the one school with a full-time nurse. Twenty-eight students were seen by that nurse on the day of the survey and 24 of those returned to the classroom rather than being released early.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-1059840511429684">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>Due to the success of the original survey data that resulted in funding for a full-time nurse at one elementary school for 3 years, the research partners decided to use the revised survey form and expand the study to include all county elementary schools, In retrospect, validation procedures should have been performed on the revised survey to ensure that teachers interpreted the survey questions consistently, especially health care terminology. The use of a cross-sectional design provided data for only one point in time each year and was limited to one geographic area; therefore, these findings cannot be generalized to other elementary school settings.</p>
<p>Additional limitations included the exclusion of the teachers not present on the day of the survey and the potential recall bias of teachers’ estimation of time spent on health issues as opposed to use of checklists or direct classroom observation. Another limitation was related to collecting early release data and the inconsistent record keeping process for documenting the reasons for early releases by the school personnel.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-1059840511429684">
<title>Implications</title>
<p>This 2-year study provided an important first step in quantifying the amount of time teachers spend on health issues in relation to lost instructional time and the impact of school nurse presence on early releases. Elementary teachers lost approximately an hour of instructional time each day due to student health issues. Over the course of a school year, this accounts for approximately 180 hr of classroom disruption and lost instructional time. When nurses were present, data reflect that students are more likely to be returned to the classroom, thus increasing student learning time. Using these data, administrators, teachers, and school nurses could develop a proposal to present to local, state, national, and private funding sources to support additional school nurses.</p>
<p>These data provide a baseline for future studies assessing teacher time dedicated to health issues in relation to school nurse presence. They also provide the groundwork for stimulating discussions about improving the communication process related to the nurses’ schedule, teachers’ desire for the nurse to have established office hours and the ability of the nurse to “protect” those hours from other interferences or commitments. Teachers recognized that the current scheduling is often changed by external factors such as changing priorities based on school or student needs, and being “on call” to other schools for emergent situations. Given the current reality of nursing hours per school, these data could also be used for an ongoing trend analysis for developing a workforce allocation plan. Examples of the utility of such a plan would be the school nurse employers’ ability to respond to peak illness patterns.</p>
