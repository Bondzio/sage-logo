<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>The treatment of a chronic displaced distal interphalangeal (DIP) intra-articular fracture can be extremely difficult. We report four DIP intra-articular fractures, which had not been treated for three months. All involved more than 30% of the articular surface. The operative treatment is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1753193411436288">Figure 1</xref>. The DIP joint was distracted with pins and rubber bands for one week to decrease the stiffness of the DIP joint. Then the fracture was fixed using a hook plate fabricated from a two-hole 1.3 mm Arbeitsgemeinschaft für Osteosynthesefragen (AO) hand modular system straight plate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1753193411436288">Teoh and Lee, 2007</xref>) through a curvilinear transverse dorsal incision. A K-wire was used to reduce the fracture by inserting it into the fracture from one side. In three cases, a small piece of cancellous bone from the olecranon was grafted into the site. Traction was continued for a mean of 3.6 weeks after surgery. The K-wire was removed five or six weeks after surgery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1753193411436288">Figure 1</xref>). The average range of motion improved from about –11° to 24° preoperatively, to about 4° to 70° postoperatively. Using Clawford’s score, three cases were excellent and one case was good. In all the fracture united, and the articular surface reconstruction was satisfactory.</p>

A radiograph, three months after injury, showed DIP joint subluxation caused by an avulsion fracture of the base of the distal phalanx. (b) This demonstrates the DIP joint traction started one week before fixation. (c) A K-wire passed to the palmar side was used for reduction, and a hook plate fixed the fragment. The percutaneous K-wire, placed for the DIP joint traction, was maintained during surgery. (d) The K-wire was removed five weeks after surgery. (e) A radiograph, about one year after the surgery, showed that the congruency of the DIP joint was satisfactory.</p></caption>

<p>A bony mallet finger should not be considered as just a mallet finger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1753193411436288">Thayer, 1988</xref>). The treatment of chronic bony mallet fingers with subluxation or joint contracture is difficult. The hook plate, which provides rigid fixation, allows the early motion, but can be technically demanding and can cause complications, such as nail growth defect and skin perforation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1753193411436288">Szalay et al., 2011</xref>). We feel that pre-operative traction stretches tissue around the DIP joint, and makes the operation easier. Traction after fixation protects the soft tissues and the realigned fracture, thus preserving joint congruity while allowing early motion.</p>
