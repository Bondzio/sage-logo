<abstract>
<p>There is legislation that withdraws governmental assistance where parents are using drugs. Social justice is an important consideration in any policy that modifies governmental assistance that benefits vulnerable children. The purpose of this policy analysis is to analyze identified legislation that effect governmental assistance for children in response to parents’ substance misuse. A selective review of data-driven studies examined findings describing actual or potential effects on children of legislation targeting parental substance misuse. Challenges in design, processes, and implementation contribute to poor child outcomes. Identifiable constructs of social justice were missing in the reviewed legislation. Social injustice is a potential outcome for children when legislative intent focuses solely on addressing parental drug behaviors. Legislative alternatives to withdrawing support can address substance abuse while maintaining health promotion for these vulnerable children.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Recent estimates determined that over 8 million children lived with at least one parent who was dependent on alcohol or illicit drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1527154413481678">SAMHSA, 2009</xref>). Parental substance use disorder (PSUD) is a major risk factor for negative outcomes for children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1527154413481678">DHHS, 2009</xref>). Maltreated children of parents with substance use disorders (SUD) remain in the child welfare system longer and experience poorer health outcomes compared to other children with parents who do not have SUD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1527154413481678">DHHS, 2009</xref>). The child maltreatment, commonly reported as child neglect, is associated with poverty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1527154413481678">DHHS, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1527154413481678">Golden, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1527154413481678">Wilke, Kamata, &amp; Cash, 2005</xref>). Social attitudes and policy responses to parental SUD contribute to the complexity of this critical public health issue in America (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1527154413481678">DHHS, 2012</xref>). The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) indicates an estimated total economic impact of $600 billion annually for SUD (including lost productivity and health- and crime-related costs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1527154413481678">NIDA, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>The basic needs of children, including nutrition, shelter, and health care are at risk due to variables surrounding parental substance misuse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1527154413481678">DHHS, 2009</xref>). Federal and state legislation target SUD using control strategies to reduce drug supply or demand. Historically, more policy funding was aimed at reducing supply rather than demand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1527154413481678">Fornili &amp; Burda, 2010</xref>). Policy implementation, design, and processes are factors that can influence child outcomes regardless of the policy’s aim (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1527154413481678">Schouwstra &amp; Ellman, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1527154413481678">Young et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>There is a shortage of reported policy analysis examining the impact of specific U.S. legislation on children affected by parental SUD within the context of social justice. The purpose of this policy analysis is to examine selected legislation affecting government assistance for children of parents with SUD and systematically evaluate their conformity to social justice.</p>
<p>The policy search and selection yielded two federal policies for review. Federal legislation identified were the following: (a) The 1996 Contract with America Amendment Act (the termination of the Social Security Administration’s [SSA] Drug and alcohol program), and (b) The 1996 Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act (PRWORA) creating the Temporary Assistance of Needy Families (TANF) Program. Although there are several states with known policies surrounding parental substance use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1527154413481678">Young et al., 2009</xref>), none met the criteria for this search that was to find data-driven child outcomes associated with the withdrawal of government assistance due to PSUD after policy enactment. After evaluating conformation to attributes of social justice, this article discusses future implications and relevance of policy evaluation, nursing advocacy, and future nursing research to inform policy.</p>

<title>Operational Frameworks, Contexts, and Definitions</title>
<p>Children of parents with SUD receiving governmental assistance are “vulnerable” because of increased susceptibility to poor health outcomes stemming from interrelated dimensions of human interactions influenced by resource availability over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1527154413481678">Aday, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1527154413481678">Kregg-Byers &amp; Schlenk, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1527154413481678">Mechanic &amp; Tanner, 2007</xref>). Because most state legislation address PSUD solely within the context of illegal drug use, particularly when determining governmental assistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1527154413481678">Young et al., 2009</xref>), the term of “parents affected by SUD” in this analysis refers to parents who experience SUD of one or several categories of illicit drugs (i.e., cocaine, amphetamines, heroin, lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), etc.). The “affected” parent with SUD is frequently required to report substance use, and is subject to criminal prosecution, employment restrictions, social work monitoring, loss of custodial care of children, imprisonment, fines, and ineligibility of governmental assistance associated with their exposures to the legal system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1527154413481678">Mechanic &amp; Tanner, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1527154413481678">Young et al., 2009</xref>; ).</p>
<p>The policy search included both federal and state legislation, but policy selection was limited to research articles that explicitly named federal or state policy effect related to withdrawal of governmental assistance and substance misuse. Two federal policies and no state legislation were identified in the research literature from the established criteria. Government assistance for children considered in the selection included health-care coverage, food, shelter, and access to care.</p>

<title>Social Justice Framework</title>
<p>Social justice attributes that guided the analysis are those defined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1527154413481678">Buettner-Schmidt and Lobo (2012)</xref>. These attributes of social justice are the following: (a) fairness; (b) equity in the distribution of power, resources and processes that affect the sufficiency of the social determinants of health; (c) just institutions, systems, structures, policies and processes; (d) equity in human development, rights and sustainability; and (e) sufficiency of well-being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1527154413481678">Buettner-Schmidt &amp; Lobo, 2012</xref>, p. 954).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1527154413481678">Buettner-Schmidt and Lobo (2012)</xref> proposed distinguishable attributes of social justice, recognizing variations in context, and the nature of social justice as both process and product.

<p>The analysis also considers social justice as an ethics term that frames a significant focus of public health nursing in general, and particularly in advocacy efforts on behalf of vulnerable children ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1527154413481678">Anderson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1527154413481678">Drevdahl, Kneipp, Canales, &amp; Dorcy, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1527154413481678">Mohammed, 2006</xref>) . Social justice is “a full participation in society and the balancing of benefits and burdens by all citizens, resulting in equitable living and a just ordering of society” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1527154413481678">Buettner-Schmidt &amp; Lobo, 2012</xref>, p. 955). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1527154413481678">Anderson et al. (2009)</xref> propose that social justice is a matter of life and death. It influences how we live, distribute resources within environmental contexts, and determine risks of illness, injury, and premature death. Conceptually, a social justice framework characterizes relationships of the individual to sustainable relational, environmental, economic, and social resources over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1527154413481678">Anderson et al., 2009</xref>). The impact of social determinants of health such as poverty, ethnicity, gender, and access to care and service delivery strongly influences the health status of individuals and communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1527154413481678">Mohammed, 2006</xref>).

<title>Policy Analysis Framework</title>
<p>The Geelhoed–Schouwstra Framework (GSF) guides policy evaluations beyond the explicit text of the policy. In order to “capture the most important factors that generally influence the outcome of a policy,” consideration is given to all variables and stakeholders that a policy impacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1527154413481678">Schouwstra &amp; Ellman, 2006</xref>, p. 2). The framework supports considerations of policy impact beyond a one dimensional outcome view focusing on short-term benefits. Thus, the analysis considered the selected federal legislation’s impact on the parent affected by SUD and their child (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1527154413481678">Schouwstra &amp; Ellman, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1527154413481678">Young et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The GSF model considers a policy’s conceptual and implementation frameworks. The policy’s conceptual framework is based on intended outcomes, motivations, and assumptions with consideration of cultural, historical, and geographical factors. The policy’s implementation framework addresses the political, social, economic, and legal organizations and institutions responsible for implementation, and the primary stakeholders with obvious or implied interests in its outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1527154413481678">Fornili, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1527154413481678">Schouwstra &amp; Ellman, 2006</xref>). This model supports examining legislative intent as a separate element from its implementation and measured outcomes. Using the GSF, the process identifies key factors that influence policy outcomes and whether outcomes conform to policy intent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1527154413481678">Schouwstra &amp; Ellman, 2006</xref>).</p>

<p>Abstracts were reviewed and articles were included if the research identified parental SUD, state legislation, federal legislation, or other legal sanctions or considerations that could interrupt government assistance and influence parent and/or child health outcomes, resulting from parental SUD. The authors excluded studies if not written in English, if government assistance for at-risk children were not within the context of parental SUD, and if the study excluded potential or actual health outcomes of the parents or children affected by SUD. Although the search for research articles was limited to the geographical location of the United States, an applicable international theory was included for critical analysis (GSF) of direct and indirect child outcomes associated with legislative actions targeting parental SUD.</p>
<p>The final literature search yielded 15 data-driven studies and two books. After identifying certain federal legislation from the research databases using the outlined selection criteria above, the authors searched legal (e.g. Thomas Library), and government websites for the original legislation in order to determine intent and purpose.</p>

<title>Analysis Method</title>
<p>Policy analysis involved reading 15 data-driven studies to synthesize the policies’ impact and evaluate the policy’s conformation to social justice. The authors desired to identify trends in legislation over time, thus the sample included selected studies, published from 1995 to 2012, investigating concepts of PSUD, legislation, funding and/or parent and child outcomes within the research databases of the Cumulative Index for Nursing and Allied Health (CINAHL), PsycInfo, and PubMed.</p>

<title>Principal Findings and Results</title>
<p>Prior to January 1, 1997, individuals with SUD could qualify for government assistance through the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program. After the welfare reform, this policy was changed resulting in lost income and health care benefits for many low-income individuals with SUD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1527154413481678">Hogan, Unick, Speiglman, &amp; Norris, 2008</xref>). The 1996 PRWORA established the TANF as a transitional program to increase employment among the population eligible for government assistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1527154413481678">DHHS, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1527154413481678">Meara, 2006</xref>). In addition to the provisions concerning time limits and work requirements for TANF recipients, PRWORA allows states to conduct drug testing of TANF recipients and impose sanctions on those who test positive including withdrawal or denial of income assistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1527154413481678">DHHS, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1527154413481678">Meara, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1527154413481678">NCSL, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1527154413481678">Radel &amp; Wulff, 2011</xref>). The general intent of both federal legislative acts was to reduce the number of Americans receiving government assistance by promoting personal responsibility and self-sufficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1527154413481678">Green, Rockhill, &amp; Burrus, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>The federal legislation selected focused on demand reduction as its policy scope for dealing with social and economic challenges surrounding PSUD. Generally, the measuring and reporting of policy outcomes on individuals were obtained at scheduled times following the enactment of selected legislation.</p>
<p>Although federal policies generally have shifted over recent decades to include more health promotion and prevention initiatives, the task of prioritizing funding to ensure the health of vulnerable children affected by parental SUD continues to pose systematic and organizational challenges at the state and local levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1527154413481678">Aday, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1527154413481678">Golden, 1997</xref>). The findings from this analysis are the following:</p>
<list id="list6-1527154413481678" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Finding #1</italic>: Findings regarding “fairness” of the policies: One policy lacked attributes of fairness as it relates to SUD disability type. For example, following the termination of the SSI’s drug addicts and alcoholics (DA&amp;As) program in 1996, one longitudinal study in Los Angeles county on 308 randomly selected sample participants affected by the legislation found that many individuals in the study who reported significant physical and mental health problems were not reclassified under another disability program and did not receive government assistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1527154413481678">Watkins, Podus, &amp; Lombardi, 2001</xref>). The purpose of this study was to examine the physical and mental health of those individuals affected by the legislation at the time the legislation was enacted, and determine their income source after the legislation took effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1527154413481678">Watkins et al., 2001</xref>). The authors did not address the parental status of these sample participants, but withdrawal of government assistance in this scenario does raise concern for the health and well-being of the participants in this sample, and any children involved. Another large nine-site longitudinal study followed 1,764 randomly selected SSI beneficiaries over two years to determine how loss of government assistance affected drug use. Results indicated that declines in use of alcohol and illegal drugs other than marijuana were not significant for those who retained and those who lost SSI benefits, indicating that termination of the program had no effect on levels of substance use. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1527154413481678">Green, Kappagoda, Martinovich, Norris, &amp; Speiglman, 2003</xref>). In this study, higher drug use levels were strongly associated with those “sample participants younger than 44 years, psychiatric and legal problems, family or social conflicts, suggesting that subsets of the DA&amp;A population need individualized services beyond income support” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1527154413481678">Green et al., 2003</xref>, p. 291). This study reported parental status of sample participants and although child outcomes were not addressed for the two year period, it was noted that the tendency towards less frequent use of alcohol and drugs were present when minor children were living in the home (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1527154413481678">Green et al., 2003</xref>). Fairness represents the degree of equality of human rights regardless of disability type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1527154413481678">Buettner-Schmidt &amp; Lobo, 2012</xref>).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Finding #2</italic>: Findings regarding the “equity” in the distribution of power, resources, and processes: Both federal policies lacked equity in the distribution of societal benefits and burdens as an outcome effect. Several studies have shown significant economic and service-related barriers for affected individuals with both policies after enactment. Economic and service barriers generally included access to care challenges, lack of insurance coverage for eligible mothers and children, poor physical and mental health of former recipients and their children, and substantial employment barriers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1527154413481678">Birenbaum, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1527154413481678">Cawley, Schroeder, &amp; Simon, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1527154413481678">Morgenstern &amp; Blanchard, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1527154413481678">Romero, Chavkin, Wise, Hess, &amp; Van Landeghem, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1527154413481678">Watkins et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1527154413481678">Willis, Malloy, &amp; Kliegman, 2000</xref> ). For example, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1527154413481678">Pollack and Reuter’s (2006)</xref> study looking at the change in relationship between substance use, government assistance, and substance-abuse treatment for low-income mothers before and after legislation enactment, low-income mothers who used substances and received government assistance were more likely to receive treatment services than other low low-income mothers who used substances. Controlling for other variables, government assistance was associated with a higher prevalence of illicit drug use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1527154413481678">Pollack &amp; Reuter, 2006</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1527154413481678">Pollack and Reuter (2006)</xref>, “welfare is a major access point to identify and serve low-income mothers with SUD, but it reaches a smaller proportion of illicit drug users than it did pre-reform” (p. 2024). In another review of the literature by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1527154413481678">Meara (2006)</xref>, evidence supported that women with SUD experienced significantly greater employment barriers than other TANF recipients. Since the 1996 Welfare Reform, Meara also reported that women with SUDs have increased employment and earnings, but by less than similar women who do not have SUD (p. 223). Attributes of distribution involves resource availability and the equal opportunity of resource sharing through access to support resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1527154413481678">Buettner-Schmidt &amp; Lobo, 2012</xref>).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Finding #3</italic>: Findings regarding “Just” structural elements (i.e., institutions, systems, structures, policies, and processes): Both selected policies lacked attributes of just structural elements as an outcome effect. For example, few Maternal and Child Health (MCH) agencies reported a sufficient number of programs at the state and local levels to address the special needs of women receiving TANF who have health problems or have children with health problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1527154413481678">Romero et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1527154413481678">Romero, Chavkin, Wise, Smith, &amp; Wood, 2002</xref>). In one study in Cook county, Illinois looking at the prevalence of psychiatric and SUD among single mothers nearing lifetime welfare eligibility limits, the study found that many participants remain untreated for their conditions despite the high prevalence of mental health problems and SUD among sample participants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1527154413481678">Cook et al., 2009</xref>). The consequences of terminating government assistance are noteworthy considering the potential for adverse effects on both mothers and their young children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1527154413481678">Cook et al., 2009</xref>).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Finding #4</italic>: Findings regarding “equity” in human development, rights, and sustainability: Findings from selected studies did not indicate a direct lack associated with equity in human development and sustainability. However, noteworthy maternal findings for both federal policies indicated very little effect on parental substance use after the termination of government assistance, which may compound the risks of unmet needs of the child (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1527154413481678">Cook et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1527154413481678">Meara &amp; Greenfield, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1527154413481678">Pollack &amp; Reuter, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1527154413481678">Romero et al., 2002</xref> ).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Finding #5</italic>: Findings regarding “sufficiency of well-being”: Both federal policies lacked attributes promoting sufficiency of well-being. Examples of insufficiency primarily are the increased economic hardships experienced by former welfare recipients with SUDs after termination of government assistance as part of the 1996 welfare reform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1527154413481678">Green et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1527154413481678">Hogan et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1527154413481678">Meara, 2006</xref>; Pollack et al., 2006; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1527154413481678">Romero et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1527154413481678">Watkins et al., 2001</xref> ). Several studies of former SSI sample participants who were mothers nearing lifetime eligibility had untreated psychiatric conditions and SUD raising concern for their well-being and that of their young children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1527154413481678">Birenbaum, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1527154413481678">Cook et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1527154413481678">Meara, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1527154413481678">Morgenstern &amp; Blanchard, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1527154413481678">Watkins et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1527154413481678">Willis et al., 2000</xref>).</p></list-item></list>

<title>Discussion of Findings</title>
<p>It is common knowledge that adequate funding drives service delivery and positively supports public health outcomes. Many federal and state policies have attempted to address PSUD by reducing illegal drug supply or drug demand. The selected federal policies heavily affected low-income parents with SUD directly during welfare reform. There was very little research focused on child outcomes connected with PSUD and withdrawal of governmental assistance. The research naming legislation primarily addressed parental or general adult SUD and the social, health-related, and economic challenges within the context of policy enactment.</p>
<p>Many politicians rationalized that the majority of these low-income individuals with “legitimate” physical or mental illnesses would retain their government assistance by requalifying under another governmental program, while undeserving low-income individuals with SUDs would be forced to find employment or alternative sources of income (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1527154413481678">Green et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1527154413481678">Meara, 2006</xref>). Policy officials advocating this change estimated that 75% of former SSI’s DA&amp;A recipients would requalify under another disability category, but in actuality, only a reported 35% of this population retained their SSI benefits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1527154413481678">Green et al., 2008</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1527154413481678">Green et al. (2008)</xref>, “Policymakers should have realized that the social welfare of some of our society’s most vulnerable members had been compromised—a result that is antithetical to the goals and objectives of a progressive welfare state and a healthy society” (p. 242).</p>
<p>Over a decade after the enactment of these selected federal policies, we still know very little about the legislative effect for children of low-income parents with SUD. Most of the research in this review focused primarily on the negative health outcomes of the addicted parent or adult who became ineligible for government assistance after legislation was passed, with little emphasis placed on child health outcomes. None of the research examined focused on long-term consequences for children of parents with SUD who lost government assistance, although several noted the potential adverse effect of withdrawing governmental assistance on the children.</p>
<p>It remains unclear as to how children are affected by federal policy enactment that withdraws government assistance from low-income parents with SUD. Research findings suggest that policy program funding should target health promotion and prevention initiatives for children affected by SUD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1527154413481678">Birenbaum, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1527154413481678">Young et al., 2009</xref>). However, when the intended outcomes are to reduce the demand for illegal drugs through substance-abuse treatment, challenges arise due to economic barriers, limited access to care, and systematic and process issues at all governmental levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1527154413481678">Aday, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1527154413481678">Golden, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1527154413481678">Green et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Application of the GSF in this article provided a broad perspective for examining the selected federal legislation that allows for consideration of the effect that arise to the children of parents with SUD. Social injustice is a potential outcome for children when policy intent focuses solely on addressing the parent’s alcohol or drug behaviors. When support resources are interrupted through legislation, the child may experience a significant risk of unmet basic needs including nutrition and health care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1527154413481678">Aday, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1527154413481678">Golden, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1527154413481678">Schouwstra &amp; Ellman, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Although states have traditionally removed the child from the home and placed them in foster care system as a means of addressing their health needs, long-term–foster care placement has yielded negative physical, emotional, and social health outcomes for these children over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1527154413481678">Golden, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1527154413481678">Green &amp; Rockhill, 2004</xref>; ). Even now, few treatment programs are available that address the unique needs and health outcomes of both the parent and child in substance-abuse treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1527154413481678">Young et al., 2009</xref>). What we must consider is the immediate and long-term consequences of these policies on the welfare of vulnerable children.</p>
<p>There are several limitations to this policy analysis. The policy search was selective in identifying specific U.S. legislation addressing support resources for children of parents with SUD. The method for determining relevant articles might have contributed to an exclusion of other relevant articles applicable to both population and subject matter. Key phrases used in computer databases may have been inconsistently applied yielding unrepresentative samples.</p>

<title>Implications for Nursing Advocacy and Research to Inform Policy Reform</title>
<p>A social justice framework (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1527154413481678">Buettner-Schmidt &amp; Lobo, 2012</xref>) can guide nursing advocacy and public health nursing research to inform policies that impact vulnerable children. Vulnerable children are innocent, but dependent bystanders when a parent engages in substance misuse. Policies that contribute to or place a child at risk for poor health outcomes do not conform to a framework of social justice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1527154413481678">Buettner-Schmidt &amp; Lobo, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1527154413481678">Mohammed, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Nurse advocates must raise awareness of the compounded risks to children of parents with SUD when support is interrupted. Alternative strategies that depart from punitive and coercion strategies, and instead promote health seeking behaviors need further nursing research to establish, but they offer better-informed and more effective policy content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1527154413481678">Hinshaw &amp; Grady, 2011</xref>). Program evaluations conducted by nurse administrators and investigators, using social justice as an outcome measurement, can inform state level programs where it is difficult for families with SUD to navigate when seeking assistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1527154413481678">Aday, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1527154413481678">Young et al., 2009</xref>). Policy solutions aimed at affecting parental SUD and funding must encompass both short and long-term health indicators for children in order to provide a truly effective means of change towards wellness, adequate service delivery, and order in a just society for all.</p>
