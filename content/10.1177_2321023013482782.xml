<p>The career of Rajni Kothari helps narrate the story of how political science in India acquired a measure of national and international visibility and standing. Much of this story is told through a kind of personal ethnography on which we draw, Kothari’s 2002 book, <italic>Memoirs: Uneasy is the Life of the Mind</italic>. It details Kothari’s role as an institution-builder and a conceptual and methodological pioneer. We tell Rajni Kothari’s story from the mid-1950s through the mid-1970s when his fierce opposition to Indira Gandhi’s emergency changed his life’s trajectory, eventuating in the formation of <italic>Lokayan</italic>, ‘a Gandhian-socialist’ (this is how Gail Omvedt characterized Kothari’s <italic>Lokayan</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-2321023013482782">Omvedt, 1993</xref>, p. 193]) civil society organi-zation that strived to arouse political participation and promoted social change at the grassroots. Kothari’s shaping of political science in India arises not only from the book he regarded as ‘a classic’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2321023013482782">Kothari, 2002</xref>, p. 69) but also and more fundamentally from his pioneering work in behavioural political science, particularly studies of electoral behaviour and his work on the role of caste in Indian politics.</p>
<p>Our story starts with a double recognition, one by Sachin Chaudhury, the fabled founding editor of <italic>The Economic Weekly</italic>, the other by Richard Park, perhaps the first American political scientist of India and himself something of an institution-builder.</p>
<p>After obtaining a B.Sc. (Economics) at the London School of Economics, Kothari returned from England in the mid-1950s and in 1958 took up a post as lecturer in the Political Science and Economics departments at the University of Baroda. He reports a ‘breakthrough’ as a result of ‘chance encounters’ during his ‘first field investigation’ at the All India Congress Committee session at Bhavnagar in Gujarat. He gained access to:
<disp-quote>
<p>some rather well-known individuals … and entered into extensive discussions with all types of Congressmen from different regions … discovering widespread existence of factions and groups … the play of power conflicts … and how all this was shaping the running of government at various levels. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2321023013482782">Kothari, 2002</xref>, pp. 30–31)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>‘Spurred by the “field work” at Bhavnagar’, Kothari wrote a series of six articles in 1961 under the title ‘Form and Substance in Indian Politics’. ‘Young though I was’, Sachin Chaudhury ‘reposed full trust in me’ by publishing the first article in a series, counting on Kothari to deliver the rest in successive weeks. ‘In a matter of a few years’, Kothari writes, ‘I was able to launch, along with some others, what many of [my] reviewers have dubbed as a “new political science” ’ (<italic>ibid</italic>.).</p>
<p>Kothari’s second recognition happened soon thereafter when his ‘Form and Substance’ series which, he tells us, ‘created quite an impact’, caught the attention of Richard Park, resident head of the Asia Foundation in India. Kothari quotes Park’s description of the series as ‘a breath of fresh air in understanding Indian politics’. Park provided Kothari with ‘a small sum of money, enough it seems, to transform ‘a large empty hall into a workspace for half a dozen people’. This space, the then unused Indian Adult Education Association located at I.P. Extension in New Delhi, became the centre that Kothari had been thinking about, a place deliberately set up to be free of official pressures and academic bureaucracy. It was under these circumstances that in 1963 Kothari launched the CSDS.</p>
<p>Park’s ‘small grant’ ran for only three years. There was no assurance of continuity, much less of security or big salaries. ‘The kinds of people who joined’, Kothari writes, ‘were least concerned about salaries and perks and security’. They joined, he says, because they felt excited about ‘the prospect that lay ahead’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2321023013482782">Kothari, 2002</xref>, pp. 37–39).</p>
<p>The CSDS soon became the premier institution in India for social science research. It did so because Kothari attracted talented risk-takers to the centre, encouraged them to identify and pursue unconventional research subjects, and quickly built a high-morale community of scholars and intellectuals.</p>
<p>Early in his career, Kothari became a bridge between American and Indian political science. He spent four months at Stanford University in 1964 at the instance of Gabriel Almond, the dominant figure in his day in comparative politics. Then spent a year at the Centre for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences at Palo Alto, and encountered the Survey Research Centre at Michigan, the Mecca of survey research and electoral studies both then and now. Kothari arranged for the extended collaboration of the CSDS with Philip Jacob of the University of Pennsylvania on a cross-national study of values in politics, and with Samuel Eldersveld, of the University of Michigan’s Survey Research Centre, to study Kerala’s 1965 state assembly elections and India’s 1967 national elections. The two projects that Kothari brought home from his Stanford visit provided a ‘comfortable financial base’ for the CSDS, including means to train teams that Kothari’s centre was then building (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2321023013482782">Kothari, 2002</xref>, pp. 215–216). Kothari was not the first Indian political scientist to study electoral behaviour in India, but his energetic early involvement helped establish election studies as one of the hallmarks of Indian political science.</p>
<p>It is hard to date the behavioural turn in political science and in other social sciences in India or to capture fully why it was taken but there is no doubt that Rajni Kothari took the turn and contributed mightily to it. One reason for the turn in India seems to have been a desire to shed the colonial legacy which, in political science, was the institutional and legal scholarship that characterized academic work under the British Raj. Of course, institutional political science continues to this day; there is continuity as well as change. That is why for India, we speak of a ‘turn’ rather than, as was the case for the US, a behavioural ‘revolution’.</p>
<p>In addition to shedding the colonial legacy, another reason for the behavioural turn was the enhanced prestige that Jawaharlal Nehru, India’s Prime Minister for the first fourteen years of Independence, brought to science as a way of thinking and acting. For him, science was an antidote to tradition and religion. Jawaharlal Nehru’s influence on the 1950s and 1960s made those decades an era of enthusiastic modernism, of five-year plans and of scientific development. The decades reflected Nehru’s effort to place science at the centre of India’s intellectual life. Behaviouralism gave political scientists reason to believe political science’s claim to be a ‘science’. They began to deprecate institutional, legalist, and normative approaches to the study of political science. It should be concerned with causality and laws, not interpretation and meaning, work with survey instruments and population samples, not case studies, and favour synchronic over diachronic analysis. At one level, behaviouralism was welcomed in the US and in India for similar reasons, its empiricism.</p>
<p>Behaviouralism encouraged political scientists to put aside their texts, leave their studies and libraries, and get into the ‘field’ to do hands-on research among voters and politicians. In the US, it was primarily in the cities; in India primarily in the villages. In Kothari’s words, ‘We knew very little [in the 1960s] about what ordinary people thought about with respect to socio-political, cultural and psychological subjects’(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2321023013482782">Kothari, 2002</xref>, p. 216).</p>
<p>In the US, empiricism in the form of the ‘behavioural revolution’ was experienced as a paradigm shift, liberating political science from the texts of the ‘classical curriculum’, the contextless study of formal institutions, and an unreflexive normativity. In India, it was experienced as a triple liberation, not only from the ‘classical curriculum’ and institutional formalism, but also from the culturally alien literature of the Macaulay legacy in Indian higher education. By 1969 David Easton, in his 1969 presidential address at the American Political Science Association, called for an end to the behavioural revolution because behaviourism had succumbed to a sterile scientism and formalism that prevented professionally ambitious political scientists from addressing pressing real world problems such as war and poverty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2321023013482782">Easton, 1969</xref>).</p>
<p>In India behavioural political science was addressing an important real world problem by showing that democracy in the form of universal suffrage and competitive elections could succeed in India, a country that Seymour Martin Lipset, in 1959, alleged lacked the ‘requisites of democracy’.</p>
<p>Behaviouralism not only opened an avenue for ‘science’ in India’s political science world, it also contributed towards liberating India’s intellectual life from its Brahmanical legacy. Behaviouralism had a counter-hierarchical thrust. Arriving on the scene at a historical moment, when India was becoming a constitutional democracy and introducing universal suffrage, behavioural political science proved attractive because its democratic characteristics subverted an elitist culture of knowledge. Behavioural political science sought and found knowledge about the many, not the few; about the sovereign people, not about sacred texts. It dignified knowledge about persons from all walks of life and stations in society and rewarded the labour of those who went into the field to acquire that knowledge. Gopal Guru went further when he argued in ‘How Egalitarian are the Social Sciences in India’:
<disp-quote>
<p>as 50 years of experience shows, social science practice has harboured a cultural hierarchy dividing it into the vast, inferior mass of academics who pursue empirical social science and the privileged few who are considered the theoretical pundits with reflective capacity which makes them intellectually superior to the former. To use a more familiar analogy, Indian social science presents a pernicious divide between theoretical Brahmins and empirical shudras. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2321023013482782">Guru, 2002</xref>, p. 5003)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In addition to helping transfer behavioural political science from the US to India, Rajni Kothari also helped introduce modernization theory and its correlate, structural functionalism to India. It was the provenance of his deeply researched and highly influential 1970 book <italic>Politics in India</italic> that brought Almondian modernization theory to India’s attention, not its theoretical framework, which was eclectic.</p>
<p>Both modernization theory and structural functionalism had emanated from the work of Talcott Parsons, the Harvard sociologist, who with the University of Chicago’s Edward Shils, published the essay ‘Toward a General Theory of Action’, in a book of the same name (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-2321023013482782">Parsons and Shils, 1962</xref>). They laid out the four functions of the social system and the five pattern variables that defined modernization.</p>
<p>The basics of structural functionalism and modernization theory soon took possession of political science’s commanding heights in the US as the writings of David Easton and Gabriel Almond gained increasing influence. In 1960, Almond made the extraordinary claim that ‘the concept of the political system… separates out analytically the structures which perform political functions in all societies regardless of scale, degree of differentiation and culture’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2321023013482782">Almond, 1960</xref>, p. 5), and wrote about ‘the universality of political structure’ and ‘the universality of the political functions’ (<italic>ibid</italic>., pp. 9–13).</p>
<p>In his 1959 Foreword to the 1960 Almond and Coleman edited volume, <italic>The Politics of Developing Areas</italic>, Frederick Dunn, Director of Princeton University’s Centre for International Studies, held that Almond had made possible ‘for the first time, a comparative method of analysis for political systems of all kinds’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2321023013482782">Dunn, 1960</xref>, p. v), not least the political systems of those areas of the world in which dramatic social changes are taking place<italic>—</italic>Asia, Africa and Latin America. Almond was instrumental in convincing the US Social Science Research Council to sponsor and fund the Committee on Comparative Politics that for more than a decade stood astride the research paradigm and funding for the study of comparative politics in the US and cast a shadow over political science in India.</p>
<p>As we have already noted, Rajni Kothari, along with Bashiruddin Ahmed, spent the academic year 1968–1969 on the Stanford University campus at the Centre for Advanced Studies in the Behavioral Sciences. Gabriel Almond was their sponsor and mentor. At the Centre, Kothari worked on what would become <italic>Politics in India</italic>, in his view his ‘most systematic and comprehensive piece of work, a work preposterously known as, ‘classics,’ which stands apart from all the other works that I have done’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2321023013482782">Kothari, 2002</xref>, p. 69). Its structural–functionalist orientation gained the imprimatur of Gabriel Almond who, in 1970, published it in the US in his Little Brown series in comparative politics. To our knowledge <italic>Politics in India</italic> was the first work of an Indian political scientist to be given such international recognition.</p>
<p>Modernization theory and structural functionalism performed an ‘imperializing’ role in India and other ‘third world’ countries by ignoring or obliterating cultural and historical differences in the name of uniform processes which were said to be the same everywhere and always (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-2321023013482782">Rudolph, 2008</xref>). In the face of deep-seated cultural and social differences and radically different historical contexts, Almond and Coleman held that the features that they found to characterize Euro-American developmental history would have to be replicated if third world countries were to become ‘developed’, modern and democratic. They would have to become like us. Modernization theory imagined only one historical path, that trod by the West, and one goal, the modernity said to characterize the West.</p>
<p>Rajni Kothari’s most important contribution to Political Science in India may very well be his work on caste in Indian politics, the title of his 1970 edited book (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2321023013482782">Kothari, 1970</xref>). In the preface to this influential book he tells his readers that the nine studies in the volume reject ‘ … the prevailing dichotomy between traditional society and modern polity …’ by examining ‘… the interaction between the two in a given community and territorial settings’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2321023013482782">Kothari, 1970</xref>, p. ix). James Manor in his 2010 prologue to the second edition says that Kothari ‘argues that the secularization of castes “through their political involvement … is leading to a breakup of the old [socio-political] order and is gradually forging a reintegration on secular-associational grounds”, a phenomenon that Kothari calls the “traditionalization of modernity” ’(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2321023013482782">Manor, 2010</xref>, pp. xii–xiii).</p>
<p>Rajni Kothari, the social scientist of the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s who brought national and international recognition to Indian political science and founded and shaped CSDS, is not the Rajni Kothari of the 1980s and beyond. The latter had to flee the country as a result of his vigorous opposition to Indira Gandhi’s mid-1970s Emergency. In the 1980s he founded and shaped <italic>Lokayan</italic>, a civil society organization and movement. Its aim was to establish a grassroots model of mass politics in which the people are more important than the state. In his acceptance speech for ‘The Right Livelihood Award’ in 1985, Rajni Kothari told his audience that ‘<italic>Lokayan</italic> is an attempt to build bridges across both the world of action and the world of knowledge’. It asks intellectuals to move ‘away from specialized knowledge to … social knowledge’, a form of knowledge that goes beyond explaining the world to changing it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2321023013482782">Kothari, 1985</xref>).</p>
