<p>This first of a pair of <italic>Rounds</italic> begins with a pair of cases, 50 years apart:</p>
<p><italic>Prelude</italic>: In 1960, the prevailing expert opinion was that a patient with persistent blood pressures of 240/125 and no major target organ damage probably didn’t benefit from – and might be harmed by – antihypertensive drugs (as a medical resident, I was chastised that my ‘reckless’ decision to treat such a patient was likely to cause him to suffer a stroke) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1740774513484395">1</xref>].</p>
<list id="list1-1740774513484395" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Case 1</italic>: Accordingly, it was ethical and highly relevant in 1963 for a group of trialists led by Edward Fries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1740774513484395">2</xref>] to ask the PICOT question:</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><bold>P:</bold> Among hospitalized US veterans with persistent diastolic pressures 115–129 who were free of important target organ damage or secondary hypertension, and who displayed high compliance with appointment-keeping and placebo-taking as outpatients over a 2- to 4-month period,</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><bold>I:</bold> can ‘stepped care’ with three antihypertensive drugs applied under close follow-up by aggressive physicians,</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><bold>C:</bold> compared to identical-appearing placebos given by these same clinicians under identical circumstances,</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><bold>O:</bold> reduce the risk of catastrophic clinical events (such as death, dissecting or ruptured aortic aneurysm, cerebral or retinal hemorrhage, rapidly progressive renal failure, or diastolic pressure &gt; 135)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><bold>T:</bold> over the next 2 years?</p></list-item>
</list>
<p><italic>Interlude</italic>: As you already know, these and subsequent investigators generated powerful RCT evidence that prescribing and taking antihypertensive drugs can reduce death, disability, and target organ damage. Unfortunately, they also generated powerful observational evidence that lots of clinicians weren’t detecting and treating hypertension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1740774513484395">3</xref>], and that lots of patients weren’t taking their medicine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1740774513484395">4</xref>].</p>
<list id="list2-1740774513484395" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Case 2</italic>: Accordingly, it was ethical and highly relevant in 2007 for a group of trialists led by Janusz Kaczorowski [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1740774513484395">5</xref>] to ask the PICOT question:</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><bold>P:</bold> Among mid-sized Ontario communities,</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><bold>I:</bold> does a highly organized, community-based program that combines offering blood pressure assessments to everybody ≥ 65 years old with education and referral of all new or uncontrolled hypertensives to a source of continuing care,</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><bold>C:</bold> compared to the absence of this community-based program,</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><bold>O:</bold> reduce community rates of hospitalization for cardiovascular disease,</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><bold>T:</bold> over the next year?</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>These two trials differed in many ways, but the all-embracing reason behind these differences, and the theme for this pair of <italic>Rounds</italic>, was formulated by a pair of French trialists, Daniel Schwartz and Joseph Lellouch,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1740774513484395">*</xref></sup> in their landmark 1967 paper:<disp-quote>
<p><italic>Generally speaking, the treatments to be studied have to be administered in a ‘context’ made up of the mode of administration, side-effects and their treatment, diet, auxiliary care, associated treatments, etc. The levels of these contextual factors may be fixed in several different ways, of which two may be clearly distinguished – the levels in the two treatment groups may be equalized if we require information on the true effects of the treatments (we aim at acquiring information)</italic> [they labeled these explanatory trials], <italic>or they may be separately optimized, taking into account the ‘cost’ of the treatments in the broadest sense, if what we require is to choose between two modes of therapy (we aim at making a decision)</italic> [they called these pragmatic trials] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1740774513484395">6</xref>].</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Thus, they proposed that the <italic>function</italic> served by a trial ought to determine its <italic>structure</italic>. The trial structure in Case 1 served an <italic>explanatory</italic> function: <italic>Under ideal circumstances</italic> of risk and responsiveness, <italic>can</italic> the expert care of individual, severely hypertensive patients reduce their risks of a relevant but restricted set of outcomes? For example, before they could enter the trial, eligible patients were prescribed placebos laced with riboflavin and given a series of clinic appointments. If, on more than one occasion, they missed an appointment, returned more than 10% (or less than 5%!) of their prescribed pills, or their urine failed to display riboflavin fluorescence under u-v light, they lost their eligibility. This ‘faintness of heart’ strategy rejected almost half them! The ‘survivors’ were randomized to increasing doses of active antihypertensives or corresponding placebos, closely followed, and observed for a restricted set of clinical events and death. No surprise, in retrospect, that this explanatory trial was crash-stopped after catastrophic events occurred (within an average of 16 months) in 14 placebo patients but in no patients on active drugs (indeed, this difference in outcomes was so great that a ‘worst-case scenario’ analysis assigning dire outcomes to lost experimental patients and rosy outcomes to lost placebo patients still generated a huge risk reduction at p = 0.001).</p>
<p>The trial structure in Case 2 served a <italic>pragmatic</italic> function: <italic>Under the usual circumstances</italic> of hypertension detection and treatment that prevail in mid-sized Ontario communities, <italic>does</italic> adding a community-organized offer to identify, educate, follow, and link untreated and uncontrolled hypertensives to family physicians reduce cardiovascular admissions to hospital? Their ‘knowledge translation’ or ‘KT’ interventions, although extremely comprehensive and highly integrated, were simply offered to everyone in the experimental communities, and the citizens and health professionals living there were free to use or ignore them. All the more remarkable, then, that in experimental communities, half-again as many patients were started on antihypertensive drugs (p = 0.02), and fewer citizens were hospitalized for heart attack (rate ratio: 0.87, 95% confidence interval: 0.79–0.97; p = 0.008) or congestive heart failure (0.90, 0.81–0.99; p = 0.029), all accomplished with no increase in total health expenditures! [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1740774513484395">7</xref>] The investigators concluded that extrapolating their program effects would result in about 5000 fewer hospital admissions for cardiovascular disease throughout Ontario, 30,000 fewer in the United Kingdom, and 120,000 fewer in the United States.</p>
<p>The explanatory/pragmatic formulation of Daniel Schwartz and Joseph Lellouch (which they later expanded into a book with Robert Flamant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1740774513484395">8</xref>]) is widely shared and applied (sometimes unwittingly) by trialists and other students of health care. Five years after their seminal paper, everybody’s hero Archie Cochrane<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1740774513484395">†</xref></sup> championed pragmatic trials as the means for determining the ‘effectiveness’ of health care, coupling it with ‘efficiency’ in his landmark book [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1740774513484395">9</xref>]. Others, mere mortals, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1740774513484395">10</xref>] have also coined synonyms that better suited their bedside teaching and clinical application of these notions, using ‘efficacy’ in the place of ‘explanatory’, and ‘effectiveness’ or ‘management’ in the place of ‘pragmatic’.</p>
<p>By whatever names, these ideas ought to permeate every element of the RCTs you design, execute, and read about. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1740774513484395">Table 1</xref> provides examples of the polar extremes of the explanatory and pragmatic attitudes, but trialists like me see them as anchors of a continuum that we’ll explore in the second of this pair of rounds.</p>

<p>For at least two reasons, explanatory trials often constitute the initial Phase 3 attempt to determine the usefulness of new treatments. First, by restricting their scope to surrogate or compound outcomes among high-risk, highly responsive individuals, they can generate a quicker, cheaper answer to the question: Can this new treatment work under ideal conditions?</p>
<p>Second, if this answer is ‘no’, their investigators and sponsors can abandon this treatment, cut their losses, and get on to the next promising candidate. On the other hand, a ‘yes’ answer from an explanatory trial leaves some ambiguity. Although it might help expert clinicians and their highly compliant patients select individual treatment options, it doesn’t answer the broader clinical or health care policy question: Does this treatment improve patient-important outcomes when applied by typical clinicians to typical patients? Answering this latter question is the goal of the pragmatic trial.</p>
<p>Pragmatic trials constitute the ‘proof of the pudding’ for promising results from explanatory trials and are (or bloody well ought to be) a major focus of ‘comparative effectiveness research’. A ‘yes’ answer to a pragmatic trial – if it tested the new treatment when it is applied by typical health professionals to typical patients for the prevention or relief of outcomes that are important to patients – can provide a powerful evidence base for its general implementation, especially when accompanied by an economic analysis. Why, then, don’t we skip the explanatory phase in evaluating new treatments and go at once into pragmatic trials? Let’s pause and think about that for a minute.</p>
<p>I reckon you’ve come up with at least two reasons why this is a bad idea. First off, and of less scientific (but greater career) importance, pragmatic trials are usually lots bigger, longer, and more expensive than explanatory trials, and their investigators don’t have much time to do other publishable work. Second, when the first trial of a new treatment is pragmatic, a ‘no’ answer is ambiguous, for it can’t distinguish a useless treatment from one which is efficacious but difficult for non-expert clinicians to apply, or for patients to take, or is overwhelmed by the risk (e.g., comorbidity) or responsiveness (e.g., age) of its participants.</p>
<p>To prepare for the second round in this pair, I suggest that you look at each of the <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1740774513484395">Table 1</xref> elements of your latest RCT protocol (or the most recent trial report you’ve read in some impressive journal) through these explanatory–pragmatic ‘spectacles’ and see what you think. When Daniel Schwartz and Joseph Lellouch looked at published trials through these ‘lenses’, they were so disappointed that they opened their landmark paper [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1740774513484395">6</xref>]:<disp-quote>
<p><italic>It is the thesis of this paper that most therapeutic trials are inadequately formulated, and this from the earliest stages of their conception. Their inadequacy is basic, in that the trials may be aimed at the solution of one or other of two radically different kinds of problem; the resulting ambiguity affects the definition of the treatments, the assessment of the results, the choice of subjects and the way in which the treatments are compared.</italic></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>I hope that you agree with them, because the second in this pair of <italic>Rounds</italic> will propose a ‘PRECIS’ strategy and some tactics for overcoming these inadequacies.</p>
<p>As usual, this <italic>Round</italic> isn’t over yet, because our discussion period has just begun. Rounders who have other or contrary thoughts about explanatory and pragmatic trials, or have questions or comments about the ones presented here, are encouraged to send them to the Editors, with a copy to Dave at <email>sackett@bmts.com</email>. He’ll summarize them in a later round.</p>
