<sec id="sec1-1460408611418767" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>The management of craniofacial trauma can be one of the greatest challenges for the maxillofacial surgeon and encompasses injuries to the midface, naso-orbito-ethmoidal (NOE) complex and frontal sinus. The facial skeleton provides the supporting framework for the overlying softtissues and also gives points of origin and insertion for the facial musculature. The bones house and protect important regional structures,most notable the eyes and olfactory apparatus, and are the foundation for an individual’s appearance. This complex biomechanics and the functional and cosmetic significance of the facial skeleton mandates that repair of these structures when they are damaged be undertaken with care and precision if the best outcomes are to be achieved.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-1460408611418767"><title>Incidence and aetiology</title>
<p>In the western world, the incidence of maxillary and pan facial fractures has fallen in conjunction with the compulsory use of seatbelts to restrain drivers and other safety devices such as the airbag (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1460408611418767">Mouzakes et al., 2001</xref>). However, road traffic accidents still account for many of these injuries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1460408611418767">Gassner et al., 2003</xref>). Interpersonal violence is a frequent cause, and when these injuries follow assault with implements such as clubs and bats, they are considered to be high-energy injuries. Explosions, both civilian and military, account for a proportion of these injuries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1460408611418767">McVeigh et al., 2010</xref>). As military body armour has improved, more personnel are surviving blast injuries and the necessity to treat associated facial injuries has increased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1460408611418767">Reed and Hale, 2010</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-1460408611418767"><title>Applied anatomy and fractured patterns</title>
<p>The facial skeleton consists of a series of paired bones suspended from the skull base. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1460408611418767">Sicher and Tandler (1928)</xref> described distinct areas on each side where the arrangement of bones is such thatit forms strong struts (‘facial buttresses’) capable of withstanding heavy loads and transmitting the forces generated by chewing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1460408611418767">Figure 1</xref>). The importance of reconstructing these buttresses was introduced by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1460408611418767">Manson et al. (1980)</xref> and further developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1460408611418767">Gruss and McKinnon (1986)</xref>. Tightly adherent to the bones is the periostium to which a number of the facial muscles will attach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1460408611418767">Moss et al., 2000</xref>). The superficial musculo-aponeurotic system (SMAS) layer forms a distinct, complex layer of muscle and fascia, which is an integral component of the dynamic soft tissues of the face. When reconstructing the midface, it is essential to re-suspend these soft tissues in their original pre-injury location to prevent sagging as this creates an unsightly aged appearance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1460408611418767">Phillips et al., 1991</xref>).
<fig id="fig1-1460408611418767" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Facial buttresses.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1460408611418767-fig1.tif"/></fig></p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1460408611418767">Le Fort (1901)</xref> first described three patterns of fracture that occur along lines of weakness in the facial skeleton as a result of blunt trauma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1460408611418767">Figure 2</xref>). A Le Fort 1 injury occurs horizontally across the tooth-bearing segment of the maxilla, separating it from the rest of the face. A Le Fort 2 injury is a pyramidal fracture that detaches the tooth-bearing maxilla and the nasal pyramid from the facial skeleton. Fractures at the Le Fort 3 level cleave the entire midface (maxilla, nasal pyramid and zygomas) from theskull base. Le Fort’s original descriptions were of bilateral symmetrical injuries, but in practice, the injuries seen do not conform to this pattern. Instead unilateral or asymmetric fractures, often at multiple levels and with gross comminution, and midline or para-sagittal splits of the palate (not included in Le Forts description) are seen. This most likely reflects the mechanism of injury with high velocity or oblique impacts producing different patterns of injury than those created by the blunt trauma used in Le Fort’s experiments. Various workers have attempted to devise scoring systems to further classify these injuries but none have proven to be universally accepted. One of the major problems is that these fractures are often a part of a destructive pattern of injury involving other regions such as the frontal sinus and naso-orbital-ethmoidal (NOE) complex, which have their own classification schema (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1460408611418767">Luce, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1460408611418767">Markowitz et al., 1991</xref>). Combining the classification of these injuries into a useable system hasnot yet been achieved and a description of eachindividual injury may be more useful than any scoring system. However, the presence of any Le Fort type injury should alert the clinician to the potential for other system injuries, particularly injuries to the head and cervical spine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1460408611418767">Mulligan and Mahabir, 2010</xref>), and the immediate patient management must follow Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) guidelines.
<fig id="fig2-1460408611418767" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Le Fort fracture patterns.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1460408611418767-fig2.tif"/></fig></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1460408611418767"><title>Midface fractures</title>
<p>The presence of a Le Fort injury is often indicated by extensive facial oedema and bruising appearing within a few hours which will be significantly greater than that seen with isolated zygomatic or nasal injuries. Classically, there is a well-defined periorbital bruising, giving rise to the ‘panda eyes’ appearance in the higher level injuries, where the fracture lines run behind the orbital septum Subconjunctival ecchymosis may also accompany involvement of the orbital walls and floor and the posterior limit of this is often not visible. Epistaxis may occur and this can be substantial. It is also important to exclude cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) rhinorrhea and otorrhea where there has been extensive or pan facial fractures. There may be displacement of the facial skeleton along the slope of the skull base, aided by the unopposed pull of the pharyngeal musculature, creating a concave, ‘dished in’ appearance. The posterio-inferior displacement of the maxilla results in premature contact on the molar teeth and a corresponding anterior open bite and lengthening of the face. Careful, systematic palpation of the facial skeleton (bothintra- and extra-orally), paying particular attention to the orbital margins, nasal bridge and piriform rims will detect most fractures but is often hampered by the soft tissue oedema. It is important to assess mobility of the maxilla and if mobile to identify the points of movement (hard palate only, nasal bridge or lateral orbital walls). The absence of mobility does not exclude fracture, as the displaced maxilla may become impacted. In such cases, a gentle tap of the maxillary teeth with the handle of a mouth mirror will emit a ‘cracked cup’ sound characteristic of these fractures, and there may also be bruising of the palatal vault. In addition to these signs, the conscious patient may complain of trismus or malocclusion, diplopia and altered sensation over the distribution of the infraorbital nerves.</p>
<p>Computerised tomography has largely superseded plain radiographs when imaging these injuries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1460408611418767">Hopper et al., 2006</xref>). Modern spiral computed tomography (CT) scanners allow rapid acquisition of high-quality images that can be viewed in multiple planes and reconstructed to create three-dimensional (3D) images that allow for accurate diagnosis and enhance surgical planning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1460408611418767">Figure 3</xref>). It is also possible to examine other regions, particularly the brain and cervical spine, simultaneously. Rarely angiography may be indicated if there is substantial haemorrhage that fails to arrest with basic manoeuvres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1460408611418767">Chen et al., 2009</xref>). Additional information about the patient’s pre-injury occlusionmay be gained by taking impressions of the teeth, which can then be cast as stone models. In patients where the fractures involve the orbits, a formal ophthalmological opinion should be sought and the visual acuity, colour vision, range of eye movements, pupil responses be recorded and fundoscopy should be performed.
<fig id="fig3-1460408611418767" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>3D CT demonstrating midface fractures. Note artefact from dental amalgam restorations.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1460408611418767-fig3.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>All patients should be initially managed following established ATLS guidelines and the potential for cervical spine injury must be remembered and managed appropriately. In the conscious patient, the airway will often be maintained, but may be threatened if the maxilla is displaced posterio-inferiorly along the skull base or if there is torrential haemorrhage. Placing two fingers inside the mouth, behind the soft palate and gently pulling the maxilla forwards may relieve partial airway obstruction. If this is unsuccessful, then intubation or consideration of formal tracheostomy may be necessary, and patients who have sustained maxillofacial trauma have the highest incidence of initial surgical airway intervention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1460408611418767">Dupanovic et al., 2010</xref>). Oral intubation prevents establishment of the occlusion during surgery and so an alternative strategy when nasal intubation is not possible is to intubate orally and then convert to a submental intubation at the start of the surgery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1460408611418767">Mohan et al., 2009</xref>). It may be necessary to perform nasal packing in the emergency setting to achieve haemorrhage control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1460408611418767">Harris et al., 2010</xref>), but the potential for anterior skull base fractures should be remembered. An alternative strategy for haemorrhage control is to use adental mouth prop between the jaws to compress the maxilla against the skull base, thus tamponading the bleeding vessels.</p>
<p>Timing of surgery may be dictated by the presence of other injuries, particularly head injury as this may preclude safe anaesthesia. Equally important is the local availability of appropriately trained andexperienced personnel. Early surgery (within 24–48 h) has the advantage of less tissue oedema, which once established can make surgical access difficult. The alternative is to wait up to several days to allow the oedema to subside, but surgery may be further complicated by primary callus formation.</p>
<p>Traditionally, these injuries were managed by closed reduction techniques with a variety of external frames (e.g. Levant or Halo) and often required the teeth to be wired together in intermaxillary fixation (IMF) for a period of 6–8 weeks. Along with the obvious inconvenience to the patient, the results were often disappointing because of imprecise fracture reduction and the fact that controlling the position of the teeth dose not achieve control of the bones. The use of these techniques is now largely confined to the developing world where economics may prevent use of the more expensive equipment required for current techniques. Contemporary management now employs open reduction and internal fixation of anatomically reduced fractures wherepossible and the use of early bone grafts if needed to restore bony continuity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1460408611418767">Marciani and Gonty, 2003</xref>) when indicated. Surgical access to achieve this must to be adequate but sympathetic to facial aesthetics. A coronal flap gives excellent access to the upper facial skeleton and zygomatic arch and hides the scar within the hair to minimise impact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1460408611418767">Ellis and Zide, 2006</xref>). This approach also exposes the calvarium, which is a useful potential donor site for split calvarial bone grafts and avoids the need for a separate incision to harvest bone if it is required. The entire midface can be accessed when the coronal flap is combined with well-placed peri-orbital or transconjuctival incisions, and intra-oral mucoperiosteal flaps in the maxillary buccal sulcus. Where neurosurgical intervention is also required, it is the approach of choice.</p>
<p>The maxilla may require disimpaction and repositioning using specially designed (Rowe’s) disimpaction forceps. With regard to fixation, miniplate osteosynthesis was described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1460408611418767">Champy et al. (1976)</xref> for the treatment of mandibular fractures and subsequently applied to midface fractures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1460408611418767">Luhr, 1979</xref>). Here, the load requirements are less and so it is possible to use plates of a lower profile, which are now widely available. Once the fractures are reduced, the plates are applied to the reconstructed facial buttress where bone quality and density is optimum. The low profile nature of the plate makes them virtually undetectable and allows the plates to remain <italic>in situ</italic> after fracture healing, unless infection or soft tissue dehiscence mandates their removal.</p>
<p>The sequence in which the fractures are treated is important, particularly with panfacial fractures with involvement of the NOE complex, frontal sinus and mandible. The difficulty that these extensive fractures create is the destruction of recognisable reference points that are necessary for the accurate reconstruction of facial width and projection. Fracture sequencing aims to restore certain key areas in turn, with the reconstruction of one area facilitating the accurate repositioning of the next. The peripheral structure of the face is managed first with attention to the skull base and position of the mandibular condyles in the glenoid fossa. This establishes facial width. The frontal bone, outer orbital rims, zygoma and mandible are then reduced and fixed. The position of the zygoma and in particular, the zygomatic arch (which is straight) is key, as this will restore facial projection. It is important also to ensure that the zygoma is aligned correctly at the lateral orbital wall and is not rotated. Significant post-traumatic deformity may result if this is not accurately repositioned (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1460408611418767">Figure 4</xref>). It may not be possible to place the patient into IMF if the maxilla is split or comminuted and so this may need to be corrected early to allow the width of the dental arch to be restored. Reconstruction of the outer facial skeleton achieves a base from which the orbital walls and floor can be assessed. The central portion of the face can now be reduced. This involves management of the NOE complex, including the medial canthal apparatus, (see below) and the maxilla. It is rare for all four buttresses of the maxilla to be comminuted, such that at least one can be plated to give some indication of correct facial height. Bone grafting is often required to support one or more of the buttresses.
<fig id="fig4-1460408611418767" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>Stereolithographical model demonstrating post-traumatic deformity due to incorrectly positioned zygomaticomaxillary complex.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1460408611418767-fig4.tif"/></fig></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1460408611418767"><title>NOE complex fractures</title>
<p>NOE complex fractures comprise the medial orbital walls, the ethmoidal sinus complex, the nasal bridge and the frontal bone along with thelacrimal drainage system. Fractures may occur as part of panfacial trauma or in isolation. A force of sufficient magnitude will drive the relatively denser bones of the nasal bridge and anterior wall of the frontal sinus backwards into the fragile vertical septa of the ethmoid complex. These bones comminute and collapse under the force, dissipating energy and protecting the orbital apex and frontal lobes of the brain. Significant deformity is present in the early stages, but is masked by swelling, only to become apparent over the nextweek or so as the oedema resolves. There is a characteristic depression over the nasal bridge with an upturned nasal tip (‘pig nose deformity’) and splaying of the medial canthus (telecanthus). Haemorrhage can be significant and leakage of CSF through the floor of the fractured cribriform plate is not unusual. It may only become evident rather late as swelling resolves and the dural tear above the comminuted ethmoid becomes evident. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1460408611418767">Markowitz et al. (1991)</xref> has classified these injuries depending on the degree of comminution and preservation of the attachment of the medial canthal tendon. Closed reduction and indirect fixation of nasoethmoidal fractures produces unsatisfactory cosmetic results as it is impossible to address the medial canthal displacement. Open reduction and internal fixation are essential foradequate treatment. Although various local incisions have been described, there is little doubt that a coronal flap produces the best exposure. Residual post-traumatic deformity in the form of telecanthus commonly follows if these structures are not correctly reattached, which is technically demanding as the canthus must be reattached behind the posterior lachrymal crest. Various techniques have been described either using transnasal wires or fixing the canthusto a miniplate, which is then rotated into the orbit to the correct position before it is secured(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1460408611418767">Hammer, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1460408611418767">Hammer and Prein, 1998</xref>). Lacrimal duct damage complicating NOE fractures is probably under-recognised and primary exploration is generally not undertaken unless the ductal system has been obviously divided. However, there is some evidence that prophylactic intubation of an intact ductal system as a part of the primary management ofmidfacial trauma enhances its patency post-operatively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1460408611418767">Spinelli et al., 2005</xref>). Delayed dacrocystorhinostomy may be required if the ductal system is damaged.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-1460408611418767"><title>Frontal sinus fractures</title>
<p>The frontal bone is sturdy and its fracture implies a significant impact and the potential for other injuries. Frontal sinus fractures may be isolated or occur in conjunction with pan facial injuries and are reported in up to 12% of craniofacial injuries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1460408611418767">Luce, 1987</xref>). The rationale for treating these injuries is primarily to deal with dural tears and CSF leaks, to prevent long-term sequelae such as meningitis and mucocele formation, butalso to prevent the cosmetic deformity that may follow untreated fractures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1460408611418767">Kalavrezos, 2004</xref>). Classification systems distinguish central injuries involving the cribriform plate and ethmoid sinus regions from lateral injuries involving the orbital roof, although these patterns may occur together. The important feature is to diagnose involvement of the posterior wall or floor and frontonasal duct. Clinical signs of injury are similar to those already described for pan facial fractures. Fracture of the anterior skull base is suggested by the presence of bilateral periorbital ecchymoses and CSF rhinorrhea whilst fracture of the middle cranial fossa is suggested by CSF otorrhea and bruising over the mastoid process (Battle’s sign), although this may take some days to become apparent. There may also be an obvious cosmetic deformity affecting the forehead, although swelling may mask this. A formal ophthalmological assessment is required and assessment of the cranial nerves is also mandatory in the conscious patient. Sensory loss over the forehead in conjunction with papillary abnormalities and limited eye movements raise the possibility of superior orbital fissure syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1460408611418767">Bowerman, 1969</xref>). Fine-cut CT examination is mandatory to assess the extent of the injury and identify intracranial complications such as haematoma formation. Simultaneous imaging of the cervical spine is usually also undertaken.</p>
<p>The key determinant regarding management strategy is the involvement of the posterior wall of the sinus and the inevitable dural tear that accompanies this. Minimally displaced isolated anterior wall fractures may require no treatment. Displaced anterior wall fractures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1460408611418767">Figure 5</xref>) should be reduced and fixed with microplates. This is bestachieved <italic>via</italic> a coronal flap and in severely comminuted cases, or where there has been bone loss, consideration should be given to primary bone grafting. If the frontonasal duct is damaged, then the mucosa lining the sinus should be carefully removed and the sinus obliterated,commonly using bone chips (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1460408611418767">Ronrich andMickel, 1995</xref>). In the majority of cases with involvement of the posterior wall, it is necessary to perform a combined craniofacial–neurosurgical approach, unless the posterior wall is minimally displaced. The aim of treatment in these cases is to create a ‘safe sinus’, and this is best achieved by a low bi-frontal crainiotomy to gain access to the posterior wall of the sinus, which is then removed and any dural tear is repaired. All the mucosa lining the sinus must be stripped off and the frontonasal ducts obliterated, often with bone chips harvested during the removal of the posterior sinus wall. A pericranial flap is laid into the sinus creating a watertight closure, separating the cranial cavity from the nasal cavity and further reducing the incidence of infective sequela. This cranialisation of the frontal sinus allows the frontal lobes ofthe brain to expand into sinus to fill the dead space. Management of the sinus in this way reduces the overall incidence of meningitis from 30% to 4% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1460408611418767">Eljamel and Foy, 1990</xref>). The timing of surgery is in part dictated by the patients’ other injuries and the fitness for anaesthesia and a prolonged operation. The current trend is forearly combined craniofacial–neurosurgical repair (within 3 days). Raised intercranial pressure (ICP) is perhaps the most important factor in determining the timing of surgery. However, provided the ICP not greater than 15 mmHg at the time of surgery, then there is no significant difference in survival if treatment is early (within 3 days) or late (more than 7 days) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1460408611418767">Derdyn et al., 1990</xref>). The management of frontal sinus fractures has been, and will remain a controversial topic and future directions are likely to see an emerging role for endoscopy as an aid to management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1460408611418767">Strong, 2009</xref>).

</sec>
<sec id="sec7-1460408611418767"><title>Summary</title>
<p>Midface and craniofacial fractures represent a significant challenge for the maxillofacial surgeonand successful outcome requires careful planning and execution of surgery at the appropriate time, often in conjunction with neurosurgical colleagues. Whilst the results of treatment are good, it must be recognised that potential for late complications, such as post-traumatic deformity and infections and the need for revision surgery can be minimised but never be fully eliminated.</p>
