<p>The number of falls in the elderly is becoming a major public health problem in our society. In the past decade, life expectancy has increased from 75 years in 1990 to 79 years in 2009 in the US. It has been estimated that the number of persons aged 65 years and older in the US will double by 2050. In 2000, falls accounted for 45% of all injury-related inpatient stays with almost 750,000 hospitalizations. Fractures were the most common primary injury diagnosis, including 314,006 hip fractures. Injury following a fall is associated with a decreased quality of life and poor functional outcome, in severe injuries these effects continue for a prolonged period of time. In 2006, fall-related medical costs in the population aged ≥65 in the US amounted to US$19 billion for non-fatal and US$0.2 billion for fatal injuries. In this article, we provide a literature overview on the impact of falls in the elderly, the demands on healthcare, and the costs for our society.</p>

<p>The number of falls in the elderly is becoming a major public health problem in our society. In recent decades, life expectancy has risen from 77 years in 1990 to 81 years in 2009 in the Netherlands. Similar trends have been noted in other countries; from 75 to 79 years in the US, and from 76 to 80 years in the UK. This allows an estimate of the increasing life expectancy in western countries worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1460408612463145">WHO, 2011</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1460408612463145">Vincent and Velkoff (2010</xref>) estimated that the number of persons aged 65 years and older in the US will double by 2050. In 2010, 14% of the population in the US was 85 years old or older, by 2050 that proportion is expected to increase to more than 21%. Currently, 15.6% of the population in the Netherlands is aged 65 years or older; this is estimated to increase to 25% by 2050 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1460408612463145">CBS, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>How should we prepare our society for the growing number of elderly and the array of health problems associated with increased age? Approximately, one out of three persons aged ≥65 years experiences a fall every year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1460408612463145">Tinetti et al., 1994</xref>). The most important risk factors for falls are old age (&gt;80 years), a history of falls, gait deficit, balance deficit, use of an assistive device, visual deficit, arthritis, impaired activities of daily living, depression, and cognitive impairment. Other risk factors include the environment (e.g. insufficient lighting, rugs, and loose wiring), and comorbidities such as orthostatic hypotension, vertigo, and Parkinson’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1460408612463145">AGS/BGS, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1460408612463145">AGS/BGS/AAOS, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1460408612463145">Nevitt et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1460408612463145">Tinetti et al., 1988</xref>). Approximately, 33% of persons over 65 years use so-called fall-risk-increasing drugs (FRIDs) such as cardiovascular and psychotropic drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1460408612463145">Leipzig et al., 1999a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1460408612463145">1999b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1460408612463145">Woolcott et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Low-level falls are deemed to be fairly innocent in the young, yet falls in the older population are associated with substantially higher morbidity and mortality rates. This will put a substantial burden on healthcare workers and institutions, and will result in rising healthcare costs as long as the population of elderly continues to grow. In order to solve this public health problem, we need insight into the outcome of falls in the older population, such as the type of injury, mortality, disability, fear of falling, and social isolation. Also, the burden of falls on healthcare systems including emergency departments (EDs), hospitals, long-term care and rehabilitation facilities, and the costs of falls for our society and economy need to be investigated. Falls-prevention programs provided by healthcare givers are now being developed and implemented worldwide, assessing and managing risk factors for falls. In this article, we provide a literature overview of the impact of falls in the elderly, including the predominant injuries following a fall, the quality of life after a fall, the costs of treatment, and the effectiveness of fall prevention.</p>

<sec id="sec2-1460408612463145"><title>Burden on healthcare</title>
<p>In 2009, the number of persons aged 65 and older treated at an ED for a non-fatal fall in the US was 1,594,335 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1460408612463145">CDC, 2004</xref>). Greenspan et al. showed that of all injury-related hospitalizations in 2000, discharge rates from hospitals were highest for those aged 65 years and older; adults 85 years and older had the highest hospitalization rates of any age group (5499 per 100,000). Falls were the leading cause of hospitalization. With almost 750,000 hospitalizations, falls accounted for 45% of all inpatient stays. Fractures were the most common primary injury diagnosis, including 314,006 hip fractures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1460408612463145">Greenspan et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Falls are also the leading cause of traumatic brain injury, between 2002 and 2006, an average of 144,338 persons aged ≥65 sustained traumatic brain injury in the US annually, of which 107,221 visited the ED, 29,860 were hospitalized, and 7257 died (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1460408612463145">Faul et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>In 2008, there were 34,091 fall-related hospitalizations including 14,258 with hip fractures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1460408612463145">Hartholt et al., 2010</xref>) and 3010 with significant traumatic head injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1460408612463145">Hartholt et al., 2011c</xref>) in persons aged 65 years and older in the Netherlands. In 1999, there were over 647,721 fall-related ED visits in the UK for persons aged 60 or older, leading to 204,424 hospital admissions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1460408612463145">Scuffham et al., 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Close et al. documented the healthcare use of older fallers (≥70 years old) in Australia. From 2008 to 2010, older fallers constituted 17% of all ED visits, which led to hospital admission in 42.7% of the cases, after hospitalization 9.5% became first-time resident in long-term care facilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1460408612463145">Close et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-1460408612463145"><title>Predominant injuries</title>
<p>In 2006, there were 10,300 fatal and 2.6 million non-fatal fall-related injuries in the population aged ≥65 in the US (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1460408612463145">Stevens et al., 2006</xref>). Accidental injury, often resulting from a fall, ranks as the ninth leading cause of death among people over 65 years of age in the US (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1460408612463145">Kochanek et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Older adults are more prone to injury than younger persons, and similar injury mechanisms will result in more severe consequences for the elderly. For instance, the increased fracture incidence in older age is partly attributable to osteoporosis. The most common injuries due to falls in persons aged 65 years or older in the Netherlands are superficial injuries, hip fractures, upper extremity fractures, and traumatic brain injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1460408612463145">Hartholt et al., 2010</xref>). About 30% of people with a hip fracture will die in the following year, and many more will experience significant functional loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1460408612463145">Brauer et al., 2009</xref>). Data from recent studies in Europe and North America indicate that the incidence of hip fractures is declining (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1460408612463145">Brauer et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1460408612463145">Chevalley et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1460408612463145">Kannus et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1460408612463145">Leslie et al., 2009</xref>). This decline has been observed since 1985 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1460408612463145">Leslie et al., 2009</xref>) and by some as early as 1950 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1460408612463145">Melton et al., 1996</xref>). Having an explanation for this trend could be helpful in developing programs for further reduction of the hip fracture incidence rate. However, there seems as yet to be no clear answer to this decline. One of the most striking observations is the disparity in rates of decline of the male and female incidence rates, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1460408612463145">Chevalley et al. (2007)</xref> reported no decrease in hip fracture rates between 1991 and 2000 in males in Switzerland and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1460408612463145">Hartholt et al. (2011a)</xref> reported a continuing increase in hip fracture rates in the oldest men aged 80 years and older in the Netherlands between 1980 and 2008. One explanation for this observation could be the lack of awareness and preventive measures against osteoporosis in men. However, the overall decline in hip fracture incidence rates observed in both males and females in the US and Canada cannot be explained by this (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1460408612463145">Brauer et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1460408612463145">Leslie et al., 2009</xref>). Several other explanations have been suggested such as improved nutrition status, increasing body weight, declining smoking rates, and hormone replacement therapy, yet there is no definitive answer. A combination of all these factors is probably the reason for the lower incidence of hip fractures in western countries.</p>
<p>Traumatic brain injury is associated with serious consequences. Recent studies in the US (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1460408612463145">Faul et al., 2010</xref>), the Netherlands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1460408612463145">Hartholt et al., 2011c</xref>), and Finland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1460408612463145">Kannus et al., 2007</xref>) showed an increase in fall-related traumatic brain injury. Falls cause 60.7% of traumatic brain injuries among persons aged 65 years and older in the US (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1460408612463145">Faul et al., 2010</xref>). Rates for ED visits, hospitalization, and death due to traumatic brain injury in the US all increased from 2002 to 2006, with hospitalization rates increasing from 67.6 to 90.7 per 100,000 in persons aged 65 or older (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1460408612463145">Faul et al., 2010</xref>). A similar increase in hospitalization rates after traumatic brain injury was also seen in the Netherlands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1460408612463145">Hartholt et al., 2011c</xref>). A definite cause is yet unknown, the observed increase could in part be due to the increased mobility of the elderly, the implementation of new treatment guidelines, the increased use of radiographic imaging, or the rising life expectancy in western countries.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1460408612463145"><title>Health-related quality of life</title>
<p>In addition to the effects on morbidity and mortality as described above, falls result in a significant reduction in health-related quality of life and substantial functional impairment 1 year after sustaining a hip fracture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1460408612463145">Boonen et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1460408612463145">Randell et al., 2000</xref>). Compared with the general older population, fallers with hip factures, upper extremity fractures, or skull/brain injury all displayed a higher prevalence of functional problems. In a Dutch population-based study, patients aged 65 years or older who had sustained a hip fracture reported problems in all domains of the EuroQol-5D (EQ-5D), including mobility (90% of patients), self-care (54%), usual activities (73%), pain/discomfort (69%), anxiety/depression (28%), and cognition (38%) up to 9 months after the fall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1460408612463145">Hartholt et al., 2011b</xref>). Marottoli et al. studied physical function following a hip fracture in persons aged 65 and older; at baseline, 86% of patients could dress independently versus 49% at 6 months. Similarly, 90% could transfer independently versus 32% at 6 months; 75% could walk across a room independently versus 15% at 6 months; 63% could climb a flight of stairs versus 8% at 6 months; and 41% could walk one-half mile versus 6% at 6 months (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1460408612463145">Marottoli et al., 1992</xref>). Injury following a fall is associated with a decreased quality of life and poor functional outcome, in severe injuries these effects continue for a prolonged period of time.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1460408612463145"><title>Healthcare costs</title>
<p>In 2006, fall-related medical costs in the population aged ≥65 years in the US amounted to US$19 billion (equivalent to €13.8 billion) for non-fatal and US$0.2 billion (€0.15 billion) for fatal injuries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1460408612463145">Stevens et al., 2006</xref>). The estimated population aged ≥65 in 2006 in the US was 37 million (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1460408612463145">Census-Bureau, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1460408612463145">ONS, 1999</xref>), which amounts to a per capita cost of US$517 (€382). Between 2003 and 2007, the average annual cost for fall-related injuries in the Netherlands was US$ 0.64 billion (€0.47 billion), in 2005 the population aged ≥65 in the Netherlands was 2.3 million (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1460408612463145">CBS, 2011</xref>), which amounts to a per capita cost of US$280 (€207). In 1999, the total cost to the UK Government from unintentional falls in persons aged 60 or older was US$1.6 billion (€1.15 billion; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1460408612463145">Scuffham et al., 2003</xref>), the UK population aged ≥60 in 1999 was 12.2 million (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1460408612463145">ONS, 1999</xref>) thus the per capita cost was approximately US$130 (€96). In 2005, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1460408612463145">Roudsari et al.</xref> estimated the mean cost per fall-related hospitalization in the US to be US$17,483 (€12,674), the mean cost per ED visit US$236 (€171), and the mean cost per outpatient visit US$412 (€299; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1460408612463145">Roudsari et al., 2005</xref>). Between 2003 and 2007, the average cost per hip fracture in the Netherlands was US$24,639 (€18,223), the cost per patient admitted to a hospital with traumatic brain injury after a fall was US$19,309 (€14,281), and overall cost per fall US$9530 (€7048; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1460408612463145">Hartholt et al., 2011b</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-1460408612463145"><title>Falls-prevention initiatives</title>
<p>Much effort has been put into prevention programs, assessing risk factors, such as previous falls, impaired balance and gait, and FRIDs. There have been successful single intervention studies, implementing exercise programs which mainly consisted of muscle strengthening and balance exercises (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1460408612463145">Campbell et al., 1999a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1460408612463145">Province et al., 1995</xref>), and a study featuring withdrawal of FRIDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1460408612463145">Campbell et al., 1999b</xref>). The withdrawal of FRIDs should place minimal burden on the healthcare system, fallers taking FRIDs are easily identified, and withdrawal is shown to be safely possible and effective for both cardiovascular and psychotropic drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1460408612463145">Van Der Velde et al., 2007</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1460408612463145">Campbell et al. (1999b)</xref> demonstrated how withdrawal of psychotropic medication significantly reduced falls; however, permanent withdrawal was difficult to achieve. There are also falls-prevention programs with multiple interventions; so-called multifactorial intervention programs. The most common interventions featured in successful multifactorial intervention studies are exercise, medication review, an assessment of vision, hearing, cardiovascular function and psychological state with proper referrals, and an assessment of the home environment and assistive devices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1460408612463145">AGS/BGS, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1460408612463145">AGS/BGS/AAOS, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1460408612463145">Close et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1460408612463145">Davison et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1460408612463145">Jensen et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1460408612463145">Spice et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1460408612463145">Tinetti et al., 1994</xref>). The efficacy of such interventions varies, and in some multifactorial intervention studies no reduction in falls could be shown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1460408612463145">De Vries et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1460408612463145">Mahoney et al., 2007</xref>). Thus, there is room for improvement and further research concerning this complex problem. Identifying the population that will benefit most from falls-prevention programs and determining which components of multifactorial interventions are most effective could improve current results. With such a broad range of risk factors, falls-prevention is not a simple task.</p>

<sec id="sec7-1460408612463145" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this article, different aspects of falls and the impact of falls on the elderly, healthcare systems, and society have been reviewed based on current literature. In the past decades, there has been a growing awareness in western societies of the increasing burden of falls. Although the mortality rate following a fall and the incidence rates of hip fractures have decreased, hospitalization rates for traumatic brain injury are increasing. The absolute number of falls and injuries following a fall continues to rise, as do the costs. Factors which have reduced injury severity following a fall are preventative measures including treatment for osteoporosis, improved nutrition status, increasing body weight, declining smoking rates, hormone replacement therapy, and more recently falls-prevention programs. Yet the decline in hip fracture rates is not explained by these factors alone. A definitive answer concerning the reduction in hip fracture rates could help us further in preventing fractures following falls. Falls affect a large proportion of the elderly population and have a substantial impact, with consequences such as higher morbidity and mortality rates, disability, fear of falling, social isolation, loss of independence, and institutionalization. Fall-related injuries and loss of function, poorer quality of life, and reduced independence place a substantial burden on healthcare systems due to the large numbers of visits to EDs, hospital admissions, admissions to long-term care and rehabilitation facilities, and other healthcare services needed. The elderly population in our society will continue to increase during the coming decades. This may be a reflection of the change in life style and advances in public health and medical care, but this will challenge us with rising healthcare budgets worldwide.</p>
