<body>
<p>In Australia, about 250 000 infants are born each year.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0890334413480561">1</xref></sup> Infants are reliant on breast milk or infant formula as a sole source of nutrition and hydration, for at least their first 6 months of life. Published literature consistently reports the broad figure of 25% of infants who experience feeding difficulties at some stage of development.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0890334413480561">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0890334413480561"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0890334413480561">4</xref></sup> Prevalence and severity of feeding and swallowing difficulties increase with premature birth (25%-55%) and diagnosis of developmental disorders (80%). Exact epidemiologic data are difficult to find due to a lack of standard diagnostic protocols and terminology for coding feeding-related behaviors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0890334413480561">2</xref></sup> The term <italic>feeding</italic> includes, but is not limited to, mother or infant factors associated with successful ingestion of human milk or formula (eg, attachment, refusal, infant endurance). <italic>Swallowing</italic> refers to the oral, pharyngeal, and esophageal phases of swallowing. Feeding and swallowing are tightly interwoven during infancy and early childhood.</p>
<p>Some infants have trouble coordinating sucking, swallowing, and breathing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0890334413480561">5</xref></sup> Infants with swallowing issues are at risk of dehydration, failure to thrive, and breathing complications, such as pneumonia. Some of the methods of managing feeding and swallowing issues in infancy include alterations to positioning, swaddling, jaw or cheek support, tongue resistance exercises, external pacing to promote feeding rhythm, tactile stimulation, use of nipple shields, changes to teat type or flow, and thickening of human milk or formula. This discussion will focus on issues surrounding thickening human milk and infant formula.</p>
<p>To provide some background, thickening of human milk or formula is most commonly used for infants who are at risk of aspiration, and infants with reflux. General guidelines for the use of thickeners with human milk and formula can be found in government health documentation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0890334413480561">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0890334413480561">7</xref></sup> Speech pathologists tend to be the health professionals who prescribe thickened liquids where aspiration and/or incoordination with breathing and swallowing are noted. For reflux, doctors and other health professionals tend to prescribe thickened liquids. For swallowing difficulties, human milk or formula is thickened to slow flow, allowing time for better coordination of sucking, swallowing, and breathing. For reflux, the density of the thickened feed is thought to help it stay in the stomach.</p>
<p>Although thickening human milk or formula may sound like a straightforward solution, it is not without issues. For example, infant teats are designed for unthickened liquids; thickening agents behave differently with human milk and with infant formula, and for both liquids there is scant information about the effect of thickening agents on nutrient bioavailability. In fact, further information is urgently needed to develop interprofessional guidelines for the use of thickening agents with human milk and infant formula to inform coordinated best practice and management.</p>
<sec id="section1-0890334413480561">
<title>Thickening to Assess Infant Swallowing Issues</title>
<p>Clinical and instrumental assessments are used by speech pathologists to investigate swallowing issues. Videofluoroscopy is a radiological technique used to determine risks for aspiration and provide dynamic assessment for all stages of swallowing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0890334413480561">8</xref></sup> In order for the bolus to be viewable on x-ray, barium is added to liquids, or liquid barium is used. It is not possible to perform a videofluoroscopy during breastfeeding, as the milk cannot be mixed with barium. As a consequence, mothers may express milk and add thickener and give thickened milk from a bottle. It is acknowledged that this does not give a true representation of the feeding situation for a breastfed infant. For example, sucking physiology is different between breastfeeding and bottle-feeding, placing the breastfeeding infant at an immediate disadvantage during testing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0890334413480561">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rheological studies have shown that although liquid barium is similar in thickness to thickened infant formula, it is 1.6 times more dense and has a yield stress 28 times that of thickened infant formula.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0890334413480561">10</xref></sup> Yield stress is the degree of force required to initiate flow. Density and yield stress of thickened human milk have, to the best of our knowledge, not yet been reported. The results available for thickened formula demonstrate one level of difficulty. That is, the test liquid (infant formula enriched with barium) and the treatment liquid (infant formula) have very different flow characteristics. With this, the ability to predict feeding performance based on the radiological examination is undoubtedly questionable. Advances that would allow the examination to more accurately predict typical feeding performance should be pursued and incorporated in interprofessional guidelines.</p>
<p>Geddes et al demonstrated that ultrasound can be used to view the oral stage of swallowing and nasopharyngeal function during breastfeeding.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0890334413480561">11</xref></sup> Ultrasound represents an ability to more accurately investigate the oral feeding skills of a breastfeeding infant. The cream or fat in human milk produces a characteristic echogenic display that can be reliably identified on ultrasound. Due to these unique characteristics, the test liquid (human milk) and the treatment liquid (human milk) are the same. Watson Genna’s<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0890334413480561">12</xref></sup> text elegantly explains and elaborates on feeding and swallowing issues experienced by breastfeeding infants. Given the benefits of using ultrasound particularly for evaluating the feeding skills of breastfeeding infants, further studies are required to evaluate if <italic>thickened</italic> human milk shows a characteristic echogenic display similar to unthickened human milk. Ultrasound is very useful for assessment of the oral stage and nasopharyngeal function. It is not used to diagnose aspiration, however, due to difficulties discriminating the air-filled trachea from the esophagus that lies behind it. For evaluation of aspiration, despite its disadvantages, videofluoroscopy is the method of choice.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0890334413480561">
<title>Levels of Thickness for Liquids Used in Therapy</title>
<p>Thickened human milk and formula flow more slowly than unthickened human milk and formula. Human milk or formula is most often thickened with powdered thickening agents (eg, gum-based thickeners, starch, rice cereal).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0890334413480561">13</xref></sup> Viscosity or what we call <italic>thickness</italic> is a fluid’s resistance to flow. Viscosity can be measured using a range of devices (rheometers, viscometers). The addition of a thickener changes the material property characteristics of the liquid. Choosing the correct measuring device, as recommended by a chemical engineer who understands the flow characteristics of the liquid and the capabilities of the measuring device, is critical for accurate results. Studies that use rheometers provide more accurate information than those provided by viscometers and other devices. Look for studies that include information on temperature of the test liquid and shear rate.</p>
<p>The viscosity of unthickened human milk is reported to be in the range of 1.31 to 1.63 mPas (shear rate of 30 seconds<sup>–1</sup>; 37<sup>o</sup>C).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0890334413480561">14</xref></sup> Thickened human milk has variously been reported in the range of 4.5 to 26 mPas, using a rudimentary measuring device.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0890334413480561">15</xref></sup> In contrast, unthickened powdered infant formula has an average viscosity of 2 mPas, increasing to 320 mPas with a powdered thickener (maltodextrin, starch, and carob bean gum; shear rate of 50 seconds<sup>–1</sup>; 37<sup>o</sup>C).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0890334413480561">10</xref></sup> Further studies using the more accurate rheometer to measure thickened human milk would be advantageous. As it stands, thickened human milk becomes 26 times as thick as human milk when a thickener is added. Of more concern is that thickened formula is 12 to 70 times thicker than thickened human milk. For infants who receive complementary feeds, this difference is of considerable concern. Sucking physiology differences between breastfeeding and bottle-feeding will become amplified with such big differences between the thickened liquids. In spite of the apparent wide variation between thickened human milk and thickened infant formula, to date there is no research to determine the exact level of thickness that produces the most beneficial therapeutic effect. We first need to determine what level of thickness is most beneficial to infants with feeding and swallowing issues and then ensure that thickened milk and thickened formula meet this thickness level. The thickness level that is most beneficial should then be included in interprofessional guidelines, along with ways of accurately measuring the thickness.</p>

<title>Thickening Agents for Human Milk and Infant Formula</title>
<p>A powdered thickener is most commonly used to thicken expressed breast milk (EBM) or infant formula. Although thickening infant formula is relatively straightforward, there is much empirical and anecdotal evidence of issues associated with thickening EBM. Clinicians and parents need to be aware of the types of thickening agents that are safe for infant use. In addition, there are reports that EBM does not thicken well or loses its thickness over time. de Almeida et al demonstrated that the viscosity of thickened infant formula remained steady after reaching stability, however, thickened EBM became <italic>thinner</italic> over the 20 minutes post mixing, regardless of pasteurization.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0890334413480561">15</xref></sup> These differences are important clinically for the timing of infant feeds.</p>
<p>Dewit et al identified amylase in human milk as a potentially important digestive enzyme for infants.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0890334413480561">16</xref></sup> For the first 3 months post birth, salivary amylase is negligible in infants, and adult levels of pancreatic amylase are not reached until 1 to 2 years of age. The concentration of human milk amylase is dependent on maternal factors such as amylase activity and parity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0890334413480561">16</xref></sup> de Almeida et al concluded that the presence of amylase in human milk was responsible for partial hydrolysis of the starch in the thickener, resulting in a less viscous liquid.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0890334413480561">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>Due to the effect of amylase, the type of thickening agent used for human milk is important. Gums do not respond to amylase and can be used as a thickening agent. Food Standards Australia and New Zealand approves only carob bean gum and guar gum as thickening additives to infant formula products. In the US, rice-based or oat-based cereals, or gum-based thickeners including xanthan gum, have been used to thicken human milk and infant formula.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0890334413480561">13</xref></sup> In 2011, however, warnings were issued to cease the use of xanthan gum for use with premature and term infants. The warning came as a result of 15 infants who were reported to have developed necrotizing enterocolitis, with the condition proving fatal for 2 infants.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0890334413480561">17</xref></sup> Clinical guidelines should include evidence-based material that specifically addresses thickening agents and their use with human milk and infant formula.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0890334413480561">
<title>Flow of Thickened Human Milk and Formula through Teats</title>
<p>Geddes et al have reported vacuum pressures ranging from −64 to −144 mmHg (8.5-19 kPa) during infant breastfeeding where, as reported above, the viscosity of human milk is in the range of 1.3 to 1.6 mPas.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0890334413480561">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0890334413480561">18</xref></sup> Thickened expressed breast milk or infant formula is dispensed to the infant through a bottle and teat system. However, teats have been designed for use with unthickened EBM and formula. Not unlike attempting to suck pudding through a straw, the infant must use increased suction to obtain the feed. Although there are anecdotal reports of manual manipulation of the teat hole to increase the diameter, this practice is not recommended. There is little known about the effect of this manipulation on flow rate, disintegration of the teat, and potential for choking. There are no studies that have verified the suction pressures required to draw thickened human milk or formula through a teat system. It is likely that the effort that infants put into acquiring their feed somewhat negates the energy they derive from it. Studies to determine suction pressures of infants with poor cardiovascular or respiratory function are important. These will facilitate optimal teat design to encourage the development of oral feeding skills. Furthermore, treatment to improve suction pressure may facilitate the establishment of breastfeeding. Clinical guidelines would benefit from notation of the characteristics of teats that are suitable for use with thickened fluids (eg, flow rate, material, shape). There may also be benefit to the design of custom teats specifically for thickened fluids.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0890334413480561">
<title>Effects of Time and Temperature on Thickened Liquids</title>
<p>Human milk is provided at body temperature. However, when milk is expressed, or if infant formula is used, the liquid will cool in the bottle over the course of a feeding session. Measures of thickened infant formula have been reported above as 320 mPas.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0890334413480561">10</xref></sup> However, when thickened infant formula is left to cool over the duration of a feed (~30 minutes), the viscosity increases a further 1.3 times to 430 mPas.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0890334413480561">10</xref></sup> To date, there are no data to demonstrate whether this difference has a physiological effect on the infant. There are no data to date on the effect of cooling on thickened human milk.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0890334413480561">
<title>Bioavailability of Nutrients of Thickened Human Milk or Formula</title>
<p>To the best of our knowledge, there are no studies that have investigated the bioavailability of iron, calcium, or zinc with thickened EBM. Results of the 2 known studies that have evaluated bioavailability of mineral nutrients with thickened infant formula have been conflicting.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0890334413480561">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0890334413480561">20</xref></sup> An in vitro study found that thickening with pregelatinized waxy maize starch (digestible carbohydrate) did not influence the availability of calcium, iron, and zinc, however, a reduction in availability of these minerals was noted for formula thickened with locust bean gum (indigestible carbohydrate).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0890334413480561">19</xref></sup> However, Levtchenko et al, using an in vivo design, were unable to demonstrate changes to intestinal absorption when comparing thickened (bean gum thickener) versus nonthickened infant formula.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0890334413480561">18</xref></sup> Given the importance of infant physical and cognitive growth, especially in the first 12 months of life, the effect of thickening agents on the bioavailability of essential nutrients warrants further investigation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0890334413480561">
<title>Summary and Future Directions</title>
<p>Thickened human milk and formula are used as a treatment for infants with swallowing difficulties. It is used under the premise that slower flow will enable better coordination and safer, more efficient feeding. It is unfortunate that there are a number of areas that need research. We need to know what level of thickness helps infants and what level could make feeding more difficult due to effort required to suck thickened liquids through a teat. For breastfeeding infants with swallowing issues, there is also the complication of moving between the breast and a bottle so that a thickener can be added to the EBM. Choosing the correct thickening agent is important. Thickeners behave differently in EBM as opposed to infant formula, and this may be due to the amylase in breast milk. There are currently no data on the cardiorespiratory effort of infant extraction of thickened formula through teats designed for use with unthickened milk. Cooling of thickened formula increases the thickness, although there are no studies showing the effect of cooling on the thickness of thickened human milk.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0890334413480561">9</xref></sup> A further complication is that we also need to determine which thickeners provide optimal nutrient bioavailability. Ultrasound studies require further investigation to determine their ability to be used for thickened human milk, given their successful use with unthickened EBM for characterizing the oral stage and nasopharyngeal function. Ultrasound provides the most “natural” feeding assessment condition for a breastfeeding baby. It is unfortunate that videofluoroscopy, necessitating bottle-feeding, is required to assess for aspiration, however. Caution is needed in the use of thickeners given a paucity of evidence about them and their use. Interdisciplinary professional guidelines for the use of thickeners with human milk and infant formula that address the issues raised are required.</p>
