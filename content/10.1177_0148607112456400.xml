<title>Clinical Relevancy Statement</title>
<p>Parenteral amino acid (AA) supplementation is an integral part of early nutrition in preterm infants. Although the safety and the metabolic benefit of early supplementation of AA have been demonstrated, studies regarding the effect of higher doses of AA on growth outcomes in very low birth weight (VLBW) infants have been scarce. In the present study, the higher starting doses of parenteral AA (3.0 g/kg/d) are well tolerated during the early neonatal period, but compared with the standard doses (1.5 g/kg/d), no benefit was demonstrated in short- and long-term growth parameters in VLBW infants. Further well-controlled trails are required to determine the dose-response relationship between early parenteral AA doses and growth outcomes of premature infants.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0148607112456400" sec-type="intro">
<title>Introduction</title>
<p>During the early days following the birth of preterm infants, parenteral nutrition (PN) must replace the role of the placenta by providing a continuous supply of nutrients and minerals to fulfill the nutrition needs of growing fetuses. Although providing doses of macronutrients similar to those of placental transfer can be achieved with the currently used method of neonatal PN, the optimal dose of amino acids (AAs), which are the major building blocks for the growth of preterm infants, has been the topic of studies regarding the nutrition management of very low birth weight (VLBW) infants. A linear relationship between AA intake and nitrogen retention in both fetuses and neonates was revealed, and a minimum intake of 1.0–1.5 g/kg/d of AAs has been recommended as the “standard dose” of early AAs in PN to prevent a negative nitrogen balance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0148607112456400">1</xref></sup> However, this level is far from the AA dose of fetal transfer that can approximate ideal protein accretion and fetal growth. At least in part, extrauterine growth retardation experienced by most VLBW infants may be attributable to the gap between the “standard dose” of AAs in PN and those of the “fetal dose” (3.5–4.0 g/kg/d) during the early days after birth.</p>
<p>Despite concerns regarding the negative influence of an excess level of some AAs and/or their metabolites on premature infants, the metabolic safety of the administration of the fetal dose of AAs during the early neonatal period has been studied even in extremely low birth weight infants with limited metabolic and excretory capacity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0148607112456400">2</xref></sup> However, there are still conflicts regarding whether early and higher doses of AA administration in VLBW infants can translate into better outcomes in terms of their growth.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0148607112456400">3</xref></sup> A few studies have demonstrated the benefit of a higher AA supplement on neonatal growth,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0148607112456400">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0148607112456400"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0148607112456400"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0148607112456400">6</xref></sup> but little is known regarding the effect of the fetal dose of AA administration in premature infants on their long-term growth outcome.</p>
<p>The purpose of the present study is to compare the effect of 2 different strategies for early parenteral AA supplementation in the range of the standard dose of AAs (&gt;1.5 g/kg/d) on the short- and long-term growth parameters in VLBW infants.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section4-0148607112456400">
<title>Study Participants</title>
<p>All newborn infants who were born at Asan Medical Center between January 2008 and December 2009, with birth weights &lt;1500 g and gestational ages between 24 ± 0 weeks and 33 ± 6 weeks, and who survived and were discharged after 36 weeks of corrected age were enrolled. Exclusion criteria included infants with major congenital anomalies or acute renal failure (serum creatinine ≥1.6 mg/dL) and in whom the AA supply was restricted during the early neonatal period so as to avoid a higher urea nitrogen level.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0148607112456400">
<title>Nutrition Management</title>
<p>From January to December 2008, parenteral AAs were started at a rate of 1.5 g/kg/d for all VLBW infants from the first day of life (mostly within the first hour of life) (standard protein group [SP]). Beginning in January 2009, the unit policy regarding the AA dose on the first day of life was changed to 3.0 g/kg/d (high protein group [HP]). AAs were administered as a standardized preparation in a premixed bag containing 10% dextrose with 2.2% and 4.4% AA concentration for the SP and HP groups, respectively. From the second day of life, the AA dose was increased in the form of an individualized PN solution. The unit policy regarding the increasing rate (by 0.5–1.0 g/kg/d) and the target amount (3.5–4.0 g/kg/d) of AAs in VLBW infants did not differ between the 2 groups. Fluid intake was restricted to 70–80 mL/kg/d on the first day of life, and thereafter it was generally increased by 10–20 mL/kg/d, reaching 130–140 mL/kg/d at 10–14 postnatal days by monitoring the body weight, serum sodium, and urine volume. Except for the AA doses, there were no differences in the other nutrition strategies for PN (dextrose, lipid, and minerals) and enteral nutrition (EN) between the 2 periods, and dextrose was administered to maintain the serum blood glucose between 80 and 180 mg/dL in an effort to avoid hyperglycemia (serum glucose concentration &gt;200 mg/dL) when hyperglycemia was managed with a decreasing glucose infusion rate and/or intravenous (IV) insulin. IV lipid emulsion (20% lipoMCT; Hanmi, Seoul, Korea) was initiated on the second day of life at a rate of 0.5 g/kg/d and was increased by 0.5–1.0 g/kg/d to maintain a target of 3.0 g/kg/d. Enteral feeding was initiated as trophic feeding with breast milk (BW) or, if not available, with the same preterm formula (Maeil Premie; Maeil, Seoul, Korea) once the infant was considered able to tolerate enteral feeding. As enteral feeding was advanced, the amount of IV fluid and, accordingly, the dose of AA decreased. When the infants fed with BM could tolerate 100 mL/kg/d of enteral feeding volume and were at least after 2 weeks old, human milk fortifier (HMF; Maeil) was mixed with the mother’s milk in the patients fed with BM. PN supplementation was stopped when feedings reached 130–140 mL/kg/d. All patients were discharged fed with premature milk (PM), fortified BM, or both, but the detailed data regarding the postdischarge formula could not be investigated.</p>

<title>Data Collection and Monitoring</title>
<p>Data were collected using an electronic medical records system. Demographic parameters and perinatal data, including the use of antenatal steroids, Apgar scores, and Clinical Risk Index for Babies II (CRIB II) scores, were obtained. Other outcomes of neonatal mortality and morbidities that could affect their growth were also obtained and included respiratory distress syndrome, bronchopulmonary dysplasia (defined as oxygen requirement at the corrected age of 36 weeks), indomethacin treatment of patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), PDA ligation, early- or late-onset sepsis (defined as identification of bacteria or fungus cultured in the blood or cerebrospinal fluid within or after 7 days of life, respectively), severe-grade (grade 3 or 4 by Papille classification) intraventricular hemorrhage, retinopathy of prematurity requiring laser therapy, necrotizing enterocolitis or intestinal perforation that required surgery and PN-associated cholestasis (direct bilirubin &gt;2.0 mg/dL) and the days of oxygen supplement, mechanical ventilator therapy, and hospitalization. Detailed data regarding nutrition management were collected from an electronic nutrition chart program developed by our unit. In this program, the daily amount and calories provided by each major nutrient were automatically calculated from the individualized PN and enteral feeding orders, which were confirmed or modified by a neonatal pharmacist. Actually administered doses (g/kg/d) of AAs and the total and nonprotein calories (kcal) administered both parenterally and enterally were calculated during the first 14 days of life. Since the AA amounts and the degree of maturation of BM vary from person to person, accurate calculation of AAs in BM was not feasible in this study. Hence, we calculated the dose of AAs and calories using the average amount of AAs and total calories of Korean mothers’ BM (1.4 g AA, 67 kcal/100 mL). To evaluate the tolerability and adverse effects of AA intake, serum urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, bicarbonate, base deficit, blood sugar level, and potassium level were also obtained.</p>
<p>During hospitalization, body weight was measured daily using digital scales accurate to 10 g. Height and head circumference were measured weekly and at 36 weeks of corrected age (CA) using a fixed head board and movable foot board and with nonstretchable tape at the maximal occipitofrontal circumference. Weight, height, and head circumferences were compared with the latest intrauterine reference values<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0148607112456400">7</xref></sup> using <italic>z</italic> scores. As our unit has a routine clinic visit program for all VLBW infant survivors, the infants were followed at least every month until 6 months CA and thereafter at least every 2 months until 12 months CA. The growth profile was measured by calculating the <italic>z</italic> score change from birth to 36 weeks, 6 months, and 12 months CA.</p>

<sec id="section7-0148607112456400">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>All analyses were performed using SPSS version 12 (SPSS, Inc, an IBM Company, Chicago, IL). Normally distributed data are presented as mean values with SD, with the patient groups compared using a <italic>t</italic> test. Nonnormally distributed data are presented as the median value with a range, with the groups compared using the Mann-Whitney test. Categorical data are presented as actual numbers or percentages, with the groups compared by the χ<sup>2</sup> test.</p>
<p>Univariate and stepwise multivariate analyses were used to evaluate the influence of the clinical characteristics and the AA intake of growth expressed as <italic>z</italic> score changes from birth to each time when the growth data were assessed. The relationship between AA intake and serum urea nitrogen level was determined using Pearson’s correlation coefficient (<italic>r</italic> or <italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup>). The results were considered significant at <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05.</p>
</sec></sec>
<sec id="section8-0148607112456400" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>After discharge, 16 infants died within 12 months (n = 9 in the SP group vs n = 7 in the HP group), and 12 infants (n = 7 in the SP group vs n = 5 in the HP group) were lost to follow-up. A total of 109 patients were included in the study analysis.</p>
<p>Demographic and perinatal data did not differ in the 2 study groups (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0148607112456400">Table 1</xref>). The HP group received 11% more AA intake than the SP group for the first 2 weeks, and this was mostly due to the difference in AA intake during the first week of life (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0148607112456400">Figure 1</xref>). There were no differences in the fluid volume, nonprotein intake, or enteral intakes between the study groups. The proportion of infants fed with preterm formula or fortified BM and the amount of each type of feeding also did not differ between the 2 study groups during hospitalization (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0148607112456400">Table 2</xref>). The mean and peak serum urea nitrogen levels during the first 2 weeks of life were higher in the HP group, although the incidence of serum urea nitrogen &gt;40 mg/dL did not differ between the 2 groups. The mean and peak serum potassium and glucose levels and the incidence of hyperkalemia and hyperglycemia also did not differ between the 2 study groups (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0148607112456400">Table 3</xref>). However, during the first 3 days of life, the peak blood glucose level was significantly lower in the HP group than in the SP group (<italic>P</italic> = .001). A linear regression analysis revealed a significant correlation between AA intake during the first 2 weeks of life and the mean serum urea nitrogen level while adjusting for gestational age (<italic>r</italic> = 0.245, <italic>P</italic> = .004).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In the present study, administration of a higher dose of AAs in the VLBW infants, approximating the fetal AA transfer rate from the first day of life, did not result in better growth outcomes than in the group with the “standard dose” of AA. Protein and energy intake meeting the recommended dietary intakes is rarely achieved in VLBW infants, and they inevitably experience cumulative energy and protein deficits during the initial few postnatal weeks.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0148607112456400">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0148607112456400">2</xref></sup> A dietary intake of protein of 3.0 g/kg/d or more from the first day of life is thought to prevent the interruption or reduction of the fetal dose of AA transfer and, thereby, theoretically can minimize postnatal growth restriction. Although several studies have addressed the effect of early and “aggressive” nutrition on growth outcomes, most are observational studies, and the effect of parenteral AA was not independently investigated.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0148607112456400">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0148607112456400"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0148607112456400"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0148607112456400"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0148607112456400">7</xref></sup> It is no wonder, then, that most studies of nutrition interventions in preterm infants have been interested in enteral feeding strategies rather than early PN, with a different kind of enrichment protocol of AAs and/or calories.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0148607112456400">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0148607112456400"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0148607112456400"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0148607112456400">11</xref></sup> Only a multicenter, randomized trial comparing 2 groups with different dosing strategies of parenteral AAs demonstrated a result similar to ours, in which the higher starting dose and the faster advancement in the AA supplementation did not lead to better growth outcome at 28 days of age in premature infants of &lt;30 weeks’ gestation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0148607112456400">3</xref></sup> On the other hand, an observational study by Maggio et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0148607112456400">5</xref></sup> with a very similar design of nutrition strategies, including the AA dose, to ours reported better height and weight gain in the higher AA group at the time of their hospital discharge. In that study, the mean AA intake during the first 2 weeks of life was independently associated with weight and height <italic>z</italic> scores in the short term. However, the intake of AAs during the first 2 weeks of life did not correlate with the changes in the <italic>z</italic> scores of any of the growth parameters in our study. The reasons for this discrepancy are unclear. However, our enrolled study patients were more mature (approximately 30 weeks vs 27 weeks of gestational age), and the proportion of the small for gestational age (SGA) preterm infants was higher (30% vs 9%) than in the study by Maggio et al. The effect of early AA intervention can be attenuated in the more mature infant group with faster achieving target enteral feeding and in SGA preterm infants with greater risk of postnatal growth retardation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0148607112456400">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0148607112456400">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>In our study, the metabolic benefit of higher AA supplementation was not demonstrated in terms of serum glucose and potassium control, although the peak blood glucose level was lower in the HP group during the first 3 days after birth. The increased concentration of the extracellular AA level, especially leucine, stimulates intracellular protein synthesis and suppresses protein breakdown, presumably by stimulating insulin secretion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0148607112456400">14</xref></sup> However, this insulin-dependent proteolysis suppression by AAs has not been consistently documented in preterm infants.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0148607112456400">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0148607112456400">16</xref></sup> Several comparative studies composed of groups with different AA doses also failed to demonstrate the greater risk of hyperglycemia and/or hyperkalemia with a range of clinical concerns in the group with the lower AA intake.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0148607112456400">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0148607112456400">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0148607112456400">18</xref></sup> The metabolic benefit of early and higher AA infusion in a specific study group can be influenced by several factors such as disease severity, patient maturity, and renal functions. As for hyperkalemia, in particular, other factors such as exposure to antenatal corticosteroid treatment can be related to the early serum potassium levels.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0148607112456400">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0148607112456400">20</xref></sup> However, these factors were comparable in our 2 study groups.</p>
<p>The clinical implication of a higher peak serum urea nitrogen level in our study’s HP group is not clear. Even in this group, the mean peak serum urea nitrogen level was within the cord blood serum urea nitrogen range,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0148607112456400">21</xref></sup> and the proportion of patients with a peak serum urea nitrogen level &gt;40 mg/dL was also not greater than that seen in the SP group. No patients in either group demonstrated a serum urea nitrogen level &gt;60 mg/dL during the initial 2 weeks, and the advance in AA dose did not have to be stopped based solely on the serum AA levels. This may be due to the characteristics of the enrolled patients since those with acute renal failure had been excluded. Of course, there are still concerns regarding the potential risk of a high serum urea nitrogen and/or ammonia level in the developing brains of the extremely premature patient group.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0148607112456400">18</xref></sup> However, until now, there has been no reliable evidence of a detrimental effect on the neurodevelopmental consequences caused by uremia of the degree commonly encountered during the early neonatal period in premature infants.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0148607112456400">2</xref></sup> The difference in the mean serum urea nitrogen level between our study groups might have resulted from the difference in the AA doses, although other investigators have failed to correlate the serum urea nitrogen levels with the amount of AA intake within 3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0148607112456400">22</xref></sup> or 15 days<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0148607112456400">22</xref></sup> after birth in more premature groups than those of our study.</p>
<p>There are some limitations to our retrospective study. First, the actual protein intake did not reach the target dose of AAs during the early days of life. This may be due to the need for volume restriction for clinical reasons and concomitant continuous infusion of other medications (eg, inotropes, sedatives). This early inadequate protein intake could have affected the growth outcomes of both study groups. Second, the influences of unexpected changes in patient care other than nutrition factors could not be completely controlled, especially during the first 2 weeks after birth. However, factors potentially affecting the early growth rate, such as early neonatal morbidities and fluid management protocol, did not differ between the 2 study groups. Moreover, nutrition practices other than the AA doses did not change and were controlled and monitored by the same pharmacist. Third, nutrition strategies during the hospitalization and afterward up to the last time point of the growth parameter could not be strictly regulated. However, the type of feeding formula did not differ between the 2 groups, although detailed data could not be obtained. Finally, the nutrition benefit (or risk) for the HP group over the SP group could not be evaluated in terms of nutrition quality. Lean body mass in preterm infants is less well developed, and the proportions of fat deposition could be affected by several factors such as the disease severity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0148607112456400">23</xref></sup> Comparison analysis of lean body mass in both groups using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry or magnetic resonance fat imaging could clarify this issue.</p>
<p>In conclusion, changes in nutrition practice by increasing the starting dose of AAs from 1.5 to 3.0 g/kg/d and earlier achievement of the fetal dose of AA transfer did not result in a better growth outcome in the VLBW infants assessed in our study. Furthermore, well-controlled prospective studies will be needed to determine the effect of early and higher AA intake on the quantity and the quality of growth in premature infants.</p>
