<p>Since the classical books of the Greek philosophers or Confucius Anaclets, the learning process has been a subject of inquiry, discussion, formalization and practice. After more than 20 centuries of philosophical, moral and more recently scientific developments, no ‘best way’ of teaching and learning has been discovered. The individual cognitive learning process seems to influence and be influenced by the plurality and complexities of the ever-changing social, economic and political context. This phenomenon become much more complex if we take into account that the world never had so many inhabitants as it has nowadays nor so many countries, nations, cultures, organizations, institutions, companies, churches, etc., Individuals or any other structure with more than an individual in a each day more worldwide integrated world are seeking to act and to learn. Directed at this end, <italic>Action Learning in Practice</italic> is an important endeavour.</p>
<p>The fourth edition of <italic>Action Learning in Practice</italic> is a fully revised and updated volume of the original edited book published in 1983 by Mike Pedler. The third edition of <italic>Action Learning in Practice</italic> was published in 1997. Since then, the promotion of learning over teaching and the championing of practitioner knowledge has become part of the ‘mainstream’ in the corporate and academic communities. With 80 per cent newly commissioned chapters, Mike Pedler seeks to document the changes and developments that have taken in the practice of action learning in recent decades in four separate sections focussing on the origins, varieties, applications and questions posed by those who have practiced and studied action learning.</p>
<p>The volume continues to feature the core writings of earlier editions including the seminal chapters by Reg Revans, who is recognized as the founder of the action learning movement, and other distinguished students including Bob Garratt and John Morris. The second section on varieties of action learning is a new contribution. It seeks to map the different types of action learning that are taking place in today’s world. Action learning models are now used in classic settings, but also with geographically distributed participants via communication technologies. This second section also includes a focus on how more recent models of Action Reflection Learning and Business-driven Action Learning differ and align with Revan’s views of action learning.</p>
<p>The entire section on practical applications of action learning featured in the third edition has been entirely revamped and expanded in the fourth edition. The cases and examples draw from a wider set of companies, organizations and countries. As action learning has expanded to so many parts of the globe, to small and big organizations alike, it is clear that action learning means different things to different people. The fourth and final section of the book is geared at this question. In the third edition, this final section was directed at an evaluation of action learning. In this fourth edition, Pedler has shifted the frame to try to link action learning with the broader literature.</p>
<p>The 35 chapters of the fourth edition of <italic>Action Learning in Practice</italic> consolidate efforts to establish an authoritative work that maps how action-based organizational learning and development has evolved up until the first decade of the twenty-first century. The book is extremely useful for many types of audiences. For those who want to practice action learning, there are multiple chapters that offer important insights and questions for deliberation. For those who seek to study action learning for academic purposes, the chapters contain a thorough review of the state of the practice of action learning across countries and organizations.</p>
