<abstract>
<p>It has been hypothesised that among different human subjects, the bone tissue quality varies as a function of the bone segment morphology. The aim of this study was to assess and compare the quality, evaluated in terms of hardness of packages of lamellae, of cortical and trabecular bones, at different anatomical sites within the human skeleton. The contralateral six long bones of an old human subject were indented at different levels along the diaphysis and at both epiphyses of each bone. Hardness value, which is correlated to the degree of mineralisation, of both cortical and trabecular bone tissues was calculated for each indentation location. It was found that the cortical bone tissue was harder (+18%) than the trabecular one. In general, the bone hardness was found to be locally highly heterogeneous. In fact, considering one single slice obtained for a bone segment, the coefficient of variation of the hardness values was up to 12% for cortical bone and up to 17% for trabecular bone. However, the tissue hardness was on average quite homogeneous within and among the long bones of the studied donor, although differences up to 9% among levels and up to 7% among bone segments were found. These findings seem not to support the mentioned hypothesis, at least not for the long bones of an old subject.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>It is commonly accepted that bone tissue changes in response to physical activity and altered loading conditions. Recent studies have indicated that the average bending properties and mineralisation of human cortical tissue vary as a function of the overall size of the bone.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954411912459424">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954411912459424"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0954411912459424">3</xref></sup> In those studies, four-point bending and damage accumulation properties of bone tissue samples extracted from tibiae coming from different subjects were compared. It was found that more slender tibiae were correlated with increased bone tissue modulus and tissue mineralisation. The authors hypothesised that this adaptation occurs to ensure that the bone segment morphology and tissue quality together meet the mechanical demands.</p>
<p>The six long bones of the human body are of different shapes and sizes. In fact, the long bones show large differences in term of both structural stiffness (e.g. the femur is up to 40 times stiffer than the fibula) and strength (e.g. the femur is up to 100 times stiffer than the fibula).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954411912459424">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954411912459424">5</xref></sup> At the tissue level (i.e. specimens at the millimetre scale), the data reported in the literature show a high scattering in mechanical strength within subjects and among subjects.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954411912459424">6</xref></sup> This scattering has been found to be mainly explained by the differences in the amount of bone tissue present within the volume of interest, that is, bone volume fraction or apparent density.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0954411912459424">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0954411912459424">8</xref></sup> However, it is still debated whether there are differences at the level of intrinsic bone tissue quality.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0954411912459424">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0954411912459424">10</xref></sup> Hence, it is not clear whether the hypothesis of a coadaptation of morphological and tissue quality traits can be extended to the long bones of the same subject. To the authors’ knowledge, no study has been performed to test this hypothesis by investigating the tissue quality along all long bones of the same subject. Furthermore, it is not known whether the trabecular bone tissue of the long bones also adapts to its different mechanical demands.</p>
<p>Measuring hardness is a possible way to determine the mechanical properties of the bone tissue. It has been found that hardness can be considered as one of the characteristics determining bone tissue quality.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0954411912459424">11</xref></sup> In fact, over the years, indentation tests have been used to derive degree of mineralisation, mechanical properties and anisotropy of the tissue or its components.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0954411912459424">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0954411912459424"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0954411912459424"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0954411912459424"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0954411912459424"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0954411912459424"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0954411912459424">18</xref></sup> More recently, it has been demonstrated that the degree of correlation between hardness and degree of mineralisation of bone tissue (R<sup>2</sup> from 0.36 to 0.52) improves if the variable ‘subject’ is excluded (within-subject correlation R<sup>2</sup> from 0.76 to 0.90).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0954411912459424">19</xref></sup> Therefore, hardness measurement is a simple way to estimate the degree of mineralisation of bone tissue retrieved from the same subject.</p>
<p>The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that bone tissue hardness, measured with microindentations, adapts to different functions and mechanical requirements of the six long bones in the human skeleton.</p>

<title>Material and methods</title>
<p>Both contralateral six long bones of the skeleton (i.e. fibula, tibia, femur, humerus, radius and ulna) were obtained from a donor programme of the Université Libre de Bruxelles. The subject was a 78-year-old female. Although the subject’s medical history did not include cancer or skeletal disorders, it was found that the donor was osteoporotic (T-score:−3.8). This value was estimated from computed tomography (CT) images since no dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) or quantitative computed tomography (QCT) data were available. In a parallel study, the bone tissue composition (i.e. contents of water, organic matrix and mineral expressed in weight/weight) and the Ca/P atomic ratio were determined. It was found that the tissue composition (mineral 59%, organic matrix 30% and water 11%) was comparable with the values reported in the literature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0954411912459424">20</xref></sup> Additionally, the Ca/P atomic ratio, determined by means of energy dispersive X-ray microanalysis, was 1.66 ± 0.06.</p>
<p>Before proceeding, all bone segments were kept in a 4% formalin embalming solution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0954411912459424">21</xref></sup> for 4 weeks. Formalin fixation was used to reduce the risk of transmission of infectious diseases and to assure tissue preservation during the study. It has been found that this procedure has no significant effect on the hardness of bone tissue.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0954411912459424">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0954411912459424">23</xref></sup> Each bone segment was cut perpendicular to its longitudinal axis using a diamond saw. The diaphysis of each bone was cut at different levels. The levels were chosen trying to cover the whole diaphyseal length. However, since the whole bone segments previously had undergone a monotonic destructive test, as a part of a different study, in some cases, one or more levels were excluded since the diaphysis was largely disintegrated in that portion. In any case, eight complete cross sections were obtained at different levels from the diaphysis of each bone segment, that is, the indentations were performed on intact parts of the diaphyseal bone tissue. The absence of fracture in the area of interest was double-checked. Preliminarily, it was verified macroscopically that the cross section was intact. Moreover, when selecting the location for indentation, the absence of microfracture around the indentation area was checked microscopically.</p>
<p>Additionally, at least one cross section of each epiphysis of each bone segment was obtained for trabecular bone indentations. The smaller number of cross section was due to (1) the smaller local anatomy of the epiphyses and (2) the need of bone slices at least 10 mm in height (thickness necessary to clamp the specimen during surface preparation).</p>
<p>The procedures of microindentation on wet specimens of human cortical and trabecular bone tissues used in this study are described in detail in two previously published works;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0954411912459424">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0954411912459424">25</xref></sup> however, the most important steps are reported.</p>
<p>Before testing, all slices were immersed in Ringer’s solution at 4°C for at least 24 h, to assure the rehydration of the bone tissue.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0954411912459424">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0954411912459424">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0954411912459424">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0954411912459424">26</xref></sup> One cutting plane of each slice was polished using increasingly fine sandpaper and diamond paste to get a perfectly smooth surface. The whole process was done under constant water irrigation. After the polishing procedure, the slices were rinsed in distilled water and immersed in Ringer’s solution for at least half an hour to assure specimen hydration. Before microindentation testing, a blotting paper was used to soak up the excess of Ringer’s solution from the tissue surface. This is important since an excess of saline solution would wet back the imprint left on the tissue surface making it difficult to measure the two diagonal lengths.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0954411912459424">22</xref></sup> In general, all indentations on the same slice were performed within 30 min. If the procedure took longer, the slice was re-immersed into Ringer’s solution for 30 min before proceeding with the indentation series to avoid specimen dehydration.</p>
<p>Microindentations on bone tissue in a wet condition were performed by means of a Vickers diamond indenter (Leica VMHT).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0954411912459424">19</xref></sup> According to the studies of Zwierzak et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0954411912459424">25</xref></sup> and Dall’Ara et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0954411912459424">24</xref></sup> microindentations were performed using different loads for cortical and trabecular tissues, 100 and 25 gf, respectively. For both tissues, the indentation time was set to 15 s. The lengths of the diagonals were measured under reflected light microscopy, and the Vickers hardness value (HV/0.100 and HV/0.025, respectively) was calculated. Asymmetric indentations with differences of more than 15% between diagonals were discarded, and the indentation was repeated.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0954411912459424">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0954411912459424">28</xref></sup></p>
<p>A preliminary study was preformed on the first analysed bone (i.e. left tibia). On each cross section, 60 complete secondary osteons, hereafter referred to as osteons, with a cross-sectional diameter greater than 200 µm were indented. Fifteen osteons were selected on each of the four quadrants (anterior, medial, posterior and lateral). Hence, a total of 480 microindentations were performed on the cortical tissue of the left tibia. These preliminary data were used to determine the appropriate sample size of microindentation to be performed on each bone segment. On the basis that the error associated with the whole procedure, considering also different operators, was typically 2%–3%, it was chosen that the sample size should assure the detection of a difference greater than 5% between hardness mean values with a statistical power of 95% when the significant level is set at 0.05. Since the standard deviation was found to be 3.8 HV/0.100, it was calculated that the appropriate sample size would be 95 indentations. In order to perform an equal number of indentations on each quadrant and each bone slice, the total number of repetitions was set to 96.</p>
<p>To verify the chosen sample size, once collected the first 480 hardness values, further 12 osteons were selected on each cross section (three for each quadrant) collecting additionally 96 hardness values from the same bone segment. To assess the effect of the sample size, a nonparametric test (Mann–Whitney) was performed separately for each level. Mann–Whitney was used since the hypothesis of a normal distribution cannot be assured in a group of 12 measurements. Furthermore, the homoscedasticity between 60 and 12 measurements at each single level was not always guaranteed. Conversely, considering the two whole datasets (480 and 96 measurements), the two assumptions to apply a parametric test were verified, allowing the use of a t-test.</p>
<p>On the basis of the outcomes of this preliminary analysis (see ‘Results’ section), the sample size of 96 measurements was considered adequate to describe the hardness value population. Therefore, 96 microindentations, that is, 12 on each analysed cross section, were performed on the diaphysis of each remaining bone segment.</p>
<p>The same sample size was chosen for the trabecular bone tissue. Hence, 48 indentations were performed on both the distal and proximal epiphyses. On the analysed surface, microindentations were performed following a 1- to 2-mm grid. The interdistance was set depending on the cross-sectional dimension, to obtain the target sample size. However, since the trabecular structure is not regular, the effective microindentation location was adjusted selecting the trabecula closest to the target point or passing over to the next target point when a large void in the trabecular structure did not allow the application of the criterion.</p>
<p>The first statistical analysis aimed to determine differences among the hardness values measured at different levels. A Kruskal–Wallis test was used to analyse the HVs collected at different diaphyseal levels. Conversely, normal distribution (Shapiro–Wilk test) and homoscedasticity (f-test) of the hardness values collected at the proximal and distal epiphyses of each bone were verified. If both assumptions were confirmed, a t-test was performed, otherwise the nonparametric Mann–Whitney test was applied.</p>
<p>Finally, a multifactorial analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to analyse the effect of tissue type, bone segment and side on the bone tissue hardness (the assumptions of normal distribution and homoscedasticity were verified).</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>The analysis of the preliminarily data collected from the left tibia showed that the differences in the hardness mean values obtained with 60 and 12 indentations were lower than 1% at four of eight levels, while at the remaining levels, the differences were in the range of 1%–2%. However, in all the cases, the differences between the 60 and 12 indentation groups were not statistically significant (Mann–Whitney: p values in the range of 0.40–0.97). Considering the two whole datasets, the hypothesis of normality and homoscedasticity were verified (Shapiro–Wilk test: p = 0.17 and p = 0.12 for the 480 and 96 measurements, respectively; f-test: p = 0.80). The difference between the two hardness mean values was lower than 1% and not statistically significant (t-test: p = 0.56).</p>
<p>A complete dataset of cortical hardness values (sample size = 96) was collected from each remaining bone segment. The Kruskal–Wallis showed that the level of the diaphysis was not significant in 9 of 12 cases (p values in the range of 0.10–0.97). In the remaining three cases, significant differences were found among diaphyseal levels (p = 0.002, 0.003 and 0.01 for the left femur, right femur and left fibula, respectively). The maximum differences among the levels were as follows: 7% in the left femur, 9% in the right femur and 6% in the left fibula. All the collected cortical data are summarised in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954411912459424">Figure 1</xref>.</p>

</fig>
<p>The same trabecular hardness sample size was obtained from all the bones except the two fibulae. In those cases, a reduced number (75 and 60 for the left and the right fibula, respectively) was performed due to less material to indent. In 7 of 12 comparisons, that is, proximal versus distal epiphyses of each bone segment, the two assumptions necessary for a parametric test were confirmed, allowing the use of a t-test. The statistical analysis showed no significant difference (t-test: p values in the range of 0.20–0.75) between the hardness of trabecular bone in all the cases except one. In the right femur, the trabecular tissue of the proximal epiphysis was about 5% harder than that of the distal one (t-test: p = 0.006). In the remaining five cases where parametric test could not be applied, Mann–Whitney tests showed no significant difference in all the cases (p values in the range of 0.07–0.56) except one. In the right ulna, the trabecular tissue of the distal epiphysis was about 6% harder than that of the proximal one (Mann–Whitney test: p = 0.03). The trabecular data are also summarised in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954411912459424">Figure 1</xref>.</p>
<p>In both cortical and trabecular tissues, the bone hardness was found to be locally highly heterogeneous. In fact, considering the single slices, coefficients of variation of the hardness values up to 12% was found in the cortical bone and up to 17% in the trabecular bone.</p>
<p>Neglecting the level of the cross section within each bone segment, the hardness values were grouped by tissue type, bone segment and side. The grouped data were relatively dispersed, the coefficient of variation ranging from 0.08 to 0.15. As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954411912459424">Figure 2</xref>, the hardness was found to be significantly influenced by tissue type (ANOVA: p&lt;0.001). The trabecular tissue was approximately 18% less hard than the cortical one. Conversely, anatomical side and site did not affect significantly the HV (ANOVA: p = 0.40 and p = 0.10, respectively). The maximum difference found between the hardness measured in contralateral bone segments was 4% (tibial trabecular bone), while the maximum differences found between bone segments were slightly greater (cortical: 4% humerus vs tibia; trabecular: 7% femur vs radius).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The hardness of cortical and trabecular bone tissues obtained from the contralateral six long bones of the skeleton was studied. A significant difference was found in hardness between cortical and trabecular bones. Cortical bone was found to be approximately 18% harder than trabecular bone. The mean values of cortical (42 HV/0.100) and trabecular hardness (35 HV/0.025) found are in line with previous findings (wet cortical tissue: 42 HV/0.100,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0954411912459424">25</xref></sup> wet trabecular tissue: 33 HV/0.025<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0954411912459424">24</xref></sup>). The fact that the HVs found in this study comparable with those reported in the literature indirectly confirms that the indentations were performed on intact bone tissue. In fact, it has been demonstrated that damaged bone tissue (compressive testing up to 12%–53% of deformation) shows 50% lower hardness compared to intact tissue.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0954411912459424">29</xref></sup> However, the present findings are in disagreement with the study of Boivin et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0954411912459424">19</xref></sup> In that study, cortical and trabecular bones were found to have similar hardness. However, the tissue samples had been dehydrated and embedded in methyl methacrylate prior to indentation. It has been found that the hardness of trabecular bone is more affected by such a procedure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0954411912459424">24</xref></sup> than cortical bone.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0954411912459424">25</xref></sup> This may have balanced the difference between the two tissues and hence explain the disagreement with this study. Conversely, the present finding is in agreement with the study of Weaver,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0954411912459424">30</xref></sup> where it was found that the hardness of trabecular bone was generally somewhat less than that of cortical bone. Moreover, a study of Hodgskinson et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0954411912459424">27</xref></sup> found that cortical bone was 10%–20% harder than trabecular bone. Such difference in hardness could be due to different bone remodelling rates and/or to the greater bone mineral density found in cortical bone compared to trabecular bone.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0954411912459424">31</xref></sup> Furthermore, it has also been found that the degree of mineralisation of cortical bones is significantly higher than that of trabecular bones.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0954411912459424">32</xref></sup> The present results are in line with the findings of Zysset et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0954411912459424">33</xref></sup> In that study, hardness of trabecular and cortical lamellae was investigated by means of nanoindentations. It was found that both hardness and elastic modulus of cortical lamellae were significantly higher than that of trabecular lamellae. Nevertheless, as discussed by the authors of that article, those results contradict the assumption by Wolff<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0954411912459424">34</xref></sup> and the suggestion by Carter and Hayes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0954411912459424">35</xref></sup> that cortical and trabecular bones are made of the same tissue. However, in that study,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0954411912459424">33</xref></sup> as well as in the present one, trabecular bone was indented randomly along multiple orientations (in this study, generally perpendicular to the longitudinal direction of the single trabecula), whereas the cortical bone was always indented in the longitudinal direction of the Haversian canals. The indentation direction may affect the measurement, as it has been found that the hardness of bovine cortical bone is significantly different in the three orthogonal directions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0954411912459424">28</xref></sup> In fact, in a study of Turner et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0954411912459424">36</xref></sup> it was found that the elastic properties, measured by means of nanoindentation, of human trabecular bone were within the range of that of cortical bone tissue. To completely determine the reason for the difference between cortical and trabecular bones, future studies should investigate the hardness in different directions of the bone tissue.</p>
<p>No statistically significant difference in hardness was found between contralateral bones. This is in agreement with a previous study where the cortical hardness of two contralateral femurs was investigated.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0954411912459424">25</xref></sup> Furthermore, no significant differences in hardness of cortical or trabecular tissues were found among different bones. These findings suggest that the mean value of hardness is unaffected by the function of the bone segment, that is, weight bearing or not. These results are in line with the study of Ramrakhiani et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0954411912459424">37</xref></sup> where the hardness of some of the flat bones was investigated. Furthermore, they are in line with some of the findings of Weaver.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0954411912459424">30</xref></sup> In that study, it was found that the hardness among tibia, fibula and ulna did not vary greatly. However, in both those studies,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0954411912459424">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0954411912459424">37</xref></sup> higher HVs were found (mean values calculated from their respective reported data: 50 HV/0.100 and 50 HV) compared to the cortical bone hardness (42 HV/0.100) of this study. Different reasons may explain that difference. Referring to the first study, Weaver<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0954411912459424">30</xref></sup> performed 10 indentations but calculated a mean value only from the three highest values found. Considering only the highest 30% of the values of this study, a value closer to that reported by Weaver can be calculated (46 HV/100). Furthermore, Ramrakhiani et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0954411912459424">37</xref></sup> silver-coated the specimens before indentation, which might have affected the hardness measurements. Additionally, the use of a coating suggests that a dry testing condition was used. It has been found that dry tissue is about 10%–40% harder than wet tissue.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0954411912459424">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0954411912459424">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0954411912459424">30</xref></sup></p>
<p>It has been demonstrated that bone tissue hardness is correlated with the degree of mineralisation of the single osteon or trabecula within subjects.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0954411912459424">19</xref></sup> Therefore, on the basis of the present results, it could be assumed that although local differences exist, on average the degree of mineralisation of packages of lamellae of cortical or trabecular bone from the six long bones do not differ despite the differences in bone segment slenderness. This deduction seems to be in disagreement with the findings of Tommasini et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954411912459424">2</xref></sup> In that study, it was found that the average mineralisation of human cortical tissue varied as a function of the overall size of the bone. Conversely, on the basis of the present results and the above reported reasoning, no differences in average mineralisation would be expected among the six long bones in the human skeleton, despite differences in size and shape. Two different reasons may explain this disagreement: (1) Bone quality is a mean of adaptation to mechanical demands only between individuals, while within the same skeleton, it remains on average constant. The theory of Tommasini et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954411912459424">2</xref></sup> is based on observations performed on 21 tibiae retrieved from 21 different subjects, while in this study, all 12 long bones of one donor were studied. (2) The adaptation described by Tommasini et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954411912459424">2</xref></sup> is more marked in young adult subjects. It is possible that the average tissue differences decreases with ageing since both tissue remodelling and daily physical activity decrease. In fact, in those studies, all subjects were young adults (17–46 years old), while in this study, the sole donor was fairly old (78 years old) and, more important, affected by osteoporosis. Therefore, the outcomes of this study must be evaluated considering the presence of this disease since it cannot be excluded that the bone quality adaptation mechanism might be blocked by osteoporosis. This is the main limitation of this study, that is, the study considered just one old subject. The study must be replicated on several subjects before these preliminary results could be generalised.</p>
<p>It should be kept in mind that the present findings cannot be extended to the bending properties of trabecular or cortical bone tissue. In fact, other parameters than mineralisation of packages of lamellae are relevant parameters for those properties.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954411912459424">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0954411912459424">38</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0954411912459424"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0954411912459424">40</xref></sup> Therefore, the hypothesis of Tommasini et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954411912459424">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954411912459424">2</xref></sup> subsequently elaborated by Jepsen,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0954411912459424">3</xref></sup> that the bending properties of human cortical tissue vary as a function of the overall size of the bone segment is not contradicted.</p>
<p>The present findings about the mean hardness values measured on the whole bone segments do not imply that the hardness of the bone tissue is locally homogeneous. Conversely, osteons or packages of lamellae are generally different in terms of hardness. In fact, similar coefficients of variation (about 9%) were found despite the five times increase of indentations performed in the preliminary study on the left tibia. Coefficients of variation in the same order of magnitude were found subsequently in all groups, regardless of bone segment and tissue type. Additionally, considering one single slice, the maximum coefficient of variation was found to be 1.5 and two times greater than that calculated for the whole bone segment for the cortical and trabecular bones, respectively. It must be acknowledged that a repeatability error is intrinsically associated with microhardness measurements, which was verified to be generally 2%–3%. However, the measured hardness values were more dispersed, the maximum value being about two times the minimum one. Therefore, the bone tissue is far away from being locally homogeneous. This is in agreement with the studies of Huja et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0954411912459424">41</xref></sup> and Hengsberger et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0954411912459424">42</xref></sup> In the former study, a great difference in hardness (41%) was found between older osteons (completely mineralised) and younger ones (early phase of mineralisation) in femoral cross sections. In the latter study, trabecular bone from the human femoral neck was investigated, and it was found that the hardness within the same bone structural unit was rather homogeneous, whereas it varied extensively between structural units.</p>
<p>In conclusion, investigating the hardness of the six pairs of long bone of an old subject, the following was found:</p>
<list id="list1-0954411912459424" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Cortical bone tissue is harder than trabecular one;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Both tissue types are not locally homogeneous, the osteons or packages of lamellae located in the same anatomical region have different tissue hardness;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The average tissue hardness does not differ significantly in contralateral bones;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The average tissue hardness does not differ significantly among different bones.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>However, these conclusions must be considered as preliminary results. To be able to generalise the last two conclusions, an inter-subject study with the inclusion of young adults should be performed.</p>
