<abstract>
<p>Students with learning disabilities obtain a wide range of recommended accommodations in secondary school, which they anticipate will continue into postsecondary education. Although the student’s specific learning disability (SLD) contributes to the accommodation planning process, it is not the sole determinant of appropriate accommodation. Academic requirements have integrity of their own, bona fide elements that cannot be altered without changing the nature of what is being taught or assessed. It is important to remain cognizant of bona fide requirements, which may not be altered when recommending academic accommodations. This is especially true when the student is heading into postsecondary or professional education. This article uses the World Health Organization’s model of disability and the human rights context to highlight the role of bona fide requirements in accommodation planning.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Canadian human rights and education legislation does not require any specific type of accommodation for any given condition in any particular setting. This leaves much room for interpretation in individual cases, taking into account the nature of the condition, the resulting impairment, and the environmental context. While it is important to understand the nature and extent of the student’s disability, it is also critical to understand the nature of the task required of the student. The specific impairment a student may have is, therefore, only one half of the equation in determining appropriate accommodation at the postsecondary level. Bona fide task requirements are as important a consideration as the identification of impairment. Focusing on task requirements in a particular course or program of study helps to determine accommodations that equalize the opportunity to participate without compromising the integrity of the academic task. Only when we consider both sides of the issue—the student’s functional capability and the requirements of the academic task—can a balanced and appropriate accommodation plan can be devised. Without an analysis of requirements, we risk two things: compromising standards or practices that are indeed necessary for external, real-life reasons, and on the other hand, we risk perpetuating assumptions that exclude students with disabilities from participating equally.</p>
<p>While academic task requirements, policies, procedures, and instructional methods are often developed with implicit assumptions about normal vision, hearing, information-processing, and print capabilities that merit reconsideration, postsecondary education requirements are also rife with bona fide professional practice constraints. The work of accommodation planning is about examining academic requirements for barriers that affect disabled students’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0829573512437171">1</xref></sup> equal participation, without compromising essential requirements.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0829573512437171">2</xref></sup> It is important to go beyond the student and consider the bona fide task requirements, those that cannot be modified, along with those than can and should be achieved by alternative means, before deciding to accommodate.</p>
<p>The purpose of this article is to elaborate on the importance of an essential, or bona fide, requirement and explicate the role of that concept in determining academic accommodations at the postsecondary level.</p>

<title>Literature Review</title>
<p>The Ontario Human Rights Code 1990 sets a boundary for accommodation by stating explicitly that discrimination is not present (i.e., accommodation would not be required to rectify discrimination) when the person is unable to perform essential duties expressly because his or her disability prevents them from doing so. “A right of a person under this Act is not infringed for the reason only that the person is incapable of performing or fulfilling the essential duties or requirements attending the exercise of the right because of disability” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0829573512437171">Ontario Human Rights Code, 1990a</xref>). This section of the code speaks to the notion that there are requirements that cannot be accomplished by people with certain disabilities. Examples would include a person who is blind driving a bus. It would not be discriminatory to prohibit people who are blind from driving a bus, because of the requirement to see the road, read traffic signs, and so on. Hence, the vision requirement for a driver’s license does not discriminate against people who are blind. Similarly, it would not be discriminatory to exclude people with severe reading disabilities from tasks that require fast, accurate reading for the health and safety of others and where an effective accommodation could not be made. The notion of bona fide requirements is elaborated substantially in case law decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0829573512437171"><italic>Granovsky v. Canada [Minister of Employment and Immigration]</italic>, 2000</xref>; <italic>British Columbia [Superintendent of Motor Vehicles] v. British Columbia [Council of Human Rights]</italic>, 1994; <italic>Meiorin</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0829573512437171">1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0829573512437171"><italic>Ontario Human Rights Commission v. Borough of Etobicoke</italic>, 1982</xref>) where the focus is on determining whether a requirement is justifiable and not discriminatory.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0829573512437171">Pardo and Tomlinson (1999)</xref> identify the need to define and defend academic requirements in fieldwork settings. Their work draws on Canadian and American court cases involving discrimination in postsecondary education, where the emphasis on differential treatment of students with impairments and the need for accommodation speaks to the necessity of articulating why various policies and procedures are required in programs and courses. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0829573512437171">Lindstrom (2007)</xref> also notes the importance of considering the larger context in which accommodation is implemented. “Professionals must consider the environmental, biological, cognitive, language, and behavioral signs influencing an individual’s ability to learn tasks in a specific context when making accommodation decisions” (p. 235).</p>
<p>A useful framework for including the task in the analysis of accommodation comes from the World Health Organization (WHO). The WHO identifies not only the impairment, but also the environmental factors, including policy structures and delivery methods, which contribute to disablement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0829573512437171">WHO, 2001</xref>). In the WHO biopsychosocial model, the word <italic>impairment</italic> refers to the body structure or function that is affected. For example, in the case of learning disabilities, this would include brain structures responsible for cognitive functions such as memory, attention, visual and auditory processing, and so on. An impairment of auditory processing due to brain chemistry or structure would affect listening, understanding, and recalling what was heard. Functional implications for participation in school would result in what are known as “participation restrictions” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0829573512437171">WHO, 2001</xref>) in that the student might not keep up with taking notes in lectures or recalling spoken material. To the extent that the student is unable to access classroom material due to delivery methods that rely on audible, spoken language, that student is disabled by the environmental requirements for speech and sound-based instruction.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0829573512437171">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Environmental Factors category (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0829573512437171">WHO, 2001</xref>) includes accommodation strategies because accommodations are most often changes to an element of the environment that contributes to, or detracts from, the participation of students with impairments. Environmental factors are divided into five categories: attitudes and beliefs; policies, services, and systems; products and technology; built and natural environment; and relationships and supports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0829573512437171">WHO, 2001</xref>). Without going into each of these environmental factors in equal depth, this review will focus on three that relate to accommodation, task analysis, and the role of bona fide requirements.</p>
<list id="list1-0829573512437171" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Attitudes and beliefs: Attitudes and beliefs comprise an environmental Factor in that they exist outside the person with an impairment<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0829573512437171">3</xref></sup> and affect the person’s equal participation. This category of environmental factors includes the attitudes and beliefs of professionals who identify, diagnose, and accommodate students with impairments. Attitudes and beliefs about disability, equal opportunity, and accommodation itself inform both diagnostic and accommodation processes. Beliefs in different definitions and criteria for the diagnosis of a specific learning disability (SLD), for example, result in conflicting information for clients, affecting their self-image and sense of empowered, autonomous participation.</p></list-item></list>
<p>The belief that a diagnosis, or even identification, is sufficient to compel accommodation becomes problematic when there is no impact of the impairment on the task at hand or when there is no inequity of opportunity to participate. For example, a student with poor auditory memory would experience no functional impact in a flexibly paced, text-based correspondence course that requires no audible discussion or presentation and so would not require accommodation in that course. If no listening is required, there is no impact of auditory memory, and no inequity of opportunity to learn. Believing that the presence of a condition requires accommodation in and of itself ignores the importance of a nexus between the impairment and the bona fide requirements, or real-life constraints, as well as the feasibility of potential accommodation strategies in various settings.</p>
<list id="list2-0829573512437171" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>2. Policies, services, and systems: The environmental factors of policies, services, and systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0829573512437171">WHO, 2001</xref>) encompasses academic requirements as a form of policy. Academic requirements are a function of instructional goals, chosen methodologies, policies, and systemic requirements. The following example illustrates the importance of policies in determining disability itself and accommodation strategies.</p></list-item></list>
<p>For postsecondary students with learning disabilities to legitimately access the programs and supports offered at the postsecondary level, institutional policies require them to provide acceptable documentation in the form of a psychoeducational assessment or neuropsychological assessment to validate that they do, in fact, have a diagnosed disability. Currently, there is no one definition of “learning disability” that is used consistently by clinicians and implemented universally by institutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0829573512437171">Sparks &amp; Lovett, 2009</xref><italic>)</italic>. Legal definitions of disability refer to a wide range of conditions and impairments but most typically do not delineate a definition of who is disabled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0829573512437171">Harrison &amp; Holmes, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>For instance, the Canada Student Loans Program (CSLP) defines permanent disability as follows:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>A functional limitation caused by a physical or mental impairment that restricts the ability of a person to perform the daily activities necessary to participate in studies at a post-secondary school level or the labour force; and is expected to remain with the person for the person’s expected life. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0829573512437171">Government of Canada, 2009</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This definition exemplifies the functional limitations approach to classifying disabilities, taking into account both the person’s experience of impairment and how it influences the person’s function in the postsecondary environment. In this definition, disability is identified not only in terms of an underlying medical condition but also by the functional limitations caused by impairments. The functional limitations definition adopted by CSLP, while firmly maintaining the role of impairment in defining disability, recognizes that disability may be influenced by external factors, such as how the student participates in activities and the environment. Hence, students must also demonstrate that their specific impairments are causing a functional impact in the educational environment that is permanent in nature.</p>
<p>Herein lies the dilemma. The presence of a diagnosable condition does not necessarily require accommodation or produce a functional limitation in all situations. There is nothing to accommodate if the condition does not compromise the student’s equal opportunity to participate in education. For example, a person may have an underlying SLD in math, dyscalculia. So long as this condition has no impact on the person’s studies in philosophy or literature, there is no disadvantage to accommodate. However, if the dyscalculia interferes with calculation tasks in mapping in geography or surveying land in civil engineering, these functional limitations may require accommodation.</p>
<p>There are times when the requirement itself is entirely well supported and evidenced as necessary, and accommodation would not be appropriate. Students may not be accommodated if a requirement is bona fide and the method involved cannot be altered. In the example of a student with dyscalculia, accommodations may be possible in mapping software programs, but there may not be a feasible accommodation for calculating medication dosages adjusted for body weight during an emergency medical procedure.</p>
<p>The policies, services, and systems factors in the WHO framework captures the way in which social and academic policies influence the need for accommodation.</p>
<list id="list3-0829573512437171" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>3. Products and technology: An equally critical eye must be applied to what products and technologies are relied upon as accommodation strategies. Sometimes, assistive technology is a perfectly appropriate accommodation. In other situations, the reliance on a form of technology may not equal the physical performance of a task, such as reliance on reading or dictation software when the student is in a clinical placement that requires quick and accurate reading or writing of patient information. Hand-held scanners have been suggested as an accommodation, but the accuracy of scanning is affected by the quality of the print scanned. Clinicians’ handwriting, Medic-alert bracelets, stained copies, and damaged labels are just a few examples of print that could not be read reliably by a scanning device. Although such devices may be useful in some settings, they may not be appropriate in all situations. The vast array of products and technologies utilized as accommodations bears another entire chapter, or several. For now, it will suffice to say that sometimes products and technologies present a brilliant solution; other times they may be infeasible because of real-life constraints on the performance of a task.</p></list-item></list>

<title>Human Rights and the Duty to Accommodate</title>
<p>In Canada, antidiscrimination legislation strives to promote equality of opportunity to participate in society and, in this case, in educational institutions. It does not purport to maximize each individual’s success. Human rights legislation seeks only to ensure equal access to the opportunities and resources available at an institution without discrimination on the basis of disability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0829573512437171">Ontario Human Rights Code, 1990a</xref>) or impairment, where the disability or impairment is not essential to the task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0829573512437171">Ontario Human Rights Code, 1990b</xref>). This is why the legal analyses of bona fide requirements focus on what must be achieved, how, and why, more than on quantifying or verifying the individual’s specific condition.</p>
<p>Canadian human rights decisions on accommodation of disability focus on the nature of the required task. Investigations of discrimination in employment settings by various courts and tribunals tend to focus on the task requirements and whether they can be accommodated or not. The focus is not so much on quantifying the impairment but on an examination of the requirements and proposed accommodations (<italic>British Columbia</italic>, 1994; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0829573512437171"><italic>Granovsky</italic>, 2000</xref>; <italic>Meiorin</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0829573512437171">1999</xref>). If one considers the context of the requirement or activity, it is easier to determine appropriate accommodation than by defining various characteristics of people without that context.</p>
<p>In <italic>Granovsky v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration)</italic> the Supreme Court of Canada stated,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>In summary, while the notions of impairment and functional limitation (real or perceived) are important considerations in the disability analysis, the primary focus is on the inappropriate legislative or administrative response (or lack thereof) of the state. Section 15(1) [of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms] is ultimately concerned with human rights and discriminatory treatment, not with biomedical conditions. (para. 39)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>It must be understood that the Charter of Rights and Freedoms has a complex relationship with postsecondary institutions, which will not be fully addressed here. Nonetheless, the principles of equity and equal opportunity enshrined in the Charter do inform the development of provincial human rights legislation, which mandates accommodation by both public and private schools. Thus, we can nonetheless take some guidance from Supreme Court decisions citing the Charter because the analysis is instructive in applying principles to the requirements of higher education. In the above quotation, the “administrative response . . . of the state” is analogous to the administrative and curricular structures and requirements of the institution. One might paraphrase this idea as the “administrative and academic response of the institution,” and in other words, academic requirements. Extrapolating from the court’s comment, antidiscrimination legislation is concerned with equal opportunity, not the quantification of biomedical, or in this case psychological, conditions. So in order to achieve a balance between understanding the condition and designing appropriate accommodation for specific tasks, both must be considered.</p>
<p>Accommodations should equalize the opportunity for the student to compete fairly, to gain and demonstrate knowledge unimpeded by limitations of an impairment that are irrelevant to the academic task at hand. Accommodations are not meant to enhance performance, like performance-enhancing drugs—if only the student had artificially induced advantages, she or he could achieve better marks. Another sports analogy often used in this field has become a cliché; to “level the playing field” is used to describe the objective of accommodations. Accommodations are meant to <italic>level</italic> the playing field between teams or individuals, not tilt it to the student’s advantage or act as insurance against failure. Given a fair chance, with appropriate accommodations, it is up to the student to succeed or fail. Many postsecondary programs derive their mandate from requirements of professional practice or are designed to develop independent scholarship. Both of these origins present strong rationales for the programs’ required activities. These cannot be ignored in implementing accommodations, and after sufficient scrutiny and due consideration, recommendations of clinicians may or may not be incorporated, depending on the nature of the activity and the legitimate, essential requirements of participation. Extra time on tests where no time-related disability exists but where extra time “would benefit the student,” clarification of test questions that becomes too informative, and exemptions from written tests because the student performs better on projects are examples of recommendations that become unfairly advantageous when applied without consideration of the curriculum rationale.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>No consistent definition of what constitutes a disability exists in Canadian jurisprudence, as definitions vary from province to province and definitions of SLDs particularly vary across jurisdictions and in the literature. Many definitions focus on functional limitations, and legal decisions emphasize equality of opportunity. Having considered the role of environmental factors in contributing to the participation or disablement of students with SLD, it is clear that not only the impairment must be carefully analyzed but also the task requirements that present bona fide requirements—naturally occurring, real-life delimiters that cannot be altered to accommodate an impairment. For conditions that are not readily apparent, it is important to quantify the student’s function in order to understand where the gap in equitable opportunity lies. It is also imperative that we “quantify” or analyze the task, in order to build an appropriate bridge to allow for equal participation.</p>
<p>The WHO provides a framework for the environmental analysis with its five Environmental factors. Accommodation is most often an alteration of one of these environmental factors—a change in a policy, procedure, technology, built environment, or method, informed by a change in attitude. As well, human rights legislation as social policy is itself an environmental factors, emphasizing how we construct the environment as contributing to participation or disablement. Human rights decisions have focused on the requirements of the task more than the biomedical or psychological condition to determine discriminatory requirements. Together, the WHO Environmental Factors and legal opinions focusing on the task point toward accommodation that balances both student impairment <italic>and</italic> bona fide task requirements in postsecondary education.</p>
<p>Accommodations are required in postsecondary institutions to allow for equal but not enhanced participation and to ensure equal opportunity but not unfair advantage in demonstrating knowledge and skills. They are not implemented solely to allow for improved performance and may not always be appropriate if specific task demands cannot be altered due to essential or bona fide requirements or where there is no interaction between impairment and task demands.</p>

<p>Throughout this article, Michael Oliver’s use of “disabled person” is employed rather than the current convention of “person with a disability,” to emphasize how the environment disables people, causing them to be marginalized, oppressed, and thereby “disabled” by structures designed without them in mind. Oliver notes that the phrase “person with a disability” locates the disability squarely within the person, instead of in the environmental Factors that keep the person excluded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0829573512437171">Oliver, 1996</xref>). Since task requirements are a Factor of the environment, and we are considering how they exclude students with impairments, this review employs this language form to emphasize the role of requirements in disabling, or enabling, students’ participation.</p>
