<abstract>
<p>This study demonstrates a robust and thorough trial design leading to accurate and objective data collection. We recommend that future studies investigating heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) should follow, and improve upon, this rigorous approach to menstrual trial data collection, not only to validate clinical results but also to improve the techniques used to acquire these results. We propose that the state-of-the-art methodology described here be used as the basis for new guidelines for the implementation of clinical trials in the area of HMB.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) is characterized as any abnormality in the duration of flow, frequency, regularity, and/or blood loss volume relative to “normal,” healthy menstruation.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1933719113477492">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1933719113477492">2</xref>
</sup> As there is a wide range and natural variability between women in terms of their menstrual cycles and blood loss,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1933719113477492">3</xref>
</sup> deviations from what is regarded as “normal”<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1933719113477492">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1933719113477492">4</xref>
</sup> are often subjective. In addition, there are variations in patients’ perceptions and descriptions of their symptoms, meaning that heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) is the physician’s interpretation of the woman’s description of her perception of her total menstrual loss. This can make an accurate, clinical diagnosis of any AUB disorder (such as HMB) difficult and, therefore, appropriate treatment options may, in some cases, be inappropriately explored.</p>
<p>The classification of AUB symptoms is still lacking in common agreement; however, symptom-oriented descriptive terminology, such as HMB, appears to be akin to other poorly defined historical terms.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1933719113477492">5</xref>
</sup> For research purposes, HMB is objectively defined as menstrual blood loss (MBL) of ≥80 mL per cycle.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1933719113477492">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1933719113477492">6</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1933719113477492"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1933719113477492">8</xref>
</sup> In routine clinical practice, use of the definition of HMB, as set out in the current National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines, is recommended and is as follows: “HMB should be defined as excessive menstrual blood loss which interferes with the woman’s physical, emotional, social, and material quality of life, and which can occur alone or in combination with other symptoms. Any interventions should aim to improve quality of life measures.” The HMB is one of the most common symptoms with which women present to obstetricians and gynecologists,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1933719113477492">9</xref>
</sup> with an estimated life prevalence of approximately 30%.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1933719113477492">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1933719113477492">11</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>The HMB is associated with significant morbidity and impacts upon a patient’s health-related quality of life (HRQoL)<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1933719113477492">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1933719113477492">7</xref>
</sup>; there is a demonstrated association between HMB and iron deficiency anemia.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1933719113477492">3</xref>
</sup> The HMB may be secondary to organic pathology such as leiomyomas and underlying hematologic disorders such as von Willebrand disease.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1933719113477492">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1933719113477492">13</xref>
</sup> However, NICE has reported that evidence from 20 observational and diagnostic studies has shown that, in the majority of HMB cases, no underlying uterine pathology could be found.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1933719113477492">3</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>The approaches to treatment of HMB, without organic cause, can be both medical and surgical. Surgical procedures, such as hysterectomy and endometrial ablation, are effective but their associated morbidity and irreversibility means that they are generally reserved for those in whom less invasive, fertility-preserving therapies have failed.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1933719113477492">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1933719113477492">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1933719113477492">14</xref>
</sup> Pharmacologic interventions offer fertility-preserving treatment for HMB and include treatments such as the highly effective levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine devices (IUDs) and less effective drugs such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), antifibrinolytics, cyclical progestogens, and the weak, impeded, androgenic steroid, danazol.<sup>

</sup> “Off-label” use of combined oral contraceptives (COCs) is also widespread, as they have been shown in small or uncontrolled studies to reduce menstrual bleeding by 32% to 43%.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1933719113477492">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1933719113477492">20</xref>

</p>
<p>A novel COC, estradiol valerate and dienogest (E<sub>2</sub>V/DNG), has become the first COC to be formally licensed for the treatment of HMB in countries with major regulatory processes. The efficacy of E<sub>2</sub>V/DNG for the treatment of HMB was assessed in 2 large (n = 421 women), multinational (n = 12 countries), randomized, placebo-controlled trials (clinical trial registration numbers NCT00293059 and NCT00307801).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1933719113477492">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1933719113477492">24</xref>
</sup> During these studies, E<sub>2</sub>V/DNG was objectively shown to significantly reduce median HMB by 88% after 6 months of treatment.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1933719113477492">25</xref>
</sup> The rigorous, innovative methodology that was used to collect and analyze patients’ sanitation material<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1933719113477492">26</xref>
</sup> during both of these trials is presented and discussed herein.</p>
<p>In order to ascertain the clinical efficacy of treatments for HMB comprehensively, a reliable and objective method of quantifying MBL is required. The MBL is defined as the volume of blood that contributes to the total menstrual fluid during a menstrual episode, rather than the total volume of menstrual fluid loss. This is because menstrual fluid is only composed of approximately 30% to 50% blood<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1933719113477492">27</xref>
</sup> and has virtually no clotting activity, with increased levels of tissue plasminogen activator, when compared to circulating blood.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1933719113477492">28</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Techniques that have previously been investigated as a means of quantifying MBL include the use of radioisotopes and pictograms, and the weighing of used sanitary products.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1933719113477492">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1933719113477492">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1933719113477492">30</xref>
</sup> Although radioisotope methods are precise, the laborious and invasive nature of such techniques has hindered their widespread clinical use.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1933719113477492">31</xref>
</sup> Furthermore, weighing measurements do not determine blood loss but rather total menstrual fluid loss, the “make-up” of which is subject to considerable variation between individual patients.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1933719113477492">31</xref>
</sup> However, one study has shown that it is possible to diagnose HMB for clinical purposes by carefully measuring total menstrual fluid loss.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1933719113477492">27</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>To date, the “gold standard” of quantifying MBL remains the spectrophotometric alkaline hematin method, first described by Hallberg and Nilsson in 1964.<sup>

<p>Two Phase III, multicenter (n = 81), multinational (n = 12), double-blind, randomized, parallel-group, placebo-controlled studies assessed the efficacy of E<sub>2</sub>V/DNG in a total of 421 adult women (≥18 years) with HMB with no related organic causality.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1933719113477492">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1933719113477492">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1933719113477492">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1933719113477492">37</xref>
</sup> The primary objective of these studies was to determine the efficacy (overall success) and safety of E<sub>2</sub>V/DNG compared to placebo in patients with HMB. Overall success rate was defined by the number of patients with the absence of any HMB-related symptoms and who met all the relevant criteria for success during the 90-day efficacy assessment phase (defined in collaboration with the United States Food and Drug Administration [FDA] and described herein), compared to the number of patients having at least 1 qualifying HMB-related symptom during the run-in phase (also described herein). Secondary objectives were to determine the efficacy of E<sub>2</sub>V/DNG in relation to individual symptoms of HMB, menstrual bleeding parameters, HRQoL, use of sanitary protection items, and iron metabolism parameters.<sup>

<title>The 90-Day Run-in Phase (Patient Eligibility Confirmation)</title>
<p>Following the screening phase, a 90-day run-in phase (consisting of 3 scheduled visits at days −90, −60, and –30) was used as a rigorous method of further assessing patient eligibility by establishing an accurate diagnosis of HMB. For the purposes of these studies, symptoms of HMB were defined as the occurrence of at least one of the following criteria during the 90-day run-in phase:</p>
<list list-type="simple">
<list-item>
<p>prolonged bleeding: ≥2 bleeding episodes, each lasting ≥8 days;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>frequent bleeding: &gt;5 bleeding episodes, with a minimum of 20 bleeding days overall;</p>
</list-item>

<p>Confirmation of the symptoms of HMB, and of treatment effect on blood loss, was made through the use of both subjective and objective measurements. In order to gain an accurate diagnosis of HMB in the absence of structural or systemic pathology, patients underwent detailed transvaginal ultrasound scans to exclude structural pelvic pathology. Endometrial biopsies were also performed, and samples were collected for routine histologic analysis. In addition, blood tests were taken for assessment by coagulation screen.</p>
<p>Women were provided with sanitary protection comprising 11 different products (5 types of tampon and 6 types of pad) that had previously been validated for their personal use during the course of the study. This was done to maintain and establish quality control. Calibration curves were calculated for tampons and sanitary pads (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1933719113477492">Figure 2</xref>) with lower limits of quantification for each type of sanitary product established.</p>

<p>Before MBL could be measured, the significant challenge of developing and implementing a suitable logistical system for the collection of used sanitary items, as well as their temporary storage and shipment to central laboratories, had to be overcome. With this in mind, patients were instructed to collect all of their used sanitary protection items separately for assessment. Used sanitary protection items were stored in self-sealing plastic bags, and women were carefully instructed in techniques designed to minimize inadvertent loss of blood down the toilet or in the shower. Written instructions of how to collect, store, and deliver used sanitary protection items to local study centers were given to patients during their first study visit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1933719113477492">Figure 3</xref>).</p>

<title>Subjective Measurement of MBL</title>
<p>During the 90-day run-in phase, patients were supplied with e-diaries (Palm Pilots with Invivodata software, Palm Inc, California) and were trained in how to use them. Patient assessment of bleeding, through the completion of e-diaries, was used to evaluate the prolonged and frequent bleeding elements of HMB. E-diaries were maintained on a daily basis to record the number of bleeding episodes (defined as bleeding for ≥2 days, separated by no more than 1 bleeding-free day), the number of bleeding days per episode (defined as a day on which sanitary protection was required), the number and type of sanitary protection items used, and any HMB symptoms that patients experienced. Patients were asked to assess the intensity of their bleeding using the following criteria:</p>
<list list-type="simple">
<list-item>
<p>none = no vaginal bleeding;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>spotting = less than associated with normal menstruation relative to the patient’s experience; only panty liners were required;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>light = less than associated with normal menstruation relative to the patient’s experience but with the need for sanitary protection;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>normal = like normal menstruation relative to the patient’s experience;</p>

<p>heavy = more than normal menstruation relative to the patient’s experience.</p>

</list>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1933719113477492">
<title>Objective Measurement of MBL</title>
<p>In addition to scheduled study visits, patients deposited their used sanitary protection items at their local study investigator’s office on a regular basis for shipment to Laboratorium für Klinische Forschung (LKF) in Germany or the Specialty Laboratories/Clinical Trials in the USA. Used sanitary protection items were placed in plastic bags and then into screw-capped, airtight, plastic protection containers, which were then stored on cooling elements in special storage packages made of Styrofoam. If away from home, patients could store up to 8 items in a special rubber handbag containing precooled packs. Study physicians collated sanitary items and stored them prior to shipment to the central laboratory. Both central laboratories provided objective evaluation of MBL volumes for each patient across the entire study population for the duration of the study.</p>
<p>After delivery of the soiled sanitary protection items to the laboratories, the containers holding these items were unscrewed in laboratory hoods, thus minimizing the exposure of gaseous menstrual degradation products to the surrounding environment. The used pads or tampons were then directly transferred into airtight plastic bags (Seward Ltd, Norfolk, United Kingdom) prefilled with 500 mL extraction solution for tampons or 1000 mL extraction solution for pads; the extraction solution was composed of Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Missouri) dissolved in distilled water (final concentration 0.2%). Menstrual fluid was extracted from the sanitary protection items by washing them in a Stomacher 3500 (Seward Ltd) for 15 minutes. A 5-mL aliquot of the extraction solution was then removed and centrifuged at 6000 g for 15 minutes before undergoing analysis for hemoglobin levels.</p>
<p>Prior to spectrophotometric analysis, the oxyhemoglobin contained within each sample was converted to methemoglobin by mixing 600-µL menstrual fluid extract with 150 µL sodium hydroxide (1 mol/L). The amount of hemoglobin extracted from each individual’s prevalidated, used sanitary protection item was calculated by measuring the optical density of methemoglobin in a spectrophotometer at 546 nm. In order to calculate blood loss, this value was cross-referenced against the preconstructed calibration curve of the respective sanitary item.</p>
<p>Calibration curves were generated by assessing the ability of each of the 11 sanitary protection products to absorb and release increasing amounts of blood, tested with an expired stored blood. After washing of the items, the amount of hemoglobin added to a sanitary product was related to the absorbency at 546 nm of the extract for each brand, resulting in brand-specific calibration curves. For pads and tampons, all calibration curves showed a high degree of linearity but, for pads alone, the intercepts were different. Therefore, for all tampon brands, a common calibration could be used but, for pads, brand-specific curves had to be generated. The calibration curve for tampons is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1933719113477492">Figure 4</xref>.</p>

<title>Quality Control</title>
<p>The method described above for objectively measuring MBL was comprehensively optimized and validated prior to carrying out the Phase III study. Menstrual fluid extraction times with the Stomacher 3500, the concentration of Triton X-100 used in the extraction solution, and the dynamic range of the spectrophotometer for a reliable calculation of the concentration of hemoglobin were all optimized. Recovery of blood from sanitary items was found to be &gt;90% for all products used. The lower limit of hemoglobin quantification was found to vary between 8 mg (for tampons) and 204 mg for Kotex Overnight Pads (Kimberly-Clark Corporation, Neenah, Wisconsin), corresponding to approximately 70 µL and 1.8 mL of whole blood, respectively.</p>
<p>The intra-assay coefficient of variation (CV) of the entire method for objectively measuring MBL was 1.7% for Camelia Maxi Pads (Kimberly-Clark Worldwide, Inc) spiked with 1.12 g hemoglobin, and 2.6% when spiked with 0.42 g hemoglobin (n = 10). In a similar experiment with 10 o.b. Super Plus tampons (McNeil-PPC, Inc., Fort Washington, Pennysylvania) the CV was found to be 15.6% (when the mean loading of hemoglobin was 70 mg), 5.6% (with a mean loading of 210 mg hemoglobin), and 1.8% (with a mean loading of 560 mg hemoglobin).</p>

<title>Behind the Scenes: The Researcher Experience</title>
<p>The main goal of our work was to design a procedure that was as pleasant and straightforward as possible for all participants involved, from the collection, storage, and shipment of the sanitary material by the patients/trial sites, to the analytical processing of the items at the laboratory. Since the decay of menstrual discharge during collection and shipment produces an unpleasant odor, we created an almost entirely closed system to help reduce exposure to this unpleasant by-product. This was achieved by instructing patients to immediately wrap their used sanitary protection items in plastic bags and put them into tightly closed plastic cup-like beakers, which were only opened under laboratory hoods. Without prior removal of the plastic wraps, sanitary protection items were dipped directly into the hemoglobin extraction solution, which had already been added to the plastic bags that were placed into the Stomacher 3500 for maceration. Using this method, soiled sanitary protection items had minimal contact with the environment and, thus, exposure of study participants and laboratory staff to the unpleasant odors caused by the bacterial degradation of menstrual fluid was minimized.</p>
<p>In contrast to the original hematin method, the technique described here does not require the hemoglobin absorbed into the sanitary protection items to be solubilized using highly concentrated (5 mol/L) sodium hydroxide. Instead, this harmful and caustic extraction solution used in earlier methods<sup>

</sup> was replaced by the harmless, neutral detergent, Triton X-100. Only small amounts of sodium hydroxide were needed to convert oxyhemoglobin to methemoglobin (hematin, for the purpose of photometric analysis), which was done just prior to carrying out absorption measurements.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study has several novel elements that add to its robust design. During the rigorous run-in, pretreatment phase, patients were prescreened for study eligibility, ensuring that only a carefully characterized group of patients fulfilling one of the required criteria for HMB were entered into the treatment phase. To our knowledge, the stringent set of study criteria that were used to define a “complete response” to therapy constitute the most rigorous set of response criteria to be used in any HMB treatment trial to date. The advantages of setting such a stringent set of eligibility and response criteria (developed in conjunction with the US FDA) were that only women who truly had a symptom of HMB were included in the study, and only women who truly responded to E<sub>2</sub>V/DNG were considered “full responders”.</p>
<p>This study also represents the first time that measurements of menstrual fluid hemoglobin have been made on such a large scale, both in terms of the vast numbers of sanitary products collected and the large size of the study population that included 1652 screened women and 421 randomized women at 81 centers in 12 countries across 3 continents (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1933719113477492">Figure 6</xref>). Measurements were also made over an extended period of time (10 months), which further strengthened the study design. Only one central laboratory was used for the menstrual assays in each of the 2 trials. Our method for collecting and storing the large quantities of used sanitary protection items ensured that all study participants (including patients, investigators and laboratory staff) had minimal exposure to the unpleasant gaseous by-products of menstrual fluid degradation. Indeed, all study participants gave positive feedback regarding the collection procedure used to obtain and store the used sanitary protection items that were collected throughout the course of this study.</p>

<p>Our method for objectively measuring MBL was optimized and rigorously tested prior to carrying out each Phase III study. The lack of a need for large volumes of highly caustic hemoglobin extraction solution meant that laboratory staff had a lower risk of exposure to highly toxic chemicals. In addition, the construction of calibration curves for calculating the objective volume of MBL in relation to the mean quantity of hemoglobin extracted from each brand of used sanitary protection item meant that our method for calculating MBL was robust and efficient. The precise nature of this method was reflected by the low intra-assay CV of 1.7% for the entire method (a CV of ≤10% was set as an indication that the method was precise).</p>
<p>We believe that the design of this study ensured that the most accurate measures available were used to assess the efficacy of E<sub>2</sub>V/DNG versus placebo. E-diaries are useful tools for collecting patients’ data. However, their use is associated with the risk of missing data due to occasional noncompliance with keeping daily diary entries and the potential for electronic devices to malfunction.</p>
<p>An interesting consequence of the rigorous “used sanitary item collection method” employed in this study is apparent in the clinical response that some women experienced to placebo (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1933719113477492">Figure 5</xref>). We hypothesize that the reason why some women using placebo experienced a reduction in MBL may be due to a phenomenon we have come to describe as “collection fatigue”. The highly demanding process of collecting used sanitary items (over many months with no perceived reduction in MBL during their therapy) may have led some study participants (particularly those affected by heavy bleeding episodes) to become demotivated with the apparent lack of treatment efficacy. This may in turn have led these patients to cease efficient collection and shipping of all of their used sanitary items. This would lead to an overreporting of response rates and is likely to affect the placebo group disproportionately.<sup>

</p>
<p>This study demonstrates a robust and thorough trial design leading to accurate and rigorous data collection. We recommend that future studies investigating HMB should follow, and improve upon, this rigorous method of data collection, which will not only assist with validating clinical results, but should also lead to improvements in the techniques used to acquire them. In conclusion, we propose this state-of-the-art methodology be used as a basis for new guidelines for the implementation of clinical trials in the area of HMB.</p>
