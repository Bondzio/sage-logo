<title>‘Mister, are you a drifter?’</title>
<p>‘Mister, are you a drifter?’ two ten year old boys ask a man in his early 50s. They have often seen him wandering around their area, and his appearance intrigued them. Always in a hat, with a fat cigar in his mouth, a pockmarked face, black jeans and heavy boots. The question has given the boys a lot to think about and to deliberate. The man, visibly delighted, answered ‘no, I’m not a drifter, I’m Ben and I live round here’. </p>
<p>This actually happened a few years ago to Ben Valkenburg, until early 2012 a member of the <italic>Transfer</italic> Editorial Committee who also worked at Utrecht University in the Netherlands. Ben Valkenburg died on 13 October last year at the age of 61. He was a remarkable person as a man, an academic, a colleague, a friend, and as a member of the <italic>Transfer</italic> Editorial Committee. He was a child of the ’60s who enjoyed a lot of earthly pleasures in life, but equally well enjoyed ‘feeling good about feeling bad’. Ben had a good sense of humour, was very patient and was razor-sharp in analysing questions and getting straight to the nub of the matter. He did this on a personal level, in analysing political and social processes, and also in linking theory and practice. He was able to explain complex social scientific theories to the kids next door, but also to analyse everyday actions and translate them into conceptual frameworks and theories, giving one-off, contextual factors a wider value. </p>
<p>Despite the fact that Ben Valkenburg had a lovely house, was happily married to his wife Anita and was in many ways a home-bird, in other ways he really did seem like a drifter. He refused to be governed by other people’s demands and values, in everyday life, at the university and in the trade union movement. He was always active in many different areas at once, and his mind certainly would not be pinned down or pigeon-holed, but he took a holistic view, in his academic thinking and actions and in his political and personal mindset. Ben spent years carrying out research in the union movement, but also spent many years away from it, all because of views and approaches that he did or did not agree with. He also had a permanent love-hate relationship with Utrecht University. For years this university gave him the opportunity, as a member of a specific, distinct research group and department, to conduct action research in which science and practice were treated as equals in an emancipatory way. At the same time, however, this research group was constantly fighting for survival and had to stand its ground in an academic environment where empirical analytical thinking dominated, many people did not accept pluriformity in academic approaches as taken for granted, and there was a massive focus on mono-disciplinarity. In the period from 2005 to 2006 the research group was disbanded as part of a reorganization and Utrecht University became a smaller and smaller part of Ben’s life. Since then he increasingly sought inspiration and enjoyment outside the university.</p>
<p>In the following paragraphs we identify some of the central pillars that always guided Ben’s work and thinking and which he himself helped to shape. </p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1024258913481295">
<title>Inside and outside the union movement</title>
<p>At the start of his academic career Ben’s research mainly focused on trade unionism as a social movement, and with good reason: in the 1970s and 1980s the unions in the Netherlands were very much on the move. There was a lot of talk about and experimentation with new forms of countervailing power in businesses and institutions, based on the active participation of union members and activists. Democracy and emancipation were the key concepts here.</p>
<p>Ben supported this drive wholeheartedly. As he saw it, the unions had an important role to play in bringing about a shift in existing power relations and in giving people more opportunities to take action in the field of labour and social security. His basic idea here was that unequal balances of power are created in interactions between people and in the meanings, rules and power relationships that these (re)produce. The people involved tend to perpetuate these balances of power and relationships themselves, but are also able to change them. Awareness of one’s own patterns of action and the development of new patterns here pave the way for change and social development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1024258913481295">Giddens, 1982</xref>; Coenen, 1987, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1024258913481295">2012</xref>). There was an obvious link with broader social developments: if people can give their work and lives meaning individually and collectively, this has direct repercussions on how society as a whole operates.</p>
<p>In the first instance Ben worked on a sizeable number of research projects in various sections of the union movement. Time and time again he ran up against the internal operation of the movement itself. The unions might be urging or demanding that employers and government should give people greater scope to act, but within the union movement itself this was happening less and less. The existing centralist practices dominated: union officials were not accustomed to take the views and situation of members and activists as the starting point of their own actions. Where research into union participation identified this as a problem, many officials with responsibility here did not seem to be willing and/or able to reflect on their own behaviour, much less change it. The result was that the policy pursued by the various unions was still not based on the day-to-day practice of workers and thus gave members and activists little practical help in actively tackling these problems, so that they tended to feel let down by the union movement and gave up active participation.</p>
<p>Having encountered this vicious circle on a number of occasions in the course of his research, Ben decided it was time to consider the position of trade unionism on a more fundamental level. He did just that in his dissertation ‘Participatie in sociale bewegingen’ [‘Participation in social movements’], which took as its central question ‘How can we introduce a particular concept of democracy in social practice? This concept must give people the opportunity to articulate their own problems, views and wishes not just once, but over the long term, and to relate these to (ideas about) broader social developments … There can only be said to be democracy if principles of reciprocity, equality and volubility are done justice in discussion and decision-making processes.’ (1995, p. vii) In his dissertation he drew empirically on the research he had been involved in, and, on a theoretical level, on the social theory concepts of Beck and Giddens in particular. He thus looked at the question of the participation of trade union members, activists and officials in the context of the reflexive modernization of semi-modern society. Relevant actors from the trade union movement can change society by acting in a different, more participatory way in the context in which they operate. In other words, participation is both a prerequisite for and a result of the modernization of trade unionism. If people are to be able to continue playing an emancipatory role within the trade unions and, from within the unions, in society, a reflexive attitude is a prerequisite, as well as being prepared to enter into reciprocal dialogue. Ben concludes that this sort of new action is certainly possible, but that his research also shows that it demands a lot of the actors involved. It is not for nothing that he headed his final paragraph ‘On optimism and pessimism’: in principle emancipatory reform through participation within the trade unions is possible, but they have to decide to go down this route. Given the centralist reflexes within trade unionism in The Netherlands there may be question marks about the enthusiasm for reform and the chances of achieving it.</p>
<p>Pessimism about the need to modernize trade unionism was confirmed by the movement’s reaction to Ben’s analysis, which was either severely criticized or simply ignored. The FNV (Dutch Trade Union Confederation) even officially questioned Ben’s involvement in editing <italic>Transfer</italic>. Ben’s response to this was twofold: first, he stopped conducting empirical research with the trade unions in the Netherlands, and second, he became very engaged in the debate on trade unionism conducted by <italic>Transfer’s</italic> editorial board.</p>

<title>An individual, demand-driven approach</title>
<p>In the last 15 years Ben’s research work mainly concentrated on the modelling and development of new social and labour market policy in the Netherlands. His key focus was on developing an individual, demand-driven approach to social policy, based on the idea that labour market policy and methods for helping people further have to start from the people concerned. If people are to be given greater help it is vital to find a connection with them. This involves identifying and establishing a connection with ‘who’ someone is, with the person as a human being. Each person is unique, with his or her own background and own path through life. Finding a connection here means reading who someone is not from your own perspective (as policy-maker, professional or researcher), but from the perspective of the person concerned. This requires close cooperation and connection. It also places considerable demands on the contact and relationship of trust with the person. An individual, demand-driven approach is also systematically rooted in people’s strengths and potential, so that people’s ‘limitations’ are viewed differently and translated into qualities and opportunities. It is all about putting people in charge of their own lives. This is not just a positive approach, it is also the most important success factor for social policy and its outcomes. Only when people are offered the choices that they themselves would choose to have will those choices be accepted, even in difficult times. </p>
<p>On the basis of these key principles Ben made a number of important contributions to the further development of an individual, demand-driven approach as a paradigm, providing an integrated body of points of view, principles, concepts and experiences that determine how we look at social context, government policy and how it is interpreted by the organizations implementing it, and the methods used in the primary process of social policy. The key here is to envisage a three-way client relationship as a way of attempting to tune the logic of individual citizens, the government and the market. The institutional logic of the government and its services is often difficult to reconcile with the logic of individual citizens and that of the market. Relating and connecting these logics lays the foundations for a sustainable democratic society. Following this approach through to the various dimensions and levels involved was one of Ben’s great passions and strengths. </p>
<p>In the field of method development for Job Coaching/Supported Employment Ben worked for many years with Marianne Coenen-Hanegraaf. Together they developed a coherent method for professionals who help people to find jobs and support them in work. A revised version of this method appeared just a few weeks before he died: <italic>Begeleid Werken</italic>. <italic>Trajectontwikkeling op basis van een individuele, vraaggerichte benadering</italic> (2012) [‘Supported employment. Development of a road map based on an individual, demand-driven approach’]. This method translates the vision and principles described earlier into a coherent model for integrating people in the labour market and developing their employability. It sheds light on how the different logics of the various actors (client, employer, government) can be related to each other. The method provides a set of practical instruments for empowering people (with or without disabilities) on the regular labour market. This not only helps to emancipate people, but also helps to create economic value. The method is seen as the main quality standard in the world of Job Coaching and is what the occupational profile of a Job Coach is based on. </p>

<title>Exemplarian action research</title>
<p>Ben used exemplarian action reseach in his work and by doing so helped to develop this as a research method. He was a member of the Employment and Awareness Research Unit at Utrecht University, which aimed to use its academic work to help to bring about social change and to emancipate those living in oppression. The dissertation ‘Exemplarisch handelingsonderzoek’ [‘Exemplarian action research’] by Harry Coenen, the professor leading the research unit, appeared in 1987. Exemplarian action research is an alternative to the existing empirical analytical model. The key elements of action research are the emancipation goals mentioned earlier and the pursuit of change which brings that emancipation closer (which means explicitly leaving value-free science behind), the desire for insight into people’s daily actions and their complexity, and the pursuit of a reciprocal relationship between the researcher and his subjects (referred to as co-researchers) in order to build the most adequate possible picture of social reality. At Utrecht University, where social sciences are heavily dominated by the orthodox consensus, these ideas were seen as heresy, and the Research Unit had to fight to be able to apply these principles when conducting the corresponding research and developing theories. Although action research attracted growing attention internationally and outside Dutch universities, this was not the case at Utrecht. After Harry Coenen’s death the research unit was disbanded in the very next reorganization and Ben too sought refuge elsewhere. This did not stop him continuing to work on action research, not just in his work on social security and the labour market, but also, in his last months, in updating and editing Harry’s dissertation with Marianne Coenen-Hanegraaf. </p>
