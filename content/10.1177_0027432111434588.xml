<p>Singers are sometimes plagued by an ongoing sense of anxiety that has the potential to negatively affect their work. This article addresses the issue of chronic anxiety as distinct from the more frequently considered topic of performance anxiety. Strategies are outlined to help teachers identify and address this problem in to order to help developing singers reach their full potential.</p>

<p>Singers can learn strategies to help them face their fears and free themselves of much of the anxiety of performing.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The great philosopher and teacher Jiddu Krishnamurti identifies fear as “one of the greatest problems in life.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0027432111434588">1</xref></sup> He describes aspects of human experience that foster fearful response, such as the tendency to compare oneself to others, a habit that may lead to feelings of chronic anxiety. He also discusses the debilitating intractability that may result when a mind is caught in a cycle of fear. While fear issues affect all performing artists to some degree, singers, whose instrument is contained within the body itself, may be particularly plagued by an ongoing sense of anxiety that has the potential to negatively affect their work. Established artists, even those at the pinnacle of their profession, have been known to describe bouts of painful stage fright at various points in their careers. The phenomenon of performance anxiety has been studied in detail, and treatments, such as cognitive behavior therapy, have been successfully applied. Less acknowledged are the chronic and sometimes hidden battles with fear that plague many singers on a day-to-day basis and prevent them from fully experiencing and enjoying a musical life.</p>
<p>Fear is a response to perceived danger, and it is safe to say that singers face a degree of risk every time they open their mouths to vocalize. The statement “I’m scared” is not at all uncommon in the voice studio or in group situations, such as chorus or voice class. When a teacher encourages a student to sing with more gusto or to take a vocal exercise a bit higher, a student will often express genuine trepidation. Recurring struggles with fear may hinder singers as they attempt to conquer technical problems and establish lasting patterns of artistic success. Such individuals may also be reluctant to participate enthusiastically in group singing experiences and related activities. A significant challenge for teachers is to identify students who struggle with fear issues and to assist them in managing these problems. Attentive teachers can adjust their teaching style and expectations so as to encourage these singers to manage their anxiety and develop the trust-in-self that is so crucial to effective performance.</p>
<sec id="section1-0027432111434588">
<title>When Singers Fear</title>
<p>Fear is not all bad. If there were no fear, a person might enter into potentially dangerous situations without a proper degree of caution and concern. A certain amount of healthy fear inspires a musician to stay on top of important issues, such as the role that adequate preparation plays in performance success. Although occasional expressions of passing fear are completely normal and to be expected, chronic problems develop when patterns of fearful response begin to shape a singer’s production, leading to habits that are detrimental to healthy vocalism. These habits may have an impact on a wide range of vocal issues, such as intonation, tonal freedom and steadiness, and breath management. In his book <italic>Singing, Acting, and Movement in Opera</italic>, author Mark Ross Clark notes that of “particular concern for musicians is the finding that fear causes subjects in hearing tests to be unable to make fine distinctions in pitch; the subtleties of muscle coordination required to sing or play are diminished with fear.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0027432111434588">2</xref></sup> Fear has the potential to limit a singer’s ability to manage his or her own body and vocal mechanism and to create an ongoing sense of failure.</p>
<p>Patterns of fearful response may begin to establish themselves early in a singer’s development. Many students experience singing first in a chorus or other group situation. The benefits of this collaborative experience are well documented: choral singing has the potential to enhance a developing singer’s musical skills and to foster a deep and abiding appreciation of music. For some singers, however, the choral experience can plant the seeds of chronic anxiety. In adolescence, young people’s voices tend to mature at vastly different rates. In considering this reality, choral conductor Kristen Eby states,</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>If a young singer is surrounded by more developed voices, there can be a temptation for that student to oversing or develop a false vibrato through mimicry. If a mature voice is singing with a less mature choir, there can be a tendency to undersing in order to match the quieter sound. This can inhibit free and natural tone.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0027432111434588">3</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Similar challenges may confront the young singer who happens to possess an unusually resonant voice or otherwise unique vocal timbre. The desire to assimilate at this age can be powerful. If a singer’s developmental issues or unusual vocal quality make him or her stand out in some way, that young person may experience a fearful response and begin to overcompensate by making choices that have long-term negative consequences. A teacher attuned to these unhealthy behavioral patterns can make adjustments to part assignments and/or to physical placement within a chorus in order to help singers participate in a more productive way.</p>
<p>For both solo and choral singers, the negative impacts of fear can be cumulative. A series of bad singing experiences may serve to magnify a singer’s fearful response. For example, if critical evaluation causes a young singer to worry too much about intonation, he or she may develop a minor panic response at the prospect of singing out of tune. In an effort to alleviate the fearful response, the singer may develop the habit of tightening muscles around the larynx in hopes of clarifying intonation. While this type of muscular manipulation may give the singer a greater sense of control, such behavior will usually exacerbate technical problems and create setbacks, leading him or her down a path that is antithetical to buoyant and healthy singing. As the panic response becomes more and more ingrained, it becomes increasingly difficult to find a solution to the problem.</p>

<title>Practice Makes Perfect</title>
<p>Singers are constantly told that to be successful, they must conquer their vocal challenges, present themselves in a marketable way, and achieve an extraordinary degree of polish. It is no wonder that some singers become fixated with perfectionism. The dictum “practice makes perfect” has much to offer in terms of inspiring adequate preparation and polish. Taken to an extreme, however, this simple and familiar bit of advice has the potential to become a catalyst to fear. In the book <italic>Embracing the Fear</italic>, Judith Bemis and Amr Barrada note that “perfectionism plays a large part in laying the groundwork for anxiety problems.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0027432111434588">4</xref></sup> The authors outline the types of debilitating “self-talk” that may occur when people establish unrealistic expectations for themselves. Singers with this problem tend to be highly self-critical and often develop the habit of overanalyzing each and every sound that comes out of their mouths. A pattern ensues in which the person is rarely satisfied and tends to inwardly berate himself or herself for the perceived inability to achieve the desired level of perfection. If a student becomes too focused on producing the perfect high note or on winning first place in a competition, such perfectionism may lead to anxiety when things do not go as planned. This type of student is often identified by a tendency toward excessively harsh self-criticism or a somewhat obsessive approach to practice and preparation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0027432111434588">
<title>A Highly Competitive Pursuit</title>
<p>The singing voice is an integral part of self-identity for musicians who sing. Even at its most fundamental level, the highly personal nature of the singing art makes it a competitive undertaking. Krishnamurti observes that chronic fear issues may arise from the tendency of people to compare themselves to others.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0027432111434588">5</xref></sup> Anxiety develops when a person is constantly worried that he or she may come up short in terms of expertise or facility in contrast to other singers. Just as human nature causes people to compare their looks to those around them, so do singers inevitably compare their voices to those of peers and, perhaps even more destructively, to those of leading artists. In this digital age, it is easy for developing singers to choose exquisitely edited studio recordings of their favorite singers as benchmarks for their own success. Such comparisons are usually impossible to live up to and may serve to exacerbate anxiety issues. When a young tenor becomes obsessed with a once-in-a-century voice like that of Pavarotti, the comparison may engender healthy enthusiasm but may also have a negative impact on that singer’s vision of himself.</p>
<p>The late Richard Miller, one of America’s most eminent vocal pedagogues, noted in his book <italic>On the Art of Singing</italic>, “If a singer writhes inwardly at beautiful sound from a singer in his or her <italic>Fach</italic>, or gleefully notes what has not gone well for a colleague on stage, that same singer is likely to perceive the audience as the enemy when he or she is the performer.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0027432111434588">6</xref></sup> An audience viewed as an enemy is a perceived danger, and fear is often the result. The inclination to compare oneself to others may lead to problems within the microcosm of the voice studio, in the larger classroom, or in the choral environment. Collaborative singing may inspire an excessive competitive response in much the same way that sporting activities sometimes do. The desire to produce the grandest sound or garner a teacher’s acknowledgement can lead singers to compare themselves to each other in unhealthy ways. Likewise, a voice or studio class meeting can turn into a breeding ground for excessive competition with possible negative results for singers.</p>
<p>Even in large-group situations, an intuitive teacher can identify harshly competitive interactions between students. By intervening in these types of situations in a way that leads to mutual support and acknowledges the unique nature of each participant’s contribution, a teacher will take an important step toward diminishing stress for class participants. Such efforts may be awkward at times because they require the teacher to challenge individuals who tend to minimize the accomplishment of others as well as those whose self-criticism is a detriment to progress. In acknowledging an outstanding singer’s contribution to a choir or voice studio, a teacher may inspire other students and provide an important role model for future development. It is important, however, not to choose words that pit one student against another or potentially trigger a fearful response in students whose contribution may, at that moment, be less noteworthy. An ongoing effort to establish an atmosphere of collegiality and trust will offer untold benefits for both teacher and students alike.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0027432111434588">
<title>An Aversion to Criticism</title>
<p>Even the most talented young singer will experience aspects of the vocal production that lead to insecurity—be it a tenor’s <italic>passaggio</italic> or a young soprano’s unstable middle voice. No matter how diligently a teacher strives to choose words that inspire rather than discourage, teaching inevitably involves the offering of feedback about aspects of a student’s performance that are less than optimal. Singers also receive criticism from a range of other sources, such as conductors, competition judges, and even their friends and peers. A student may develop an aversion to criticism if he or she begins to interpret criticism as a personal threat. Symptoms of this behavior may appear as an unwillingness to try new things or an inclination to challenge a teacher’s suggestions and analysis. Singers struggling with fear issues often develop a range of excuses as a means of avoiding risk. A student may claim that he or she does not understand the teacher or that the voice is unresponsive in spite of his or her best efforts.</p>
<p>When criticism is deemed necessary, it may be helpful to seek feedback from students to determine whether information is perceived as threatening. This type of give-and-take can be beneficial in both one-on-one and group interactions with singers. Time spent discussing and explaining the importance of constructive criticism and the positive intent with which it is provided may help to instill trust and limit a student’s tendency to fear criticism. If a singer receives harsh criticism from other sources (a competition judge, for example), an effort to analyze and understand the comments can help the student begin to embrace rather than avoid criticism. Students and teachers can work together to make the vocal studio or classroom a “safe zone” where it is possible to try new things without fear of hurtful criticism or too great a perception of risk. The occasional unattractive sound is not taken too seriously and is discussed in a way that does not inhibit the singer. As students begin to accept the reality that criticism is and will always be a component of their work, they are laying the groundwork for self-acceptance and positive growth.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0027432111434588">
<title>Identifying and Challenging Negative Self-Talk</title>
<p>Krishnamurti writes that “a mind that is caught in fear lives in confusion. . . . It dare not move away from its own patterns of thinking.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0027432111434588">7</xref></sup> Learning to sing is paradoxical in that it requires a significant degree of self-analysis while, at the same time, demanding of the artist the ability to let go and take risks. When self-analysis turns into excessive self-criticism, a pattern of negative self-talk and fear may be the outcome. A teacher may find it useful to specifically challenge the patterns of negative self-talk that a student displays. For example, when a student argues that the voice will not respond, the teacher may counter with a statement such as “Your voice will respond if you are willing to take a risk and give up some control of the process. Try to confront your fear and your tendency to tell yourself that you cannot do this.”</p>
<p>In a group situation, singers often give visual cues that they are under stress, in much the same way that they do in the private voice studio. A singer who is troubled by his or her inability to produce the perfect sound may demonstrate significant physical discomfort when attempting to sing. This might appear as excessive tension in the face, neck, or body even before a sound is emitted as the singer breathes to sing or at the tonal onset. A singer struggling with these issues may simply appear to be frustrated or afraid. Helping singers identify and address physical tension and stress is important and is time well spent in any setting. Equally important may be the establishment of a dialogue that allows students to verbalize the concerns and fears that cause their discomfort. When class or rehearsal time constraints make this type of interaction difficult, a private meeting with a student who exhibits significant physical stress can provide an opportunity to identify and address negative self-talk issues.</p>
<p>While much can be accomplished by helping students identify and confront their fear-induced responses, it may also be the case that a given singer’s problems are larger in scope than can be dealt with between student and teacher. This type of student may reveal a degree of self-criticism and negativity that seems abnormal. If a student appears to struggle with anxiety and/or panic attacks in ways that impact many aspects of his or her life, it may be important for a teacher to advise the student to seek professional guidance.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0027432111434588">
<title>Objective Self-Appraisal and the Honoring of the Unique</title>
<p>In the highly competitive world of singing, it can be challenging for a student to grasp his or her unique place in the grand scheme of things. Krishnamurti notes that “one of the major causes of fear is that we do not want to face ourselves as we are.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0027432111434588">8</xref></sup> If a singer is caught in a cycle of fear, it can be especially difficult to arrive at an objective self-analysis of his or her abilities. Even singers with limited resources have aspects of their work that make them special. One student may be particularly accomplished at the use of language and have a strong ability to convey textual meaning. Another student may display an unusually plaintive tone quality that makes the voice instantly recognizable. A teacher does a great service to a student by helping that individual recognize and honor that which is singular about his or her work. If a developing singer begins to embrace the unique aspects of his or her gifts, that singer is less likely to feel threatened by the talents of others. Technical obstacles may seem less important and perhaps even less daunting if they are seen in the larger perspective of what a performer has to offer. If time allows, feedback from colleagues in a choir or voice/studio class environment can be a powerful confidence builder. A young singer who is told by peers that his or her unique timbre or sensitive music making has inspired them may process the affirmation in a way that counteracts a tendency toward fearful response.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0027432111434588">
<title>Success as an Antidote to Fear</title>
<p>When a singer experiences success, fearful responses are gradually replaced by a degree of self-assurance. Such events may be as informal as a well-performed solo in front of classroom peers or success in a more public venue. Writing several centuries ago, the Italian vocal pedagogue Pietro Francesco Tosi encouraged the student singer to perform often, and by “gradually losing his fear, he may acquire an Assurance, but not boldness. Assurance leads to a Fortune, and in a singer, becomes a merit. On the contrary, the Fearful is most unhappy. . . . A timorous singer is unhappy, like a Prodigal, who is miserably poor.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0027432111434588">9</xref></sup> For a student struggling with fear issues, achieving consistent ease of production may take time. Performance anxiety can trigger old patterns of fearful response and cause old habits to reappear. By offering students a degree of understanding and patience, a teacher can help them find the courage to try again and gradually begin to overcome the obstacles that prevent ongoing success.</p>
<p>When student and teacher successfully challenge fear, the results can be dramatic. A struggling singer’s unruly vibrato may begin to settle, or a high note that seemed out of reach may be produced with comfort for the first time. A chorister may experience, as never before, the true joy of collaborative music making. An unafraid singer is better able to concentrate and is therefore more attuned to the learning process. He or she is able to explore a wider range of options in the effort to free the voice and sing with the necessary degree of healthy abandon. Most important, freedom from fear allows a singer to reconnect with the joy that originally sparked his or her interest in the vocal art. While the act of singing will never be completely risk-free, it does not have to be oppressive. Helping singers free themselves from fear allows them to sing with a newfound confidence and, in time, may lead them to discover their own unique place in this most demanding of art forms.</p>
