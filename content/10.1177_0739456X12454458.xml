<p>Planning students seeking interdisciplinary, skill building experiences with real-life projects may not always be satisfied with university-based studio courses. Studios generally offer limited exposure to project selection, initiation, and task scoping. A student organization at Cornell University is challenging the standard studio format and forcing faculty to reflect on the needs of students who seek experiential learning outside of the studio course and general curriculum. This article examines the activities of an organization called DesignConnect and what growing interest in this club implies. We recommend a methodical evaluation to determine whether such organizations can extend existing curriculum-based learning opportunities.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Planning students are exposed to the demands of future work environments, in part, through university-sponsored studio courses. Studio instructors facilitate the exercise with advance logistical preparations including that of securing a client. Within the classroom, the instructor plays multiple roles—including teacher, coach, and project manager—to help create and streamline a productive and thoughtful process with a final deliverable that coincides with the end of the semester. But what happens when there is no instructor? What happens when students seek more hands-on experience than a school is able, or willing, to provide? And what happens when students come from various disciplines, at different points in their academic careers, to collaborate on a project with a client and client-established deliverables outside of the classroom? DesignConnect, an interdisciplinary student organization at Cornell University, is experimenting with creating real-world planning and design experiences for students by modifying structural components common to studio courses. This group’s divergence from the standard studio model presents an opportunity for the academy to reflect on the motivations and needs of students seeking experiential learning outside of official departmental curriculum offerings.</p>
<p>DesignConnect provides design and planning services to local communities in upstate New York. Students engage with DesignConnect on two overlapping levels. Student leaders administer the program, seek out projects, mediate conflicts, and organize opportunities for skill building and discussion. Individual project teams work directly with community sponsors to develop clear and reasonable scopes and schedules for each semester’s effort; they also develop and implement participatory programs with the community and collaboratively prepare plans or conceptual designs to begin meeting explicit community goals.</p>
<p>The factors that led to DesignConnect’s emergence are not unique to a single planning program, and the solution it provides can likely be implemented in other universities and communities. Within the context of limited faculty expansion, planning programs that focus on social policy, and a growing student population, the DesignConnect model may be a means toward maintaining and enhancing practical learning opportunities. Lessons gleaned from DesignConnect’s successes and failures in achieving learning outcomes are informative for curriculum committees, studio instructors, and programs considering interaction with similar student organizations.</p>
<p>Little has been written about student-led organizations that provide planning and design assistance to local communities. Much of the existing literature approaches the topic from an instructor-led studio or community design center model whereby universities provide free or low-cost design and planning services to groups that are unable to access design services and advocate on behalf of underserved groups for a voice in local decision making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0739456X12454458">Shibley, Plattus, and Watson 2003</xref>). HUD’s Community Outreach Partnership Centers (COPC) program resulted in the creation of many such design centers. From 1994 to 2005, HUD provided guidance and financial support to form partnerships between higher education and communities. Generally, colleges and universities created centers through single academic departments that assumed responsibility for outreach on the institution’s behalf (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0739456X12454458">Vidal et al. 2002</xref>, 2-19). COPC-funded centers—and similar partnerships between communities and universities—have had mixed success because of the different sizes and resources of the organizations involved, among other factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0739456X12454458">Nye and Schramm 1999</xref>, 17). Design centers were criticized for their “paternalistic / theory testing relationships” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0739456X12454458">Nye and Schramm 1999</xref>, 11). In addition, because COPC-funded programs were often organized along departmental lines to reflect academic disciplines, the tools, knowledge, and perspectives applied could not always respond to the interdisciplinary problems communities faced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0739456X12454458">Nye and Schramm 1999</xref>, 17).</p>
<p>Another way that communities receive assistance is through instructor-led studio courses. However, a general shift in the 1960s away from physical planning and toward social policy and communicative processes rendered studio-type courses increasingly less relevant in the eyes of planning academia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0739456X12454458">Lang 1983</xref>, 124). Among the leading institutions, Cornell University’s Department of City and Regional Planning moved farther than most in reducing studio courses from requiring three in 1955 to one optional workshop by 1984 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0739456X12454458">Heumann and Wetmore 1984</xref>, 123). As urban planning programs became difficult to set apart from urban studies programs, students seeking a professional degree began pushing for more practical experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0739456X12454458">Bayer, Frank, and Valerius 2010</xref>). By the mid-1980s some planning departments, notably the University of Michigan, reintroduced studio courses in response to student calls for more hands-on experience and in an attempt to distinguish their professional degree program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0739456X12454458">Vakil, Marans, and Feldt 1990</xref>, 62). Although Cornell’s planning program once again requires completion of at least one workshop course and offers several options to choose from, DesignConnect emerged within the historical continuum of studios and design centers to respond to those students who seek more real-world planning experiences.</p>
<p>DesignConnect’s efforts certainly fall in the category of experiential learning, but there is also a “distinct mutuality” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0739456X12454458">Radest 1993</xref>, 90) driven by altruism, a desire to practice skills learned in the classroom, and an understanding that many professional skills are best developed through practice. As one DesignConnect student participant stated:
<disp-quote>
<p>I learned a lot in my first year as a MRP student. . . . However, all of my education was in the classroom. I wanted to use the skills that I had learned in a real-world setting. I felt that it was important to try to gain some experience working with communities before entering the workforce.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>An easy take-away for curriculum committees is that voluntary participation in DesignConnect demonstrates that students are seeking venues for professional experience beyond course offerings; however, questions remain. How does the learning that takes place in DesignConnect compare to the learning in a studio course? What ethical considerations for students, faculty, and communities will help evaluate this kind of work? Because DesignConnect has only existed since 2009, it may be premature to subject the organization to a rigorous program evaluation, yet given that the organization is actively working in local communities, it is not too early to begin formulating and asking such questions.</p>
<p>The goal of this article is to develop a broader conceptualization of how students practice planning techniques and theories outside of the classroom. We argue that student-managed organizations complement and extend existing curriculum-based learning opportunities. We propose that academic departments begin methodically evaluating such organizations before determining the degree of faculty support or participation. Our mixed-methods, case study research included a literature review, analysis of independent study reflection essays, analysis of DesignConnect-administered student and client surveys, a pilot survey of expected and perceived student learning, and a review of best practices of other community-based learning efforts. We use this body of evidence to consider the implications for planning academia of independent student organizations providing learning opportunities and engaging in planning practice outside of the classroom.</p>
<p>This article is organized into three major sections. First, we describe DesignConnect’s internal organization and community-based activities. In the second section, we document the critical components of studio courses in order to establish the similarities and differences between studio courses and the efforts of DesignConnect. In the third and final section, we examine the implications of such a student club on university-based planning education. Given the many reasons why university planning programs might have mixed feelings about the proposition of independent student groups engaging in planning practice and education, we conclude with an evaluative framework that can help planning programs determine whether and how to become involved with similar clubs.</p>

<title>Description of DesignConnect</title>
<p>DesignConnect is an interdisciplinary, student-run, community design organization. Graduate students in Landscape Architecture conceived of the organization in the spring of 2008; projects began in the fall of 2009; and the group registered as an independent student organization in the spring of 2010. DesignConnect provides design and planning services to local municipalities and nonprofit organizations to help organize community ideas and build consensus around a project before it moves to the grant application and professional consultant stage. According to its governance documents, the organization is expressly rooted in collaborative, democratic, and sustainable principles for the advancement of municipalities in upstate New York.</p>
<p>Students involved with DesignConnect work on at least one of two parallel fronts: project teams and the administrative board. As dictated by its governing documents, the administrative board is composed of a chair (or cochairs), a community outreach representative, faculty outreach representative, team manager, communications representative, treasurer, and secretary. The administrative board solicits projects from local communities and meets with select community representatives to develop preliminary scopes of service. The board evaluates and selects projects, publicizes projects to students, facilitates the formation of teams, and intervenes in team–client or interteam disputes. Administrative board members also facilitate a range of more academic opportunities including skills workshops, theory discussions, and critiques.</p>
<p>Participating students work in teams with clients using jointly agreed on scopes of work and deadlines, that is, everything that planning studio courses offer, but without the mandatory weekly classroom instruction, instructor, and subsequent grade. Projects are designed to have discrete deliverables that coincide with a semester’s duration, but partnerships occasionally continue for multiple semesters. On average, seven teams of five to ten students complete individual projects. On its inception, thirty-four students participated in six teams in the fall of 2009; forty-five students participated in six teams in the spring of 2010; seventy students participated in eight teams in the fall of 2010; and fifty-two students participated in eight teams in the spring of 2011. Consistent participation on the part of students suggests continued interest and approval.</p>
<p>Community applications requesting DesignConnect assistance have grown steadier. In anticipation of DesignConnect’s first semester, the founding students had to solicit community projects. By the spring of 2011, word of DesignConnect’s abilities (and low-cost services) had spread, and communities submitted unsolicited requests for assistance. Projects are publicized online and with fliers. During introductory meetings geared toward attracting student participation from various disciplines, student administrators describe DesignConnect’s mission, what can be gained from participation, the work required, and the various clients’ needs. Interested students identify first and second choices of projects and the administrative board members assemble proposed teams into numerically balanced groups. Students come primarily from the Departments or Programs of Landscape Architecture, City and Regional Planning, Real Estate, Architecture, Interior Design, Civil Engineering, Natural Resources, Historic Preservation, Environmental Engineering, and Design and Environmental Analysis. No student is prohibited from participating. The initial decision and existing protocol to encourage interdisciplinary and intergenerational participation rests on the notion that all students can benefit from hands-on experience, all have something to contribute, and that work in the real world involves diverse people with a variety of expertise. On being informed of their proposed team, each student is asked whether they are, in fact, committed to participating. Student teams then begin meeting on a weekly basis.</p>
<p>A team’s first task is to finalize a scope of work in concert with their team’s client through a process of face-to-face meetings and iterative drafts that build on a contract template. The contract includes the client’s name and student participants, describes the project scope and deliverables, and conveys language that holds the University harmless in the relationship between the students and client. Similar to any contract document, it describes how disagreements will be resolved. The University plays no role in conflict resolution; the DesignConnect board and clients must resolve conflicts between themselves or decide to dissolve the contract.</p>
<p>The contract also describes an avenue through which donations are made. Student team members are not compensated for their efforts, but client donations cover students’ out-of-pocket expenditures. Initially, the exchange of money complicated the client–clientele dichotomy. DesignConnect began requesting upfront donations after experiencing difficulty collecting promised reimbursements for supplies after projects were completed. Suggested donations of $400 cover supplies and travel costs incurred by students and also help the administrative board avoid projects that lack client commitment. Donations to DesignConnect via the University channel the money directly to the organization while ensuring financial transparency and oversight in accordance with University and DesignConnect protocol.</p>
<p>The scope of work is tailored to the skills and abilities of the students who have committed to serve as team members. Thus, in theory, the students should be capable of doing the work. Other time commitments coupled with project management inexperience sometimes complicate student abilities to produce. To manage expectations, DesignConnect only works on projects at the conceptual phase, that is, deliverables may not be used for construction purposes. Scope limits are evident in an evaluation submitted by the Lyons Main Street Program Coordinator; when asked to describe the experience with the DesignConnect team, he described it as “a real benefit in creating clarity on park development.” Quoted in a local news publication, a board member of the Main Street Program stated, “The aim is to get a sense of what the community wants rather than to generate detailed plans and cost estimates. None of the ideas here are necessarily anything that’s going to be put into practice any time soon. It’s more, ‘What do we aspire to for the park?’” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0739456X12454458">Miller 2010</xref>). DesignConnect efforts set the stage for the municipality or community organization to compete for funding to hire professionals and move a project to the next stage. Unlike faculty who often have the skills of practitioners, students without faculty leaders cannot generate deliverables comparable to those generated by the private sector.</p>
<p>Several DesignConnect-completed projects have continued beyond the conceptual stage into the hands of the private sector. For example, Elmira’s Brand Park received an engineering feasibility study grant for an historic structure’s adaptive reuse based on the work of DesignConnect students. The participatory charrettes and organizing conducted by the DesignConnect team on the City’s Riverfront Park project galvanized enough support that a local firm was hired to develop a preliminary design. The club’s administration is explicit about its desire to facilitate more planning and design, and to not compete with or replace the services of design and planning professionals, especially during lean economic periods. However, these good intentions cannot be measured. At this point, DesignConnect has no mechanism to assess its impact on private or nonprofit sector consultants.</p>
<p>Clients approach DesignConnect with initial ideas of what their communities need, but without the capacity to sufficiently organize themselves around the project. Completed projects include the redesign of two parks in Elmira, one in Lyons, and one in Owego; a stormwater management plan for a parking lot in Elmira; the development of a brand and brochure for Ithaca Neighborhood Housing Service’s Community Housing Trust; the reprogramming of historic city halls in Elmira and Cooperstown; a redesign of the Route 28 entrance to Cooperstown; streetscape improvements in Interlaken; a trail feasibility study in Caroline; proposed trail improvements along the Chemung River; a feasibility analysis of a micro-hydro system in Caroline; a draft neighborhood streetscape plan in Binghamton; a cultural trail in Geneva; a small craft landing on a canal in Clyde; and the initial design of a wetlands park in Lansing.</p>
<p>Projects are not selected based on their geographic size or scale. However, on average, projects tend to respond to smaller, urban design issues, encompassing a few parcels or neighborhood blocks. The largest project, as of 2011, involved the drafting of a neighborhood streetscape plan. A major difference between DesignConnect projects and departmental studios at Cornell is not scale, but rather the physical design component. Academic studio courses in this University often emphasize policy analysis or program evaluation. Also, unlike some academic studios, DesignConnect projects do not systematically produce data “intended to develop or contribute to generalizable knowledge” and thus are not subject to Institutional Review Board approval. While Cornell offers courses in physical planning, and the planning department is in a College that emphasizes materiality and design, the department’s strengths have traditionally emphasized the communicative aspects of planning, social policy, and policy analysis. Conversations with DesignConnect team members suggest that planning students seek the hands-on, smaller scale design skills more prevalent in landscape architecture and architecture departments in their participation in DesignConnect. In addition, many participating students have said that one of the greatest learning opportunities of DesignConnect was the chance to work directly with clients and the public managing their projects and the process. Beyond the project deliverable, being a part of DesignConnect offers students an opportunity to take part in steering an organization, creating the kind of group they would like to see in the world. Within the safe confines of the University, without having to worry about the overhead of an office space, payroll etc., DesignConnect is a testing ground where students can apply theory not just to project decisions but also to the core of how an organization functions.</p>
<p>While the DesignConnect administrative board gives project teams great autonomy—teams are encouraged to set their own internal structure and they negotiate a final project scope directly with the client—a liaison from the administrative board also interacts with the local communities. This liaison conducts outreach to generate project applications and works with potential applicants to hone project ideas to meet the needs of both students and communities. Clients are systematically contacted by the administrative board’s community outreach liaison at a project’s conclusion. Pursuit of feedback is becoming more rigorous over time. In 2010, DesignConnect began requesting that clients complete a one-page feedback form. Clients appear to prefer sending comments by email in a more unstructured way. On a DesignConnect 2011 evaluation form, the City of Binghamton’s Planner wrote the following:
<disp-quote>
<p>The Planning Department has been pleased with the DesignConnect work from previous semesters. Our department, like many others, is having to assess and reevaluate projects and initiatives in the City. This has resulted in a new prioritization of resources, including staff time for the oversight of projects. . . . Therefore, at this time we will not be pursuing assistance from DesignConnect for the fall semester. Please convey our sincerest thanks to the DesignConnect students. We appreciate the time and effort that has been put into the project thus far and we hope that we can collaborate again in the future.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Written feedback from ten DesignConnect clients suggests satisfaction, coupled with the frustration of overseeing and managing the work of interns or consultants. As Binghamton’s Planner suggests, managing student-run projects takes more time and energy than managing an experienced consultant. Feedback is not available from all clients. In fact, those clients that do respond to requests for input may be self-selected; that is, only those pleased respond. Client feedback is not currently pursued after a second request is issued.</p>
<p>Another way of determining satisfaction is from examining client behavior. Of the thirty-nine projects initiated between the fall of 2009 and spring of 2011, eight began as single-semester projects but spanned two or three semesters with the clients’ express approval. The thirty-nine projects took place in fifteen municipalities; therefore, approximately 40 percent of DesignConnect’s clients are “repeat customers.” Requests for additional assistance and project extensions are indicators of satisfaction.</p>
<p>Bringing DesignConnect into a project frequently brings press and attention that community groups or municipalities have a hard time getting on their own. “Working with DesignConnect is a great opportunity to help give this project a little more exposure and raise its visibility in the community so that we can go after funding for it in the future,” said Gary Ferguson, Executive Director of the Downtown Ithaca Alliance, of a project in its early stages. This attention is a double-edged sword that DesignConnect students struggle to manage. On several occasions, projects have been reworked midsemester after it became apparent to students that a project’s sponsor was not representative of wider stakeholders and DesignConnect’s presence was intended to bring positive spin to an otherwise unpopular project. On one such project (Brand Park in Elmira), DesignConnect’s community meetings revealed significant opposition to the city’s planned demolition of a historic structure in the park. The meetings resulted in a last minute cancellation of the demolition, which was seen as a project failure by the client (City Hall). Neighborhood preservationists then rallied in support of an adaptive reuse plan for the structure, an idea proposed by the DesignConnect team, and pursued and received state funding for an engineering feasibility study. This project received more attention than DesignConnect had anticipated, but the neighborhood perceived the outcome as successful.</p>
<p>Of the total projects initiated by DesignConnect between 2009 and 2011, only two have not been completed. One, involving the conversion of a bridge that could no longer bear vehicular traffic to a pedestrian park, was withdrawn by the community’s mayor. The project’s options were preempted by business interests who disagreed with the State’s determination that the bridge was in poor condition. A second project was withdrawn by a DesignConnect team after the sponsoring municipal department sought to curtail community participation and avoid a politically sensitive debate over the exclusion of a dog run from a park redevelopment plan.</p>
<p>Project complications are brought to the attention of faculty sponsors. Each project team has a faculty sponsor. Potential sponsors are chosen by teams based on matching faculty teaching and research interests to particular projects. Representatives from each team approach individual faculty members to request participation. Faculty who agree to participate receive no compensation, other than the ability to document contributions as fulfilling community service requirements and personal satisfaction. Department chairs applaud engagement with DesignConnect as evidence of interest in student affairs, but advise faculty to minimize their commitment and focus on teaching and research. Rarely do faculty members agree to sponsor more than one team per semester. Faculty sponsors provide teams with guidance ranging from project management to technical content, spending an average of one hour per week during the semester in direct contact with DesignConnect student participants.</p>
<p>Teams rarely seek—nor can faculty offer—the extent of involvement expected in a studio course. In addition to participating in mid- and end-of-semester presentations that provide organizational cohesiveness and structure, faculty sponsors attend two or three meetings over the course of a semester and provide advice by email when requested. Both faculty and students recognize that faculty are volunteering their services. From a students’ perspective, limited faculty involvement ensures that faculty do not compromise the independence of the student teams or the organization’s values. Yet the founders, and current administrators, saw/see the value of faculty involvement. No academic department has yet discussed the possibility of a faculty course release to facilitate the club’s efforts. Faculty members do, with departmental approval, offer students arrangements for independent study credit. Although most students do not need the additional credits to graduate, approximately half of the students registered with their faculty sponsors to receive independent study credit to strengthen their transcripts. Independent study credits introduce a small, but new, funding stream to departments, and faculty receive recognition for work they had initially volunteered to do.</p>
<p>Beyond facilitated discussions that encourage reflection during weekly meetings, DesignConnect conducts surveys of student participants after each midterm and final presentation. The surveys reveal a high rate of satisfaction with the program, but DesignConnect’s internal surveys—developed by student administrators—are designed primarily to improve operations and so are of limited use in evaluating the program as a whole. In an attempt to assess impacts on learning, we pilot tested a survey in the spring of 2011. Although the survey yielded a small response rate, when weighted the results suggest DesignConnect provides significant learning opportunities and that students’ relatively high expectations are not only being met but exceeded.</p>
<p>We recommend that an independent survey of students be conducted in DesignConnect’s fifth year of existence; after the organization has established a track record, participating students can better appreciate the need for a thorough program evaluation. The survey could help establish whether certain learning outcomes are perceived as achieved and from where, that is, from DesignConnect or from the particular student’s academic department. Learning outcomes could reflect essential planning skills, as identified by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0739456X12454458">Ozawa and Seltzer’s 1999</xref> research, and be reworded to facilitate student understanding and ease of response. Additional outcomes could be added to account for the exposure DesignConnect students have to the mechanics of running a project without an instructor. Proposed learning outcomes could include professional writing skills; graphic skills; public participation techniques; principles of physical planning and design; analyzing problems and developing solutions; dealing with ethical issues; leadership skills; project management skills; the mechanics of initiating a project and the politics of project implementation; and the ability to work with a client as well as colleagues from different disciplines. An assessment that compares perceptions of DesignConnect and classroom-based work must account for depth of learning. Departments are likely to provide substantial depth focused on a more narrow range of objectives, whereas DesignConnect may provide a wide but shallow exposure to certain concepts. A formal, independent evaluation of DesignConnect should help gauge what students are actually learning.</p>

<title>Rethinking Certain Components of Studio Courses</title>
<p>Although the total number of required planning studios has not rebounded from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0739456X12454458">Wetmore and Heumann’s 1988</xref> study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0739456X12454458">Urban Insight 2009</xref>, 49), the trend toward community-based work set in motion by community design centers remains clear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0739456X12454458">Shibley, Plattus, and Watson 2003</xref>). However, given the pressure for students to complete undergraduate and graduate degrees within four and two years, respectively, the number of studio courses planning programs can require is limited. If the role of the studio is to “apply and synthesize the various skills and knowledge employed by professional planners” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0739456X12454458">Wetmore and Heumann 1988</xref>, 136) and planning programs cannot require that students take several studio courses—or at least one that involves community-based physical planning and design work—then the application and synthesizing of skills must also take place <italic>outside</italic> of the classroom. This section considers the literature pertaining to this option. In addition, two components that differentiate DesignConnect from university-based studio courses are examined: the role of the instructor and the degree to which students participate from various disciplines.</p>
<p>Learning that incorporates real practical experiences (i.e., meaningful engagement with a client and multiple publics, deadlines, and deliverables) raises several concerns for university-based planning programs. Issues that must be addressed include resourcing (together with the risks and rewards to faculty), cost-effectiveness, the unpredictability of workplace settings, assessment and customization of learning goals and outcomes, collaborations across organizational boundaries, and matching learner needs and the educational potential of the activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0739456X12454458">Reeders 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0739456X12454458">Forsyth, Lu, and McGirr 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0739456X12454458">Nye and Schramm 1999</xref>). And yet, planning academia recognizes that students require an educational environment in which skills central to the creative act of planning can be learned and/or tested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0739456X12454458">Schön 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0739456X12454458">Lang 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0739456X12454458">Sletto 2010</xref>). Learning that occurs outside of the classroom, and service learning in particular, has grown over the years as the benefits for students have proven to outweigh their costs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0739456X12454458">Eyler and Giles 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0739456X12454458">Checkoway 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>Effectively connecting theory and practice, service learning is usually accomplished through workshop or studio courses to fulfill degree requirements in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0739456X12454458">Planning Accreditation Board (1984)</xref>–accredited schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0739456X12454458">Dewar and Isaac 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0739456X12454458">Reardon 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0739456X12454458">Roakes and Norris-Tirrell 2000</xref>). Service learning is:
<disp-quote>
<p>an approach to experiential learning, an expression of values—service to others, community development and empowerment, reciprocal learning—which determines the purpose, nature and process of social and educational exchange between learners and the people they serve, and between experiential education programs and the community organizations with which they work. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0739456X12454458">Stanton 1987</xref>, 4)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0739456X12454458">Kolb (1984)</xref> frames experiential learning in a cyclical manner, that is, students acquire knowledge from concrete experience, reflective observation, abstract conceptualization, and active experimentation. While the field of service learning continues to be explored and definitions refined, this article characterizes service learning as political (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0739456X12454458">Longo 2004</xref>) and involving Kolb’s four components of the learning cycle.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0739456X12454458">Roakes and Norris-Tirrell (2000</xref>, 109) argue for including service learning <italic>within</italic> the planning curriculum, and yet an equally strong case can be made for incorporating the features of planning-oriented service learning outside of the formal structure of the curriculum. Apart from the previously mentioned complications associated with learning that incorporates practical experiences, planning programs are not solely the composites of their coursework but include extracurricular activities such as lectures by guest speakers, internship opportunities, field trips, and linkages to alum and practitioner networks. Recognizing that students benefit from diverse, practical experiences, planning departments already offer a variety of means that expose students to the professionals and work environments they will likely encounter on graduation. For some students, this exposure to practice is sufficient. Others are starved for more.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0739456X12454458">Wetmore and Heumann (1988</xref>, 145) theorize that planning faculty members compensate for the decline of studio courses by incorporating lessons from applied practice into the classroom. But of course, the role of the lecturer differs from that of the studio instructor. While lecturers can certainly engage and empower the students, the role of the instructor in many studios goes far beyond facilitating student learning to include finding and selecting projects, contact and negotiations with community clients, fundraising, project management, risk management, and ensuring the quality of the studio’s final deliverable.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0739456X12454458">Lang (1983</xref>, 125) suggests that a new generation of scholars understands the theory of interrelationships between analytical activities, design activities, and choice activities (decision theory), and their translation into practice. These scholars should be well equipped to serve as effective studio instructors that can pose the sorts of questions that will push students to examine their own sets of values for planning and personal and professional responsibilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0739456X12454458">Schweitzer and Stephenson 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0739456X12454458">Howe, Adler, and Ozawa 2010</xref>). And yet, the presence of such instructors alone does not resolve the other institutional challenges facing studios. If instructors are not available to assist students, countless opportunities for learning and growth may be missed. Or will they?</p>
<p>Faculty at the Nova Scotia College of Art and Design found that students in conventional studios become overly dependent on instructors for leadership and are reluctant to experiment with new approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0739456X12454458">Grant and Manuel 1995</xref>). Portland State University’s experience is similar. Prior to 1993, studio students at Portland State generated products that were disappointing in their lack of focus on process and justification of recommendations because they were participating in assigned projects for which they had little interest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0739456X12454458">Howe, Adler, and Ozawa 2010</xref>). Portland State has since modified its approach; students now select their own projects and are responsible for all client communications. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0739456X12454458">Howe, Adler, and Ozawa (2010</xref>, 23) report that students in studio courses are, now, more engaged as demonstrated by risk taking, spontaneity, and actions that match challenges with skills and support. The deliverables generated are stronger and the students are indicating greater satisfaction in their course evaluations. If the lesson of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0739456X12454458">Howe, Adler, and Ozawa (2010)</xref> is that studio instructors ceding responsibilities and control to students leads to improved outcomes, DesignConnect’s step of further reducing instructor control and responsibility merits critical consideration. When students operate with less instructor oversight, managerial responsibilities become core learning opportunities. As such, the absence of a faculty instructor becomes a critical component when examining the difference between a studio course and instructor-less student club.</p>
<p>The students participating in Portland State’s studios are all planning students and from the same admissions cohort. Nova Scotia’s studios are similarly populated. Thus, the students know one another, have comparable academic interests, and have taken at least certain common core planning courses. Exposure to “difference” comes from the project itself. Admittance to planning studio courses is, in fact, often limited to students of a specific program and academic year. If smaller teams of students are necessary to manage the workload, some studio instructors will go through great pains to “distribute the talent and assign students so that each team has individuals with leadership skills, writing skills, and design skills” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0739456X12454458">Kotval 2003</xref>, 303). Describing the Nova Scotia experience, Grant and Manuel write, “Throwing teams together without ensuring that members have the requisite skills can prove disastrous” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0739456X12454458">1995</xref>, 53). Alternatively, unbalanced, interdisciplinary teams not only reflect the diversity of individuals one encounters in the work environment but will force members to recognize the skills they lack internally and practice seeking assistance from elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0739456X12454458">Balassiano 2011</xref>). Peer-to-peer learning is recognized as an invaluable method by which students learn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0739456X12454458">Grant and Manuel 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0739456X12454458">Allen and Hartman 2009</xref>), as is self-guided inquiry. One DesignConnect participant, who also served as a team leader, included the following reflection in a spring 2009 end-of-semester evaluation:
<disp-quote>
<p>The last major learning opportunity for me this semester was my role as a team leader. Leading a group of people who are both older and in many cases more qualified than I am pushed me to either find the confidence or fake the confidence in order to effectively lead the group. By the end of the semester, I feel a lot more comfortable delegating responsibilities, leading group meetings, and speaking publicly.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Highlighting the importance of DesignConnect’s interdisciplinary format is the following reflection provided by a Landscape Architecture student in response to a faculty advisor’s fall 2010 end-of-semester assessment:
<disp-quote>
<p>The actual experience that I received from DesignConnect both differed and coincided with my expectations. I still think that one of the best experiences that anyone can get from DesignConnect is learning how to work in a group. Group work is something that is extremely common in the real world and I think that DesignConnect does a good job of embodying this concept. I believe that I will be working with City Regional Planners on both large and small scale projects when I enter the professional world, and I truly value the insight that the group work within DesignConnect has given me on how there is much to learn from different professions when working on the same project.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>More problematic than limiting admittance, or organizing teams by skill sets for the ease of instruction, is the potential contradiction that underlies this maneuvering. Interdisciplinary collaboration is an American Institute of Certified Planners core ethical value. In addition, the Planning Accreditation Board mandates that schools expose students to difference. And yet, the historic, institutional structure of university-based planning programs and need to differentiate themselves as a coherent discipline encourages an inward-looking focus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0739456X12454458">Pinson 2004</xref>, 504). Planning programs continue to strive for validating and maintaining their own identity, and ultimately autonomy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0739456X12454458">Dalton 2001</xref>, 428). Dalton documents the tension between the multidisciplinary nature of the discipline and the Planning Accreditation Board requirements, for example, that planning departments operate as independent entities.</p>
<p>In sum, issues pertaining to whether the student body should be interdisciplinary (and of mixed academic levels) and role of the instructor remain open for debate. Our intention is not to diminish the role of the studio instructor or to suggest that DesignConnect-style programs can or should replace studio courses in planning curricula; instead, we explore a potential opportunity for greater student exposure to collaborative community-based planning and design skills. Planning programs already value and support learning outside of the classroom, so the question is how to improve and manage those experiences to better align them with desired learning outcomes. Portland State’s experience suggests that changing the instructors’ tasks and roles encourages other means by which productive learning can occur. Thus, an alternative mode of education presents itself, that is, one provided by student organizations.</p>

<title>Implications for University-Based Planning Education</title>
<p>DesignConnect, by its creation and number of participants, has demonstrated that students want more practical, university-based experiences. Many students involved in DesignConnect join with preexisting studio and/or real-life planning experiences, and yet their participation indicates a desire for additional hands-on experience, because, as Lang writes, “it is clear that any one studio effort cannot focus on all the processes and techniques that planners need to know how and when to use” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0739456X12454458">Lang 1983</xref>, 126). The fact that the club is open to all students, regardless of their major or years of higher education, reveals that students recognize future work environments will require collaborative work among people of different disciplines and knowledge bases. The students of DesignConnect are, in effect, creating a more realistic work environment than what university studio courses generally offer. And yet, similar to standard, university-driven studios, DesignConnect uses many valued teaching strategies to achieve learning outcomes, including active learning, collaborative learning, peer-to-peer learning, project-based planning, and learner-centered learning.</p>
<p>As recommended in Keeling’s “Learning Reconsidered 2” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0739456X12454458">2006</xref>, 43), the transition from a teacher- to student-oriented learning environment requires institutional self-analysis to ultimately enhance the experience for students, faculty and their respective departments. Based on the research conducted by this article’s authors, DesignConnect plays an important co-curricular role in the areas of practicing collaboration, leadership training, organizational development, and helping students appreciate how local communities make, and continue making, decisions. And yet, the challenges and drawbacks related to this particular approach are also plentiful. One potential concern includes the continuity and sustainability of a student organization that varies in terms of membership and, thus, effectiveness. In addition, the students have not yet instituted a systematic mechanism to document and monitor community impacts, including impacts on private sector consulting firms. Other challenges pertain to faculty. Participatory action research may decrease if students design their own field-based learning efforts, and curricula committees may veer further away from practice-related teaching if they perceive that students are getting this experience elsewhere. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0739456X12454458">Boyer (1996)</xref> referred to practice-related teaching and research, the “scholarship of engagement” may deteriorate over time.</p>
<p>Planning programs can evaluate opportunities for collaborative co-curricular student-based community design activities using <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0739456X12454458">Kolb’s (1984)</xref> four components of experiential learning. The framework below poses questions that reflect the full cycle of learning, that is, concrete experience, reflective observation, abstract conceptualization, and active experimentation. As planning programs expose students to these components, student organizations that wish to benefit from departmental support should also offer all aspects of this cycle. Rather than respond ad hoc to student requests, departments should have a mechanism that allows for more systematic decision making. The issue is not a matter of abandoning instructor-led studios; rather it is determining complementarity guided by department-established learning objectives. Specifically, the leadership of a university-based planning program might ask:</p>
<list id="list1-0739456X12454458" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>What is the degree of concrete experience offered? Using departmental learning objectives as a measure, to what degree does the student organization help achieve those learning objectives? And conversely, does participation negatively affect mandatory coursework and timely graduation?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Does the student organization institute mechanisms that facilitate reflection for student and faculty participants? How are the results of that reflection channeled back into the learning/advising process?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Prior to or instead of simply acting, do mechanisms facilitate the abstract conceptualization of tasks? What are the substantive opportunities that allow for the analysis of alternatives and participatory selection of appropriate solutions?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Are there opportunities for active experimentation and risk taking? As opposed to, for example, offering known, tested solutions—is creativity and possibly failure imaginable? Are the risks taken negatively impacting student/faculty/community participants, and how do they compare to the benefits?</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Student organizations can facilitate learning and serve as a mechanism for social change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0739456X12454458">Rhoads 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0739456X12454458">Rosenberg and Statham 2006</xref>). Although DesignConnect is not as radical as some activist organizations described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0739456X12454458">Sirianni and Friedland (2004)</xref>, selecting projects with a social and environmental justice perspective and insisting that all projects are transparent and participatory is viewed as revolutionary in some municipalities. Certainly, DesignConnect’s justice-oriented, do-it-yourself methods represent a departure from business as usual and provide a testing ground for students’ moral gumption. In many ways DesignConnect is quite similar to activist student groups involved in service learning and civic engagement with their demonstrated commitment to advocacy planning principles and democratic practices. Like certain activist groups, DesignConnect engages in “service politics” in that the students are “active producers . . . of knowledge and democracy” and “co-creators of a public, common good” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0739456X12454458">Sirianni and Friedland 2004</xref>, 105) attempting to “overcome the powerful fragmenting forces in higher education and conceptualize a new practice connecting community service and political participation” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0739456X12454458">Longo 2004</xref>, 64).</p>
<p>Even without the threat of budget cuts, the efforts of planning programs to engage students with community issues and thereby teach necessary skills can be strengthened. Potential learning opportunities result from the work of student organizations. Dimensions of desirable civic engagement outcomes include a heightened sense of responsibility, commitment to public service though communities of practice, engagement in principled dissent, and effective leadership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0739456X12454458">Keeling 2006</xref>, 23). The results of a variety of developmental experiences demonstrate these outcomes, including involvement in service learning, leadership courses, social activism, and student organizations.</p>
<p>Recognizing that students have curricular and co-curricular options that foster an acquisition of substantive knowledge, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0739456X12454458">Pasque et al. (2009</xref>, 83) found that students take advantage of these options differently but that behavioral patterns can be tracked. Students who won awards for a combination of excellent scholarship and service generally participated in several student clubs. Given that student participation in a club can enhance a student’s university experience, Pasque et al. minimally call for faculty to make explicit the options and connections that exist between curricular and co-curricular opportunities. Beyond informing students of opportunities and options, developing a productive relationship with a community design-oriented student organization at the departmental level need not be difficult. As demonstrated by the efforts of DesignConnect, a student organization can handle the labor-intensive client interactions; and nowadays, all universities have processes to ensure that student organizations steer clear of legal problems. DesignConnect works to manage the expectations of student and community participants in order to avoid municipalities becoming “bystanders” and not real partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0739456X12454458">Nye and Schramm 1999</xref>, 37) and the bad feelings and misunderstandings that Forsyth, Lu, and McGirr have observed, that is,
<disp-quote>
<p>Having a university that moves out into the neighborhood in a way that is well-intentioned, but in the end cannot come through with the goods, can do much to destroy trust. In many ways this failure to deliver can be counterproductive in terms of wasting the time of residents, polarizing positions in the neighborhood, and making subsequent university activity very difficult. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0739456X12454458">Forsyth, Lu, and McGirr 2000</xref>, 249)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Contracts containing the project scope are signed by both student and community participants to minimize misconceptions and liabilities. Part of the standard contract reads as follows: “I acknowledge that DesignConnect is a voluntary service program not conducted by licensed professionals or experts, and their work can in no way be used for the basis, documentation, or estimate of construction.” Making the organization’s limitations clear is an important factor in precluding trouble. Departmental faculty should thoroughly investigate the student organization before agreeing to provide support.</p>
<p>If the department determines the organization has made every attempt to avoid misunderstandings, then communication between the planning department and club is important and can come in the form of announcements and exchanges during faculty meetings. More extensive departmental support can include, for example, space for students to meet, funding of a student assistant to help with administrative tasks, faculty serving as advisors, and the option of students receiving independent study credit for participation in the organization.</p>
<p>Examining student choices and explicitly asking for opinions pertaining to curricula is nothing new. The Planning Accreditation Board has been collecting student input since 1984. Students regularly participate in faculty-run committees designed to improve the quality of curricula. The formation of a new student organization should similarly serve to inform faculty of students’ interests and needs. At Cornell University, the desire for more hands-on practical experiences has become so great that it spawned the birth of an independent organization populated by large numbers of already busy students. And while university-promoted service-learning is now widely appreciated as a critical pedagogical component (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0739456X12454458">Stanton, Giles, and Cruz 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0739456X12454458">Eyler and Giles 1999</xref>), departmental linkages to student organizations that provide learning alternatives—without a faculty member serving in the capacity of instructor or project manager—is less common.</p>
<p>At this point, DesignConnect remains a nascent organization. It continues to make adjustments as needs reveal themselves. It appears to be moving in the direction of more rigor and inclusivity. For example, in the fall of 2011, it formed an advisory board composed of community leaders, client representatives, department representatives, former and current faculty advisors, and former and current student administrators. However, rather than wait a few years to conduct a formal program evaluation, we felt an urgency to shed some light on the organization. With little University oversight, student teams are working in communities <italic>now</italic>. They are organizing community workshops, gathering data from town hall, and presenting preliminary plans and designs to local decision makers. Certainly, their presence is being felt. The local impact of their actions will likely remain for years and may travel beyond upstate New York. The organization is already sharing their experiences with students in other schools and through American Planning Association conferences. The framework proposed within this article may serve as a starting point for the questions faculty might ask of students interested in forming a DesignConnect-like organization.</p>
