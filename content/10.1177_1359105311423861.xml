<abstract>
<p>Exercise reduces the likelihood of psychological distress, but this may be due to incidental socializing. We gathered information on exercise, social support and three aspects of psychological distress from 583 community-dwelling older adults. Exercise and social support from friends were both associated with lower scores of depression, anxiety and perceived stress. For infrequent exercisers, having a low level of social support indicated higher levels of depression, whereas for frequent exercisers, having a low level of social support did not affect depression levels. Both exercise and social support have roles in regulating psychological well-being in older populations and exercisers are less susceptible to effects of low social support on depression.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The population of the world is ageing. The proportion of the Irish population aged 65 years or older is projected to increase from 11 percent of the overall population in 2006 to 20 percent by 2036 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1359105311423861">Central Statistics Office, 2007</xref>). Promoting longer, healthier lives is now a primary issue for health researchers. In particular, the mental health of older adults is becoming an increasingly prioritized matter. Estimates of the prevalence of mood disorders in the older population range from 5 percent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1359105311423861">Byers et al., 2010</xref>) to 10 percent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1359105311423861">Weissman and Myers, 1978</xref>) and mood disorders in old age are associated with increased morbidity and mortality rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1359105311423861">Cuijpers &amp; Smit, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1359105311423861">Penninx et al., 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>Exercise is commonly known to be a key factor in maintaining psychological well-being. Longitudinal studies have shown that high levels of exercise at baseline predict low levels of depression at follow-up (eg, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1359105311423861">Strawbridge, et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1359105311423861">Paffenbarger et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1359105311423861">Mobily et al., 1996</xref>). Also at a cross-sectional level, there is an association between exercise and depression in older adults (Ruuskanen and Ruoppila, 1995). There is a stronger association between exercise and mental health outcome in older adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1359105311423861">Stephens, 1988</xref>), which has previously been explained with recourse to Homan’s exchange theory of investment and rewards, reasoning that since exercise would be physically tougher on older than younger adults, they perceive more of a reward to their health in return (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1359105311423861">Ransford and Palisi, 1996</xref>). However, in general a paucity of experimental evidence for the association in older adults has been noted (for a meta-analysis of existing evidence, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1359105311423861">Netz et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Several potential mechanisms could explain the association between exercise and psychological well-being. Biological mechanisms such as increased endorphin release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1359105311423861">Farrell et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1359105311423861">Markoff et al., 1982</xref>) and adrenaline production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1359105311423861">Barchas and Freedman, 1963</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1359105311423861">Gordon et al., 1966</xref>) may account for lower likelihood of psychological distress in exercisers. Psychological explanations have been put forward also. It is possible that exercise reduces likelihood of psychological distress by acting as a buffer against stressful events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1359105311423861">Brown and Lawton, 1986</xref>), by producing a sense of mastery and self-efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1359105311423861">Bodin and Martinsen, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1359105311423861">Greist et al., 1979</xref>) or by increasing self-esteem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1359105311423861">McAuley, 1994</xref>). Alternatively it is possible that exercise promotes psychological well-being due to the cumulative effect of improved mood immediately following sessions of exercise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1359105311423861">Baekeland, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1359105311423861">McDonald and Hodgdon, 1991</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1359105311423861">Salmon (2001)</xref> outlines a psychobiological account of exercise as a ‘controllable stressor’; exercise can reduce sensitivity to stress in a similar fashion to stress adaptation in animals. Salmon’s theory aims to explain the anxiolytic, antidepressant and stress-reducing effects of exercise collectively, with recourse to stress adaptation. Over time, tolerance to stress can be increased using exercise, since exercise represents a stressor which can be controlled and overcome.</p>
<p>Another possibility is that incidental social interaction is underlying the antidepressant and anxiolytic effect of exercise. Social support is important for psychological well-being in older adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1359105311423861">Bowling and Browne, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1359105311423861">Bowling et al., 1991</xref>). While it is intuitive what social support can constitute, there is controversy as to how it ought to be defined in the literature. Social support can be treated as being instrumental, emotional, appraisal or informational as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1359105311423861">House’s (1981)</xref> model, and can also be conceptualized as comprizing perceived support, enacted support and social integration, as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1359105311423861">Barrera’s (1986)</xref> model. With regard to older adults, social network type has been further typified by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1359105311423861">Wenger (1997)</xref> such that an older adult can have a local, integrated network, a wider-community focused network, a local self-contained network, a local family-dependent network or a private, restricted network. A full discussion of the various approaches taken to define and operationalize social support is beyond the scope of the current investigation, but can be found elsewhere (eg, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1359105311423861">Barrera, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1359105311423861">Heitzmann and Kaplan, 1988</xref>). Lubben operationalized social networks as primarily based on size and frequency of interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1359105311423861">Lubben and Gironda, 2004</xref>) and this framework has been particularly validated for research with an older population, as it is thought to be clinically relevant, being associated with all-cause mortality, hospitalisation and depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1359105311423861">Lubben and Gironda, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>A lack of social support is associated with depression and suicidal ideation in older adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1359105311423861">van der Horst and McLaren, 2005</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1359105311423861">Oxman et al. (1992)</xref>, satisfaction with social support, rather than the objective size of one’s social network, is predictive of depression levels. However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1359105311423861">Antonucci and colleagues (1997)</xref> warn that the association between depression and low social support may be confounded by the fact that depressed people may be more pessimistic when discussing the quality of their social support. The relationship between social support and depression is further complicated by a caveat raised by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1359105311423861">Pagel et al. (1987)</xref>; that relationships and social interactions are inherently stressful and may not always be beneficial to mental health (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1359105311423861">Rook, 1984</xref>).</p>
<p>There are a limited number of studies acknowledging that social interaction may be a potential confounder within the exercise and psychological well-being relationship. One early theory attributed the psychological effects of exercise to its relationship with social interaction during exercise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1359105311423861">Lees and Dygdon, 1988</xref>). In accordance, solitary exercise was shown to have no beneficial effect on psychological well-being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1359105311423861">Hughes et al., 1986</xref>).</p>
<p>These studies have informed more recent research. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1359105311423861">Kerse and colleagues (2008)</xref> controlled for the social nature of some forms of exercise in their intervention study, by dividing participants into an exercise group and a social-contact-only control group. Both groups reported an improvement in mood, suggesting that social interaction and exercise both have positive effects on psychological well-being. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1359105311423861">Abt (2006)</xref> showed a similar effect with another intervention study, while <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1359105311423861">McNeil et al. (1991)</xref> also controlled for the social component of exercise by having a separate social contact control group, and found that both exercise and social contact reduced depression but only exercise reduced somatic depression symptoms in older adults. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1359105311423861">Wilcox and colleagues (2006)</xref> discuss the use of two different interventions to support exercise in older adults: ‘active choices’ – a six-month long telephone based program and the ‘active living everyday’ – a 20-week group-based programme. Only the group-based programme showed significant effects on reducing depression. While Wilcox attributed the failure to find significance within ‘active choices’ to a lack of statistical power, it is also possible that the group-based programme succeeded where the telephone-based programme failed due to its social group-based nature, since the telephone-based programme involved only contact with one counsellor.</p>
<p>The current study investigated the extent to which social support may explain the association between exercise frequency and psychological outcomes at a cross-sectional level. In the current study, exercise was measured as hours of exercise per week, since there is purportedly a dose-response relationship between exercise and psychological well-being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1359105311423861">Dunn et al., 2001</xref>). We investigated three separate facets of psychological distress as a measure of psychological outcome; depression, anxiety and perceived stress, since <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1359105311423861">Salmon (2001)</xref> advocates a unified approach to investigating the relationship between exercise and psychological well-being, and most previous research focuses on one sole aspect, for example, depression. We also measured social support in our population, with a view to investigating the relationship between exercise, social support and psychological distress. Specifically we wished to investigate the extent to which exercise and social support may independently predict psychological outcome at a cross-sectional level, in a population of community- dwelling older adults.</p>

<title>Methodology</title>
<sec id="section4-1359105311423861">
<title>Sample</title>
<p>The study involved community-dwelling participants attending the TRIL (Technology Research for Independent Living) Clinic (for a more detailed account of the assessment taken in the TRIL clinic, please refer to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1359105311423861">Romero-Ortuno, Cogan, Fan &amp; Kenny, 2010</xref>). TRIL participants came to the clinic via self-referral, GP-referral or emergency-department referral. TRIL Clinic participants were required to be community-dwelling, aged 60 and over, able to mobilize independently with or without mobility aid and able to provide informed consent. Local Research Ethics Committee approval was obtained (SJH/AMNCH Research Ethics Committee approval reference number 2007/06/13). All participants gave their informed consent prior to their inclusion in the study. The analyses reported here involved data from participants with an MMSE (Mini Mental State Examination; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1359105311423861">Folstein et al., 1975</xref>) score of above 23, which has previously been shown to be a reliable cut-off score for indicating an absence of cognitive impairment in the Irish population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1359105311423861">Cullen et al., 2005</xref>). This excluded 41 participants from the original TRIL cohort of 624 participants, leaving 583 participants’ data suitable for analysis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1359105311423861">
<title>Design</title>
<p>Participants were interviewed at the TRIL Clinic at St James’s Hospital in Dublin. All participants underwent a structured clinical assessment that included medical and falls history by physicians and cognitive and psychosocial assessments by psychologists. Measures of interest in the current analyses are detailed below. As well as primary measures of interest, age, gender, activities of daily living (ADL), instrumental activities of daily living (IADL), age-adjusted Charlson index of co-morbidities (AACI), neuroticism (from the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire – Revised edn; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1359105311423861">Eysenck and Eysenck, 1991</xref>), self reported verbal rating scales of pain, self-rated health status and polypharmacy information were collected from all participants.</p>

<title>Primary measures</title>
<sec id="section7-1359105311423861">
<title>Centre for Epidemiology Scale – Depression (CES-D-8)</title>
<p>Depression was evaluated using the CES-D-8, a widely used 8-item scale validated by the Centre for Epidemiological Studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1359105311423861">Radloff, 1977</xref>). Each item asks whether ‘much of the time during the past week’ the individual has felt a certain way. A total score, 0 to 8, is then computed. Higher scores on the CES-D indicate higher levels of depressive symptoms. Scale items include ‘for much of the past week, have you felt depressed?’ (responses are yes or no), and ‘for much of the past week, did it feel like everything you did was an effort?’</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1359105311423861">
<title>Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale – Anxiety subscale (HADS)</title>
<p>Anxiety was evaluated using the anxiety subscale of the HADS scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1359105311423861">Zigmond and Snaith, 1983</xref>). In this scale, participants are required to report how often they would be likely to experience various symptoms of anxiety, on a 4-point scale. A total score is then computed, which can range from 0–21, with scores of 11 or above being indicative of clinical levels of anxiety. Participants are asked how often they agree with certain statements, for example, ‘I get a frightened feeling like something bad is about to happen’, with responses as ‘Yes, very definitely and very badly/Yes, but not too badly/ A little but it doesn’t worry me/ Not at all’.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1359105311423861">
<title>Perceived stress scale</title>
<p>The Perceived Stress Scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1359105311423861">Cohen et al., 1983</xref>) was used to measure the perception of stress experienced in the last month. It is a measure of the degree to which situations in one’s life are appraised as stressful and is designed to tap how unpredictable, uncontrollable and overloaded respondents find their lives. A score from 0 to 40 is computed from the 10 items with higher scores indicating higher levels of stress. Scale items include ‘In the past month, how often have you been upset because of things that happened unexpectedly?’ with possible responses as ‘Never/ Almost never/ Sometimes/ Fairly often/ Very often’.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1359105311423861">
<title>Hours of exercise per week</title>
<p>To investigate the effects of physical exercise on mood, measures of participation in various sports and activities were gathered from participants. Participants were asked as part of a longer social interview ‘how long each week do you spend at each of these hobbies?’ and given the options of gardening, watching sport, doing sport/physical activity, reading, cards/Bingo, handicrafts, racing/betting and travel. Participants were required to elucidate the types of physical activity or sport they partook in. Hours per week spent in exercise were then defined as those spent walking, jogging, cycling, swimming, aerobics, tennis, dancing, golf, yoga, bowling, judo, gaelic football, horseriding, rugby, badminton, tai chi and sailing.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1359105311423861">
<title>Lubben social network scale</title>
<p>The 18-item version of the Lubben Social Network Scale was used to examine perceived social support in older adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1359105311423861">Lubben and Gironda, 2004</xref>). The Lubben scale aims to assess social isolation in older adults by measuring perceived social support. This version utilizes three subscales for friends, family, and neighbours (otherwise, the items of the subscales are identical to each other) and has the highest level of internal consistency (α = .82) of the three available versions of the LSNS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1359105311423861">Lubben and Gironda, 2004</xref>). The scale weights size, closeness and frequency of social contacts. The sum of the 18 equally weighted items is computed with scores ranging from 0 to 90. Lower scores indicate smaller networks, or a lower level of perceived social support. Items include ‘How many relatives (friends/neighbours) do you see or hear from at least once a month?’, ‘How many relatives (friends/neighbours) do you feel you can talk to about private matters?’, and ‘How many relatives (friends/neighbours) do you feel close to such that you could call on them for help?’</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1359105311423861">
<title>Data analysis</title>
<p>Data were analysed using SPSS 16.0. Bivariate Spearman’s rho correlation analyses were first performed in order to compare hours of exercise per week with biological, psychosocial and demographic measures taken in the sample. Three separate backwards linear regression analyses were then performed with depression, anxiety and perceived stress as outcome measures, with hours of exercise and Lubben subscores and total scores as predictors and potential confounders controlled for. Potential confounders controlled for were as follows: age, gender, pain, ADL, IADL, AACI and neuroticism. Use of antidepressants was also controlled for in the analyses concerning depression outcomes. The significance level of <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 was set for all statistical procedures.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>The mean number of hours spent in physical exercise per week in this sample was 5.66 (CI<sub>95</sub> = 5.37–5.99; range 0–28.3). Gender was investigated, and it was found that men engaged in more hours of exercise per week than did women in this sample (t<sub>581</sub> = 2.526, p &lt; 0.05); a mean of 6.27 hours per week (CI<sub>95</sub> = 5.66, 6.88) compared with 5.41 hours of exercise per week for women (CI<sub>95</sub> = 5.06, 5.76). Hours of exercise per week were then correlated with biological, psychosocial and demographic variables gathered within the sample in a series of bivariate Spearman’s rho correlations (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1359105311423861">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<p>In order to investigate potential interactions between hours of exercise and Lubben scores, the interaction products were calculated from the centred variables and entered into a series of linear regressions with depression, anxiety and perceived stress as the dependent variables, and hours of exercise per week, the Lubben total and subscale scores and the interaction products as independent variables (for a full description of these analyses see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1359105311423861">Table 5</xref>). For both anxiety and perceived stress as outcomes, no interactions were found. However, for depression as the outcome variable, there was a significant interaction between hours of exercise per week and total Lubben scores, such that at low hours of exercise per week, low total Lubben scores were indicative of more depression than high total LSNS scores, but at high hours of exercise per week, there appeared to be little effect of total Lubben scores on depression.</p>

<p>There was also an interaction between hours of exercise per week and the ‘Neighbours’ subscale of the Lubben scale. Investigating this interaction revealed that at low levels of exercise per week, participants who had higher social support from neighbours were less depressed than those with lower levels of social support from neighbours, but at high levels of exercise per week, social support from neighbours did not appear to contribute to depression levels.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1359105311423861" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>As expected, both exercise and social support were related with depression, anxiety and perceived stress outcomes, alongside other known predictors of mood such as pain, functional status (IADL), neuroticism and age. The interaction found in depression scores between hours of exercise per week and Lubben social support scores suggested that participants who take large amounts of weekly exercise have less susceptibility to the adverse effects of a lack of social support. In other words, exercise appears to be protective against the effect that social support has on depression. Our results suggest that at a cross-sectional level, both social support and exercise are related to depression, anxiety and perceived stress in an older population.</p>
<p>These findings accord with previous research in the area (eg, Ruuskanen and Ruoppila, 1995). Our population were of limited age range, meaning that we could not investigate whether the association between exercise and depression is stronger in an older population compared to younger populations as put forth by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1359105311423861">Stephens (1988)</xref>. It could only be concluded that, in an older population at least, the association between exercise and psychological outcome is significant. We did take the opportunity to divide the population into younger old (60–75) and older old (75+) during preliminary analyses, and perhaps contrary to expectation, there was no significant difference between the groups in terms of exercise taken, only in terms of the size of their friends social networks, with the younger old group having significantly larger friend social networks. This may be a cohort effect, since friends would be peers and therefore it would make sense that networks would be smaller at older age.</p>
<p>The current investigation did not look for interactions between personality, exercise and social support. Neuroticism was controlled for within the analyses since it has a known association with psychological distress. This may be considered in future research, since it is possible that the exercise-psychological well-being relationship is particularly effective for certain personality types but not others, or that psychological well-being is more contingent on social support than on exercise for other personality types.</p>
<p>Having a high level of perceived social support from friends in particular was related to lower levels of psychological distress among the sample. This is in accordance with previous research. Since for anxiety and stress this effect was independent of the effect of exercise (since the two did not interact), it can be concluded that the effects that socializing and exercise have on anxiety and stress are largely independent; as such the positive effect of exercise on these dimensions of psychological well-being cannot be attributed to incidental socializing.</p>
<p>It is notable that interactions between exercise and social support were significant only for depression outcomes. The current results indicate that the anti-depressant effect of exercise may be related in part to incidental socializing. From a clinical perspective, the current results inform us that in using exercise as an antidepressant, provision of social support needs to be considered also. It is possible that providing social support and exercise has a synergistic effect on depression levels, while anxiety and stress are less affected by these provisions. Further research is required to elucidate these relationships.</p>
<p>There was an interaction between social support from neighbours and exercise for depression outcomes such that at low levels of exercise per week, higher social support from neighbours led to lower depression levels than those receiving lower levels of support from neighbours. Social support from neighbours could represent a locally integrated social network, which is associated with positive outcomes for older adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1359105311423861">Wenger, 1997</xref>) and would explain its protective role in the relationship between low levels of exercise (which may reflect poor mobility) and depression.</p>
<p>All measures in the current study were self-reported. It is possible that the association between social support, exercise and psychological well-being was due to a general pessimism typical to depressed participants, as put forward by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1359105311423861">Antonucci and colleagues (1997)</xref>. Furthermore, the metric of exercise per week was collected as part of a question about hobbies, so incidental exercise, for example, that accrued during housework or during volunteering/employment, are not measured in the current study. Future research using accelerometry or even a more in-depth questionnaire about exercise engagement could more accurately measure an individual’s level of exercise per week, and various facets of exercise, such as intensity of the exercise, duration, frequency, and so on.</p>
<p>While information on participants’ social support was recorded, information on the social nature of the specific exercise taken was not recorded. It may have been a more valid method of investigation to have collected whether exercise taken was social in nature, when investigating potential interactions between socialising and exercise. Future research gathering this information could elucidate the interaction reported here. Also, it is not clear whether the type of social support measured in the current investigation reflects the same type of socializing that may typically occur during exercise. For example, pastimes such as golf, dance classes and yoga were popular among the sample, and these may involve regular interaction with acquaintances, rather than the friends, neighbours and family members alluded to in the Lubben social network scale. Further research is required to clarify what constitutes social contact and what aspects of social contact are beneficial to psychological well-being. This would aid clinicians in identifying at-risk individuals who are deficient in either social networks or incidental socialising with acquaintances.</p>
<p>The current study employed a population who were community-dwelling and on the whole were a relatively healthy sample, such that they were volunteering to participate in this research. As such, the relationship between exercise, social support and mood can hereby only hold for this population; it is possible that for other populations, such as institutionalized older adults, or older adults with poor physical health, the relationship between exercise and mental health may not be so notable.</p>
<p>A strength of the current investigation was the emphasis on various measures of psychological distress; namely, depression, anxiety and perceived stress. Previous research on exercise has typically focused on its ameliorative effects on depression. The current findings indicate that exercise levels are also related to anxiety and perceived stress in the older population. The approach taken here is based on that of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1359105311423861">Salmon’s (2001)</xref> unified approach to mental health.</p>
<p>The scales used in the current study refer to different time frames, for example, the hours of exercise variable relates to exercise per week, the CESD and the HADS-A refer to the past week, the Lubben social network scale and the Perceived Stress scale refer to a month. Since we were primarily interested in the association between hours of exercise per week and general psychological well-being, it is possible that the different time-frames indicated by the different measures may render any statistical association meaningless. The authors acknowledge that in both the Lubben social network scale and the exercise per week question are more averages than the ‘in the past week/month’ style eliciting of the anxiety, depression and stress scales. This concern needs to be taken into account when interpreting the results hereby reported.</p>
<p>The current study measured exercise as hours per week, and this was related to psychological distress levels. This would appear to support the idea of a dose-response relationship between exercise and psychological well-being reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1359105311423861">Dunn and colleagues (2001)</xref>. However the type of exercise (eg, high-impact, low-impact, aerobic, resistance, and so on) was not investigated. While previous research promotes high-intensity exercise as the most effective in reducing psychological distress, this may not be practical for older adults. It could be that another type of exercise is optimal for reducing psychological distress in older adults. Furthermore, exercises were not analysed in terms of the different types of activities – it could be that those activities involving learning a skill, for example, golf or dance classes, could be more enjoyable and beneficial to psychological well-being than a more straightforward activity such as walking or jogging. The current study represents a preliminary investigation into a simple metric of exercise and its relationship with social support and psychological distress, and therefore more research would be required to investigate the effects of different types of exercise on psychological distress with respect to social support.</p>
<p>The current findings have clinical implications for older adults. Since both exercise and social support have a positive impact on psychological well-being, interventions for psychological distress should consider targeting both of these areas. Future research could investigate this issue longitudinally, to see if exercise at baseline predicts psychological distress at follow-up. Furthermore, investigations of social and non-social exercise in older adults could inform the interpretation of the reported interaction between exercise and socializing.</p>
