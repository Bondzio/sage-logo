<abstract>
<p>While majority of the literature documents the preponderance of social identity–related biases in favor of in-group members, this research investigates factors that may attenuate the bias. Examining intergroup bias within the realm of information availability and accessibility, this research highlights malleability of judgments and decisions as a function of social identity in both complete and incomplete information situations in the context of ultimatum games. Study 1 replicates the positive bias toward in-group members even in situations where individuals know that the counterpart is behaving unfairly. Study 2 shows that the intergroup bias is attenuated for relatively unfavorable offers in incomplete information situations. However, the intergroup bias is persistent for relatively favorable offers. Study 3 shows that making situational constraints salient also attenuates the intergroup bias for relatively favorable offers. Together, the findings identify conditions, based on information availability and accessibility, under which the intergroup bias can be corrected.</p>

<p>With the globalization of business activities as well as the increasing mobility and diversity in the general population, it is increasingly common to find business transactions in settings that involve individuals from different countries, cultures, and, in general, social backgrounds. As the social milieu in which most exchange processes are embedded become increasingly complex, it is important to understand how social context and situational constraints influence business transactions (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0146167212458327">Chen, Mannix, &amp; Okumura, 2003</xref>). Arguing that one of the most salient features that individuals confront in an exchange process is their counterpart’s social identity, this research investigates the role of social identity and information availability in determining individuals’ reactions to counterpart’s behavior as well as eventual outcomes.</p>
<p>According to social identity theory, categorizing people into social groups leads to intergroup biases in judgments and decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0146167212458327">Tajfel, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0146167212458327">Tajfel &amp; Turner, 1986</xref>). The need to achieve and preserve positive social identities underlies the phenomenon of in-group favoritism (and out-group derogation), wherein people tend to evaluate one’s own group favorably in comparison to other groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0146167212458327">Tajfel, 1982</xref>). The preference or affinity toward one’s in-group over an out-group has been manifested in terms of attitudes, beliefs, and behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0146167212458327">Turner, 1981</xref>). For example, in the context of conflict management, perceptions of common group identity have been shown to enhance concern for the needs of the other party (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0146167212458327">Rubin, Pruitt, &amp; Kim, 1994</xref>). In contrast, perceptions of a separate group identity enhance the salience of the zero-sum nature of conflicts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0146167212458327">Sidanius, Van Laar, Levin, &amp; Sinclair, 2004</xref>). In sum, in-group favoritism suggests that individuals are likely to interpret and react more favorably when the counterpart is perceived to be a member of their own social group than from another social group (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0146167212458327">Brewer &amp; Kramer, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0146167212458327">Kramer, Pommerenke, &amp; Newton, 1993</xref>).</p>
<p>Although majority of the existing literature documents the preponderance of in-group favoritism (and out-group derogation), the literature on identifying conditions where the intergroup bias is attenuated is relatively sparse. The few studies examining factors that may reduce the intergroup bias rely primarily on altering individuals’ conceptual representations of group membership (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0146167212458327">Crisp &amp; Beck, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0146167212458327">Ensari &amp; Miller, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0146167212458327">Gaertner, Mann, Murrell, &amp; Dovidio, 1989</xref>). For example, inducing individuals of different groups to recategorize themselves as belonging to a common more inclusive group reduces intergroup bias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0146167212458327">Gaertner &amp; Dovidio, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0146167212458327">Gaertner et al., 1989</xref>). Similarly, inducing individuals to think of characteristics shared between the in-group and out-group reduced intergroup favoritism, more so for those who identified with their in-group weakly than strongly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0146167212458327">Crisp &amp; Beck, 2005</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0146167212458327">Ensari and Miller (2002)</xref> showed that self-disclosure or revealing significant aspects of the self to another, along with typicality of group membership and salience of intergroup differences, reduced bias toward new out-group members. The current research adds to this growing literature by examining whether situational factors such as information availability and salience of situational constraints represent restricting conditions for the display of in-group favoritism.</p>
<p>Specifically, the present research investigates intergroup bias (i.e., in-group favoritism) and the factors that may reduce the bias in the context of an ultimatum game. In a typical ultimatum game, one agent (proposer) makes an offer to another agent (responder) that divides a specified sum of money between the two agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0146167212458327">Camerer &amp; Thaler, 1995</xref>). The responder can then either accept or reject the offer. If the offer is accepted, the sum of money is divided as proposed, and the game ends. If the offer is rejected, both agents receive nothing, and the game ends. An ultimatum game provides the appropriate context as it not only is a model for basic transactions but also represents a building block for more complex and more descriptive types of bargaining (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0146167212458327">Camerer &amp; Thaler, 1995</xref>). Ultimatum games represent the end state of continuous bargaining as well as the simplest form of a take-it-or-leave-it transaction. Attesting to its importance as a model of strategic behavior, ultimatum games have been widely used to document behavioral regularities that were interpreted to imply that fairness considerations often override strategic considerations (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0146167212458327">Straub &amp; Murnighan, 1995</xref>). Importantly, for the purposes of this research, ultimatum games offer a simple structure that allows isolation of the factors of interest and examine individuals’ behavioral reactions to their counterpart’s behavior based on counterpart’s social identity, information availability, and salience of situational constraints.</p>
<p>Several aspects of the present research are noteworthy. First, much of the prior research on understanding intergroup bias has focused predominantly on attitudinal and perceptual measures. The ultimatum bargaining context used in the present investigation allows us to examine the reduction of intergroup bias on a behavioral measure (i.e., accept or reject an offer in an ultimatum game), in addition to attitudinal measures. Second, the present article, after confirming the preponderance of the intergroup bias, investigates attenuating conditions due to two situational factors: amount of information available and salience of situational constraints. More generally, these two factors correspond to conditions where all information is not present or equally accessible. Understanding the role of information in the formation of identity biases is of interest because, although the importance of social categories in the formation of norms under conditions of ambiguity is recognized (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0146167212458327">Fiske &amp; Taylor, 1991</xref>), relatively little research examines the role of social identity in incomplete information situations.</p>
<p>Previous research has tended to focus more on complete information situations where both parties in an exchange process have access to clear and objective referents (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0146167212458327">Croson, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0146167212458327">Huck, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0146167212458327">van den Bos, Lind, Vermunt, &amp; Wilke, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0146167212458327">White &amp; Neale, 1994</xref>). Readily available referents allow individuals to assess the fairness of potential outcomes with relative ease. However, many exchange settings are complex, characterized by uncertainty and information asymmetry (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0146167212458327">Pinkley, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0146167212458327">Srivastava, 2001</xref>). Although previous research has examined the effect of social identity along with factors that affect perceived risk (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0146167212458327">Brewer &amp; Kramer, 1986</xref>), the present research is more closely related to situations of uncertainty where it is difficult to assess fairness of potential outcomes (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0146167212458327">van den Bos et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0146167212458327">van den Bos &amp; Lind, 2002</xref>). Furthermore, unlike previous research that argues that people use the fairness of the procedure to assess fairness of outcomes (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0146167212458327">van den Bos et al., 1997</xref>), the present research holds the process constant and examines how the counterpart’s social identity may influence perceptions of fairness and thereby outcomes when fairness can be determined with certainty (i.e., complete information) versus uncertainty (i.e., incomplete information). Facing information asymmetry, individuals may form different expectations about the mutual gains from trade as well as the attractiveness of potential outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0146167212458327">White &amp; Neale, 1994</xref>). The present research thus not only adds to the few studies on the role of social identity in complete information situations but also extends the literature by examining how a counterpart’s social identity affects expectations of distributive justice and, thus, results in a different set of outcomes in incomplete information situations (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0146167212458327">Kramer, Shah, &amp; Woerner, 1995</xref>). Examining both complete and incomplete information situations allows us to explore conditions under which the intergroup bias (in-group favoritism or out-group derogation) can be bounded.</p>
<p>The present research also highlights the importance of attribution processes in the presence of uncertainty. Attribution theory suggests that individuals seek to meaningfully explain others’ behavior in terms of its underlying causes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0146167212458327">Fiske &amp; Taylor, 1991</xref>), and this inclination is particularly strong in information-poor conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0146167212458327">Kelley, 1972</xref>). An aspect of attribution theory that is key in the context of ultimatum bargaining is an individuals’ perceptions of the level of self-interest and competitiveness that underlie counterparts’ behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0146167212458327">Morris, Larrick, &amp; Su, 1999</xref>). In the absence of objective referents, individuals’ perceptions and behavior are likely to be more susceptible to cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0146167212458327">Kelley, 1972</xref>), such as the counterpart’s social identity. For example, the same positive action may be attributed to a competitive dispositional (internal) trait rather than to situational (external) factors more often when the counterpart is from an out-group than an in-group. Because the overattribution bias is more likely to occur when situational constraints are not salient, the present research examines whether it is possible to mitigate or even eliminate the intergroup bias when the context allows for situational constraints to be made salient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0146167212458327">Nisbett &amp; Ross, 1980</xref>). In sum, further understanding of the interplay between these two situational factors and the social cues embedded in the decision-making environment provides a fruitful framework for relevant theoretical advancement using the case of ultimatum games.</p>

<title>Role of Counterpart’s Social Identity</title>
<p>Extensive research shows that individuals are active in understanding their social world and that social cues play a critical role in shaping expectations, attributions, and behavior (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0146167212458327">Fiske &amp; Taylor, 1991</xref>). Arguably, one of the first features individuals confront in a bargaining transaction is the social identity of a counterpart. Accordingly, a central premise of this research is that the contextual or social features of the transaction, such as characteristics of the bargaining counterpart, may influence individuals’ strategic decision making and behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0146167212458327">Chen et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0146167212458327">Kramer et al., 1993</xref>).</p>
<p>Social identity theory suggests that membership in a social group affects judgment and decision making in both interpersonal and intergroup contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0146167212458327">Tajfel &amp; Turner, 1979</xref>). Social identity is defined as part of an individual’s self-concept that is derived from being a member of a social group including the value and emotional significance linked to that membership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0146167212458327">Tajfel, 1981</xref>). As such, one’s nationality, ethnicity, gender, occupation, or peer group helps in defining one’s social identity, who one is, and how one perceives others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0146167212458327">Fiske &amp; Taylor, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0146167212458327">Tajfel, 1981</xref>). Social identity has implications for how individuals from either one’s group or from other groups are perceived, and how one interacts with in-group and out-group members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0146167212458327">Tajfel, 1981</xref>). The central finding regarding the role of social identity in conflict resolution is that an action by a member of one’s own group is evaluated quite differently from an identical action by a member of another social group (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0146167212458327">Brewer &amp; Kramer, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0146167212458327">Kramer et al., 1993</xref>). In particular, in-group members are expected to practice a certain amount of diligence, monitor their own contribution to the group, and be more cooperative than out-group members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0146167212458327">LeBoeuf &amp; Shafir, 2003</xref>) because they are expected to care about fulfilling not only instrumental goals but also relational goals in their interactions with members of their own group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0146167212458327">De Cremer &amp; Van Vugt, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>In the context of ultimatum games, “reciprocity expectations” between proposers and responders play an important role in shaping bargaining behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0146167212458327">Camerer &amp; Thaler, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0146167212458327">Güth, 1995</xref>). The standard economic prediction is that because any amount of money is better than nothing, a rational proposer should offer (and the responder should accept) the smallest unit of currency. Contrary to the normative prediction, proposers typically offer 40% of the total amount and responders typically reject offers that represent less than 25% of the total amount (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0146167212458327">Camerer &amp; Thaler, 1995</xref>). These systematic deviations from the normative prediction have been attributed to bargainers’ assessment of what is expected as fair or “reciprocable” counterpart’s behavior. Arguably, individuals’ prior expectations and fairness perceptions are likely to be affected by certain features such as the transaction counterpart’s social identity. Importantly, the effect of social identity and the attributions that are triggered may depend on the information available to assess counterpart’s behavior. We thus differentiate between complete and incomplete information conditions.</p>
<sec id="section2-0146167212458327">
<title>Complete Information</title>
<p>In complete information ultimatum games, the outcomes can be easily evaluated because both proposers and responders have knowledge of the total amount available for division. The obvious determinant of whether or not a responder accepts an offer is the size of the offer and the relative share of the total amount it represents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0146167212458327">Croson, 1996</xref>). An offer representing an equal share of the available amount may be perceived similarly regardless of whether the offer comes from an in-group or out-group proposer. However, the proposer’s social identity is likely to play a more dominant role when an offer is clearly unfair. Because unfair offers, representing an unequal share of the total amount, are more likely to trigger dissonance and conflict, the social identity of a counterpart may loom large (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0146167212458327">Brewer, 1979</xref>). Research suggests two competing predictions regarding how a responder is likely to react to an unfair offer depending on whether the proposer is an in-group or out-group member (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0146167212458327">Kramer et al., 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>The first prediction, termed the <italic>intergroup bias hypothesis</italic>, suggests that responders will react more positively to offers from in-group members than out-group members (or negatively to offers from out-group than in-group members). The rationale is that a fundamental mode of social categorization is “us” versus “them” where “us” is evaluated more favorably than “them” under most circumstances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0146167212458327">Fiske &amp; Taylor, 1991</xref>). The affective and evaluative responses that this categorization evokes are prone to reflect in-group favoritism (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0146167212458327">Brewer &amp; Kramer, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0146167212458327">Kramer et al., 1993</xref>). In general, out-group members are perceived as less honest, less trustworthy, and less cooperative than in-group members. Accordingly, individuals are likely to react more positively (negatively) to unfair offers coming from an in-group (out-group) proposer relative to an out-group (in-group) proposer.</p>
<list id="list1-0146167212458327" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 1</italic>: The intergroup bias hypothesis predicts that in ultimatum games with complete information, acceptance rates and perceptions of fairness will be higher when an unfair offer comes from an in-group proposer than an out-group proposer.</p></list-item></list>
<p>The second prediction, termed the <italic>expectancy violation hypothesis</italic>, suggests that responders will react more negatively to unfair offers when they come from in-group rather than out-group proposers. The rationale is that individuals expect in-group members to behave in a more cooperative and trustworthy manner when interacting with members of their group. Individuals from the same social group share similar values and norms, and this shared sense of identity suggests that unfair offers are not expected from in-group members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0146167212458327">Brewer, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0146167212458327">Kramer &amp; Brewer, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0146167212458327">Kramer et al., 1995</xref>). To the extent to which in-group members are expected to be trustworthy and cooperative, responders are likely to react more negatively to an unfair offer when it comes from an in-group versus out-group proposer.</p>

<sec id="section3-0146167212458327">
<title>Incomplete Information</title>
<p>Consider a one-sided incomplete information situation where the responder is uncertain but the proposer knows the total amount available for division. Prior findings suggest that proposers tend to offer less when responders do not have full information about the total amount available because it is difficult to assess fairness of the offer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0146167212458327">Güth, Huck, &amp; Ockenfels, 1996</xref>). Furthermore, proposers become more strategic as they only have to appear fair but not actually be fair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0146167212458327">Schmitt, 2004</xref>). However, lacking objective referents, responders become primarily concerned with the relative share or proportion of the total amount that a proposer’s offer represents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0146167212458327">Croson, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>Incomplete information triggers attribution processes such that responders seek to causally explain a proposer’s behavior (i.e., the offer made). As such, responders may use the proposer’s offer to infer the total amount available for division and, thereby, the proportion of the total amount that a specific offer represents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0146167212458327">Srivastava, 2001</xref>). Furthermore, attributions and associated inferences are also likely to follow an intergroup bias depending on whether the proposer is an in-group versus out-group member (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0146167212458327">Taylor &amp; Jaggi, 1974</xref>). That is, research suggests that people tend to attribute behavior in ways that reflects positively on the in-group but negatively on the out-group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0146167212458327">Hewstone, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0146167212458327">Islam &amp; Hewstone, 1993</xref>). We examine responders’ assessments and reactions to two different proposer offers.</p>
<p>Consider an offer of US$12.50 when the total amount available for division is US$25. Although an offer of US$12.50 is objectively fair in complete information situations when both parties know the total amount available, fairness assessments are ambiguous in an incomplete information situation where a responder only knows that the total amount could assume any whole number between US$10 and US$40 with equal probability (uniform distribution). Because US$25 represents the mean of the distribution, the likelihood that US$12.50 represents a favorable (equal or more than equal share) or an unfavorable (unequal share) offer from the responders’ perspective is 50% in both cases. In other words, given the uncertainty about the total amount, an offer of US$12.50 is likely to lead to ambiguous inferences regarding the relative share of the total amount and thereby affect the assessment of its fairness. In a situation where objective referents are not available, the persistent in-group favoritism (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0146167212458327">Brewer &amp; Kramer, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0146167212458327">Hogg &amp; Turner, 1985</xref>) suggests that perceptions of fairness and acceptance rates are likely to be higher when the offer of US$12.50 comes from an in-group proposer than an out-group proposer.</p>
<p>Now consider an offer of US$7.50 when the total amount available for division is US$25. Because the responder only knows that the total amount available could be any whole number between US$10 and US$40 with equal probability (uniform distribution), the likelihood that the offer represents an unfavorable (unequal) division is high leading to the belief that the counterpart could be trying to take advantage of the information asymmetry by offering a relatively small portion of the total amount. Although research shows that there is a natural tendency to overattribute unfavorable behavior to personality traits such as level of competitiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0146167212458327">Morris et al., 1999</xref>), it is possible that, as in the complete information situation, responders will continue giving the benefit of the doubt to in-group but not to out-group proposers. Alternatively, even loyal in-group individuals may be somewhat concerned about fairness from members of their group and maintaining a sense of personal identity and self-esteem within the group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0146167212458327">Wilder, 1986</xref>). An unfavorable offer when the responder has incomplete information may be perceived as an attempt by the in-group proposer to take undue advantage of the situation at the expense of one’s own vulnerable group member. This reasoning suggests a likely attenuation of the intergroup bias such that perceptions of fairness and acceptance rates may not differ when an unfavorable offer comes from an in-group or an out-group proposer.</p>
<p>At the extreme, it is possible that the in-group bias may be negative. Some prior work suggests that while favorable in-group members are evaluated more positively than comparable out-group members, deviant in-group members are evaluated more negatively than similar out-group members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0146167212458327">Biernat, Vescio, &amp; Billings, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0146167212458327">Marques &amp; Yzerbyt 1988</xref>). The reasoning is that people are motivated to view their in-group as favorably distinct to the out-group. Good in-group members contribute positively to the overall image of the in-group and their evaluation relative to comparable out-group members. In contrast, bad in-group members or “black sheep” contribute negatively to the image of the in-group, and the evaluative bias in favor of the in-group is manifested in the evaluative derogation of those members relative to comparable out-group members. The literature considers this black sheep effect a sophisticated form of in-group favoritism. As such, at the extreme, acceptance rates could even be lower, and perceptions of counterpart competitiveness could be higher in incomplete information situations when the US$7.50 offer comes from an in-group versus out-group proposer.</p>

<title>Situational Salience</title>
<p>Although we argue that the intergroup bias may be attenuated when the offer is relatively unfavorable in incomplete information situations, the intergroup bias or in-group favoritism is still manifested when the offer is relatively favorable. Given the tendency to seek causal explanation for counterpart’s behavior, it is likely that the fundamental attribution error occurs because explanations based on personality dispositions are the first plausible ones to come to mind as they are more cognitively available. Moreover, people do not exert the cognitive effort to consider less obvious situational explanations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0146167212458327">Hewstone, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0146167212458327">Nisbett &amp; Ross, 1980</xref>). We propose that, to the extent that even an offer of US$12.50 is attributed to the proposer’s personality disposition such as competitiveness for out-group versus in-group proposers, it is possible that the bias could be mitigated by making situational constraints salient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0146167212458327">Nisbett &amp; Ross, 1980</xref>).</p>
<p>Although there are no referents to assess one’s attributions in incomplete information situations, individuals who expend the cognitive effort to think about situational constraints may be less likely to overweight inferred personality traits in their judgments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0146167212458327">Corneille, Leyens, &amp; Yzerbyt, 1999</xref>). Said differently, the extent to which situational constraints are made salient, responders are less likely to attribute a relatively high offer of US$12.50 to a proposer’s competitiveness, particularly for out-group members, and more likely to take into account possible situational constraints, such as the fact that the total amount available may be smaller. Thus, estimates of the percentage of the total amount that the US$12.50 offer represents should be higher for out-group proposers when the situational constraints are salient. In sum, the intergroup bias is likely to be attenuated, even for favorable offers, when possible situational constraints, such as the amount available for division, are made salient.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section7-0146167212458327">
<title>Participants and procedure</title>
<p>One hundred twenty-six undergraduate business students were randomly assigned to a 2 (proposer’s social identity: in-group and out-group) × 2 (offer: US$7.50 and US$12.50) between-subjects design. Participants were told that they would be participating in a proposer–responder game with another individual.</p>
<p>As participants entered the session, they were randomly divided into two groups. The study was conducted in two adjacent rooms, each group being seated in a different room. All participants were required to read the instructions, which described the proposer–responder game. They read that in the proposer–responder game, two individuals, the proposer and the responder have to agree on how to divide a given amount of money between them (say US$10). The proposer starts by making an offer of US$X, which is less than or equal to US$10, to the responder in any way she or he chooses to do so. The responder can then either accept the offer, in which case she or he will receive US$X and the proposer will get to keep the balance, US$(10 − X), or the responder can reject the offer, whereupon both receive nothing. The instructions emphasized that the proposer can only make one offer and the offer cannot be withdrawn while the responder can accept or reject the offer. Playing in a complete information situation, participants were told that both parties know the total amount to be divided by the proposer was US$25.</p>
<p>Participants were instructed that they would be randomly paired with another student who was not in the room and the identities of all individuals would remain anonymous before, during, and after the study. Participants were assigned a number, which they were led to believe would be used to match them with another individual. They were told that students had been randomly assigned the role of the proposer or responder. Based on a coin toss, students in their room had been assigned the role of the responder.</p>
<p>Participants were given 10 min to read the instructions and seek clarification, if required. After ensuring that everyone understood the proposer–responder game and the task, the numbers assigned to participants at the beginning were called out in random order. Participants were then handed a sheet with their respective offers, purportedly from another student playing the role of the proposer. The instructions emphasized that they could either accept or reject the offer. They had to first accept or reject the offer on the same sheet that contained the assigned proposer’s offer. They were then asked to respond to several other measures.</p>
<p>No communication was allowed through the duration of the study that took about 30 min. After completion, participants were thoroughly debriefed. The debriefing revealed that everyone believed the cover story that they were actually playing the proposer–responder game with another individual who had been randomly assigned the role of the proposer.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0146167212458327">
<title>Experimental variables</title>
<p>The two experimental variables were embedded in the instructions. Social identity was manipulated at two levels. In the in-group condition, participants were told that they were randomly paired with another student from their own class. They were told that students in the adjacent room had all been randomly assigned to play the role of a proposer. To enhance the credibility of the cover story, about 10 min into the study, an individual was sent into each of the two rooms with a large brown envelope, purportedly containing the offers, which proposers in the other room had just made. In the out-group condition, participants were told that they would be randomly paired with another student from a historically competing university located in the same region. They were told that their counterpart was randomly chosen to play the role of the proposer and that they had been chosen to play the role of the responder. To enhance the credibility of the cover story, the offers were packaged in a sealed Federal Express envelope that had supposedly arrived from the rival university. Furthermore, when the offers were handed out, a letterhead with the rival university’s logo was in plain view of the participants. In both cases, social identity was common knowledge as it was announced that the proposer knew the responder’s social identity as well.</p>
<p>Offer size was manipulated at two levels. In the favorable offer condition, the proposer’s offer was US$12.50, representing an equal share of the total amount available for division. In the unfavorable offer condition, the offer was US$7.50, representing an unequal share of the total amount. The offers were presented on a separate sheet of paper and were handwritten to be consistent with the cover story.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0146167212458327">
<title>Dependent measures</title>
<p>After receiving the offer, participants responded to several dependent measures. First, they indicated their decision to accept or reject the offer in the same sheet of paper that contained the offer. They were told that this sheet would go back to the proposer (these were collected separately). Second, perceptions of offer fairness were measured by asking, “To what extent was the proposer’s offer fair?” (1 = <italic>very unfair</italic>; 7 = <italic>very fair</italic>). In addition to fairness perceptions, responders’ emotional reactions were measured by averaging responses to two items (<italic>r</italic> = .77). The two items were “To what extent were you happy with the proposer’s offer?” (1 = <italic>very unhappy</italic>; 7 = <italic>very happy</italic>) and “To what extent were you irritated with the proposer’s offer?” (1 = <italic>not at all irritated</italic>; 7 = <italic>very irritated, reverse scaled</italic>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0146167212458327">
<title>Social identity pretest</title>
<p>A pretest with 66 undergraduate business students tested the efficacy of the social identity manipulation. None of these students participated in the main study. Participants were asked to read a description of the proposer–responder game, but no specific offer was provided. After they had responded to some questions regarding the comprehension of the game, they were asked to provide evaluations of students in their class and students at the rival university used in the main study. In particular, they were asked, “In general, how would you evaluate a student from your introductory marketing class at (NAME OF THEIR SCHOOL)” (1 = <italic>very unfavorably</italic>; 7 = <italic>very favorably</italic>) and “How much do you have in common with other students from your introductory marketing class at (NAME OF THEIR SCHOOL)?” (1 = <italic>not at all</italic>; 7 = <italic>a lot</italic>). They were asked identical questions about students from a similar introductory marketing class at the rival school.</p>
<p>Results show that participants rated students from their own school significantly more favorably than students from the rival school. Specifically, evaluations of students from the same class in their school (<italic>M</italic> = 5.03, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.23) were significantly higher than evaluations of students from the rival school (<italic>M</italic> = 3.76, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.33), mean difference = 1.27, <italic>SE</italic> = .32, <italic>t</italic>(65) = 4.37, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001 (95% confidence interval [CI] = [−1.90, −.63]), and participants felt that they had more in common with other students in their school (<italic>M</italic> = 4.72, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.46) compared with students of the same class from the rival school (<italic>M</italic> = 3.35, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.20), mean difference = 1.37, <italic>SE</italic> = .33, <italic>t</italic>(65) = 5.67, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001 (95% CI = [−2.02, −.71]). These data indicate that social identity was successfully manipulated by altering the school of the counterpart in ultimatum bargaining.</p>

<title>Results and Discussion</title>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0146167212458327">Table 1</xref> provides a summary of the dependent measures as a function of the experimental variables. Acceptance rate was analyzed using a log-linear model as a function of the manipulated factors and their interactions. In general, acceptance rates were significantly affected by offer size, χ<sup>2</sup>(1) = 34.66, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, social identity, χ<sup>2</sup>(1) = 4.27, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, and the interaction between offer size and social identity, χ<sup>2</sup>(1) = 3.61, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .06. Analyzing the interaction further, in the US$12.50 condition, where the offer represented an equal division of the total amount available, there was no significant difference in acceptance rates across in-group (91.7%) and out-group proposers (81%), χ<sup>2</sup>(1) = 1.64, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .10. However, in the US$7.50 offer condition, consistent with the intergroup bias hypothesis (Hypothesis 1), but in contrast to the expectation violation hypothesis (Hypothesis 2), the acceptance rates were significantly higher when the proposers were in-group (41.7%) versus out-group proposers (23.1%), χ<sup>2</sup>(1) = 2.69, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05.</p>

<p>Consistent with their behavior, an ANOVA on participants’ assessment of offer fairness revealed a significant effect of offer size, <italic>F</italic>(1, 122) = 170.55, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, η<sup>2</sup> = .57, social identity, <italic>F</italic>(1, 122) = 6.14, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01, η<sup>2</sup> = .06, and the interaction between offer size and social identity, <italic>F</italic>(1, 122) = 5.16, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, η<sup>2</sup> = .04. Participants perceived the US$7.50 offer to be less fair when the offer was from an out-group proposer (<italic>M</italic> = 2.19, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.74) than an in-group proposer (<italic>M</italic> = 3.08, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.56), <italic>F</italic>(1, 74) = 10.95, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01, η<sup>2</sup> = .13.</p>
<p>The data on emotional reactions corroborate the findings. An ANOVA revealed a significant effect of offer size, <italic>F</italic>(1, 122) = 60.95, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, η<sup>2</sup> = .32, social identity, <italic>F</italic>(1, 122) = 2.54, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .10, η<sup>2</sup> = .02, and the interaction between offer size and social identity, <italic>F</italic>(1, 122) = 3.49, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .60, η<sup>2</sup> = .03. Responders were less happy and more irritated when a US$7.50 offer came from an out-group proposer (<italic>M</italic> = 2.79, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.20) than an in-group proposer (<italic>M</italic> = 3.73, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.70), <italic>F</italic>(1, 74) = 6.08, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01, η<sup>2</sup> = .05. This variable was significantly correlated with fairness perceptions (<italic>r</italic> = .85).</p>
<p>Study 1 showed that a counterpart’s social identity affects outcomes when both parties have complete information. While previous research suggests that responders typically reject offers when there is no doubt that the offer is unfair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0146167212458327">Huck, 1999</xref>), our results qualify this finding. Consistent with previous research (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0146167212458327">Kramer et al., 1995</xref>), our findings suggest that even when the offer is clearly unfair, the intergroup bias exists such that individuals react more positively (negatively) when the offer comes from an in-group (out-group) member. In other words, in-group favoritism is manifested such that individuals’ tolerance for inequity is higher when dealing with an in-group counterpart than an out-group counterpart.</p>
<p>Given the persistent intergroup bias in the context of a complete information ultimatum game, Study 2 explores whether the intergroup bias can be reduced in an incomplete information situation where individuals are likely to behave differently as there are no objective referents against which to judge fairness of potential outcomes. In such situations, the attributions and inferences made about the cause underlying a counterpart’s offer assume particular significance.</p>

<title>Participants and procedure</title>
<p>One hundred twenty-nine undergraduate business students participated in this study. Participants were randomly assigned to a 2 (proposer’s social identity: in-group and out-group) × 2 (offer: US$7.50 and US$12.50) between-subjects design. The experimental variables were manipulated exactly as in Study 1 as were the procedures, except that Study 2 used an incomplete information situation. Participants were told that the amount given to the proposer to divide would be determined as follows. The instructions mentioned that the experimenter would randomly draw a ticket from a jar that has tickets numbered from 10 to 40. The number on the ticket that the experimenter randomly picks will be the amount that the proposer has to divide. The proposer will know the exact amount to be divided but the responder will only know that the amount could be any whole number between 10 and 40 with equal probability. They were also told that both parties know that the proposer knows the exact amount to be divided while the responder only knows that the amount could assume any number between 10 and 40 with equal probability.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0146167212458327">
<title>Dependent measures</title>
<p>As in Study 1, participants were asked to respond to several dependent measures. First, they accepted or rejected the offer. Second, perceptions of offer fairness and responders’ emotional reactions were measured using 7-point items. Third, participants were asked to evaluate the person playing the role of the proposer following Morris et al.’s (1999) approach. They were asked, “In your opinion, the person playing the role of the proposer most likely is” (1 = <italic>competitive/untrustworthy/not at all considerate</italic>; 7 = <italic>cooperative/trustworthy/considerate</italic>). An average of these three 7-point items was used to measure counterpart competitiveness (Cronbach’s α = .88). These three variables were significantly correlated: fairness and emotional reactions (<italic>r</italic> = .64), fairness and competitiveness (<italic>r</italic> = .61), and emotional reactions with competitiveness (<italic>r</italic> = .58).</p>
<p>Last, participants were asked to indicate how close and how favorable they felt about other students in their introductory marketing course in their school compared with students in a similar class at a rival school. Participants felt closer to and more favorable toward students in their own school relative to students in the rival school (both <italic>p</italic>s &lt; .001). Along with the pretest prior to Study 1, this result shows that social identity was successfully manipulated.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-0146167212458327">
<title>Offer pretest</title>
<p>Note that in an incomplete information context, we argued that an offer of US$12.50 and US$7.50 are perceived, respectively, as relatively favorable and unfavorable. A pretest conducted with 90 undergraduate business students validated this assumption. None of the participants in the pretest participated in the main study. Participants were randomly assigned to a 2 (social identity: in-group and out-group) × 2 (offer: US$12.50 and US$7.50) between-subjects design. The experimental manipulations and procedures used in the pretest were identical to those used in the main study. After ensuring that participants understood the proposer–responder game, they received their respective offers and were asked to answer several dependent measures. First, participants were asked, “In your estimate, how likely is it that the offer you received is half of the total amount available for division?” (1 = <italic>very unlikely</italic>; 9 = <italic>very likely</italic>). As expected, perceived likelihood of the offer being half of the total amount was higher in the US$12.50 condition (<italic>M</italic> = 4.05, <italic>SD</italic> = 2.18) than in the US$7.50 condition (<italic>M</italic> = 3.02, <italic>SD</italic> = 2.00), <italic>F</italic>(1, 87) = 5.49, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .02, η<sup>2</sup> = .06. Second, subjects were asked, “How likely it is that the offer is less than half of the total amount available for division?” (1 = <italic>very unlikely</italic>; 9 = <italic>very likely</italic>) and “How certain are you about your assessment above?” (1 = <italic>very certain</italic>; 9 = <italic>very uncertain</italic>). Participants perceived the likelihood of the offer to be less than half of the total to be significantly higher in the US$7.50 condition (<italic>M</italic> = 7.34, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.58) relative to the US$12.50 condition (<italic>M</italic> = 6.40, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.96), <italic>F</italic>(1, 87) = 6.25, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01, η<sup>2</sup> = .07. Participants were also more certain of their assessment that the offer is less than half of the total amount in the US$7.50 (<italic>M</italic> = 3.52, <italic>SD</italic> = 2.40) versus the US$12.50 condition (<italic>M</italic> = 5.03, <italic>SD</italic> = 2.46), <italic>F</italic>(1, 87) = 10.97, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, η<sup>2</sup> = .10.

<p>Consistent with the well-documented intergroup bias, Hypothesis 3 states that a relatively favorable offer would be more favorably received when coming from an in-group proposer than an out-group proposer. However, the intergroup bias will be attenuated when individuals receive an unfavorable offer in what they consider a vulnerable incomplete information situation. A log-linear analysis of the acceptance rates revealed significant effect of offer size, χ<sup>2</sup>(1) = 4.60, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, a nonsignificant effect of social identity, χ<sup>2</sup>(1) = 0.01, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .70, but a significant interaction between offer size and social identity, χ<sup>2</sup>(1) = 6.011, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01. A planned contrast showed that although directionally consistent with the black sheep effect, the acceptance rates did not differ significantly when the US$7.50 offer came from an in-group proposer (33.3%) than an out-group proposer (45%), χ<sup>2</sup>(1) = 2.01, <italic>p &gt; .</italic>10. A 2 × 2 ANOVA on perceptions of fairness revealed a significant interaction between offer size and social identity, <italic>F</italic>(1, 125) = 8.62, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01, η<sup>2</sup> = .07. The planned contrast revealed that fairness perceptions were not significantly different when the US$7.50 offer came from an in-group (<italic>M</italic> = 2.87, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.20) than an out-group proposer (<italic>M</italic> = 3.80, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.53), <italic>F</italic>(1, 62) = 1.98, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .10, η<sup>2</sup> = .03. Another ANOVA on emotional reactions revealed a significant interaction between offer size and social identity, <italic>F</italic>(1, 125) = 7.10, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01, η<sup>2</sup> = .06. The planned contrast revealed that emotional reactions (positive affect) to the US$7.50 offer were marginally lower when the offer came from an in-group (<italic>M</italic> = 2.87, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.20) than an out-group proposer (<italic>M</italic> = 3.65, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.26), <italic>F</italic>(1, 62) = 2.73, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .10, η<sup>2</sup> = .04. Finally, an ANOVA on perceptions of proposer competitiveness revealed a similar significant interaction between offer size and social identity, <italic>F</italic>(1, 125) = 9.65, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01, η<sup>2</sup> = .08. The planned contrast revealed that proposers were perceived to be more competitive when the US$7.50 offer came from an in-group (<italic>M</italic> = 4.07, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.61) than an out-group proposer (<italic>M</italic> = 2.57, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.73), <italic>F</italic>(1, 62) = 3.62, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .06, η<sup>2</sup> = .06.</p>
<p>Although acceptance rates did not reach significance, the attitudinal and inferential measures suggest that the bias toward in-group members can be attenuated (or even reversed) under certain conditions. Consistent with Hypothesis 3, the findings support that the combination of incomplete information and relatively low offer indeed attenuates the intergroup bias observed in the complete information situation in Study 1.</p>
<p>However, acceptance rates were higher when the US$12.50 offer came from in-group proposers (78.6%) than out-group proposers (56.2%), χ<sup>2</sup>(1) = 4.09, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05. Perceptions of fairness were significantly higher when the US$12.50 offer came from in-group proposers than out-group proposers (<italic>M</italic> = 4.43, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.20, and <italic>M</italic> = 3.63, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.18), <italic>F</italic>(1, 63) = 3.17, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .03, η<sup>2</sup> = .09, and emotional reactions to the offer were marginally higher in the in-group versus the out-group conditions (<italic>M</italic> = 3.71, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.28, and <italic>M</italic> = 3.25, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.38), <italic>F</italic>(1, 63) = 2.05, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .07, η<sup>2</sup> = .07. However, although directionally consistent, perceptions of opponents’ competitiveness were not reliably lower (<italic>M</italic> = 4.00, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.49, and <italic>M</italic> = 3.67, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.62), <italic>F</italic>(1, 63) = 0.70, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .40. These data provide support for the contention that for relatively favorable offers, that are ambiguous with respect to the relative proportion of the total amount, individuals are still likely to give the benefit of the doubt to in-group counterparts.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Study 2 finds that the intergroup bias is attenuated (and in some measures even reversed) as members of one’s group are evaluated more negatively when the offer is apparently unfavorable. This pattern of results, at the extreme, could display the black sheep effect where an undesirable action by an in-group member is judged more severely than an identical action by an out-group member. The result is in contrast to Study 1 where the unfair offer of US$7.50 elicited more positive reaction when the proposer was an in-group member than an out-group member. We argue that the role of expectations may be more pronounced in an incomplete information situation where responders are clearly vulnerable to exploitative behavior. Individuals may expect in-group counterparts to behave in a more cooperative and trustworthy manner particularly when responders facing uncertainty are in a weak and vulnerable position. Given this expectation, an apparent unfavorable offer may be perceived as an attempt by an in-group counterpart to take advantage of their superior position even at the expense of one of their own. Consistent with this reasoning, the relatively low offer of US$7.50 was judged as less positive, and the counterpart was perceived to be more competitive when the proposer was an in-group member than an out-group member.</p>
<p>To determine whether responders’ expectations were indeed different for an in-group proposer based on information availability, we measured expectations of 102 undergraduate students who read the ultimatum bargaining scenario used in Study 1 (complete information) and Study 2 (incomplete information). Although all participants were in the in-group condition, half of them were randomly assigned to the complete information condition, whereas the other half were assigned to the incomplete information condition. After reading the scenario carefully, they were asked three questions: “How likely is it that the Proposer will offer you half of the total amount available for division?” “How likely is it that the Proposer will take advantage of you?” (1 = <italic>very unlikely</italic>; 7 = <italic>very likely</italic>), and “I would be more likely to tolerate selfish behavior from a fellow classmate” (1 = <italic>not at all</italic>; 7 = <italic>very much</italic>). The perceived likelihood of receiving half of the total amount was higher in the complete information (<italic>M</italic> = 4.46, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.79) relative to the incomplete information condition (<italic>M</italic> = 3.71, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.61), <italic>F</italic>(1, 98) = 4.14, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, η<sup>2</sup> = .05. The likelihood that the proposer would take advantage of the situation was marginally lower in the complete information (<italic>M</italic> = 4.88, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.20) than in the incomplete information condition (<italic>M</italic> = 5.35, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.61), <italic>F</italic>(1, 98) = 2.32, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .10, η<sup>2</sup> = .03. Finally, the extent to which they would be likely to tolerate selfish behavior from an in-group member was higher in the complete information condition (<italic>M</italic> = 5.13, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.67) than in the incomplete information (<italic>M</italic> = 4.58, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.52), <italic>F</italic>(1, 98) = 3.51, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .06, η<sup>2</sup> = .04. These data provide support for our reasoning that responders react more negatively to an apparent low offer from an in-group proposer because they are more critical of members of one’s own group who are likely taking advantage of their superior position.</p>
<p>In sum, although Study 1 suggests that individuals are generally more tolerant of unfair behavior coming from an in-group counterpart, Study 2 suggests that there are limits to their tolerance. Because responders expect in-group members to look after their group counterparts when they are in a weak position, they react more negatively toward them when caught in an apparent attempt to take advantage of a vulnerable position. However, while the intergroup bias is attenuated in the US$7.50 offer condition, individuals still exhibited a positive bias toward in-group counterparts in the US$12.50 offer condition. A final question to explore is whether the negative bias toward an out-group counterpart can also be attenuated in cases like this where the counterpart could be acting in a fair and equitable manner. Study 3 addresses this issue. It also explores a different dimension of information asymmetry: salience of available information.</p>

<title>Participants and procedure</title>
<p>Eighty-five undergraduate business students participated in an ultimatum game where they were randomly assigned to a 2 (proposer’s social identity: in-group and out-group) × 2 (situational constraint: salient and not salient) between-subjects design. All offers were US$12.50. The procedures used were identical to those in Study 2. Social identity was also manipulated as in Studies 1 and 2. Salience of situational constraints was manipulated at two levels. To make situational constraints salient, just after receiving the offer, participants were asked to write down the possible reasons for the proposer’s offer and estimate the percentage of the total amount that the offer represented. Only after completing this task were participants asked to accept or reject the offer. When situational constraints were not made salient, participants accepted or rejected the offer after receiving it, responded to all dependent measures, and then estimated the percentage of the total amount that the offer represented. The rationale behind this manipulation is that, by having participants write the reasons for the offer, it is more likely that they would recognize that the total amount available may be playing a significant role in their counterpart’s decision and that an offer of US$12.50 could be fairly favorable. The other dependent measures were identical to those used in Study 2. The three variables (fairness, emotional reactions, and counterpart competitiveness) were significantly correlated between each other (all <italic>r</italic>s &gt; .55).</p>

<p>Hypothesis 4 suggests a two-way interaction between salience of situational constraints and proposer social identity. As predicted, the two-way interaction had a significant effect on acceptance rates, χ<sup>2</sup>(2, <italic>N</italic> = 84) = 5.47, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01, fairness perceptions, <italic>F</italic>(1, 84) = 2.64, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .10, η<sup>2</sup> = .15, emotional reactions to the offer, <italic>F</italic>(1, 84) = 7.09, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01, η<sup>2</sup> = .14, and estimates of the percentage of the total amount that the offer represents, <italic>F</italic>(1, 84) = 6.33, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01, η<sup>2</sup> = .06. Specifically, when the situational constraint was not salient, acceptance rates were higher (83.3% and 53.9%), χ<sup>2</sup>(1, <italic>N</italic> = 49) = 4.66, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .02, perceptions of fairness were higher (<italic>M</italic> = 4.38, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.38, and <italic>M</italic> = 3.19, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.13), <italic>F</italic>(1, 48) = 12.02, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01, η<sup>2</sup> = .19, emotional reactions to the offer were higher (<italic>M</italic> = 4.93, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.98, and <italic>M</italic> = 3.63, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.48), <italic>F</italic>(1, 48) = 13.62, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .002, η<sup>2</sup> = .20, and estimates of the percentage of the total amount that the offer represented were higher (<italic>M</italic> = 45, <italic>SD</italic> = 9.6, and <italic>M</italic> = 31.9, <italic>SD</italic> = 15.4), <italic>F</italic>(1, 48) = 4.85, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .02, η<sup>2</sup> = .03, when the US$12.50 offer came from an in-group rather than an out-group proposer. In contrast, none of these measures differed significantly when situational constraints were made salient (all <italic>p</italic>s &gt; .5).</p>
<p>Responders’ perceptions of counterpart competitiveness were not affected by the two-way interaction between salience of situational constraints and proposer’s social identity, <italic>F</italic>(1, 84) = 0.17, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .60. In fact, perceptions of counterpart competitiveness were not significantly different when the offer came from an in-group proposer than an out-group proposer, respectively, in both conditions: when the situational constraints were not salient (<italic>M</italic> = 4.33, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.32, and <italic>M</italic> = 4.73, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.18), <italic>F</italic>(1, 48) = 1.23, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .20, and when the situational constraints were salient (<italic>M</italic> = 3.76, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.47, and <italic>M</italic> = 3.85, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.08), <italic>F</italic>(1, 34) = .05, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .80. However, consistent with our reasoning, when the proposer was an out-group member, perceptions of counterpart competitiveness were significantly lower when the situational constraints were made salient than when not salient (<italic>M</italic>s = 3.85 and 4.73), <italic>F</italic>(1, 45) = 6.77, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01, η<sup>2</sup> = .13.</p>
<p>Study 3 replicates Study 2’s findings for relatively favorable offers. More importantly, Study 3 shows that the intergroup bias can be attenuated by making situational constraints salient. These results suggest when the offer is relatively favorable, the in-group favoritism can be mitigated by making responders elaborate on the fact that the proposer’s behavior may be due to the situation rather than personality disposition.</p>

<title>General Discussion</title>
<p>Motivated by the increasing complexity in the social milieu of many exchange processes, this research seeks to investigate how social cues, that are embedded in the decision-making environment, shape individuals’ expectations, perceptions, and behavior. Arguing that one of the first features encountered in a transaction context is the social identity of the transacting counterpart, this research examines the effect of a transacting counterpart’s social identity in conjunction with information availability on perceptions and outcomes in the context of an ultimatum game. Given that majority of the existing research documents the preponderance of intergroup bias, the current research adds to the growing literature that examines factors that may reduce in-group favoritism. More specifically, although studies have investigated the role of social identity in complete information contexts (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0146167212458327">Kramer et al., 1995</xref>), the presence of social identity biases have largely been ignored in contexts characterized by uncertainty and information asymmetry. The present research is an attempt to better understand information-based conditions under which social identity biases may be reduced or eliminated.</p>
<p>The issue of whether information availability and accessibility alters identity-based biases is important because exchange settings are commonly characterized by uncertainty and information asymmetry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0146167212458327">Srivastava, 2001</xref>). Although previous research has examined the effects of social identity in conjunction with factors that affect perceived risk (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0146167212458327">Brewer &amp; Kramer, 1986</xref>), the present research is more closely related to uncertainty where it is difficult to assess fairness of potential outcomes (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0146167212458327">van den Bos et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0146167212458327">van den Bos &amp; Lind, 2002</xref>). It is perhaps not surprising that contextual cues, such as counterpart’s social identity, play an influential role in incomplete information situations given that social identity affects perceptions and behavior even when individuals have access to objective referents against which to evaluate outcomes. However, in incomplete information situations, where individuals are in a relatively weak and vulnerable position, expectations of how the counterpart is likely to behave may loom large. The attributions that are triggered, particularly in incomplete information situations, may affect the extent to which potential outcomes are assimilated or contrasted with one’s expectations based on the counterpart’s social identity. The present research thus adds to the literature in social psychology by identifying information-based contextual conditions that represent boundaries to social identity–based biases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0146167212458327">Tajfel, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0146167212458327">Tajfel &amp; Turner, 1986</xref>).</p>
<p>Specifically, this article reports the results of three studies that examine the role of a counterpart’s social identity in influencing perceptions and behavior in both complete and incomplete information ultimatum games. Previous research suggests that responders typically reject offers that are clearly unfair (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0146167212458327">Huck, 1999</xref>). Study 1 qualifies this finding by showing that in complete information situations where an offer is clearly unfair, the counterpart’s social identity still affects how responders perceive and respond to such offers. Responders perceived an unfair offer to be less fair when the offer came from an out-group counterpart relative to an in-group counterpart. Results are consistent with the intergroup bias that an “us” versus “them” mode of social categorization is prone to reflect in-group favoritism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0146167212458327">Kramer et al., 1995</xref>). Importantly, although responders clearly know that the counterpart is being unfair, they appear to be more tolerant and forgiving when the counterpart is an in-group member than an out-group member.</p>
<p>Study 2 shows that in incomplete information situations, a counterpart’s social identity exerts a different type of influence on individuals’ perceptions, attributions, and behavior. The findings suggest the typical persistence of a positive in-group bias when the offer is apparently favorable but an attenuation or even reversal of that bias when the offer is apparently unfavorable. In particular, when the likelihood of an offer representing an unfair division is relatively high, the intergroup bias is attenuated or even reversed as individuals react more negatively to relatively unfair offers coming from in-group than out-group counterparts. Together, Studies 1 and 2 delineate a condition under which the typically persistent intergroup bias is attenuated (and perhaps even reversed). Specifically, although an opportunistic in-group counterpart may be tolerated in complete information situations, the same action is less likely to be condoned in an incomplete information situation because the counterpart is taking advantage of the situation at the expense of a vulnerable member of one’s own group. In other words, individuals are willing to tolerate selfishness from in-group members relative to out-group members when they are in a strong position, but they cannot tolerate it when they are in a weak spot. Basically, individuals like to be generous and accepting of people in their own group but have difficulty in putting up with a breach in the informal contract, which suggests that people in the same group should not take advantage of the other’s vulnerable position. Said differently, there is an expectation that members in the same group will be protective, and there is a backlash if that expectation of protection is not only jeopardized but that there is even exploitation.</p>
<p>Although Study 2 identified an information-related condition under which the intergroup bias was attenuated, the typical in-group favoritism was still manifested when the offer was relatively favorable. It is possible that individuals make the fundamental attribution error and still give more weight to a counterpart’s personality traits than to situational constraints, such as the total amount available for division, when they evaluated the relatively favorable offer in an incomplete information setting. Study 3 thus explored a different information-related way of attenuating the intergroup bias: making situational constraints salient and compelling individuals to consider other plausible explanations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0146167212458327">Corneille et al., 1999</xref>). Study 3 replicated the finding that when situational constraints are not salient, a relatively favorable offer is more likely to be accepted when coming from an in-group counterpart relative to an out-group counterpart. The offer was also estimated to be higher as a percentage of the total amount available when the counterpart was an in-group member rather than an out-group member. In contrast, when situational constraints were made salient, individuals appear to have considered other plausible explanations thus attenuating the intergroup bias. While Study 2 showed that the intergroup bias can be attenuated by lowering perceptions of in-group cooperativeness, Study 3 showed the attenuation by raising perceptions of out-group fairness.</p>
<p>The limitations of this research bear comment. First, although ultimatum games provide a simple setting in which to isolate the effects of the factors of interest, most economic transactions involve bargaining over multiple periods. Repeated interactions not only create stronger expectations about others’ behavior but also provide additional information from which to draw inferences. Second, despite attempts to make the task as realistic as possible, the studies reported here are laboratory experiments. Although issues of generalizability do arise, we believe that the systematic effects found attest to the robustness of the effect of social identity on perceptions and behavior. Third, social identity was operationalized as group membership in all three studies. However, we did not recourse to a minimal group context but to a rich intergroup relation of one university against another, with the two being old rivals. In this situation, rich in-group and out-group stereotypes come into play, which assists in making expectations about others’ behavior stronger (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0146167212458327">Jetten, Spears, &amp; Postmes, 2004</xref>). Although it is important to test the robustness of the findings with other contexts and social categories, such as culture, ethnicity, gender, and so forth, our results highlight the malleability of judgment and behavior to social cues that are an integral part of many transactions.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the limitations, the findings clearly highlight the role of social identity in exchange processes. From a strict economic perspective, the social identity of a transacting counterpart should play a relatively minor (or no) role in how individuals interpret and react to offers. Our results, however, strongly suggest that the social context in which most transactions are embedded plays a critical role in how counterparts are evaluated as well as whether offers are accepted or rejected. Consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0146167212458327">Tajfel (1981)</xref>, our results corroborate the idea that motives for social self-esteem are critical for resource allocation decisions.</p>
<p>Furthermore, social identity plays a different role when objective referents are absent. The counterpart’s social identity, along with the offer, is used to make inferences about the extent to which the counterpart is taking advantage of their informational advantage. Together, our findings identify information-based boundary conditions for the intergroup bias. Knowledge of the influence of factors such as social identity and information availability and accessibility should facilitate better management of the trade-offs between competitive and cooperative behavior in exchange processes.</p>
<p>Our results also have several theoretical implications for the research on distributive justice or fairness. Although the notion of fairness is not typically incorporated in standard economic theories (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0146167212458327">Rabin, 1993</xref>), there has been a proliferation of research documenting the ubiquity and importance of fairness considerations in business transactions. This research departs from the prior literature on fairness in at least three ways. First, while much of the prior research focuses on the dual entitlement principle and examines situations where referents against which offers are evaluated are accessible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0146167212458327">Kahneman, Knetsch, &amp; Thaler, 1986</xref>), this research explores fairness assessments in situations where referents are not easily available. Second, this article attempts to rigorously link social cues to various aspects of behavior, attitudes, and judgment formation. Third, unlike most studies that use hypothetical scenarios, this article examines how social identity influences the nature of causal attributions and related perceptions, and links perceptions directly to outcomes (or behavior), in a true economic transaction.</p>
