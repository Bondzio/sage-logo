<title>Geography’s story</title>
<p>Once upon a time geographers had little room for narrative. To be sure many wrote narratives, unselfconsciously, to describe processes of change, but few reflected on, or analysed, the nature and value of narrative as a form of exposition or interpretation. When they did so, in mid-20th century Anglophone geography, narrative appeared a problem in positioning geography as a discipline, both too powerful a method and too powerless. As a conventional mode of history, narrative appeared to over-ride spatial or visual frameworks of interpretation, which led H. C. Darby to identify some interesting experiments in geographical description, cross-sections, mixtures of past and present tense, ‘retrospective asides’ and ‘flash-backs’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1474474011432520">1</xref></sup> Endorsing positivist views of causality, David Harvey found narrative a weak method for geography, at best a preliminary verbal sketch to be filled out through more powerful, quantitative models of temporal explanation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1474474011432520">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>If we plot human geography’s story as a paradigm shift into a post-positivist period from the late 1970s, those who made room for narrative did so from a variety of positions, humanist, realist, marxist, post-modernist, and the many combinations thereof.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1474474011432520">3</xref></sup> Most familiarized themselves with a wider, inter-disciplinary narratological turn in the arts and social sciences, coming from literary criticism, cultural anthropology, and particularly a widely influential hermeneutic and historiographical strain in philosophy, notably in canonical works by Paul Ricouer, Hayden White and Louis Mink. While narratology addressed a radical, structuralist suspicion of narrative, its rhetorical power to offer a mystifyingly false coherence and closure to events, it also sought to redeem narrative as a theoretically powerful and complicated form of explanation, a precise cognitive instrument, taking many forms, genres, tropes, tenses, including various kinds of storytelling.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1474474011432520">4</xref></sup> Moreover narrative not only focussed on understanding the past, but also framed the present and future, a relay of retrospect and prospect. The model of explanation itself was widened to include various modes of cultural interpretation, understanding and description, contextual, creative modes of making and meaning displacing naturalistic modes of causality. The sequential passing of time was configured synoptically, even spatially, such that period and place were brought into closer conceptual conjunction, the plot, and emplotment, as a matter of both locating and telling, of creating situated stories.</p>
<p>The recuperation of narrative in human geography was upheld as a way of connecting, or re-connecting, conceptual polarities such as idiographic/nomothetic, analysis/synthesis and agency/structure, and connecting other polarities which had seldom hitherto been recognized as a problem in what was understood as a broadly scientific domain, such as subjective/objective, imagination/experience, fact/fiction. This involved recovering, or reconstructing, some key geographical concepts: region, landscape, space, place and environment and reaching out to disciplines in the arts and humanities which were focussing on them also, as geography’s cultural turn entwined with a geographical turn in the humanities and social sciences, in a wider movement concerned with narrative as a creative method as well as subject of critical analysis. It is a movement for which <italic>cultural geographies</italic> has, since its inception (under the original title <italic>Ecumene</italic>), offered a home and forum.</p>

<title>A place for stories</title>
<p>The turn to narrative in the arts, humanities and social sciences values work which has evident public appeal and engagement. The past might be told from varying perspectives, including subaltern ones, opening its field to address and retell a range of narrative materials including personal recollections, popular anecdotes and folk tales, extending the range of narrative knowledge beyond conventional documented history to matters of heritage and memory, in the process recovering modes of knowledge such as antiquarianism which had been displaced by progressive forms of scholarship. The extension of narrative was often explicitly spatial or environmental. Following the path of Raymond Williams, Edward Said re-situated the novel within the contours of its political and physical world, ‘the actual geographical nexus from which [its] narrative trajectory emerges’ to interpret the text as a heightened form of historical experience.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1474474011432520">5</xref></sup> And William Cronon found ‘a place for stories’ when making sense of long term social-environmental processes, with non-human agencies and determinations, while focussing on the way different historical plots, of progress and decline, reshape valuations of one region, evident in its various place names, Great Plains, Wheat Belt, Dust Bowl, the Land Where the Sky Begins.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1474474011432520">6</xref></sup> The focus on matters of cultural heritage, in the meaning and marketing of places, has raised geographical questions of how sites and landscapes are a narrative medium, officially so, in pictures, on the ground or the many designed spaces such as museums, galleries, monuments, and archives, and how counter-narratives might be told in new forms of interpretation and display.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1474474011432520">7</xref></sup> To show and tell contemporary artists focus on passing time in landscape matters, like photographer Jem Southam’s documentation of soil creep as well as social transformation in his book <italic>Landscape Stories</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1474474011432520">8</xref></sup> Landscape designers narrativize their practice, as a way of moving beyond a narrow professional expertise, and reaching out to a wider world of natural and social processes, and ways of making sense of them.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1474474011432520">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>While narrative has been extended one way beyond written human history, even human presence itself, to matters of deep time, so it has been focussed within human individuals too, in a new, consciously creative conjunction of personal biography and natural history, often conducted as a place based form of writing, in fact a renewed relationship that demands some critical reflection on its own history as a literary genre.</p>
<p>With both a popular readership and gathering academic attention, ‘new nature writing’ reworks a centuries-old literary tradition of natural description and natural history publishing.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1474474011432520">10</xref></sup> Regional and topographical in orientation, the signature feature of this narrative-driven genre is a deeply personalized quality of expression, articulating anxieties about irreversible local change, nowadays in a context of resource depletion, habitat destruction, biodiversity loss and atmospheric warming on a global scale. The newest examples of writing bear witness to landscapes and environments that exist, <italic>after</italic> nature. Several favour the format of a creative compendium or chapbook; chockfull of short entries that read like narrative invitations to continue a tale just begun.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1474474011432520">11</xref></sup> Others unfold as odysseys, made in search of an elusive quarry. Journeying forth is at the same time revelatory of an emergent sense of self. Humbled and hobbled, this narrative strain chronicles tender beauties in the most botched and malignant of forms, compiles field notes about the feral finds made in contaminated ‘dross-scapes’, and charts picturesque routes through post-industrial edgelands. Announced by the arrival of writers more avowedly angry and angular than their forebears, these writing worlds suggest the formulation of an alternative environmental aesthetic, written in a seething, scabrous spirit, that is dissenting and knowingly contrarian.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1474474011432520">12</xref></sup> Evading the age-old fear of nature deficit, detachment or estrangement, their preferred conduct is to come upon unnatural, compound ecologies that have passed over a threshold, and proliferate in permanently disfigured state. The new craft is to pen words offering no immediate pastoral comfort, little in the way of consolation, and that instead document the dread of a felt world in a time of environmental reckoning.</p>
<p>This new narrative space across the humanities provides scope to address and question official or established stories of places, from nations to monuments, whether by subjecting their mythologies to materialist analysis, deploying history against heritage, or, from a pluralistic perspective in which all grand narratives are suspect, of opening a space for many kinds of story, personal and political, biographical and environmental.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-1474474011432520">13</xref></sup> Narrative here is a question, or a generator of questions, in a critical space between the differences and dilemmas of self and other, rhetoric and reality, shadowed by a critical scepticism of storytelling as well as its creative potential. What might it mean to posit a formal equivalence between scientific and literary accounts of nature and environmental process and change? Why should we choose some stories over others? What room for realism, for telling like it was?</p>

<title>Ways of telling</title>
<p>Listen. In the shadows of the story stirs the storyteller. This presence of this charismatic figure, and the relation to the oral tradition it represents, has sometimes troubled narrative as a written, analytical form for silent reading, particularly in its academic guises. It positions narrative in a naïve past in more ways than one, in a place of childhood, or remote or marginal cultures and societies, of folklore, fairy tale and make-believe worlds we have lost. Storytelling more widely has seen a cultural renaissance, even as a creative industry of a kind, aligned to the resurgence in new forms of creative writing, folk song and handcrafts. As a form of place-based performance and public engagement storytelling is being deployed as a practice to propel cross-generational interest in local, community-centred initiatives and as a way to re-learn forms of civic attachment. What are the sources of such situated storytelling as a creative act and source of cultural concern?</p>
<p>In his 1936 essay ‘The Storyteller’, a canonical text for Anglophone cultural theory upon publication in <italic>Illuminations</italic> (1969), Walter Benjamin noted that the one ‘listening to a story is in the company of the story teller; even a man reading shares this companionship’. But the figure of the storyteller was already remote in a Germanic tradition and ‘getting every more distant’ as the loci of his role historically receded, whether the storyteller had come from afar, like a trading seaman, stayed at home like a peasant tiller of the soil, or worked in a city as an artisan.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>For storytelling is always the art of repeating stories, and this art is lost when the stories are no longer retained. It is lost because there is no more weaving and spinning to go on while they are being listened to. The more self-forgetful the listener is, the more deeply is what he listens to impressed upon his memory. When the rhythm of work has seized him, he listens to the tales in such a way that the gift of retelling them comes to him all by itself. This, then, is the nature of the web in which the gift of storytelling is cradled. This is how today it is becoming unraveled at all its ends after being woven thousands of years ago in the ambience of the oldest forms of craftsmanship.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-1474474011432520">14</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>As the other essays in <italic>Illuminations</italic> make clear, romantic antiquarianism was dialectically linked to a revolutionary progressivism, as part of a vocational historical consciousness in which different forms of narrative, articulating varieties of temporal experience (from traditionally plotted folktales to the close-ups and slow motion of modern film) might be retrieved as part of the process of cultural transformation. The ‘retroactive force’ of these resources might be brought to bear not only on a given present but on conformist versions of the past as ‘the way it really was’, ‘once upon a time’, to ‘seize hold of a memory…an image…as it flashes up’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-1474474011432520">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is not surprising that cultural anthropology has paved a way for wider scholarly recognition of storytelling, as a sophisticated mode for communicating both experience and imagination, and as a form of practice, involving verbal and non-verbal ways of telling, well beyond the original field research.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-1474474011432520">16</xref></sup> The work of Kathleen Stewart, in ‘narrativising a local cultural real’ in coal mining communities in West Virginia, and Tim Ingold’s reports of wayfinding as storytelling in hunter-gather cultures have influenced recent cultural geographic work on places in Britain.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-1474474011432520">17</xref></sup> For Ingold, stories are a propulsive force, usefully bearing the weight of direct comparison to walking and to weaving, as organic activities formed from a meshwork of movement and habitation, and producing a more satisfactory ecology of life.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-1474474011432520">18</xref></sup> A recent book on landscape design cites anthropologist David Guss’s search to record the creation epic of the Kekua in the Venezuelan rainforest. Arriving at source he found no elder retelling attentive youths of the deeds of their ancestors. Instead he gained access to the stories only through involvement in basket making, and the work of gathering, cutting and plaiting cane as well as learning design and use. He concluded, ‘to tell a story therefore was to weave a basket, just as it was to make a canoe…to build a house, to clear a garden’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-1474474011432520">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>With its own ancestry in anthropology, along with archaeology and theatre research, Performance Studies has accommodated different forms of storytelling into a wider narrative realm, in part to articulate its elusive nature, between exposition and reconstitution, “at once a ‘doing and the thing done’”. While the doing may involve various ways of telling in dramaturgical practice, so ‘performance survives as a cluster of narratives, those of the watchers and the watched, and all those who facilitate their interaction’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-1474474011432520">20</xref></sup> In Mike Pearson’s work questions of site, landscape and environment, in their various forms, studio, parish, field, disused factory, military training ground, are frameworks for overlapping forms of storytelling, antiquarian, chorographical, biographical, acted out in situ, recollected on the page.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-1474474011432520">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>Beyond the academy, the work of John Berger, a cultural critic and creative writer centrally concerned with ways of telling – as well as ways of seeing – the material world, has been surprisingly neglected in geography.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-1474474011432520">22</xref></sup> Decisively influenced by the writings of Walter Benjamin, Berger’s oeuvre ranges across a repertoire of forms and genres (photo-essay, travelogue, memoir, letters, poetry, diary dispatches and fiction) his narratives turning on highly personal, deeply physical experiences caught up in the greater churn of social and environmental change.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-1474474011432520">23</xref></sup> Here are stories of exile and migration, displacements and disruptions, landscapes and livelihoods, largely in overlooked, peripheral regions of Europe, or its edges, on a compass dial that takes in stories from Palestine, Anatolia and Lisbon. In <italic>A Question of Geography</italic>, his play co-written with Nella Bielski, the action takes place among exiles condemned to live out a most marginal existence in the Gulag camps of Eastern Siberia.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-1474474011432520">24</xref></sup> Other works focus on questions of belonging. <italic>A Fortunate Man</italic> (1967) displays through words and photographs (by Jean Mohr) the professional life of a country doctor in the Forest of Dean, including his role in constructing the personal and social narratives of the community through his practice. This as a way of revealing the landscape, drawing aside the conventional scenic ‘curtain behind which their struggles, achievements and accidents take place’, to show where ‘landmarks are not only geographic but also personal and personal’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-1474474011432520">25</xref></sup> <italic>Pig Earth</italic> (1979) charts Berger’s own residence in a peasant village in the French alps, and his attempts to align the realism of his own story telling as a professional, published writer with that of the village, as an oral collective self-portrait. This is a ‘question of place’ in which routine events (like the slaughter of a cow) are storied by the end of their day, through observation and gossip, along with remote, landmark episodes (like the accidental death of a herder) in the community’s collective memory.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-1474474011432520">26</xref></sup> <italic>Another Way of Telling</italic> (1982) explores photography as a narrative form, a field of memory in which stories might be read in discontinuous, non-chronological ways, as spaces between images as well as what is shown. A medium of modernity is a relay to archaic sources of storytelling, lying on the ground forming the patterns of constellations to tell stories about the stars, or striding along the ground: ‘stories walk, like animals and men’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-1474474011432520">27</xref></sup></p>

<title>Narrative themes</title>
<p>A cultural geographical focus on experience and imagination is perhaps a medium for the production, perhaps overproduction of narrative. The risk here is a tendency, which has now become endemic, to loosen narrative as an interpretative term, to give it too much room, too little analytical purchase, so elastic that ‘narrative’ has become a shorthand for almost any kind of knowledge, discourse, meaning, experience or point of view. The measured, critical response to the inflationary pressure, set out in our discussion above and expressed in the original conference call for papers which resulted in this theme issue, is to discriminate the varieties of geographical narrative, and test their claims, such that we appealed for speakers to address ‘travellers tales, theoretical histories, scientific stories, economic homilies, topographical traditions, place memories, environmental futures, geo-biographies, archival creations, archaeological reconstructions, landscape allegories and archetypal plots’. The selected papers in this issue analyse the capacity of various forms and spaces of narrative – on the page, in performance, in various sites and landscapes. They explore the limits as well as potential of narrative, even the loss of faith in narrative as a way of making sense of the world. Narrative here is a cultural predicament as well as a creative opportunity.</p>
<p>In the following selected papers relations between narrative, and landscape and environment, are explored in various ways that we might categorize in the following terms: textuality, temporality and locality.</p>
<p>Textual practices extend from travellers’ tales to scriptural geographies and earth science, bound books on shelves to the unbound Book of Nature. Historically, the credibility, authority, fidelity and authenticity of authorship have been necessary measures for readers’ legitimation of narrative accounts of foreign travel and exploration. For authors, bearing witness has ever been a business of voicing presence. Editorial interventions reveal how writing was worked to accommodate divergent discourses of science, literature and religion, and make the passage from field notebook to published volume, while trafficking with received ideas and episodes. This to bring distant and unfamiliar landscapes to life.</p>
<p>If all place description implies forms of temporality, whether landscape history’s elegiac sense of loss, or so much human geography’s present and future tense, its explicit theoretical deployment is a device for consciously experimental sorts of storytelling, designed to shift and unsettle understandings of landscape adaptation and environmental change, and the expectations of listeners and readers. An elasticized sense of time, as experienced and imagined, is explored, variously through literary invention, fieldwork principle and site-specific study. Moments of discovery meet aeons of deep time, the geophysical and the biographical, as authors bend, or break with, conventional plots and chronologies. Techniques of cut-up, montage, bricolage, simultaneity work in different media, prose, film, street theatre, to articulate others ways of telling.</p>
<p>The locality of narrative in these papers operates at a number of scales. In the manner of traditional regional discourse, counties are studied for their distinctive histories of land and life, including dramatic episodes of transformation, and islands, in fact and fiction, for their framing of legal title as well as literary plot. At a finer scale, specific sites are identified as vantage points, or apertures, for observing wider, geophysical processes of change, the nick point of recession on an escarpment, a suburban back garden for observing the stars, the fault-line passage through a rock revealing a harbour’s future ruin and the site’s past condition. It is the specificity of these locations that concentrates their physical as well as their cultural geography, and the role of narrative as a resource for making sense of the material world.</p>
