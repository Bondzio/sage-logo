<p>‘Every woman’s byline is the distinctive signature of her work in the media’ (p. 213), proclaims Barbara Freeman in her provocative and pioneering book. In seven chapters she details biographical studies of Canadian women media workers from the late 19th century to the early 21st century whose passions and activism influenced, challenged, and changed both the representation and working realities of women journalists. Freeman’s lively biographical sketches situate Canadian women’s media work within a socio-historical and cultural context, serving to resurrect obscure histories and draw attention to contemporary work. The phrase ‘beyond bylines’ designates how women media workers, working in contexts that usually made it difficult for them to be overtly visible and political, used their various journalistic platforms to draw attention to myriad social concerns and advocate for women’s socio-political advancements. Different forms of journalism are explored: newspapers and magazines, radio, and documentary films. The biographical sketches poignantly highlight how women media workers had to transcend gendered stereotypes of their role in society and bypass and subvert in creative fashion structural barriers in their paths.</p>
<p>Freeman’s journey starts with Agnes Maule Machar, a 19th-century Christian social reformer and ardent nationalist who wrote under the adopted pen name of ‘Fidelis’ in various popular magazines of the time, and ends with the celebrated Aboriginal documentary filmmaker Alanis Obomsawin, whose many films have reclaimed the identity and power of Native women. Working within different media structures, whether it be public, private, or alternative, Freeman provides a narrative account of the motivations and barriers of the journalists’ workplaces, from blatant sexist attitudes from co-workers and management, or the interpersonal delicacies of feminist collectives, to the vexing problem of funding – both the challenges of seeking funding for their work and the politics of funding within particular organizational contexts. Her methodology includes detailed archival work, analysis of the media works themselves, media coverage of issues and events, and interviews with extant journalists. Altogether, Freeman provides a rich panoramic sweep of the social and cultural context for each case study.</p>
<p>Consider her chapter on Elizabeth Long, the supervisor for the CBC’s <italic>Women’s Interest</italic> programs. In a patchwork history consisting of material from the CBC corporate archives, program scripts, and recorded interviews from former employees, a portrait emerges of Long as an early feminist whose daytime programs, geared towards the housewife, offered informative broadcasts on citizenship and civic responsibility. Indeed, such radio programming is characteristic of what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1464884912445689">Eileen Meehan (2002)</xref>, who looked at the media audience commodity from a feminist perspective, described as the gendered audience commodity. Other chapters also explore the gendered audience commodity; the role of the women’s page writer in Toronto newspapers circa the late 19th-century illustrates this well.</p>
<p>Taking a broad perspective on what constitutes media work, Freeman’s chapter on the Abortion Caravan Publicity Campaign of 1970 is an excellent example of activist media strategies, which can serve as an apt case study for contemporary advocacy campaigns. In order to draw attention to the need for the decriminalization of abortion and progressive health reform for women, several feminist groups and organizers used mixed tactics: a cross-country caravan with staged press conferences, performative pro-choice demonstrations, the garnering of local and national press attention, and actions on Parliament Hill and in the House of Commons. Likewise, in her chapter on lesbian periodicals from the 1970s to now, Freeman widens the scope of alternative media studies, which has tended to ignore or discount the impact of feminist collective publishing for social change.</p>
<p>Freeman’s book is situated within a lively burgeoning critical scholarship in communication studies that takes labour as its focal point. Vincent Mosco and Catherine McKercher have rightfully identified labour as a veritable blind spot in western communication studies scholarship (McKercher and Mosco, 2008). To rectify this glaring omission, they have produced a significant body of work that foregrounds labour and workers as necessarily integral and intrinsic to political economic and cultural analyses within communication studies. Freeman’s focus in this book on women media workers and advocates, coupled with her feminist perspective, is thus a welcome and necessary intervention to this scholarship. Thanks to her, the unique histories of women cultural workers have been captured and will inspire current and future generations of women media workers.</p>
