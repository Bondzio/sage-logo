<p><bold>Purpose:</bold> The purpose of this study is to describe the Norwegian translation of the World Health Organization Quality of Life Spirituality, Religiousness, and Personal Beliefs module. <bold>Design:</bold> This is an exploratory study using convenience sampling. <bold>Method:</bold> Translation has followed the World Health Organization’s standardized protocol. Six focus groups were recruited from six geographical regions in southeastern Norway: three groups of health professionals (<italic>n</italic> = 18) and three groups of patients (<italic>n</italic> = 15). <bold>Results:</bold> All facets and items were found to be culturally relevant. The facet awe underwent three literary changes, spiritual strength two, and meaning, inner peace, and faith underwent one change each. The facets spiritual connection, wholeness, and integration and hope and optimism did not undergo any changes. The facets spiritual connection, meaning in life, experiences of awe, and wholeness and integration displayed the strongest discriminatory power. Internal consistency reliability of the overall module tested with Cronbach’s alpha was high (α = .93). <bold>Conclusion:</bold> Translating questionnaires and adapting them in comprehensible forms, while maintaining the meaning of the original items, is a challenge in holistic nursing. Even though certain difficulties in comprehension were revealed, the results of this study indicate that all facets and items on the Spirituality, Religiousness, and Personal Beliefs module were equally important.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Spirituality is regarded as an innate aspect of human beings where care of the spirit is often defined as the cornerstone of holistic nursing practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0898010112461976">Burkhardt &amp; Nagai-Jacobsen, 2002</xref>). Spirituality is also increasingly recognized as a key determinant of health among people the world over. Nevertheless, quality of life (QoL) as a construct has omitted areas of spirituality and religious beliefs in the past (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0898010112461976">Culliford, 2002</xref>). Consequently, many QoL assessments have not routinely included aspects of spirituality in their measurements, and many clinicians and researchers have increasingly identified a need for reliable and valid instruments that can address individuals’ lived, spiritual experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0898010112461976">Mularski et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0898010112461976">O’Connel &amp; Skevington, 2005</xref>). Of those instruments now available for assessing spirituality, many have been developed in Western contexts in English, thus having limited applicability in other cultural and ethnic groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0898010112461976">Guillemin, Bombardier, &amp; Beaton, 1993</xref>). With these facts in mind, the World Health Organization Quality of Life (WHOQOL) Assessment Group began collaborative efforts in the 1990s to define and measure QoL cross-culturally, which also included aspects of spirituality.</p>

<title>Background and Literature Review</title>
<sec id="section3-0898010112461976">
<title>Development of the WHOQOL-SRPB</title>
<p>The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0898010112461976">WHOQOL Group (1995a)</xref>, originally composed of 15 countries worldwide, defined QoL as an “individual’s perception of their position in life, in the context and culture and value systems in which they live and in relation to their goals, expectations, standards and concerns” (p. 1405). Based on this definition, the WHOQOL Group has developed various instruments and modules to assess QoL in healthy and sick groups.</p>
<p>During the past decade, the WHOQOL Group has also carried out developmental work on a Spirituality, Religion, and Personal Beliefs (SRPB) module. This developmental work arose out of an understanding that there are many forms of spirituality expressed by people in the world, and the group believed there exists a need for a spirituality measurement suitable for diverse cultural religious and spiritual groups.</p>
<p>Standardized methodology for the development of WHO instruments and modules includes a literature review, a Delphi study of the experts involved in worldwide centers, running of focus groups with individuals (e.g., with different age–groups including young and old, with healthy and ill individuals, and with males and females), and with carers. Opportunistic sampling is then applied in pilot and field testing where prospective participants attempt to meet predefined criteria for age, gender, and health status (age, 50% &lt;45 years, 50% &gt;45 years; sex, 50% = male, 50% = female; health status: 250 persons with disease/impairment and 50 well persons).The uniqueness of the WHO methodology is that instrument development is based on information incorporated from a range of culturally diverse centers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0898010112461976">WHOQOL Group, 1995a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0898010112461976">1995b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0898010112461976">1995c</xref>).</p>
<p>The SRPB module was developed according to the same standardized methodology. WHO first recruited an expert group consisting of multireligious groups of health professionals (Buddhists, Muslims, Christians, Jews, agnostics, atheists, and others) to define areas and items of importance in the assessment of spirituality in their own cultures. These items were subsequently reviewed by 92 focus groups (<italic>n</italic> = 701) in 15 countries. Based on qualitative data, a total of 15 facets were confirmed as being relevant. These facets were then pilot tested in 18 sites (<italic>n</italic> = 5087) based on convenience sampling. Mean age of the respondents was 41.3 years (<italic>SD</italic> = 15.3), ranging from 16 to 90 with 48.9% male. The most common religion was Christianity (<italic>n</italic> = 3789; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0898010112461976">WHOQOL-SRPB Group, 2006</xref>). Based on this data, a series of analyses were conducted to explore the psychometric properties of these data. Findings of this work resulted in a module that includes 32 questions assessing the following areas: spiritual connection, meaning and purpose in life, experience of awe and wonder, wholeness and integration, spiritual strength, inner peace, hope and optimism, and faith. All items are rated on a 5-point Likert-type scale, where 1 indicates <italic>none at all</italic> for some questions and <italic>very satisfied</italic> for others and 5 indicates “<italic>an extreme amount</italic> and <italic>very dissatisfied</italic> (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0898010112461976">Table 1</xref>).The SRPB also includes sociodemographic questions (age, gender, marital status, education, types of illness, and four questions addressing denomination (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0898010112461976">Table 2</xref>). The SRPB module is intended to be used together with other WHOQOL instruments.</p>

<title>Translation Methodology</title>
<p>The translation methodology used in this study is based on the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0898010112461976">WHO’s (2003)</xref> standardized translation protocol. The translation process aims at achieving different language versions of QoL instruments that are conceptually equal in various cultures. The translation methodology is composed of forward translation, convening a panel of experts, back translation, pretesting, and creating the final version. First, the source instrument is translated into the target language by one or two translators. These translators should have a clear understanding of the instrument and the population who will use the instrument. A bilingual group (expert group) then reviews the translation, looking for any inconsistencies between the source language and the translated document. The number of experts in the bilingual group can vary. In general, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0898010112461976">WHO (2003)</xref> advises that “the expert panel should include the original translator, experts in the field of health as well as experts with experience in instrument development and translation” (p. 26). A group of monolingual (focus groups), unfamiliar with the instrument then “tests” the instrument by reviewing the translation for comprehensibility. The bilingual group then considers the comments of the monolingual group and incorporates them into the translated document. The translated document is then back translated into the original language by the back translator. The back translator does not see a copy of the original English version before completing the translation. The bilingual group then considers the original and back-translated documents and agrees on a any significant differences in creating the final version</p>
<p>In this study, forward translations from English into Norwegian were performed by the first author and one associate professor in nursing who both were familiar with the terminology regarding spiritual issues and were proficient in the Norwegian language. An expert panel consisting of three persons reviewed this translation: a lecturer in nursing with a background in nursing and pastoral care, a professor in nursing with a background in instrumental development and translation, and a research director with a background in nursing, project administration, and translation.</p>
<p>Back translation was conducted by a person whose native language is English. The expert panel and the back translator discussed discrepancies between the original and the back translation until consensus was reached. Finally, pretesting was carried out by focus group interviewing, which was performed by the first author, assisted by a registered nurse with a specialty in geriatric nursing.</p>

<sec id="section7-0898010112461976">
<title>Focus Group Protocol and Participants</title>
<p>The focus group methodology used in this study is based on the WHO’s standardized protocol for focus group work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0898010112461976">WHOQOL Group, 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0898010112461976">1998</xref>). A minimum of five focus groups was recommended, with both healthy and sick individuals together with a group of health professionals. Groups were to strive for equal gender groups, different age-groups, varied socioeconomic backgrounds, and participants from differing faith communities, although it was stated that religious, spiritual, or personal beliefs were to be representative of country involved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0898010112461976">WHOQOL-SRPB Group, 2006</xref>, p. 1489).</p>
<p>For recruitment purposes, letters of invitation were sent to the administrators at 10 different institutions in southeast Norway. These institutions had formal collaboration contracts with the university college heading the study. Six institutions agreed to take part, representing both rural areas and larger cities. These administrators assigned responsibility to unit administrators, who further identified specific contact nurses. These nurses were given information regarding the study: copies of the SRPB module and focus group guidelines. They then identified potential participants based on inclusion and exclusions criteria. Inclusions criteria included the following: age 18 years and older, had no apparent memory or fatigue problems as observed by their carers, and could read, write, and communicate clearly. Exclusions criteria were those acutely ill or terminal. Inclusions criteria for health professionals included age 18 years or older. Participants agreeing to participate received verbal and written information about the study from the contact nurses. Guidelines asked participants to consider the relevancy, understandability, and conceptual clarity of the words, items, and response categories on the module and to suggest changes. Participants were also asked to consider other items that might be more relevant to Norwegian culture. Furthermore, they were asked to answer all items and provide sociodemographic data. Altogether, six focus groups were conducted with convenience samples. Three groups of health professionals were recruited (registered nurses and licensed practical nurses) from a rehabilitation center, a nursing home, and a surgical hospital ward. Three groups of patients were drafted from a rehabilitation center, a nursing home, and nursing care center. Focus groups with patient and health professionals were carried out separately. One patient from a rehabilitation center agreed to take part but was unfortunately “forgotten” by the contact nurse and was therefore excluded.</p>

<sec id="section8-0898010112461976">
<title>Focus Group Procedure</title>
<p>The first author served as moderator together with one observer for all focus groups, which were held at the separate institutions. The moderator directed the discussion and summarized major points. The observer watched, managed the technical aspects, and helped clarify information. On initiation of the groups, the moderator discussed the aim of the session as well as the time frame, and written consent was obtained. Formal oral consent was also given by each participant regarding the confidentiality of the forthcoming discussion and the tape-recording process. It was agreed that the audio recorder would be turned off when requested. Each group (six to eight members) met for one discussion lasting 1 hour to 1½ hours with a refreshment break. Discussion began with the first question on the module in ranking order, discussing each item separately. On completion of the group, the moderator made short summaries of the discussion points and asked for further comments to ensure credibility. Finally, basic sociodemographic data were gathered. In cases of necessity, participants were also encouraged to contact the moderator. Telephone number of the researcher had been included in the information letter. Directly after the focus groups, the moderator and the observer also wrote a summary of major points and functional issues related to the group gathering. No participants contacted the moderators after focus group completion.</p>

<sec id="section9-0898010112461976">
<title>Ethical Issues</title>
<p>The study was approved by the regional ethical committee and institutional ethical committees. The regional ethical committee recommended that the focus in the interviews remain on a general level without discussion of deep personal issues in order to safeguard privacy. Participant confidentiality was secured and the names of the participants were not revealed. Questionnaires were coded by numbers. Tapes and transcribed interviews were stored in a locked cabinet and computer data were stored under a password known only by the first author.</p>

<title>Qualitative Data</title>
<p>Each focus group was transcribed verbatim after each session by the first author. Both authors read through the verbatim, independently and jointly, sorting comments according to facets and items. These comments were then combined into tables representing all groups. The tables were rechecked with the verbatim as a quality control by the authors. Criteria for changing wording in the translation were based on at least three groups making recommendations for the same change. After consensus was reached, the first author implemented the changes on the final version.</p>

<sec id="section12-0898010112461976">
<title>Quantitative Data</title>
<p>Quantitative data were processed using SPSS Version 17.0 statistical software (IBM SPSS, Chicago, IL). Descriptive analyses were performed to explore differences between groups in relation to sociodemographic variables. Independent <italic>t</italic> tests were used to assess mean differences between groups in relation to the SRPB facets. Statistical significance was set at <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Demographical characteristics are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0898010112461976">Table 2</xref>. A total number of 33 persons participated in the focus groups. The mean age of the patient groups was 76.9 years (<italic>SD</italic> = 10.70; range = 50-90 years); 60% were female. Approximately 27% were married or partnered; 13% had never been married; 60% were separated, divorced, or widowed; and 73% had postsecondary education. The mean age of the health professional group was 48.5 years (<italic>SD</italic> = 8.99; range = 31-64 years); 89% were female. Approximately 6% were married or partnered; 94% were separated, divorced, or widowed; and 72% had postsecondary education. Furthermore, the majority of health professionals (83.3%) considered themselves to be moderately to extremely religious, as compared with 93% of the patients.</p>
<sec id="section14-0898010112461976">
<title>Qualitative Results</title>
<p>With connectedness to a spiritual being or force facet, the item including the words <italic>comfort</italic>/<italic>reassurance</italic> together was discussed by both the expert panel and the back translator. Even though it was related, the word <italic>reassurance</italic> is not synonymous with <italic>comfort</italic> in the Norwegian language. It was decided to use both words, even though they portray different meanings. Focus group participants did not have any problems understanding this item when both words were applied. Participants in the groups discussed both the positive and negative aspects to feeling and not feeling comforted and reassured, also in relation to religious activities.</p>
<p>For meaning and purpose in life, this facet was less indistinct. Differences between meaning in life and meaning of life were discussed by the expert panel and the translator. Similarities and differences between the words <italic>purpose, reason</italic>, and <italic>meaning</italic> were also debated. Three of the groups wanted to change the item “you are here for a reason” to “you are living here for a reason.” This change was implemented. Issues related to the relationship between goals and reasons for living were discussed among focus group members.</p>
<p>Similarly, the facet experiencing awe was less unclear. The expert group meant that the item “grateful for things in nature that you enjoy” was too restrictive. Discussion of changing the wording to “things that you can enjoy” was suggested, although the translator group had no comments regarding this facet. Some focus group members meant that respect and awe signify the same concept in Norwegian. Others debated whether <italic>awe</italic> includes a different dimension from the word <italic>respect</italic>. Several focus groups also meant that the word <italic>awe</italic> is not often used in the Norwegian language. It was suggested by a majority of groups to use both <italic>awe</italic> and <italic>respect</italic> together in the translation, which was implemented. Another point raised was “what is meant by the word <italic>beauty</italic>?” For some members, it was church, nature, art, or music. Three groups suggested this item be changed to “touched by seeing something beautiful,” which was implemented. The item regarding how one feels inspiration was also problematic for many. Members discussed differences between feeling inspiration and having feelings of inspiration, which seemed better suited to the culture. Three groups wanted to change the item “feel inspiration and excitement” to “having feelings of inspiration and excitement,” which was implemented. Connotations behind the word <italic>satisfaction</italic> and how satisfied you are, and to what extent one can experience balance were discussed. The translator group also discussed these issues. However, the focus groups had no problems understanding this facet nor did they suggest any changes in wording.</p>
<p>Regarding the spiritual strength facet, the expert panel discussed the differences in meaning given to how one feels peace and strength, how to find strength, and to what degree one can find strength. These words caused no problems for the translators. A majority of participants also brought up issues connected to <italic>feeling</italic> inner spiritual strength and suggested that <italic>having</italic> inner spiritual strength was a better translation in the Norwegian culture. This change was implemented. The meaning of the words “feel happy” as compared with “experience joy” was also discussed. Many groups meant that to experience joy was a clearer translation in the Norwegian culture and was consequently changed. The associations between feeling strength and carrying out religious and spiritual activities such as reading the Bible and praying and the happiness this creates were discussed in relation to this facet.</p>
<p>With the inner peace/serenity/harmony facet, the expert panel discussed differences in connotations between feeling peaceful within and having inner peace. The translator group did not discuss this aspect. However, the majority of focus groups discussed this point and suggested changing the wording from “do you have inner peace?” to “do you experience inner peace?” In discussing inner peace, issues connected to finding inner peace, harmony, and prayer were underlined, which were similar to the discussion related to the spiritual strength facet.</p>
<p>Regarding the hope and optimism facet, the expert panel discussed differences in connotations between “feeling and experiencing.” The word <italic>feeling</italic> is a strong word in the Norwegian language and not used as easily as in the English language, for example. The translator group also raised questions about the difference in meaning between connotations given to “how hopeful do you feel?” and “to what extent do you feel hopeful or feel hope?” These nuances were also discussed by the different focus groups, although no suggestions for changes were made. Some members meant questions about hope and optimism were difficult to answer, as they are heavily influenced by situational characteristics prevailing at the time. The relationship between hope and optimism was also raised by various members.</p>
<p>Regarding the facet on faith, the expert panel and the translator group meant items in this facet were very clear. However, some focus groups meant that some items seemed to overlap. Many participants wanted to change the item “how to enjoy life” to “help you to experience joy in life,” as this was clearer. This change was implemented. Issues related to how faith influences comfort and discomfort and how faith and strength create possibilities for development and growth were also discussed in connection with this facet.</p>

<title>Quantitative Results</title>
<p>Mean scores of the SRPB facets for the groups are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0898010112461976">Table 3</xref>. Statistically significant differences between the groups were found for four facets: spiritual connection, meaning in life, experiences of awe and wonder, and wholeness and integration, where the professional group had higher mean scores. The other facets: spiritual strength, inner peace, and hope and optimism were quite similar within the two groups. One facet, faith, displayed higher mean scores in the patient group, although this finding was not significant. In both professional and patient groups, all the mean scores were relatively high, indicating stronger spiritual–religious and personal beliefs. The lowest mean scores were related to the facet faith in both groups. For health professionals, the highest mean score was found for spiritual connection and meaning of life, and for patients, spiritual strength and hope and optimism. However, all facets showed quite large variations, with standard deviations greater than 1.0, suggesting variability in the importance attributed to them. The largest standard deviations were found for the faith facet in both groups, for inner peace in the professional group, and spiritual connectedness and meaning of life in the patient group.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the internal consistency reliability of the overall module tested with Cronbach’s alpha was high (α = .93). Reliabilities for the individual facets were α = .89 for the spiritual connection, α = .79 for meaning of life, α = .76 for experiences of awe, α = .73 for wholeness and integration, α = .86 for spiritual strength, α = .90 for inner peace, α = .67 for hope and optimism, and α = .92 for faith.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In holistic nursing practice, it is insufficient to translate questionnaires literally for use. The additional challenge is how to adapt them in culturally relevant and comprehensible forms while maintaining the meaning and intent of the original items. The results of this study indicate that all facets and items on the SRPB module were found to be culturally relevant, lending support to the findings from other countries. However, in striving to uphold translation quality following the WHO translation and focus group protocol, certain difficulties in comprehensibility of meanings were revealed.</p>
<sec id="section17-0898010112461976">
<title>Clarity of the SRPB Facets and Items</title>
<p>Results showed that the facets meaning and purpose in life, awe and wonder, and spiritual strength were found to be the most problematic. Based on the criteria that three or more groups were required to suggest the same change in literary translation before a change was made, results showed that the facet awe underwent three changes, spiritual strength two, and meaning, inner peace, and faith, one change each. The facets spiritual connection, wholeness and integration, and hope and optimism did not undergo any changes.</p>
<p>Contrary to our findings, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0898010112461976">O’Connel and Skevington (2005)</xref>, who translated the SRPB module in the United Kingdom (<italic>n</italic> = 55, age 51 years, 47% male), found that the facets spiritual strength, inner peace and harmony, hope and optimism, and experiences of awe were most clear, and wholeness and integration was most problematic. According to these participants, items regarding faith were perceived to overlap as they did for our study participants, although this facet was among the most clear in Norway. Although there was disagreement about some of the facets among different group of believers and nonbelievers in the United Kingdom, the facets inner peace, meaning in life, and spiritual strength were seen as equally important by all groups.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-0898010112461976">
<title>Relevancy of the SRPB Facets and Items</title>
<p>Our findings, which lend support to the face validity and relevancy of all SRPB facets and items, support other research findings based on concept analyses. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0898010112461976">Burkhardt (1989)</xref> found harmonious interconnectedness within self and with others, a higher power, and environment as key empirical referents of spirituality in her concept analysis. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0898010112461976">Tanyi (2002)</xref> found that attributes of spirituality included belief and faith, connectedness, inner strength, and peace and inferred that spirituality entails some form of a belief system. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0898010112461976">Delgado (2005)</xref> in a literature review on the concept of spirituality found a belief system, search for meaning and purpose, connection, and self-transcendence as major attributes and recommended that they be assessed simultaneously.</p>
<p>The mean scores in the groups also provided further confirmation of the relevancy of the items. In both samples, all mean scores were above the midpoint, suggesting positive influence of the facets in people’s lives. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0898010112461976">Boero et al. (2005)</xref> also found mean scores above the midpoint on all SRPB facets among 116 health workers, similar to our findings. In this study, highest mean scores were related to meaning and purpose and awe. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0898010112461976">Giovagnoli, Meneses, and da Silva (2006)</xref> found in a sample of 32 patients with epilepsy using the SRPB module that awe was particularly important. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0898010112461976">O’Connel and Skevington (2005)</xref> also showed that U.K. participants had means greater than 3.0. In their study, spiritual strength, meaning and purpose in life, and wholeness and integration were most important.</p>
<p>In comparing our findings with an international pilot study testing the SRPB (5,087 participants from 18 countries), results showed significant mean differences between subgroups in relation to gender, healthy and sick, and younger and older age. Older age had statistically higher mean scores on facets related to spiritual connection, wholeness and integration, spiritual strength, and peace and faith, and hope and optimism was higher among younger adults. Hope and optimism was also especially important to older Norwegian patients. Among sick persons, meaning in life, wholeness and integration, peace, and hope were statistically higher than among those who were healthy in the international study. In this study, faith was statistically higher among the unhealthy, similar to ours, although our results were not statistically significant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0898010112461976">WHOQOL-SRPB Group, 2006</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-0898010112461976">
<title>Discriminatory Power of the SRPB Facets and Items</title>
<p>Four facets of the SRPB module were found to have discriminating power between healthy and sick groups and showed statistically significant differences between the groups—namely, spiritual connection, meaning in life, experiences of awe and wonder, and wholeness and integration, with professionals (healthy) having higher mean scores. Contrarily, in the international pilot study, the facets meaning in life and awe were found to have the least discriminating power among subgroups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0898010112461976">WHOQOL-SRPB Group, 2006</xref>). Our results may be related to the fact that patient groups were relatively old, sick, and/or disabled and were struggling with more illness-related concerns, which affected feelings of connectedness and wholeness and ability to take part in meaningful activities. Some members of the patient groups were residents at nursing homes and under rehabilitation services. Our findings showed no significant differences between the healthy and sick groups, in relation to spiritual strength, inner peace/serenity/harmony, and hope and optimism. Noticeably, spiritual strength did not show a significant difference between the sick and healthy groups in the international pilot study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0898010112461976">WHOQOL-SRPB Group, 2006</xref>). This underlines the relative importance of this facet to people, regardless of their health status.</p>
<p>The large standard deviations in mean scores indicate large variability among participants, with some rating the facets low and others high. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0898010112461976">O‘Connel and Skevington (2005)</xref> also found a number of facets with quite large deviations, also indicating variability in the importance attributed by U.K. participants. In our study, for both our groups, the largest deviations were found for the facet faith and inner peace in the professional group and for spiritual strength among patients. These large standard deviations suggest that both professionals and patients may attribute different levels of meaning and importance to these facets.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section20-0898010112461976">
<title>Reliability of the SRPB Module</title>
<p>The overall internal consistency reliability of the Norwegian module was high and all facets showed acceptable values except for the facet hope and optimism, which did not reach acceptable criteria. In the international pilot study, Cronbach’s alphas ranged from .77 (meaning and purpose) to .95 (faith; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0898010112461976">WHOQOL-SRPB Group, 2006</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0898010112461976">Giovagnoli et al. (2006)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0898010112461976">O’Connel and Shevington (2005)</xref> also found high internal consistency for the overall module (α = .82 and .92, respectively), as supported by our findings. It is worth noting that the original view of the WHOQOL Group did not intend that the SRPB items should be combined into a single scale but stressed instead the importance that SRPB beliefs be examined separately for their potential effects on health and QoL. Consequently, profile scores have been suggested for use with the module. Although other studies have demonstrated acceptable internal consistency reliability for the independent SRPB facets, the hope and optimism facet needs further testing in Norway before profile scoring can be recommended.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section21-0898010112461976">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>The study is limited because of convenience sampling and small samples. Study samples are not representative of the general population at large because of an overrepresentation of participants who belonged to Christian communities, more females, more participants who lived alone, and a majority of professionals who were divorced. Only 54% of the Norwegian population are members of life attitude communities belonging to Christian communities, 65% of normal population live alone, and 10% of professionals are divorced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0898010112461976">Statistics Norway 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0898010112461976">2011</xref>). Future focus group testing in Norway is needed that represent more diverse samples and participants with other spiritual, religious, and personal beliefs to validate study findings as this study can be considered only the first phase in a longer process of validity testing of the Norwegian version.</p>
<p>Furthermore, all groups were from southeastern Norway, although it can be considered a strength that six geographical areas are represented from both inpatient and community-based services. The percentage of male professionals (22.5%) among health professionals is representative of gender distributions among health workers in Norway 13,46 % (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0898010112461976">Statistics Norway, 2012</xref>). Participants were also moderately to highly religious and interested in this topic, so mean scores may be higher than they would be in a representative sample. It can also be considered a limitation that the expert group in our translation process did not include members with a background in various health care disciplines.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section22-0898010112461976">
<title>Implications for Holistic Nursing Practice</title>
<p>Despite limitations, the development of the SRPB module can hold many implications for holistic nursing. According to the WHO, spirituality, religiosity, and personal beliefs should be routinely addressed in the assessment of QoL in order to provide a more comprehensive holistic assessment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0898010112461976">O’Connel &amp; Skevington, 2005</xref>; WHOQOL-SRPB Group, 2005). It is to be hoped that the module can be used to assess spiritual concerns among those with different faith backgrounds as well as agnostics, atheists, and nonbelievers in many cultures. The module can be used in national and cross-cultural nursing research, as many language versions exist. The WHO translation and focus group protocol can be applied in various cultures supporting nurses in minimizing validity threats to translation quality, as well as ensuring comparability of results in different cultural and ethnic groups. The items can also be used to enhance nurses’ self-reflection regarding their own beliefs and how these beliefs influence their relationships with others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0898010112461976">Baldacchino, 2008</xref>). The module can serve as a useful tool in probing and planning appropriate individual and group interventions. It could also be used for educational purposes as a tool for holistic training in spirituality and spiritual care at many levels: undergraduate, graduate, and continuing education.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>All focus group participants found the individual items and facets relevant for the assessment of SRPB in the Norwegian culture. The WHO translation and focus group procedure did reveal a few discrepancies in meanings attached to individual items. The facets meaning and purpose in life and experiencing awe were the facets that seemed the most problematic, and the facet faith was very clear. The facets spiritual strength, inner peace/serenity/harmony, and hope and optimism were for the most part conceptually understandable, with only minor changes made in translation. Four facets of the SRPB module were found to discriminate between groups: spiritual connection, meaning in life, experiences of awe, and wholeness and integration showing strongest discriminatory ability with professionals displaying higher scores. Issues related to spiritual strength, inner peace, and hope and optimism were quite similar between the professional and patient groups. The overall module also showed high internal consistency reliability, as did the individual facets with the exception of the facet hope and optimism.</p>
