<abstract>
<p>This paper examines the roles of Shanghai, Beijing and Hong Kong as financial centres by utilising interview and secondary data to analyse the decision-making of financial and regulatory actors, and the different functional roles of foreign banks in those cities. Their intercity relations demonstrate a complex mix of competition and collaboration that embeds them in evolving networks of interdependence. Empirical findings indicate differentiated markets leading to the distinctive development of Shanghai as a commercial centre, Beijing as a political centre and Hong Kong as an offshore financial centre, with all three financial centres performing distinctive and complementary roles within the regional banking strategies of foreign banks. The analysis first explains Hong Kong’s continued dominance in the region and, secondly, reveals insights into changing intercity relationships between these prominent Chinese cities that contribute to their distinctive development as financial centres.</p>

<title>1. Introduction</title>
<p>In March 2009, China’s State Council announced the bold objective of developing Shanghai into a major international financial centre (IFC) and shipping hub by the year 2020 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0042098011408143"><italic>Shanghai Daily</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0042098011408143">Winston &amp; Strawn LLP, 2009</xref>). The news triggered concerns in Hong Kong from some bankers who feared that it might turn into a Boston or Chicago living under the shadow of New York’s pre-eminence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0042098011408143">Durfee, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0042098011408143"><italic>The Standard</italic>, 2009</xref>). During the 1980s and 1990s, Hong Kong’s strategic advantage in connecting global capital and China led to the rapid development of its finance sector and economy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0042098011408143">Li, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0042098011408143">Enright <italic>et al</italic>., 1997</xref>). As Shanghai continues to develop its finance and trade sectors, there is increasing concern that it may overtake Hong Kong as the pre-eminent financial centre within China, if not the wider Asian region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0042098011408143">Ng, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0042098011408143"><italic>The Economist</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0042098011408143">Wong, 2007</xref>). In addition, the development of Jinrong Jie (Finance Street) in Beijing with its agglomeration of regulatory institutions and headquarters of national state-owned banks (SOBs) appears to threaten Shanghai’s aspiration in becoming the leading IFC for China (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0042098011408143">Caijing, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0042098011408143">Hu, 2008</xref>). These anxieties echo similar concerns about competition between other IFCs, such as London and Frankfurt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0042098011408143">Faulconbridge, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0042098011408143">Beaverstock <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>). The discourse, particularly in the media, tends to be one of competition and rivalry with predicted winners and losers.</p>
<p>Based on these views, Shanghai’s future as China’s pre-eminent IFC seems far from assured and Hong Kong’s position appears threatened by the development of IFC capacities on the mainland. However, studies indicate that Hong Kong continues to be the dominant IFC in east Asia, ranking far ahead of Shanghai and Beijing (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0042098011408143">Table 1</xref>) and it remains a global leader in international banking and finance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0042098011408143">Meyer, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0042098011408143">2009</xref>). It seems, therefore, that we need to consider new ways of conceptualising geographies of IFC and global cities in order to explain Hong Kong’s continued dominance in Greater China and to understand changing intercity relationships between these prominent Chinese cities. While hierarchical explanations of IFC geographies and global city development are useful in establishing the relative power and positions of cities, more relational accounts that embed financial centres in networks of interdependence and market specialisation could offer further insights into intercity dynamics.</p>

<p>Since the early 1980s, urban scholars have explored the interplay between globalisation and urban development, relating dominant socioeconomic trends within cities (such as industrial restructuring, labour market changes and social polarisation) to the emergence of a global urban hierarchy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0042098011408143">Friedmann, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0042098011408143">Knox and Taylor, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0042098011408143">Sassen, 2000</xref>). This hierarchy divides cities into different tiers of importance according to their degree of integration into the global economy (mainly according to transnational corporation (TNC) activities) and their roles as basing points of global capital in the spatialisation and articulation of global production, finance and markets. In seeking more nuanced and richer accounts of global city processes, recent accounts have focused on exploring networks and flows between global cities with the adoption of a relational perspective to intercity relations and linkages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0042098011408143">Beaverstock <italic>et al</italic>., 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0042098011408143">2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0042098011408143">Sassen, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0042098011408143">Taylor, 2004</xref>). This relational approach to urbanisation and capital accumulation has led to the recognition of a wider variety of global cities, revealing new nodes and networks in the global economy (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0042098011408143">Robinson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0042098011408143">Lai, 2009</xref>). Post-socialist cities, for example, are increasingly connected to and embedded in global systems of production, capital flows and accumulation. As a country that is currently developing new financial institutions and infrastructures, and becoming an increasingly active participant in global finance, China’s experience presents opportunities for fresh insights into IFC geographies and intercity relations.</p>
<p>While this paper foregrounds a relational perspective on intercity linkages and highlights complementary roles of IFCs within a wider network, it is not my intention to dismiss the importance of hierarchical dimensions and the reality of interurban competition. I approach intercity relations as co-dependent forms of development—not a ‘winner-takes-all’ perspective that tends to stem from hierarchical studies or an ‘all-remains-equal’ interpretation that a relational approach alludes to (although these are admittedly crude caricatures of both views). Rather than adopting a partisan view of the ‘network versus hierarchy’ debate, this paper emphasises the complex co-existence of competition and collaboration, of horizontal as well as vertical linkages, amongst global cities and IFCs. This dynamic approach takes into account shifting sets of relations between global cities and IFCs as their relative roles and positions evolve with local growth factors (for example, policy changes, local or national economic development) as well as the wider context of global economic change.</p>
<p>Hence, this paper argues that Shanghai, Hong Kong and Beijing operate within a network of IFCs and it is this network that enables them to capitalise on their respective advantages and perform distinctive roles as banking centres in China. Through examining the decision-making of large foreign banks and the different functional roles of branches based in Shanghai, Beijing and Hong Kong, my findings reveal these cities as having differentiated markets. This market differentiation by foreign bankers is based on and reinforces the distinctive development of Shanghai as a commercial centre, Beijing as a political centre and Hong Kong as an offshore financial centre, with all three IFCs performing complementary roles within the regional banking strategies of foreign banks. These findings support a relational perspective on IFC geographies that places cities within a network of complementarity that enables their continued participation and success, even as they are embedded within a competitive global economy. The case of Shanghai, Beijing and Hong Kong thus demonstrates dynamic and evolving relations between IFCs as both competitive and collaborative elements are entangled in complex interdependence. While this is not a novel observation in itself (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0042098011408143">Faulconbridge, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0042098011408143">Bassens <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>), this paper offers a fresh perspective on intercity relations by examining the content of such networks through the motivations and behaviour of financial actors, rather than relying on aggregate-level data such as mapping office locations or flight connections (see critique by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0042098011408143">Derudder, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>The rest of the paper develops these arguments as follows. Section 2 presents theoretical reflections on global city networks and outlines my methodological approach. In section 3, I analyse data from interviews with bankers and government officials in Shanghai and Hong Kong and secondary sources in terms of intercity relations and differentiated markets. While Hong Kong, Shanghai and Beijing are often seen as competing financial centres, my findings reveal considerable functional co-ordination and complementary roles and allude to the complex and evolving interdependency of IFCs. The paper concludes in section 4 by highlighting the significance of these findings for researching IFCs and global city networks.</p>

<title>2. Intercity Relations in IFC and Global Cities Research</title>
<p>In establishing the connection between organisational structures of TNCs and changes in the global urban system, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0042098011408143">Friedmann (1986)</xref> and Wolff (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0042098011408143">Friedmann and Wolff, 1982</xref>) popularised the concept of a hierarchy of cities; based on their functions within the global economy, cities may be ranked global (London, New York, Tokyo), multinational (for example, Singapore, Frankfurt), national (for example, São Paulo, Sydney) or sub-national/regional (for example, San Francisco, Vancouver). Similarly, IFCs are ranked based on their importance in the global financial system. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0042098011408143">Reed (1981)</xref>, for example, scored IFCs according to variables such as number of financial headquarters and branches, and volume of financial transactions. Subsequent studies also noted the role of producer services in supporting IFC growth, whereby particular cities function as sites of production for services and financial products that co-ordinate global economic activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0042098011408143">Thrift, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0042098011408143">Daniels, 1993</xref>). In this way, cities such as New York, London and Tokyo become strategic sites for the development, production and supply of innovative financial and business services, thereby sustaining their prominence in the global economy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0042098011408143">Sassen, 1991</xref>).</p>
<p>In producing rankings and league tables, these studies identified important <italic>attributes</italic> of global cities or IFCs but did not explain the <italic>processes</italic> that sustain their prominent roles in a global system. By focusing on interdependent networked geographies between these cities, we could reach a better understanding of these processes and their implications for intercity relations and global city development. Geographers have recently highlighted the value of a network approach to the global economy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0042098011408143">Dicken <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0042098011408143">Hughes, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0042098011408143">Jones, 2008</xref>) and this is reflected in studies on IFCs and global city development. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0042098011408143">Faulconbridge (2004)</xref>, for example, explains London’s continued dominance in global and regional financial networks and Frankfurt’s growth as a complementary centre by highlighting the roles of networks and interdependencies in producing global networks and linked cities (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0042098011408143">Sassen, 2002</xref>). In addition to their attribute properties, the connections between cities are also important in explaining their growth and development. This focus on intercity relations and systemic linkages also foregrounds more complementary forms of relations and alliances alongside the notion of hierarchy and competition implicit in hierarchy-based comparative research. This logic is reflected in Castells’‘network society’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0042098011408143">Castells, 1996</xref>), in which the dominant form of space is no longer spaces of places but a new space of flows between key nodes and hubs of the global system. In arguing that “the global city phenomenon cannot be reduced to a few urban cores at the top of the hierarchy” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0042098011408143">Castells, 1996</xref>, p. 380), Castells calls for a greater number of cities to be included in a global network that connects centres with different intensity and at different scales.</p>
<p>Urban scholars have increasingly stressed the importance of a relational stance: major cities are (re)produced by what flows through them (for example, people, information, money, cultural practices). Following on from this view of world cities as being (re)produced by global networking and connectivity, the empirical analyses should therefore focus on flows between cities. This is reflected in the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0042098011408143">Alderson and Beckfield (2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0042098011408143">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0042098011408143">Alderson <italic>et al</italic>., 2010)</xref> and the Globalization and World City (GaWC) Research Network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0042098011408143">Taylor, 1997b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0042098011408143">Beaverstock <italic>et al</italic>., 2000</xref>). While they differ in their methodologies and subsequent interpretations (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0042098011408143">Beckfield and Alderson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0042098011408143">Taylor, 2006a</xref>), both projects are based on the premise that collecting data on the organisational geography of large TNCs will enable the intercity relations of corporate activity to be estimated, which would demonstrate the relative power and position of cities in the global economy. By measuring the office networks of TNCs, and the constitutive flows of capital, knowledge and people between global cities, they argue that we can reach a better understanding of the interdependent network dynamics of contemporary globalisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0042098011408143">Beaverstock <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Similar network studies have used other data sources to conceptualise intercity linkages, such as flight connections and airline flows (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0042098011408143">Smith and Timberlake, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0042098011408143">2002</xref>) and advanced telecommunication networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0042098011408143">Graham, 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0042098011408143">2004</xref>). As noted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0042098011408143">Derudder (2008)</xref>, this recent surge of studies on intercity networks has opened up new theoretical and empirical perspectives on the articulation of global cities within the global networks and flows of capital, people and knowledge. A specific contribution is the unveiling of new global cities within a literature that has been criticised for normalising the sociospatial features and development trajectories of North American and western European cities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0042098011408143">Robinson, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0042098011408143">2005</xref>). The study of airline flows between cities, for example, reveals the growing integration and importance of cities in the global South (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0042098011408143">Taylor <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>). Another example is the mapping of corporate linkages between Islamic financial services firms that highlights the importance of Manama, Dubai and Abu Dhabi, cities that are often missing in conventional accounts of global city networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0042098011408143">Bassens <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Although these studies have established the importance of intercity linkages in understanding global networks, they tend to focus on more abstract analyses of agglomeration and the clustering of firms (for some exceptions, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0042098011408143">Beaverstock <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0042098011408143">Pain, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0042098011408143">Chu, 2008</xref>). While the models and matrices from Alderson and Beckfield and the GaWC group have produced important results on city rankings and network structures, their firm-level data exclude other important economic agents such as actors within firms; the decision-making, strategies, behaviour and practices of these actors have significant impacts on economic flows between firms and cities and can offer more fine-grained analyses of intercity relations. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0042098011408143">Beaverstock’s (2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0042098011408143">2007)</xref> research on investment bankers demonstrates how the knowledge-rich staff of global investment banks require face-to-face contacts to generate value for their firms and customers and to facilitate transactions. This generates intercity expert labour mobility and influences the roles of cities within an IFC network. This form of intensive research on ‘micro network systems’ and qualitative data is valuable in enriching our understanding of intercity relations.</p>
<p>While research on the structural aspects of intercity linkages has brought more cities and different forms of urban networks into prominence, it does not explain how or why certain urban and economic processes take place in those cities that lead to their growth or decline. Recent work on relational economic geographies has emphasised the need to examine relationships in the global economy and how such linkages give actors power and influence. As argued by Dicken <italic>et al</italic>.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>network relationships should be understood as being both structural and relational and … constituted by the interactions of variously powerful actors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0042098011408143">Dicken <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>, p.94).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>A mode of analysis that considers not only the structural but also the relational aspects of networks can reveal how places are enmeshed within a wider context and understood through their relations with other actors or other places. Therefore, by considering a city or IFC as the result of the networks, flows and relations in which it is embedded, we can understand and explain more fully its role in a regional or global system.</p>
<p>Drawing upon these insights, this paper argues that, to understand the roles of Hong Kong, Shanghai and Beijing as IFCs within a regional system, we need to examine the content and meanings of intercity flows and relations. To this end, I analyse the operational strategies of multinational banks in these cities to understand the rationale and motivations of financial actors embedded in such networks. This perspective of complex interdependency enables us to explain intercity relationships not only in competitive terms but also in terms of how different urban centres perform distinctive and complementary roles as part of a wider strategy of global or regional integration. For example, instead of seeing Shanghai’s IFC aspiration as threatening Hong Kong’s IFC status, Shanghai’s development could be interpreted within the context of growth with other IFCs as part of the regional business strategy of foreign banks in China. While cities undeniably compete to attract specific types of investment that would increase their power and position in terms of corporate control and co-ordination, these vertical linkages are also entangled with horizontal linkages that connect them in collaborative relationships and embed them in networks of interdependency.</p>
<p>The analysis in this paper draws from field research conducted in Shanghai from 2005 to 2007 (with some supplementary data from London) and in Hong Kong in 2009. I conducted 68 interviews with foreign and Chinese financial institutions (most banks, and some securities companies), Chinese regulators and officials (including the Shanghai Municipal Government (SMG) and the China Banking Regulatory Commission (CBRC)), and foreign chambers of commerce (British, European Union and Canadian). While the majority of my respondents (46) were based in Shanghai, many had regional postings in Beijing, Hong Kong and other Asian cities. They also had insights on how different cities fit into their business networks and strategies based on their positions as regional directors and chief executive officers or in other senior management roles. The interviews were conducted in English and Mandarin, lasting between 45 to 90 minutes, and then I personally transcribed and translated them. Interview questions focused on reasons for setting up in particular cities, challenges or difficulties, corporate strategies or institutional policies for the Chinese banking market, the development of financial or regulatory knowledge, and the opportunities and challenges that they perceived for the Chinese banking sector.</p>
<p>To analyse the interview transcripts, I employed systematic coding and recoding processes informed by some of the techniques of grounded theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0042098011408143">Strauss and Corbin, 1990</xref>). This guides the researcher through the building rather than ‘testing’ of theories through iterative abstraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0042098011408143">Crang, 1997</xref>). I first sifted through the data via a process of open coding, annotating and making notes. This involved analysing transcripts, noting particular observations, sentences and paragraphs and giving each discrete incident, idea or event particular themes or codes. As ideas emerged they were jotted down as theoretical memos. Similar phenomena identified by open coding were then brought together into common categories and given conceptual labels, sometimes borrowing words and phrases used by my respondents. I then re-analysed and refined these themes in relation to my conceptual framework and as new empirical material emerged.</p>
<p>In addition to semi-structured interviews, secondary data sources provided contextual information as well as a means of triangulating interview data to improve the integrity of empirical findings and interpretations. These included business and scholarly research on the financial markets and regulatory environment, government reports, local newspapers and business magazine articles, and announcements from banks and regulators, in both English and Chinese languages. I also kept a field journal to record observations made outside of formal interviews, events in local and national politics and business circles, and rumours that were circulating in the industry grapevine. These provided additional insights from interacting with financial actors and being ‘out there’ in the field that were not captured in interview transcripts.</p>

<title>3. China’s Financial Centre Network</title>
<p>In an Asian cities network study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0042098011408143">Taylor (2006b)</xref> uses an interlocking network model to study intercity linkages between Shanghai, Hong Kong, Taipei and Beijing (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0042098011408143">Table 2</xref>). Two observations can be drawn from this dataset that pertain to the argument of this paper: first, Hong Kong continues to be the pre-eminent Chinese city during this period, ranking far ahead of Shanghai and Beijing (and most other Asian cities); secondly, Shanghai and Beijing have significantly increased their network connectivity, with Shanghai rising from a rank of 30 to 23 and Beijing rising from a rank of 33 to 22. This demonstrates the dynamic and evolving nature of intercity relations and city rankings. Yet while Taylor’s findings suggest that Shanghai and Beijing are playing increasingly important roles in the networks of global service firms, the data say little about the different types of global service firms and functions in different cities and whether they imply different roles for those cities within regional or global networks.</p>

<p>In the rest of this section, I build on Taylor’s findings to unpack the intercity financial networks, focusing on financial and regulatory processes that contribute to the sustained dominance of Hong Kong and the increasingly influential but distinctive roles of Shanghai and Beijing. Based on personal interviews with financial and policy actors and secondary data, my analysis highlights the intercity relations that make these three Chinese cities interdependent and complementary IFCs, functioning as differentiated markets within the regional network of foreign banks in China.</p>
<sec id="section4-0042098011408143">
<title>3.1 Shanghai and Beijing: Dual-headquarter Strategy</title>
<p>In the late 1980s, the central government earmarked Shanghai as a city of national strategic importance in driving the growth of the Yangtze delta region and connecting China to the global economy through its financial and trade sectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0042098011408143">Yusuf and Wu, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0042098011408143">Wu, 2003</xref>). It currently has the highest concentration of foreign banks in China and a range of equities and commodities markets, including the largest stock exchange in China, commodities exchanges in gold and metals, a futures exchange and the China Foreign Exchange Centre. Despite these achievements, there are concerns regarding its future as a flagship IFC for China, given Beijing’s own aspiration to become a global financial hub and its political dominance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0042098011408143">Hu, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0042098011408143">Zhang, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Beijing’s most significant advantage lies in its role as the capital of socialist China and home to institutions responsible for managing and determining the economic and political life of the country. It has the country’s central bank (People’s Bank of China, PBOC), the headquarters of all major financial regulatory institutions, such as the China Banking Regulatory Commission (CBRC; and counterparts in insurance and securities regulation—CIRC and CSRC), the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE), along with the headquarters of national state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and SOBs.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0042098011408143">1</xref></sup> The development of a Jinrong Jie (Finance Street) in Beijing that is home to many of these financial and regulatory institutions is also seen as symptomatic of Beijing’s aspiration in the finance sector. The agglomeration of these important institutions creates an environment rich in political and economic information that is crucial to IFC development. Some researchers have doubted Shanghai’s future as China’s leading IFC given its lack of such high-level institutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0042098011408143">Yatsko, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0042098011408143">Cai and Sit, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0042098011408143">Zhao <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Rather than arguing for the relative importance of a particular IFC, my research findings indicate that Shanghai and Beijing perform qualitatively different roles within the Chinese IFC network. Chinese government officials, and foreign and Chinese financial actors, make clear distinctions between Beijing as a political centre and Shanghai as a business and commercial hub; this influences their investment and regulatory decisions and results in different but complementary roles for both cities as IFCs in terms of financial regulation and banking strategies. Interviewees identify a strong focus on relationships, information gathering and exchange and politics in Beijing that is contrasted with an orientation towards commercial opportunities and action in Shanghai. While Beijing has an established historical role as China’s political capital, Shanghai has an illustrious history as a regional commercial and financial hub that flourished particularly in the early 20th century (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0042098011408143">Wasserstrom, 2009</xref>). Their different historial roles and socio-cultural milieux lead to distinctive business and social environments. Most of my respondents differentiate between the more open-minded approach and efficiency of Shanghai and the more relationship-driven environment in Beijing in influencing their investment decisions and operational strategies. They highlight a cultural propensity in Shanghai to be open to outside influence and foreign investors, an ethic for commerce built up over generations and a more welcoming and conducive living and working environment for foreigners as compared with Beijing</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Shanghai has the history. [The people] are much more comfortable dealing with foreigners. So for us, you feel much more at ease here than in Beijing. In Beijing, there’s much more of an inner crowd, much more patriotic, much more political, much more slow. Shanghai has a much higher productivity per employee than other places in China. It seems to be much more accepting of foreigners. English is much better. I think quality of living [is also better] (foreign manager of foreign bank, no. 36, 18 October 2006)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The roles of Shanghai and Beijing as complementary centres within a regional network are evident in two aspects of IFC linkages: first, the roles of both cities in financial regulation and, secondly, how large foreign banks decide to locate different types of financial institutions and branch operations in these differentiated markets.</p>
<sec id="section5-0042098011408143">
<title>Different IFC functions in financial regulation</title>
<p>In terms of financial regulation, there is a clear distinction in the roles played by Beijing and Shanghai as IFCs, with Beijing being responsible for policy-making and macro planning while Shanghai is tasked with testing new products, developing new markets and financial innovation. Laws are passed by central authorities in Beijing but are implemented and enforced by local branch offices. This lack of specificity allows for adaptation to local needs by local branches in the context of a large country with wide disparities in regional and local political economies. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0042098011408143">Zhao (2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0042098011408143">Zhao <italic>et al</italic>., 2004)</xref> argues that this leads to information asymmetry as administrative agents know more than financial actors in the market, resulting in the concentration of power within Beijing-based institutions and the agglomeration of corporate and financial headquarters in that city. However, my research findings point to qualitatively different but equally important roles for both Shanghai and Beijing in financial regulation and restructuring. While the final decision-making is made in Beijing where the headquarters of its main regulatory bodies are located, regulatory authorities in Shanghai have considerable autonomy to interpret and implement those laws and policies. Over the past five years, local regulatory offices in Shanghai have had increasing levels of authority in their operations with former headquarter functions delegated to branch offices. According to regulatory officials interviewed, this is an enduring trend as regulatory bodies seek to improve their efficiency and service quality. With Shanghai having the highest concentration of foreign banks and hosting new financial markets in futures, derivatives and foreign exchange, the allocation of more responsibilities to local regulatory offices would improve regulators’ market response to changing economic conditions and increase their sensitivity to the business requirements of foreign and domestic financial institutions based in Shanghai (CBRC official, no. 25, 16 April 2006; local vice-director of Chinese fund management company, no. 26, 18 April 2006; local analyst for Chinese securities company, no. 34, 17 October 2006).</p>
<p>The establishment of PBOC’s second headquarter on 10 August 2005 illustrates this interdependent relationship between Beijing and Shanghai as IFCs within a regulatory network. Zhou Xiaochuan, a governor of the PBOC explained that, due to Shanghai’s importance as a financial hub, the existing Shanghai branch office of the PBOC had often assumed a role of greater importance than a mere regional branch and that was a key consideration in establishing a headquarter there (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0042098011408143">Xinhua News Agency, 2005</xref>). With this dual-headquarter structure, the Beijing headquarter continues to run policy-oriented operations related to monetary policy, financial research, note issuance, statistical data and anti-money laundering, while the Shanghai headquarter focuses on market-oriented and international activities such as conducting financial supervision, financial analysis and co-ordinating regional financial co-operation. To improve PBOC’s management further, it has transferred some of its bureaus for payment, liquidation and national credit profiling to the Shanghai headquarter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0042098011408143"><italic>China Daily</italic>, 2005</xref>). The latter also plays a vital role in consolidating feedback from market participants in Shanghai that would influence subsequent policy changes. The two headquarters therefore perform complementary roles in regulating China’s finance sector as a whole (Shanghai government official, no. 28, 20 April 2006). While the opening of a second headquarter is an affirmation of Shanghai’s increasing importance, it does not neccesarily contradict Beijing’s role in financial regulation</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Shanghai focuses on financial innovation, new systems; Beijing focuses on regulation, macro adjustments. The operational aspects are in Shanghai; the macro aspects, elements of control are in Beijing. Making policies, macro planning, these are in Beijing. After planning, the details are then carried out in Shanghai, that’s basically how it is. So its main functions as a financial centre are different from Beijing (local vice-director of Chinese fund management company, no. 26, 18 April 2006).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This quote is one of many from interviewees that highlight the interdependency of both cities in financial regulation whereby each performs distinctive but complementary roles. A relational approach to IFC geographies thus reveals evolving intercity relations that position these Chinese cities in distinctive roles within a wider regulatory network.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0042098011408143">
<title>Different IFC functions for foreign banks</title>
<p>The interdependent and complementary roles of Shanghai and Beijing as IFCs are also reflected in the operational strategies of foreign banks in China. Just as these two cities serve dual-headquarter functions in financial regulation, a dual-headquarter strategy is also evident in the operational structures of foreign banks interviewed, in locating different types of corporate and financial activities in different cities. For political and historical reasons, the headquarters of Chinese regulatory bodies and national SOBs and SOEs are almost all located in Beijing and this has direct bearing on the locational strategy of foreign banks. A Beijing location is more important for those whose target clients are Chinese SOEs, while those with foreign TNC clients prefer Shanghai (with most TNCs located in the Yangtze and Pearl River delta regions). As foreign TNCs form the primary market for most foreign commercial banks, they would tend to locate their China headquarter in Shanghai rather than Beijing. Even for Chinese national SOBs headquartered in Beijing, many have transferred their credit facilities, accounting departments, reporting branches and other functions to Shanghai as a result of the high volume of financial transactions and increasing significance of financial markets there (CBRC official, no. 25, 16 April 2006; Shanghai government official, no. 28, 20 April 2006). This trend mirrors the decision of the PBOC to establish its second headquarter in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Based on the distinctive political, economic and social environments of both cities as previously highlighted, financial actors differentiate between Beijing as an “administrative capital” and Shanghai as a “business capital” (foreign manager of foreign bank, no. 13, 7 March 2006) in guiding their regional business strategies in China. Banking offices in Beijing mainly serve as “diplomatic posts” (foreign president of foreign bank, no. 20, 11 April 2006) tasked with maintaining relationships with Chinese corporate clients, government and regulatory officials and lobbying on specific issues; offices in Shanghai are responsible for the bulk of business transactions and focus on the provision of financial products and services to clients. Both cities fulfil vital roles in the business strategies of foreign banks and they structure their branch networks in China accordingly in order to take advantage of how both cities perform complementary functions in their China business as a whole. Hence, whether Shanghai or Beijing has more company headquarters does not necessarily mean one is more important as an IFC since they perform functionally different roles within the operational networks of foreign banks</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Shanghai has its advantages and Beijing has its advantages. Shanghai’s advantage is that you are closer to the market, closer to your customers. Our head office is set in Shanghai so our branch manager at the Beijing branch has a special mission. His role is to maintain communication with the regulators in Beijing … to look after official relations and not bank operations. On the other hand, for banks that have head offices in Beijing, they will not neglect the Shanghai market either. They will have representative offices and branch offices in Shanghai as well. So it’s not just a matter of where the head office is; there is a dual strategy (Chinese manager of foreign bank, no. 11, 6 March 2006).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The different roles of Shanghai and Beijing as IFCs are also evident in the specific types of foreign bank located in these cities. Investment banks such as Goldman Sachs, BNP Paribus, Morgan Stanley and Credit Suisse tend to be in Beijing, to be closer to their target clients of Chinese SOEs in the energy, telecommunications and utilities industries and SOBs. Due to the politically sensitive nature of business dealings with this clientèle, maintaining good relations with government and regulatory officials based in Beijing is deemed vital to business operations, which explains the preference of foreign investment banks to locate their head offices in the ‘administrative capital’. On the other hand, commercial banks, such as HSBC, Standard Chartered, Citibank, Bank of East Asia, ING and Deutsche Bank, consider it more important to locate their China headquarters in Shanghai to provide a better service to their foreign TNC clients and to maintain business networks with other commercial banks in the ‘business capital’. For banks with both investment and commercial banking divisions, their investment banking functions tend to be in Beijing while their trading, financing and asset management functions are in Shanghai to capitalise on its global linkages and agglomeration economies with the high concentration of foreign banks.</p>
<p>Amongst the foreign banks interviewed, the general consensus was that the minimum set-up needed for business in China would be a branch in Shanghai and a representative office in Beijing, both being vital to banking operations in China as a whole. The typical structure consists of a branch office with 10 to 50 people in Shanghai offering financial products and services in corporate banking and wealth management (with some retail banking as the market develops), and three to eight people in a representative office in Beijing who would maintain linkages with the headquarters of Chinese companies, regulatory and government institutions, and perhaps run a research desk. This “dual-headquarter structure” (Shanghai government official, no. 28, 20 April 2006) reflects the different advantages of each city’s distinctive political, economic and social environments. By analysing the rationale and decision-making of financial and regulatory actors, we could obtain insights into how Shanghai and Beijing perform qualitatively different but complementary roles as IFCs within the business networks of foreign banks in China.</p>

<title>3.2 Shanghai and Hong Kong as Parallel Markets</title>
<p>Over the past decade, the aspiration of Shanghai as a financial centre and its integration into the global economy have led to speculations that it may usurp Hong Kong’s position as the pre-eminent financial centre in China. However, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0042098011408143">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0042098011408143">2</xref> suggest that Hong Kong continues to be the pre-eminent IFC, not only for Greater China but also for the Asia-Pacific region. An analysis of financial activities and flows between Hong Kong and Shanghai reveals the regulatory complexities and market differentiation between the two IFCs. Financial actors capitalise and further develop on these differences through strategies of spatial arbitrage, resulting in functionally different but relationally interdependent roles for both IFCs. To substantiate this argument, I turn to recent developments in the stock markets and banking sectors in Shanghai and Hong Kong.</p>
<sec id="section8-0042098011408143">
<title>Dual listings and complementary stock markets</title>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0042098011408143">Table 3</xref> shows the market capitalisation and number of listed companies on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (HKSE) and Shanghai Stock Exchange (SSE). Since its re-estalishment in 1990, the SSE has grown to become the sixth-largest stock market in the world based on domestic market capitalisation, ahead of the HKSE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0042098011408143">World Federation of Exchanges, 2009</xref>). However, an examination of the types of companies listed on both exchanges reveals significant geographical and sectoral clustering in each IFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0042098011408143">Karreman and van der Knapp, 2009</xref>). First, small and locally oriented companies are predominantly listed on the SSE while the HKSE attracts large internationally oriented companies. Secondly, firms listed on the SSE are predominantly in primary and heavy industries such as mining, utilities, chemicals and food production, while those on the HKSE are largely in information and knowledge-intensive industries such as banking, insurance, telecommunications and computer technology. This strongly suggests that both IFCs exhibit considerable complementarity in terms of their stock market and are not developing as close substitutes. To unravel the rationale behind this trend, I examine the different reasons for listing on the SSE or HKSE based on the experience and perspectives of the regulatory and government officials and financial actors interviewed. These financial actors have insights into the process of stock market listings from their business and regulatory relationships with mainland Chinese companies and institutional investors. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0042098011408143">Table 4</xref> summarises my interview findings on why mainland Chinese companies would seek public listings on the SSE or HKSE.</p>

<p>The HKSE’s biggest advantage lies in having a more liquid stock market that is not hindered by regulatory restrictions as on the SSE. These regulatory restrictions are related to the partial privatisation of Chinese SOEs, resulting in a divided stock market of A-shares for domestic investors and B-shares for foreign investors.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0042098011408143">2</xref></sup> Apart from these tradeable shares, the majority of shares are non-tradeable and mostly owned by the government. The multiple ownership structure, persistent state control and other restrictions regarding share trading on the secondary market have resulted in limited liquidity on the mainland stock exchanges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0042098011408143">Hertz, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0042098011408143">Walter and Howie, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0042098011408143">Green, 2004</xref>). In comparison, the absence of such restrictions on the HKSE has enabled a deeper and more liquid capital market to develop, where listed companies could raise more capital from a broader range of international investors.</p>
<p>Interviewees also highlighted the international reputation of the HKSE and Hong Kong as an IFC as a distinctive advantage, since a public listing on the HKSE could boost the international branding and reputation of the company. This has important implications for a company’s business expansion plans and internationalisation strategy; if it intends to expand overseas into Asia and other global markets, a listing on the HKSE not only raises capital in a freely convertible foreign currency but also its regional and international profile ahead of overseas expansion (local manager of foreign bank, no. 11, 6 March 2006; local analyst for Chinese securities company, no. 34, 17 October 2006). Hong Kong’s well-developed legal system with its reputation for investor protection, high financial reporting standards and prudent regulatory system is well-established and internationally recognised (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0042098011408143">Enright <italic>et al</italic>., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0042098011408143">Meyer, 2002</xref>). A listing on the HKSE therefore reflects positively on the company’s accounting standards, corporate governance and business management, and thereby improves company valuation, which influences business relationships such as transactions with suppliers and securing future financing opportunities. This reputational factor is highlighted by a foreign manager of a foreign bank (no. 37, 19 October 2006) who would assess the financial status and stability of a potential client based on where it is publicly listed</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Sinopec, 85—nearly 90—per cent of their balance sheet is actually listed in Hong Kong, and that gives us confidence because once you’ve got a listing in Hong Kong, we know that your accounting is going to be of a better standard than your regular Chinese company. Even if it’s listed in Shanghai, I don’t know [how robust that company is].</p>

<p>This difference in credibility between the HKSE and SSE could explain the HKSE’s continued pre-eminence despite the rapid growth and market size of the SSE as seen in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0042098011408143">Table 3</xref>. While statistics may point to SSE as the stronger competitor, the experience of financial actors reveals that mainland China’s legal system and institutions (for example, investor protection, corporate governance practices and financial reporting standards) are still underdeveloped with opaque rules, fuzzy guidelines and tedious procedures. With inadequate enforcement of rules and regulation, listed Chinese companies have little incentive to meet corporate transparency standards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0042098011408143">Huang, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0042098011408143">Ferguson and McGuiness, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0042098011408143">Allen <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>). As a result, price manipulation, fake transactions and the issuance of false information are pervasive on the mainland stock markets, which adds to the difficulty of making informed investment decisions, particularly for foreign investors (foreign finance manager of foreign bank, no. 12, 6 March 2006; deputy head of capital markets of foreign bank, no. 15: 7 March 2006). These market characteristics reinforce HKSE’s reputation for better-quality listed companies and contribute to its continued success in attracting and channelling financial flows.</p>
<p>However, the SSE is not necessarily a ‘second-class’ stock market as it appeals to different types of companies with its specific stock market characteristics. A special consideration is the tendency for state regulators to prioritise SOEs over private companies in the application process. In obtaining approval from the CSRC, SOEs often have their applications fast-tracked and become publicly listed ahead of smaller or private companies for political reasons (local manager of Chinese securities company, no. 35, 18 October 2006). A Chinese company may also prefer a SSE listing due to lower fees (for example, legal, accounting, brokerage) and less stringent listing requirements compared with Hong Kong (which would take longer). While a company aiming for overseas expansion could benefit from the exposure of listing on HKSE and the injection of capital in foreign currency, another company with a strategic focus on the large domestic market might obtain a better share price by listing in Shanghai, where it already has brand recognition on the mainland. A listing in Hong Kong would require greater investment in advertising and publicity to raise investor awareness and interest (local manager of foreign bank, no. 11, 6 March 2006). Therefore, a HKSE listing has its advantages, but the SSE still provides a valuable platform for many Chinese companies.</p>
<p>Other than strategic business decisions, the political motivations of Chinese state regulators are crucial factors in the public listing options of Chinese companies. The Chinese government is mindful of domestic concerns that the best Chinese companies are listing abroad while mediocre companies list in Shanghai (or Shenzhen), such that China’s wealth and opportunities are ‘leaking’ out of the mainland to Hong Kong and foreign investors rather than benefiting the Chinese citizenry (local vice-director of Chinese securities company, no. 26, 18 April 2006). The Chinese government has to consider such public sentiments in the interest of social and political stability, which would influence their decisions regarding which companies to approve for overseas listings. The politically sensitive nature of overseas listings could explain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0042098011408143">Karreman and van der Knapp’s (2009)</xref> findings that Chinese companies in strategic industries, such as utilities and chemicals, tend to be listed on the SSE instead of the HKSE, resulting in distinctive sectoral variation on both stock exchanges.</p>
<p>The SSE and HKSE therefore present different opportunities and advantages to mainland Chinese companies seeking public listings due to their different regulatory environments, market characteristics and the objectives of the companies themselves. The relationship between the two stock markets is more accurately described as complementary rather than directly competitive. This is particularly evident in the strategy of Chinese companies with dual listings on SSE and HKSE—for example, China Life, Sinopec, China Merchants Bank and the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC). In doing so, they could gain experience in public listings, improve corporate governance, information disclosure and accounting standards, and receive some capital injection from domestic investors through the SSE, which would then put them in a stronger position to meet higher regulatory standards and attract foreign investors through the HKSE. This dual-listing strategy therefore enables Chinese companies to benefit from the distinctive advantages offered by the SSE and HKSE and demonstrates their complementary roles as stock markets.</p>

<title>Regulatory arbitrage in the banking sector</title>
<p>As part of its economic reforms under the ‘open door’ policy in 1978, China has been restructuring its banking sector to a commercial banking system offering an increasingly diversified range of financial products and services. One of the most important reforms in the 1990s was the opening up of the Chinese banking sector to foreign banks who would bring in foreign capital and introduce new banking products and practices from abroad (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0042098011408143">CBRC, 2007b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0042098011408143">Berger <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>). As of 2006, there were more than 70 foreign banks with representative or branch offices in China, with the highest concentration in Shanghai (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0042098011408143">CBRC, 2007a</xref>). The range of products and services offered within the Chinese banking system has subsequently expanded, particularly in previously underdeveloped market segments such as loans to small and medium enterprises (SMEs), trade financing and syndicated loans.</p>
<p>Although the mainland banking sector has developed rapidly over the past two decades, major differences still exist between the regulatory structures of Shanghai and Hong Kong, resulting in distinctive business environments. In particular, foreign banks continue to face significant regulatory restrictions in business licences and foreign exchange on the mainland, which limits their range of financial products and services. This means that, while many foreign banks are opening branch offices in Shanghai to participate in the growing mainland Chinese market, their offices in Hong Kong continue to play vital roles in facilitating business transactions not permitted or deemed inefficient on the mainland.</p>
<p>An example of this networked relationship is the strategy of foreign banks regarding foreign currency restrictions on the mainland. Almost all foreign banks interviewed highlighted the non-convertibility of the <italic>renminbi</italic> (RMB) as a key obstacle to their business expansion in China. The RMB is regulated by tight foreign exchange controls that not only restrict the types of financial products (i.e. domestic currency only) that banks could offer, but also effectively limit the business volume of foreign banks on the mainland. Theoretically, foreign banks could mobilise funds from their head offices or branches elsewhere in the region (such as Hong Kong or Singapore) to finance their China operations and business expansion plans; in reality, they are subject to an annual foreign currency quota that limits their China business. A number of interviewees described having to turn down business opportunities on the mainland in order to stay within their allocated quota. This is understandably frustrating, as explained by this foreign manager of a foreign bank (no. 41, 27 October 2006)</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>If we get a short-term deal, someone comes to me and says, “Oh, we’ve got a brilliant deal, we’ll like you to fund us for $10 million for 3 months” and he did it today, I can’t do it because I’ve only got about $25 million [in my quota], $20 million already spoken for, and the other bits and pieces. So you’re limited in terms of the amount of business you can do. … And that’s it, that’s the limit. A fantastic, huge deal comes along and you can’t do it.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>To cope with this annual quota, many foreign banks route business deals through their Hong Kong offices instead, where there are no such currency restrictions. The geographical proximity of Hong Kong, its experience with China-related business, and financial and legal expertise mean that it is well-positioned to provide such offshore services. So, even though the actual business transaction is not conducted in Shanghai due to quota restrictions, the deal is not lost as it could be serviced out of Hong Kong for the Mainland market. While the Shanghai branches of foreign banks are important for accessing and developing business opportunities in China, their Hong Kong operations still perform crucial roles in facilitating business transactions and financial flows to circumvent restrictions on the mainland. Although the growing Chinese market has induced many companies to relocate their China headquarters to Beijing or Shanghai (which has shifted some sales and service functions), their Asia-Pacific headquarters, treasury business and dealing desks are still maintained in Hong Kong (or further afield in Singapore). This spatial division of functions is reflected in the regional business structures of all the foreign banks interviewed in Shanghai and demonstrates how both IFCs perform complementary and interdependent roles in the business operations and strategies of foreign banks in China.</p>
<p>With the non-convertibility of the RMB and foreign exchange restrictions on the mainland, many financial products and services relating to capital markets are difficult, if not impossible, to operate out of a mainland IFC like Shanghai. These regulatory differences have led to the growth in treasury and offshore financial services in Hong Kong. While Hong Kong is a prominent IFC and centre for corporate headquarters in the wider Asia-Pacific region, it has also developed a distinctive role as an international capital intermediation centre for China since the mid 1990s. Its established finance and banking sector, sound regulatory framework, legal proficiency, agglomeration of financial experts and proximity to the mainland facilitate financial and knowledge flows, contributing to economic and financial development in China as well as sustaining Hong Kong’s success as an IFC. These intercity networks are evident in the large number of financial products and services that Hong Kong has developed for the mainland market in conjunction with PRC authorities. Examples include the listing of PRC equities on the HKSE, development of China-related venture capital and private-loan syndications. Growing financial needs and increased economic flows between Hong Kong and the mainland have also led to new financial products in Hong Kong—for example, RMB deposits, remittances, exchange and credit cards in 2004, RMB cheques in 2005 and RMB bonds in 2007. A RMB Trade Settlement scheme launched in July 2009 now allows mainland companies to settle their trade accounts in RMB (instead of a foreign currency like US dollars) with operations in Hong Kong, Macau and selected south-east Asian countries. These developments are cementing Hong Kong’s role as the premier RMB settlement centre outside the mainland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0042098011408143"><italic>People’s Daily Online</italic>, 2009a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0042098011408143">2009b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0042098011408143">Chan and Chiu, 2009</xref>). Therefore, even as Shanghai develops its banking sector and experiments with capital markets, restrictions on the mainland combined with the established financial expertise of Hong Kong mean that the latter still performs a vital role in providing offshore financial products to complement and capitalise on the growing financial needs of China. This interdependency helps to explain Hong Kong’s continued pre-eminence as an IFC alongside the rapid growth and increasing importance of other Chinese financial centres such as Shanghai and Beijing.</p>
<p>This relational approach to examining IFC development places Hong Kong and Shanghai within an intercity network of financial and knowledge flows, rather than in competitive and hierarchical tiers. The question of Shanghai overtaking Hong Kong as the premier IFC for China and the East Asia region was deemed almost irrelevant by all foreign interviewees as they were not directly comparable. The Chinese regulatory and government officials interviewed also highlighted the notion of ‘parallel markets’ in terms of Shanghai’s and Hong Kong’s roles as IFCs. They emphasised complementary roles for both financial centres with their different market characteristics and the need for multiple financial centres as “one door is not enough” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0042098011408143">TIME, 2000</xref>) for a growing world economic power like China, be it Shanghai, Hong Kong or Beijing. This interdependent relationship between the IFCs is embodied by the business operations of foreign banks in Shanghai and Hong Kong. While foreign banks acknowledge the growing importance of Shanghai, Hong Kong remains a vital market for offshore products and services, particularly for foreign banks with limited business licences on the mainland. This enables both IFCs to perform distinctive but complementary roles in their business strategies to serve customers in China and East Asia with a holistic range of financial products and services.</p>

<title>4. Conclusion: The Dynamic Interdependency of Chinese IFCs</title>
<p>By examining IFCs as being embedded in networks of interdependence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0042098011408143">Faulconbridge, 2004</xref>), findings from this paper, first, explain Hong Kong’s continued dominance in the region and, secondly, reveal insights into changing intercity relationships between these prominent Chinese cities in terms of their IFC development. Other than demonstrating the complex interdependency of Chinese IFCs, the paper also offers a fresh perspective on intercity relations by examining the <italic>content</italic> of such networks through the rationale and practices of financial actors, rather than relying on aggregate firm-level data.</p>
<p>This relational approach helps to explain the continued pre-eminence of Hong Kong, the increasing importance of Shanghai and the specific role of Beijing in the Chinese (and wider Asia-Pacific) financial network. Almost all interviewees identified distinctive roles for each city, with Beijing as a ‘political centre’, Shanghai as a ‘business centre’ and Hong Kong as an ‘offshore financial centre’, stemming from different historical backgrounds, social and cultural milieux and institutional environments (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0042098011408143">Shi and Hamnett, 2002</xref>). This regional division of functions and complementary roles of Chinese IFCs is demonstrated by the strategy of foreign banks in locating representative offices and investment banks in Beijing, branch offices and commercial banks in Shanghai, and treasury business in Hong Kong. Within this network of functional co-ordination, Hong Kong remains a dominant IFC due to its established administrative capability, stability, financial and legal expertise, and unique trading opportunities with its open economy, close economic ties to the mainland and deep linkages with global financial networks. Hong Kong’s dominance also has a political basis; Article 109 of the Basic Law of Hong Kong (1990) clearly establishes the Chinese government’s commitment to “the maintenance of Hong Kong as an IFC”. The continued prosperity of Hong Kong (closely tied to its role as an IFC for China and the Asia-Pacific region) has political resonance as it reflects on Chinese leadership following the handover of Hong Kong in 1997 and could also affect future relations between Taiwan and China (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0042098011408143">Taylor, 1997a</xref>). Therefore, while Hong Kong’s financial expertise and geographical proximity are important factors in developing China-related financial products and services, its unique political status also contributes to its privileged position in facilitating these financial flows.</p>
<p>Findings in this paper also highlight changing intercity relations and interdependencies between Chinese cities. The growing financial needs of the Chinese economy and (re)establishment of financial markets on the mainland have given Shanghai new opportunities as an IFC. Shanghai has grown rapidly over the past two decades, based largely on the influx of foreign commercial banks and the establishment of equity and commodity markets oriented towards the large domestic economy. However, it could not match Hong Kong’s IFC capacities due to regulatory restrictions and lack of financial expertise; this means that Hong Kong still performs a vital role in global trading and the China and Asian financial activities of TNCs. As an IFC, Beijing has attracted foreign investment banks and other financial operations that benefit from proximity and regular interaction in political and regulatory circles. In recent years, it has relinquished some economic functions to focus on its political and macroeconomic role, as seen in the relocation of more market-based functions of the PBOC to its second headquarter in Shanghai while maintaining policy-based and macro planning functions in Beijing. These Chinese IFCs are therefore complementary and interdependent when considered as part of a wider financial regulatory network, even as they continue to compete for investments and positions of power within corporate hierarchies; collaboration and competition are entangled in the complex processes of urban transformation and intercity relations. For corporations as well as financial institutions, these networks and relations between IFCs are critical to their business operations in China as they enable different financial opportunities and activities in differentiated markets. As a result, each centre has a specific role that is reproduced by its interdependent relationships with other IFCs, with Hong Kong remaining dominant in this network due to its regulatory and financial expertise and unique global–local networks that other Chinese IFCs are dependent upon. It is this network that enables them to capitalise on their respective advantages and perform distinctive roles as financial centres in China. Such a perspective can provide the basis for policies promoting a division of labour and collaborative development among global cities and IFCs.</p>
<p>In this paper, I emphasise the complex co-existence of competition and collaboration, of horizontal as well as vertical linkages, amongst global cities and IFCs. Researching the global urban and economic system from this perspective could help to explain how and why certain IFCs have remained dominant and how their roles have changed over time, and could enrich our understanding of financial geographies that is based on interdependence, connectivity and complementarity with other IFCs in the global economy. The case of Shanghai, Beijing and Hong Kong demonstrates a division of financial labour that is constantly being reorganised in response to changes in local market conditions, policy changes and broader global economic trends. By analysing the division of roles and functions amongst different IFCs, their evolving interrelations and complex co-dependence, we can reach a better understanding of global cities as dynamic centres of economic globalisation.</p>
