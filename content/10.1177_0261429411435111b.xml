<p>The aim of this essentially practical text is to help educators to perceive their students primarily as unique individuals. The writers say that they want teachers to understand their students as multidimensional individuals and the classroom as an ecosystem of the whole. The text contains 40 reflective activities that teach methods of inquiry-based learning and strategies for collaboration. Teachers can use the text as a portfolio for flexible activities that promote understanding of individual identity and self-awareness and multicultural issues within both the classroom and the wider community.</p>
<p>Each of the 40 activities contains the rationale of why certain strategies are important, detailed but flexible lesson guides, reflective activities, how various strategies can be incorporated into subject lessons, and how the strategies can be used to promote greater understanding in teacher training. In addition, the authors provide a list of texts for further reading and details of appropriate websites.</p>
<p>Frequently, the stimulus begins with a relevant excerpt from literature or learners are encouraged to share personal reflections and to debate the similarities and differences between themselves and their experiences in their own culture or community. Further ideas are given for various language games and cross-curricular links; for example, double-entry journals that require learners to respond to quotes in a personal way, the compiling of Venn diagrams to help learners to compare and contrast ideas, star charts to enable learners to see the whole picture, and graffiti walls to allow learners to express their thoughts and feelings openly.</p>
<p>The text is an excellent practical guide aimed at deepening learners’ understanding of the complexity of the world in which they live.</p>
