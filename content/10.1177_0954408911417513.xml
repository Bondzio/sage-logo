<abstract>
<p>Operation of gloveboxes containing radiological hazards relies on risks being broadly acceptable. Worker protection is maintained in the event of damage to the containment wall or gloves by a vortex amplifier (VXA). The most recent gloveboxes to be made active at the Sellafield site are protected by a ‘Mini-VXA’, which is a geometrically scaled down version of the previous standard version. This article describes the assembly that incorporates the mini-VXA. It traces the major innovations in VXA system technology that have been employed on alpha gloveboxes at Sellafield since 1970, culminating in the discovery of high levels of O<sub>2</sub> in gloveboxes protected by the mini-VXA during commissioning of same. Laboratory tests and field trials are reported that were aimed at overcoming the unexpectedly high demand of the mini-VXA for inert gas; and the solution eventually adopted.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0954408911417513" sec-type="intro"><title>1 INTRODUCTION</title>
<p>Personnel safety is an essential and mandatory requirement of a nuclear site license [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954408911417513">1</xref></bold>]. Gloveboxes are employed at Sellafield with a cascade ventilation strategy to mitigate radiological risk from alpha plant that requires manual dexterity for operational or maintenance purposes [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954408911417513">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954408911417513">6</xref></bold>]. Manufactured mainly from stainless steel, the glovebox units have one or more transparent Perspex sides (or acrylic or similar) penetrated by, rubber, gloves (e.g. latex, neoprene, hypalon, etc). The units enable operatives to handle active or toxic materials without direct exposure. Served by a filtered extract system, the gloveboxes are maintained at a sub-atmospheric depression of between 250 and 500 Pa.</p>
<p>The pressure differential across the glovebox fabric prevents any active or toxic fluids/particulates escaping the glovebox through small gaps/cracks/holes penetrating the barrier. A vortex amplifier (VXA) is fitted to the glovebox extract to control flow through the system. The VXA is designed so that it has a near-linear response to small perturbations about the normal operating point (such as may be generated by minor seal deterioration); and larger perturbations will encounter a discontinuity, setting in train pressure and momentum changes that enable a high-inward velocity to be achieved through any breach of the containment wall (e.g. the glove port after ripping a glove). The system and fan is designed so as to be capable of delivering at least 1 m/s through an open glove port; which is sufficient to hold back gasand suspended particulates at the temperatures anticipated in the glovebox.</p>
<p>Thus, VXAs are fluidic devices capable of switching between two bi-stable states, controlled purely by pressure at the ports. Donkin valves are used as an alternative to VXAs on some other sites, but the VXA has the advantage of not requiring moving parts to switch to a safer operating state in times of emergency. VXAs have been the preferred method of flow control used in glovebox facilities at Sellafield for over 30 years.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec2-0954408911417513"><title>2 VXA ASSEMBLIES USED AT THE SELLAFIELD SITE</title>
<sec id="sec3-0954408911417513"><title>2.1 Current practice</title>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954408911417513">Figure 1</xref> shows a mock-up VXA and filter assembly. It is almost identical to the latest designs of VXA used at the Sellafield site, but the VXA itself has been constructed from white plastic for demonstration purposes.
<fig id="fig1-0954408911417513" position="float"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Mock-up of a mini-VXA unit</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954408911417513-fig1.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954408911417513">Fig. 1</xref>, a circular flange can be seen roughly at the mid-point of the assembly length. When used in practice, this flange is fitted to the glovebox wall with the (white plastic) VXA and housing projecting into the glovebox. The VXA is then the primary exit for vented air.</p>
<p>The stainless steel filter housing sits outside the glovebox. Two pipes draw filtered ambient air through the flange to a toroidal plenum (unobservable in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954408911417513">Fig. 1</xref>, but contained within the white plastic housing for the VXA), from where the control ports derive their flow.</p>
<p>The thin vortex chamber is sandwiched between two layers of white plastic material; and air enters by four equi-spaced radial ports (one of which is just visible, approximately where the arrow for the ‘VXA’ annotation leads to). Air leaves the chamber through an axial port and is drawn into the steel axial pipe connected to the large extract filter housing. The latter is located close to the VXA itself (saving a lot of space on site compared with some previous versions). This filter housing is at 90° to the axial exit pipe for ease of filter replacement using a bagging system (housing shown empty in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954408911417513">Fig. 1</xref>). The back wall of the VXA is fitted with a handle for ease of dismantling and cleaning of the VXA chamber and ports.</p>
<p>The VXA itself is only a thin portion of the assembly shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954408911417513">Fig. 1</xref> and little of the internal detail can be seen. The internal detail of one variant for site application is shown (looking axially) in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954408911417513">Fig. 2</xref>. It is a thin cylindrical chamber with four radial supply ports, four tangential control ports and one axial exit port. Its chamber diameter is 140 mm.
<fig id="fig2-0954408911417513" position="float"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Construction drawing showing key geometry of a mini-VXA unit (dimensions in millimetre)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954408911417513-fig2.tif"/></fig></p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954408911417513">Fig. 3</xref> shows a simplified version illustrating the two bi-stable conditions. In the simplified sketch, only one supply port, one control port, and the exit port are shown. The right hand drawing shows the normal operating condition, with pressure at the supply port being the glovebox pressure (say 250–375 Pa below atmospheric). The left hand drawing shows the emergency condition, with roughly atmospheric pressure at the supply port generated by a breach in the glovebox containment wall, allowing room air to rush into the glovebox.
<fig id="fig3-0954408911417513" position="float"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Simplified diagram of VXA bi-stable operation</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954408911417513-fig3.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>To establish the normal operating condition shown in the right hand drawing of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954408911417513">Fig. 3</xref>, consider an initial situation where the tangential control port is isolated by a valve; and this valve is shut. No flow is allowed to the chamber from the control port. Flow is introduced to the chamber only through the radial (supply) inlet port, open to the glovebox. The glovebox atmosphere is drawn radially through the VXA chamber towards the centre, before turning 90° to leave through the axial exit port. If left in this condition, the impedance of the device can be likened to that of a 90° elbow. Next, the valve connected to the control port is gradually opened to enable modulating flow through the tangential control port. This action greatly increases the impedance between the glovebox and the exit by introducing a tangential flow to the chamber that diverts the flow from the radial port. The combined fluids from the tangential and radial port then follow a spiral trajectory of decreasing radius, towards the axial exit port.</p>
<p>Continuity requires the radial component of velocity to increase as the flow approaches the centre of the chamber. Conservation of angular momentum requires the tangential velocity component of the swirling fluid stream to increase, as it moves towards the centre but conversely, the boundary layers forming close to the front and rear chamber walls retard the flow and (near to the chamber walls) reduce centripetal acceleration. The net effect is to generate a long or viscous flowpath for any particle entering the chamber, an increase in residence time of any particle entering from the radial supply port and hence, high radial pressure drop across the chamber.</p>
<p>The source of the modulating flow is usually room air at atmospheric pressure, but for isolated situations, the inlet valve has occasionally been connected to a pressurized source. Introduction of a small amount of control flow will cause the device to act as an amplifier. As the control port inlet valve is cracked open, small amounts of tangential flow begin to exert an influence in the chamber, diverting the previously radial flow. Here, a small increase in control port flow will lead to merely a small reduction in overall mass flow leaving the device (as the overall impedance of the device rises with increased swirl). At these low rates of control flow, the VXA exhibits a relatively linear characteristic in which small perturbations in control port pressure will generate substantial changes in radial pressure drop. However, this is not the main point of the device when appliedto modern nuclear settings! Rather, the aim is to induce a large radial pressure drop and take advantage of the switching nature of the amplifier’s characteristic when driven beyond the amplification range.</p>
<p>With sufficient flow entering the chamber from the control port, the radial flow can be virtually shut off, so that most of the fluid leaving through the axial exit port is ultimately derived from the control port. When this happens, a plot of the overall mass flowrate through the device against control flow shows a steep decline or discontinuity, with a massive reduction in overall mass flow being caused by an incremental rise in control flow. It is in this condition of high swirl that the device is expected to operate normally, with just a small purge flow continuing to enter the chamber from the radial ports; and a large radial pressure drop across the chamber, generated by the high swirl caused by tangential jets from the control ports.</p>
<p>In the left-hand drawing of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954408911417513">Fig. 3</xref>, the flow from the tangential control port is shut off. This emergencystate is reached from the normal operating state when a breach of the glovebox fabric occurs. A hole in the fabric allows room air to flood into the glovebox, raising its pressure. Glovebox and vortex chamber pressures are proportional and so as the glovebox pressure rises, so too will the chamber pressure, reducing control flow into the VXA, and thus weakening the vortex. As the strength ofthe vortex wanes, the overall pressure loss through the system (per unit flow) falls and hence, supply flow across the breach increases, not only bringing the glovebox depression back to safe operating levels but also severely reducing or shutting off completely the control flow. Design of the system is such that mean face velocities across a foreseeable breach are maintained above a minimum considered relatively safe (typically 1 m/s).</p>
<p>Also, not visible in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954408911417513">Figs 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954408911417513">2</xref>, or <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954408911417513">3</xref> is a radial diffuser. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954408911417513">Fig. 1</xref>, this is hidden within the thick plastic housing. Air leaves the chamber axially and Passes by/around the diffuser before entering the axial steel pipe leading to the extract filter housing. The purpose of this diffuser is to aid pressure recovery downstream of the chamber and also, to restrict the formation of a precessing vortex in the exit pipe.</p>
<p>This assembly is in use today, except for minor variations. The versions used on site are all stainless steel and the piping leading to the flange (down which the control port air is drawn) actually stick out at a slight angle, to give greater clearance fromthe filter housing. However, the technology at Sellafield dates from various periods of processing development and as such, there are much older versions in use too.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec4-0954408911417513"><title>2.2 Early designs</title>
<p>The following history of site development at Sellafield was written following an unstructured interview with the lead author of [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0954408911417513">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0954408911417513">8</xref></bold>] and a study of other relevant literature written by people known to have worked in the nuclear industry [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0954408911417513">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0954408911417513">10</xref></bold>].</p>
<p>Until the 1970s, control of nuclear ventilation systems was achieved through a system of pre-set dampers, pressure regulators and solenoid actuators, and glovebox depression controlled by a rubber diaphragm and needle valve, but VXA technology offered a crucial advantage: no moving parts to wear, stick, or otherwise fail.</p>
<p>In 1972, Grant devised the first VXA controlled glovebox depression regulator [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954408911417513">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954408911417513">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0954408911417513">11</xref></bold>] for the Dounray site. By 1974, a design had been developed by UKAEA for the Sellafield site. The resulting assembly was adopted as the standard device at that time(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954408911417513">Fig. 4</xref>). Tippets <italic>et al.</italic> [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0954408911417513">13</xref></bold>] explained how research published by Syred [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0954408911417513">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0954408911417513">16</xref></bold>], Saunders [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0954408911417513">17</xref></bold>], Al-Shamma [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0954408911417513">18</xref></bold>] and Keoorper [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0954408911417513">19</xref></bold>] regarding the effects of VXA geometry on performance was used in the development of the first standard VXA design for active nuclear applications.
<fig id="fig4-0954408911417513" position="float"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>1974 UKAEA VXA design [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0954408911417513">12</xref></bold>]</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954408911417513-fig4.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>In the UKAEA design, there were four radial supply and four tangential ports, with just one axial exit port in the front wall of the device. The tangential control ports were each fed independently to mitigate the risk of blockages impacting on performance. A conical diffuser was fitted to the axial exit port and the tangential control ports were fed from pipework entering the front wall of the VXA around the outlet diffuser. Unlike the current design in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954408911417513">Fig. 1</xref>, the supply ports were not directly open to the glovebox atmosphere. Instead, a supply flow plenum was created within the main body casing. That plenum was fed from an axial inlet duct as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954408911417513">Fig. 4</xref>. The assembly was eventually Patented [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0954408911417513">20</xref></bold>].</p>
<p>The standard assemblies were fabricated using sheet metal to form a square box. Machined corner inserts were used to create a circular chamber with control and supply ports. The resulting VXAs were not expensive and could be fitted into most duct systems. However, the sheet metal made the front and rear walls relatively easy to damage (but a black art for skilled people to knock back into shape so long as the damage was not severe, rather like car bodywork).</p>
<p>Previously published work, such as that by Wormley and Richardson [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0954408911417513">21</xref></bold>], had demonstrated that (subject to certain restrictions) VXA performance in its normal operating range was not strongly influenced by Reynolds number, so scaling of the VXA units could be achieved utilizing simple square-law relationships. The UKAEA standard assemblies were manufactured in four (square) frame sizes of 300, 600, 1000, and 1300 mm, with performance characteristics being influenced through alteration of the chamber height and the control port area. The standard assemblies were capable of achieving flowrates of between 1.5 and 27 m<sup>3</sup>/min.</p>
<p>In the 1970s, VXAs were set outside the glovebox. Two arrangements were tried. With the first, the VXA was situated downstream of the glovebox it protected. In the beginning, this arrangement was very successful. However, no means was provided for cleaning the innards, and plutonium dust collected on the flow passage walls and in the corners of the device. Gradually, the plutonium changed to americium, a potentially more dangerous substance for workers in the same room, whose rate of radioactive dose became greater than in the early years of the plant’s operation.</p>
<p>Because of this reason, an improved arrangement was tried in 1976: a filter was added between the VXA and glovebox to prevent the VXA collecting radioactive dust. The filter stopped radioactive particles reaching the VXA. There was almost no accumulation of radioactive dust on the VXA. However, with this arrangement, as the filter blocks, the VXA progressively responds less well to pressure and flow conditions in the glovebox. In other words, a change in glovebox pressure due to a breach of containment is masked by a partially blocked filter, so that pressure immediately upstream of the VXA does not alter to the extent required; and the filter restricts the emergency flow through the glovebox. Consequently, the filter must be cleaned regularly, leading to a high waste arising.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec5-0954408911417513"><title>2.3 The reverse purge system</title>
<p>Due to a high filter change rate for the latter arrangement described in Section 2.2, further improvement was sought. Success was found in the arrangement shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954408911417513">Fig. 5</xref>, known as the ‘reverse purge’ system. This represents a major development in theuse of VXA technology with active gloveboxes since, unlike previous arrangements of VXA technology, the one shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954408911417513">Fig. 5(a)</xref> was capable of reverse flow (i.e. in normal operation, air entered the chamber from the control ports and left the chamber by both the exit port and the supply ports – so flow in the ‘supply’ ports was reversed compared to previous arrangements). Air entering the glovebox was extracted using a narrow pipe (shown Parallel to the filter and VXA line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954408911417513">Fig. 5</xref>), providing a suitable glovebox depression.
<fig id="fig5-0954408911417513" position="float"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><p>Reverse purge arrangement in: (a) normal operation and (b) emergency operation</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954408911417513-fig5.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>However, if the glovebox containment wall was breached, then the glovebox pressure would rise towards atmospheric. As a result, the control port pressure would no longer be sufficient to ‘reverse’ flow in the supply port. Consequently, the VXA would switch to operate in the usual forward flow condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954408911417513">Fig. 5(b)</xref>).</p>
<p>By ensuring that for most of the time only clean air Passed through the filter between the glovebox and VXA, filter change rates reduced considerably. This arrangement was conceived and Patented [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0954408911417513">22</xref></bold>] in the mid 1970s. It was developed further in the late 1970s (although the plant it was used on was not commissioned/brought online until the following decade).</p>
<p>The reverse purge system proved very satisfactory and no fresh developments were implemented on site until the 1990s. However, development work continued in the 1980s with the aim of overcoming two inherent weaknesses of the reverse purge system. The VXA used in the reverse purge system was still fabricated from sheet metal, was easily damaged and required capable operatives to keep its shape and characteristic. Also the diffuser, and indeed the whole arrangement took up much space.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec6-0954408911417513"><title>2.4 The cylindrical VXA</title>
<p>In the 1980s, VXA design was improved in two stages. First, the radial diffuser was designed. This reduced the room space needed by a VXA. It also had the benefit of interfering with the formation of a precessing vortex in the VXA outlet. Second, machined circular parts and a machined casing were made instead of the fabricated square ones. The circular design of the VXA itself became the ‘BNFL standard’ in the 1990s. These were less susceptible to damage, but were heavier than the originals.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0954408911417513">Figure 6</xref> illustrates the location of the radial diffuser (albeit for a mini-VXA). Syred [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0954408911417513">14</xref></bold>] had found that a radial diffuser reduced ‘noise’ to an insignificant level. The reduction in noise levels was attributed to the radial diffuser preventing the formation of complex flow geometries in areas down stream of the exit throat. Without a radial (or plate) diffuser, a precessing vortex would form and extend for some distance along the length of the exit piping (and conical diffuser, if fitted) [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0954408911417513">23</xref></bold>]. This precession is capable of influencing flow in the supply ports, making flow patterns in that location fluctuate periodically [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0954408911417513">24</xref></bold>].
<fig id="fig6-0954408911417513" position="float"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption><p>Prototype mini-VXA assembly with radial diffuser (dimensions in millimetre)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954408911417513-fig6.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>In the same period, push-through cylindrical high efficiency Particulate arresting (HEPA) filters were developed with elastomeric lip-seals. These filters could be pushed through a cylinder without breach of containment. The initial combined VXA and filter assemblies had an (offset) exit port filter housing that was mounted directly onto the outer face of the glovebox. This facilitated changing of the filters without interfering with the VXA.</p>
<p>Flow from the glovebox passed through the exit port of the VXA and then through the first cylindrical HEPA filter, before reaching the main extract header. The overall arrangement and a sectional view of the assembly with the above modifications are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0954408911417513">Fig. 7(a) and (b)</xref>. To reduce space further, the new VXA was fitted on a door which was on the wall of the glovebox.

<p>Two filters were connected downstream of the VXA. There is no filter upstream of the VXA, so dust from the glovebox can enter the VXA, however, circular geometry reduced the rate at which dust was collected within the device. Moreover, as the VXAs were located on the glovebox door, the VXA could be manufactured in two inter-locking parts, with one part removable from the other by manual handling using gloveports; so it was cleanable. The improved radial VXA system was Patented by Rimmer and McGuigan [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0954408911417513">25</xref></bold>] for the UKAEA in 1989.</p>
<p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0954408911417513">Fig. 7(a)</xref>, the bypass line is needed during maintenance or cleaning of the VXA and its filter. One disadvantage of the arrangement was the uneven distribution of weight on the glovebox mountings, making seismic qualification more difficult.</p>
<p>A minor modification was made for the Waste Treatment Complex. Only one filter was connected to the VXA, saving space and weight. Experience had shown that the rear seal of the working filter was very reliable; so the secondary filter was not necessary. Moreover, the seal of a filter in the secondary housing in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0954408911417513">Fig. 7(b)</xref> is under some stress and subject to the vibration and any heat associated with the process room. Such a seal (and hence filter) would be better stored elsewhere. This became the BNFL standard VXA assembly and is used on such plant as the ‘Thorp Finishing Line’.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec7-0954408911417513"><title>2.5 In-line filters</title>
<p>The minor improvement described in the preceding paragraph was brought about for operational and spatial advantage, not by technical necessity to meet performance or safety needs. In fact, the reliability ofVXA technology had become accepted, so technological innovation was no longer driven by safety needs (although safety remains a major consideration). In the 1990s, further developments were made that were also instigated from a desire to seek operational advantages.</p>
<p>One disadvantage of the assembly in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0954408911417513">Fig. 7(b)</xref> is the fact that the filters are not axially aligned with the VXA, but are offset (attached to a second ‘door’ on the glovebox face). In the 1990s, control port feeds were re-configured to enable the use of in-line filters, saving space. In order to change the filter, the VXA unit had to be removed inside the glovebox to allow the old filter to be pushed through by the new filter. The seals on the filters ensured that there was no breach of containment during the filter change process. The old filter now inside the glovebox was then bagged up for disposal and removed from the system. The in-line filter VXA unit was Patented by Doig and Buckley [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0954408911417513">26</xref></bold>] for BNFL in 1996 and is used extensively throughout the site at Sellafield. At about the same time, a scaled-down version known as the ‘mini-VXA’ was tested.</p>
<p>Further improvements were made to the design ofthe VXA unit by Doig in 2000, with the filter sectionbeing set perpendicular to the VXA housing. Previously, in order to facilitate filter changes, openings in the glovebox had to be of sufficient size to allow spent filters to be posted through into contaminated waste bags; and adequate provision also had to be made within the glovebox to facilitate removal of the bagged up spent filter. Space within process gloveboxes is usually at a premium and so an alternative filter changing methodology was sought. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0954408911417513">Figure 8</xref> shows a section through the improved VXA of 2000: the filter housing has been turned through 90° to be perpendicular to the VXA. Spent filters could then be replaced without having to pass them through the glovebox. The perpendicular filter housing allowed the new filter to be inserted in one end and a waste bag to be fixed over the other. A winding unit was then used to post the old filter into the waste bag and the new filter into position.

<sec id="sec8-0954408911417513"><title>2.6 Mini-VXA</title>
<p>The mini-VXA was first made in the mid-1990s. Recently completed plant expansions use a smaller version of VXA. This is essentially the same as that introduced by Doig in 2000, but smaller. It was produced by geometrical scaling of the existing model. It is called the ‘mini-VXA’, as it is approximately half thesize of its predecessor, and sized on a simple square law. The mini-VXA is discussed in Section 2.1. A mock-up is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954408911417513">Fig. 1</xref>, and a variant of the internal geometry shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954408911417513">Fig. 2</xref>.</p>
<p>Practical use of the mini-VXA led to unanticipated operational difficulties. It was discovered that oxygen readings in gloveboxes were higher than expected and demanded a greater consumption of inert gas than the BNFL standard. This led to an experimental study [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0954408911417513">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0954408911417513">28</xref></bold>] of the device as given in Sections 3 and 4 and in order to overcome the problem, an interesting variation on an old technique.</p></sec></sec>
<sec id="sec9-0954408911417513"><title>3 LABORATORY STUDY OF MINI-VXA</title>
<p>At the time there was little evidence to suggest a mechanism, but it was suspected by company engineers that in normal operation, air was entering the glovebox in reverse flow through the supply ports, coming ultimately from the control ports. After examination of the innards of the mini-VXA, it was thought by the authors that if reverse flow in the supply ports was entering the glovebox then, since the VXA was operating in a forward flow condition, the reverse flow could only occupy part of the supply port area. This would most probably be along the bounding wall opposite the control port, where a strong tangential jet from the control port might bifurcate if not directed sufficiently towards the centre of the chamber to avoid striking the opposing wall as it spread. The angle of the control ports had not been adjusted when scaling down the device and it was operating with similar pressures at the various ports to those encountered by the previous standard version.</p>
<p>To test this hypothesis and at the same time mitigate against it, a series of laboratory experiments were conducted by Zhang and Francis [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0954408911417513">28</xref></bold>] that involved, first, moving the mini-VXA to a slightly remote location by mounting a spacing chamber where the assembly flange would normally fit to side or roof of the glovebox; and fitting the mini-VXA to the remote side of the chamber, so that it projected into the chamber rather than into the glovebox and second, to fit an orifice plate between the glovebox and spacing chamber. The arrangement is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0954408911417513">Fig. 8</xref>. The purpose of a spacing chamber was to provide a relatively narrow flow path (compared to the glovebox) and hence an extract momentum against which any air escaping the supply ports would need to penetrate to enter the glovebox; and the orifice plate was there toprovide an additional pressure rise for escaping air to overcome. The two items together were intended to form an entrapment for air issuing from the supply ports, to reduce the amount entering the glovebox.</p>
<p>The experimental study was performed using laboratory equipment available to the authors at the factory of the glovebox supplier. High levels of O<sub>2</sub> observed on site were confirmed using a laboratory glovebox and a study of the conceptual solution was initiated.</p>
<sec id="sec10-0954408911417513"><title>3.1 Experimental procedure</title>
<p>Tests were conducted using an established experimental glovebox facility fitted with a mini-VXA:</p>
<list id="list1-0954408911417513" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Without the spacing chamber and orifice fitted, when the mini-VXA projects into the glovebox (as in site applications);</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>With the spacing chamber fitted and the VXA assembly flange fitted to the remote wall of the chamber, so that the VXA projected into the chamber, but no orifice plate;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>With the VXA and chamber fitted as in (2) above and a variety of orifice plates inserted to restrict flow from the glovebox to the spacing chamber.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The glovebox under test was inerted with Nitrogen from a gas supply bottle, complete with flow control and flow measurement. Pressure instruments and manometer were used to detect glovebox depression and VXA/filter unit outlet depression. Glovebox internal atmosphere was monitored for oxygen concentration using a Drager microPac personal oxygen meter with alarms disabled (to protect the battery). This item was claimed to have a 1.5-year maintenance free operation following factory calibration and registered 20.9 per cent by volume prior to and upon completion of testing. The maximum allowable concentration of oxygen in Nitrogen was taken as 9 per cent for avoidance of fire (i.e. not for moisture control).</p>
<p>The test procedure is as follows:</p>
<list id="list2-0954408911417513" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Extract fan set running and O<sub>2</sub> content checked at 20.9 per cent in the glovebox;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>A glovebox depression of 375 Pa was established by balanced positioning of the mini-VXA control port valves;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The glovebox depression was established at 375 Pa without Nitrogen supply; the depression remained almost stable when Nitrogen was subsequently added by a leakage line from a pressurized cylinder, with only the largest flowrates causing any discernable difference in the glovebox depression. No attempt was made therefore to maintain pressure across the mini-VXA, but rather the site conditions were allowed to pertain where glovebox depression was considered critical rather than pressure drop across the mini-VXA.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Following set up at 375 Pa, Nitrogen was supplied at the maximum flowrate possible and steady conditions allowed to develop; flowrate was then reduced to 40 L/min and new steady conditions allowed to develop; flowrate was then reduced in steps of 5 L/min, which was the major graduation on the flow meter, and steady conditions allowed to develop after each step change. Where the gas ran out before satisfactory completion of the test, asubsequent test with identical settings commenced in the same manner, followed by a step change to the last flowrate measured. Nitrogen supply rate was measured using a floating ball tapered flow meter. Once set, the indication remained relatively steady (compared with manometer measurements in the authors’ experience under more turbulent conditions) and drift did not occur (probably due to the steady reservoir conditions controlled by a pressure control valve). Maximum uncertainty in setting the nitrogen flowrate is estimated at 0.5 L/min.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>From the results of (4), a prediction was made as to the required flowrate of nitrogen to achieve exactly 9 per cent O<sub>2</sub> and a fresh test started following (1) to (3) to check that the predicted steady state could be achieved.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Tests were conducted a minimum of three times to ensure repeatability. They were not conducted one after another, but tests without the chamber were interspersed with tests conducted with the chamber to allow for uncertainties to be included that result from human installation.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec11-0954408911417513"><title>3.2 Results</title>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0954408911417513">Figure 9</xref> shows the outcome of following stages (1)–(4) of the experimental procedure for the rig without spacing chamber or orifice plate (i.e. as in site operation when first installed). The subsequent test result shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0954408911417513">Fig. 10(a)</xref> confirmed a nitrogen usage rate of 32 L/min to maintain 9 per cent O<sub>2</sub> concentration in the glovebox [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0954408911417513">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0954408911417513">29</xref></bold>]. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0954408911417513">Figure 10(b)</xref> shows the confirmed nitrogen usage rate with the spacing chamber in place (but no orifice plates). The addition of the chamber reduced the supply rate of Nitrogen needed to achieve 9 per cent Oxygen concentration in the glovebox from 32 L/min to 8 L/min.

</p>
<p>Subsequently, one test was made with each of the orifice plates sandwiched between the glovebox and spacing chamber. The four orifice plates had square edged orifii of 100, 150, 200 and 245 mm, respectively. In all four tests the recorded pressure at exit from the mini-VXA was 1450 Pa. No significant deviation in exit port pressure was noted as a result of using the orifice plates. Starting with the smallest orifice, the oxygen concentration obtained with 10 L/min nitrogen supply was 1.0%, 2.2%, 3.0%, and 3.4%. This compares with an average of 4.1% in the three tests conducted without the orifice plates (but with chamber fitted); and 15.9% in the one test without the chamber that was extended to sufficiently low nitrogen supply rates for comparison.</p>
<p>The results demonstrated the advantages of the geometrical arrangement of the spacer chamber between an orifice plate and the VXA supply ports.</p></sec></sec>
<sec id="sec12-0954408911417513"><title>4 FIELD TRIALS OF A PRACTICAL SOLUTION</title>
<p>Despite the success in the laboratory, the use of a spacer chamber and orifice plate suffered from a number of disadvantages. First, the orifice plates made access for cleaning very difficult (if not impossible). Second, the spacing chamber took up additional space outside the glovebox. Third, when considering plant modification to install the solution, the VXA was no longer treated as being within the glovebox, leading to potentially greater problems with the safety case than would occur if a solution could be found without removing the VXA from its current mounted position.</p>
<p>That solution was developed by Sellafield Limited Engineers in collaboration with NIS (the glovebox manufacturer), in the form of a removable cowl that fits over the existing VXA within the glovebox; and maintains the geometry of the spacer chamber and orifice plate immediately upstream of the VXA supply ports. It is curious that in introducing the cowl (made of sheet metal) there has been a return to the use of an easily damaged component that produces a flow path into the VXA looking remarkably like the 1974 version (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954408911417513">Fig. 4</xref>), but with a simple orifice instead of the short stub of ducting at the inlet.</p>
<p>The laboratory tests (Section 3) were conducted in 2003, but it was not until 2006 that the authors had an opportunity to test the efficacy of the cowl for themselves. This occurred during field trials of prototype mini-VXA geometry for a later project [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0954408911417513">24</xref></bold>] (details of which are not given here). Field trials were conducted by the authors on a rig in the British Technology Centre (BTC, prior to it going active). These trials confirm the efficacy of the cowl. Note that the BTC, now operated by National Nuclear Laboratory at the Sellafield site, was undergoing a gradual commissioning phase at the time of the field trials, leaving a window of opportunity to conduct field trials on an otherwise fully commissioned plant whose downstream ventilation system was not at that time connected to an active system. In effect, the field trials replicated in all aspects (other than long-term time-dependent effects) the exact situation in which the devices are needed.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0954408911417513">Figure 11</xref> is two photographs showing the mini-VXA tested on site both with and without the cowl fitted. Once the two oxygen monitors are in place at opposing ends of the glovebox and the bagging port re-sealed, the experimental procedure is quite simple. First, apply maximum nitrogen flowrate to reduce the oxygen content in the working glovebox to virtually nil, then reduce the flowrate to 0.8 m<sup>3</sup>/h (determined from initial testing) and plot the rise in oxygen content over time.
<fig id="fig11-0954408911417513" position="float"><label>Fig. 11</label><caption><p>The mini-VXA shown with and without cowl in BTC glovebox facility</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954408911417513-fig11.tif"/></fig></p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-0954408911417513">Figure 12</xref> demonstrates the O<sub>2</sub> concentration in the glovebox for similar inert gas supply rates. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-0954408911417513">Fig. 12</xref>, three geometries are tested without the cowl in place. It can be seen in the results that the two prototype geometries performed better than the standard version. However, for the purpose of this article, it is intended that the reader should compare the results for the ‘BNFL’ standard geometry with and without the cowl. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-0954408911417513">Figure 12</xref> demonstrates a first-order response towards an oxygen content that is at least one order of magnitude greater when the cowl is missing.

<p>Even when the laboratory tests (Section 3) were being planned, the Sellafield engineers were considering options, with input from the authors <italic>via</italic> Doig. By the time the authors’ field trials were undertaken, the company engineers had already installed, tested, and commissioned mini-VXA cowls on a number of plant. The solution has proven very effective.</p>
<p>It should be noted that since this article was first submitted for publication, the results of an unpublished computational study by two of the authors (using commercial computational fluid dynamics software) have shown that the flow patterns in the four radial supply ports are not symmetric. While one or more radial ports maintain a purge flow into the chamber, flow from the remaining radial port(s) can be entirely shut off by the tangential jet issuing from the associated control port. Moreover, where this jet is issued with sufficient momentum to hit the opposing corner of the radial port and chamber walls, a bifurcated jet is produced whereby some of the control flow moves around the chamber, while the remainder turns into the radial port and generates a reverse flow in that port – a reverse flow that can, in extreme cases, reach to the glovebox. This study is enlightening investigations of the high-oxygen content found in gloveboxes served by the mini-VXA. Until now, it had been assumed that the global effects of the device were the result of all four radial portsacting in a similar fashion, but the recent results imply that the observed asymmetry should be expected; and that each radial port experiences a cyclical change in its flow pattern that appears to be related to the precession of the vortex core.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec13-0954408911417513"><title>5 VXA<sub>S</sub> IN OTHER APPLICATIONS</title>
<p>Although the setting of this article is in the context of nuclear gloveboxes, it is interesting to review briefly their uses elsewhere. This article is focussed on the historical development of practical VXA assemblies. It is therefore not proposed to examine the early papers on the characteristics, science, stability and modelling of VXAs (which can be read elsewhere), but to consider the practical uses of the devices and hence, their performance.</p>
<p>One of the key parameters when judging VXA performance within a system is the ‘Turn-Down’ ratio. This is the ratio of maximum flow to minimum flow. The former occurs in the absence of control flow, when the flow across the VXA plane is purely radial. It is easy to establish in laboratory tests since the condition can be created for a set pressure drop across the device by first shutting the control port valve and then adjusting the glovebox purge flow supply and exit port valves. By contrast, determination of the minimum flow condition is more difficult. This occurs when the momentum of the control port jets is sufficient to prevent the contents of some radial supply ports from entering the chamber, producing a null net supply from the glovebox. This position on the characteristic can be hard to judge due to some minor instabilities within the device, but occurs at the point where the overall flowrate falls dramatically for a small change in control port flow. It can be measured artificially by stopping purge flow to and through the glovebox but this introduces difficulties in maintaining glovebox pressure and thus a set pressure across the device, so measurements in the field showing control flowrate equal to exit port flowrate are more useful. The turn-down ratio of the mini-VXA using the standard geometry is just under 4.3. Some alternative geometries tested during various investigations resulted in improved turn-down ratios, up to almost 6.0. The selected geometry used in the field trials produced a laboratory-tested turn-down ratio of 4.5, slightly better than the standard geometry and much less apt to produce backflow of oxygen into the glovebox.</p>
<p>A second parameter of interest when judging VXA performance within a system is the ‘Critical Pressure Ratio’. This is the ratio of the control–exit ports’ pressure differential to the radial supply–exit ports’ pressure differential at the minimum flow condition. This provides a means to normalize the turn-down ratio, so that the Performance Index is given by the quotient <italic>PI</italic> = <italic>T</italic>/<italic>G</italic>, where <italic>PI</italic> is the performance index, <italic>T</italic> the turn-down ratio, and <italic>G</italic> the critical pressure ratio. An ideal VXA for nuclear glovebox applications will have a high turn-down ratio and a low-critical pressure ratio, so that maximum control can be achieved with minimal input.</p>
<p>The influence of certain design parameters on VXA performance is well known. Geometrical sizes of the VXA flowpaths (usually normalized by the exit port area, <italic>Ae</italic>) are important in this context. As the ratio of supply port area to exit port area (<italic>As</italic>/<italic>Ae</italic>) is reduced beneath ‘2’, it has been observed [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0954408911417513">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0954408911417513">30</xref></bold>] that the turndown ratio falls off. This is primarily due to the increasing significance of pressure drop in the supply ports as their overall area approaches the supposed minimum area of the exit port. However, other studies [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0954408911417513">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0954408911417513">32</xref></bold>] showed no effect of reducing supply area on the critical pressure ratio (within the geometrical limitations of a serious device). When increasing the supply port area, it is known [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0954408911417513">14</xref></bold>] that up to 50 per cent of the vortex chamber annulus can be cut away (to form supply ports) without a significant effect on axi-symmetric flow or substantial increase in noise.</p>
<p>In contrast, a reduction in the control port area (for a set exit port area) improves the turn-down ratio [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0954408911417513">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0954408911417513">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0954408911417513">32</xref></bold>]. However, this action also increases the critical pressure ratio, but optimum ratios of control port area to exit port area (<italic>Ac</italic>/<italic>Ae</italic>) have been derived in the region of 0.3 [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0954408911417513">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0954408911417513">33</xref></bold>]. The type of diffuser connected to the exit port is also important. A conical diffuser (from one pipe size to a larger one in the direction of flow) helps pressure recovery. By fitting a conical diffuser (optimum angle of 6.5°), a substantial improvement in turn-down ratio can be achieved with little effect on critical pressure ratio [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0954408911417513">14</xref></bold>]; and that improvement in turn-down ratio is known to increase as the diffuser length increases. However, space limitations and eventual pipe diameter at exit of the diffuser provide a practical limit. Moreover, conical diffusers increase noise levels. By way of contrast, it is known [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0954408911417513">14</xref></bold>] that radial diffusers reduce noise while having little effect on turn-down ratio. Radial diffusers are used in practical assemblies on the Sellafield site.</p>
<p>The chamber geometry is also important. The ratio of chamber radius to exit port radius (<italic>ro</italic>/<italic>re</italic>) and chamber height to exit port radius (<italic>h</italic>/<italic>re</italic>) are known to affect performance. Some key geometric ratios for optimum performance (gathered from literature) are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0954408911417513">Table 1</xref>.

<p>Design guidance has been produced by a number of authors [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0954408911417513">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0954408911417513">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0954408911417513">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0954408911417513">34</xref></bold>]. These were fashioned in the late 1960s and 1970s. Given their age one might be forgiven for thinking them obsolete, but in fact one of the prime motivations for funding more recent study [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0954408911417513">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0954408911417513">27</xref></bold>] is to recapture and assess again the strong developments made at that time; and to consolidate accumulated knowledge of practical application in the face of combined threats to the retention of that knowledge from (1) expert retirement and (2) the gradual break up (or outsourcing) of the former UKAEA and BNFL in-house activities. However, an insular approach is insufficient. VXAs are not constrained to nuclear applications.</p>
<p>VXAs and other fluidic technology was initially thought to have application anywhere that control was required, but modern electronic and software control systems offer very good control features that can be made bespoke to the process. This has left the VXA fulfilling niche industrial needs where, for example, very high reliability is required (and the lack of moving Parts implies that high reliability).</p>
<p>VXAs may find application in the aerospace and automotive industries, where (for example) the turn-up VXA has potential for regulating airflow for combustion control [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0954408911417513">35</xref></bold>]. A turn-up VXA has a slightly different geometry to the ones presented so far in this article. There are no radial ports but two opposing tangential ports for inflow, with an axial exit port and diffuser. When the two inflows are equal the device presents low impedance to the total throughput, but when one inflow rate creeps above the other a vortex begins to be established in the chamber, increasing that impedance monotonically. Moreover, if the two tangential ports contain two different fluids then potentially (1) the fuel can help to regulate air distribution or (2) a controlled mixing is feasible.</p>
<p>This article has described VXA technology, but it should be noted that similar science and mathematical modelling is applicable to a range of modern problems, such as centrifugal separators [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0954408911417513">36</xref></bold>] and vortex tubes [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0954408911417513">37</xref></bold>]. In micro-fluidic applications, such as ink jet printer nozzles, traditional fluidic technology is further complicated by small-scale effects, such as the surface tension of tiny droplets, mixing by diffusion, thermal effects, etc. At scales of normal perception, oscillators, vortex valves, and similar fluidic technology utilizing the Coanda effect (or propensity for a fluid to ‘stick’ to a particular frictional surface due to developed pressures in the flow field) find application in decorative water fountains, as well as a wide range of industrial situations such as drainage overflow control, ventilation distribution systems and chamber washout systems. The application of VXA assemblies to gloveboxes containing radiological hazard is but one example of fluidic technology; yet it is one of the earliest practical applications of fluidic technology, and it is one that has endured.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec14-0954408911417513" sec-type="conclusions"><title>6 CONCLUSIONS</title>
<p>For many years VXAs have been relied upon to protect workers at the Sellafield site from airborne contamination in the event of a breach in the containment wall of a glovebox containing radiological hazard, such as would occur if a glove was damaged.</p>
<p>Early designs were very effective at the primary role, but suffered from being delicate of construction and requiring a great deal of space. They also accumulated dirt or required excessive filter replacement. These designs were used in the 1970s. The dirt/filter problems were overcome by use of the reverse-purge system, which became the system of choice in the 1980s. Subsequently, the robustness was improved using circular machined parts and while this also reduced dirt accumulation, the transition to a fresh design in circular geometry enabled a means for cleaning to be incorporated in assemblies which became the standard of the 1990s.</p>
<p>With the introduction of the mini-VXA in the recent decade, came a discovery of unexpectedly high levels of oxygen in the gloveboxes protected by this device; demanding a high usage rate of inert gas to maintain specified conditions. Laboratory tests demonstrated a geometrical arrangement using a spacer plate that reduced the inert gas usage, first to 25 per cent of the site demand and then later, an alternative incorporating an orifice plate that reduced demand still further. The geometrical arrangement was present in the solution eventually adopted on site by Sellafield Limited engineers. They installed a cowl over the mini-VXA within the glovebox. Field trials demonstrated the efficacy of the cowl.</p></sec>
