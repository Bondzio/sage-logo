<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Perioperative complications may be seen during the performance of cardiac surgery in infants and children with congenital heart disease (CHD). Various factors may result in arrhythmias during this period including electrolyte disturbances, myocardial ischemia, irritation from direct manipulation of the myocardium, and reperfusion injury following cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Patients with long-standing, unrepaired CHD may be at increased risk of such problems.<sup>

</sup> Although there are various options for and algorithms to guide antiarrhythmic therapy, the effective perioperative control of arrhythmias may require alternative agents when first-line therapies fail.<sup>

<p>Dexmedetomidine is an α<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic agonist which initially received US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval in the United States in 1999 for the sedation of adults during mechanical ventilation and then in 2009 for monitored anesthesia care (MAC). Although not currently FDA approved for use in the pediatric population, dexmedetomidine has been shown to be effective in several different clinical scenarios in infants and children including sedation during mechanical ventilation, procedural sedation, supplementation of postoperative analgesia, prevention of emergence delirium, and treatment of withdrawal.<sup>

</sup> We present a case summary describing intraoperative and postoperative use of dexmedetomidine to treat and control supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) in a 5 year-old boy undergoing surgical repair of a large atrial septal defect (ASD).</p>

<title>Case Report</title>
<p>Approval for the retrospective review of this case and presentation of the material in this format was obtained from the Institutional Review Board at Nationwide Children’s Hospital (Columbus, Ohio). A 5-year-old, 18 kg boy presented for surgical repair of a large ASD during a surgical mission of Heart Care International (Greenwich, Connecticut) to San Salvador, El Salvador. The patient’s preoperative evaluation was significant for progressive shortness of breath and loss of exercise tolerance. He also had a history of SVT which had started approximately 12 months earlier. Current medications included furosemide (15 mg by mouth twice a day) and digoxin (0.1 mg by mouth every morning). With the institution of the digoxin therapy, the patient’s symptoms of SVT had decreased to one episode each month. The remainder of his past medical history was unremarkable. The patient was held nil per os on the morning of surgery and his usual doses of furosemide and digoxin were held. Following premedication with oral midazolam (0.5 mg/kg), the patient was transported to the operating room and routine American Society of Anesthesiologists’ monitors were applied. Anesthetic induction was carried out with sevoflurane in oxygen and a peripheral intravenous catheter was placed. Tracheal intubation was facilitated with vecuronium (0.1 mg/kg). Following tracheal intubation, a second peripheral intravenous catheter was placed and invasive hemodynamic monitoring secured including a right radial arterial catheter and a double lumen central venous catheter (4F, 8 cm) placed via the right internal jugular vein. Maintenance anesthesia included sevoflurane adjusted to maintain hemodynamic stability and fentanyl (15 μg/kg administered during the first 15 minutes following endotracheal intubation). During this time, the heart rate (HR) varied from 120 to 140 beats/min with a blood pressure (BP) of 70 to 90/40 to 60 mm Hg. Following sternotomy and during dissection around the right atrium for the placement of the cannulae for CPB, the patient’s HR abruptly increased to 220 beats/min and the BP decreased to 50/30 mm Hg. The electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed a narrow complex QRS consistent with SVT. Cardioversion with internal paddles resulted in a prompt return to a normal sinus rhythm (NSR) with a HR of 120 beats/min and a BP of 96/46 mm Hg. Cannulation for CPB was subsequently accomplished without incident. The ASD was repaired with a patch. Aortic cross clamp time was 32 minutes and the duration of CPB was 58 minutes. The patient was weaned from CPB without the use of inotropic medications. Following the administration of protamine and during inspection around the atrium to ensure adequate hemostasis, the HR abruptly increased to 220 beats/min with a decrease in the BP to 50/28 mm Hg. Cardioversion resulted in a return to an NSR; however, the SVT recurred within one to two minutes. A single dose of adenosine (0.15 mg/kg) resulted in a return to NSR. Approximately five minutes later, during suctioning and use of the cautery to ensure hemostasis, another episode of SVT occurred with a HR of 224 beats/min and a BP of 52/30 mm Hg. A single dose of phenylephrine (0.5 μg/kg) resulted in an increase in the BP to 94/48 mm Hg, with no change in the HR. Dexmedetomidine was administered as a loading dose of 1μg/kg over ten minutes followed by an infusion of 1 μg/kg per h. Prior to the completion of the loading dose, the rhythm returned to an NSR. The remainder of the case was uneventful and the patient’s trachea was extubated in the operating room. The dexmedetomidine infusion was continued at 1 μg/kg per h until the next morning. On postoperative day #1, the patient’s usual dose of digoxin was administered and the dexmedetomidine infusion was decreased to 0.5 μg/kg per h. There were no episodes of SVT or arrhythmias noted during the postoperative period. On postoperative day #2, the dexmedetomidine infusion was discontinued and the patient was discharged from the ICU to the inpatient ward. The remainder of his postoperative course was uneventful.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The key to dexmedetomidine’s physiologic effects of sedation and anxiolysis is a direct effect on neurotransmitters within the central nervous system (CNS). As the central presynaptic α<sub>2A</sub>-adrenergic receptor is a negative feedback receptor, agonists at this receptor in medullary vasomotor center result in decreased catecholamine release from the nerve terminal and a central sympatholytic effect leading to decreases of both HR and BP. Central nervous system stimulation of parasympathetic outflow and inhibition of sympathetic outflow from the locus cereleus in the brain stem play a prominent role in the sedation and anxiolysis produced by these agents. Decreased noradrenergic output from the locus cereleus allows for increased firing of inhibitory neurons, most importantly the γ-amino butyric acid (GABA) system.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2150135111421352">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2150135111421352"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2150135111421352">7</xref>
</sup> The end result of such effects are the desired physiologic effects of sedation and anxiolysis as well as one of the most commonly discussed of the adverse effects, bradycardia. The incidence and magnitude of bradycardia with dexmedetomidine administration is greater when dexmedetomidine is administered with other medications that possess negative chronotropic effects (propofol, succinylcholine, digoxin, pyridostigmine), in scenarios when the negative chronotropic effects of a drug may be exaggerated (hypothermia or during vagotonic procedures such as laryngoscopy), and following large or rapid bolus doses.<sup>

</sup>
</p>
<p>The cardiac conduction effects of dexmedetomidine were evaluated by Hammer et al in a cohort of 12 children, ranging in age from 5 to 17 years, who were anesthetized (ketamine and propofol).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-2150135111421352">14</xref>
</sup> After baseline studies were obtained, dexmedetomidine was administered as a loading dose of 1 µg/kg over 10 minutes followed by a continuous infusion at 0.7 µg/kg per h. Heart rate decreased at 10 minutes following the start of dexmedetomidine administration when compared to baseline (94.3 ± 19.8 vs 75.9 ± 17.1 beats/min, <italic>P</italic> = .045) but not at 20 minutes. There was also a depression of sinus and atrioventricular (AV) node function with a prolongation of sinus node recovery times and a lengthening of AV node block cycle and the PR interval. No change was noted in atrial or ventricular muscle refractory times. The authors cautioned against the administration of dexmedetomidine to patients at risk of bradycardia or with underlying AV or sinus node dysfunction.</p>
<p>In a subsequent study, ECGs were obtained before and after the administration of dexmedetomidine in a cohort of 76 pediatric patients admitted to the cardiothoracic intensive care unit (ICU).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-2150135111421352">15</xref>
</sup> This prospective study included patients with CHD and children following cardiothoracic surgery and CPB. A total of 51 patients received an infusion of dexmedetomidine, while 25 patients served as the control group. With the administration of dexmedetomidine, there was a decrease in the HR from 140 ± 22 beats/min to 115 ± 23 beats/min (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001). Neonates and infants had a greater decrease in the HR compared to older children, while other parameters were similar. When the various ECG intervals were corrected for changes in HR and compared to patients who had not received dexmedetomidine, no significant differences were noted. As they saw similar changes in the control group, the authors speculated that these likely reflected the normal postoperative course following cardiothoracic surgery and CPB.</p>
<p>Anecdotal reports of the temporal association of dexmedetomidine and potentially devastating complications have been noted in specific patient populations.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-2150135111421352">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-2150135111421352">17</xref>
</sup> Ingersoll-Wenget al reported an intraoperative cardiac arrest in a 52-year-old woman during sternotomy and thymectomy.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-2150135111421352">16</xref>
</sup> Associated factors which may have contributed to the cardiac arrest included the coadministration of medications including fentanyl as part of the intraoperative anesthetic regimen, a sympatholytic effect from thoracic epidural anesthesia, preoperative pyridostigmine to treat the underlying myasthenia gravis, a high resting vagal tone, and sternal retraction with stimulation of sensory receptors in the heart resulting in the Bezold-Jarisch reflex. The patient was successfully resuscitated with open cardiac massage and intravenous epinephrine (300 µg). There was prompt return of the blood pressure after less than 2 minutes of asystole. The dexmedetomidine infusion was discontinued and the remainder of the intraoperative and postoperative course was uneventful. In another anecdotal report, Sichrovsky et al reported intraoperative cardiac arrest and death of a 50-year-old patient during an ablation procedure for paroxysmal atrial tachycardia.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-2150135111421352">17</xref>
</sup> Hypotension, bradycardia, and asystole were temporally related to the administration of dexmedetomidine. However, confounding factors included the development of a moderate-sized pericardial effusion with tamponade. Additional confounding factors included ST segment elevation and the development of depressed left ventricular function noted on echocardiography.</p>
<p>In other clinical scenarios, the negative chronotropic effects of dexmedetomidine have been shown to be beneficial in certain patient populations and have occasionally been used as a therapeutic maneuver. Talke et al randomized 24 adult patients undergoing vascular surgery to placebo or one of three plasma concentrations of dexmedetomidine: 0.15 ng/mL (low dose), 0.3 ng/mL (medium dose), or 0.45 ng/mL (high dose).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-2150135111421352">18</xref>
</sup> Dexmedetomidine was started 1 hour prior to anesthetic induction and continued for 48 hours. In the placebo group, there was an increased incidence of tachycardia (23 minutes/h) when compared to the low-dose (9 minutes/h, <italic>P</italic> = .006), medium-dose (0.5 minutes/h, <italic>P</italic> = .004), and high-dose (2.3 minutes/h, <italic>P</italic> = .004) dexmedetomidine groups.</p>
<p>In a second study in adults undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery, 80 patients were randomized to receive either a saline placebo or a dexmedetomidine infusion, which was started 30 minutes before the induction of anesthesia.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-2150135111421352">19</xref>
</sup> Compared with placebo, dexmedetomidine decreased the incidence of intraoperative (2 vs 13 patients) and postoperative (5 vs 16 patients) tachycardia. Dexmedetomidine also decreased the need for β-adrenergic antagonists (3 vs 11 patients). In an anecdotal report, the negative chronotropic effect of dexmedetomidine was used as a therapeutic maneuver during off-pump CABG surgery when tachycardia was unresponsive to β-adrenergic blockade.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-2150135111421352">20</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Reports of the use of dexmedetomidine as a therapeutic agent to treat tachyarrhythmias in the pediatric population include a nonrandomized retrospective review by Chrysostomou et al.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-2150135111421352">21</xref>
</sup> They evaluated the efficacy of dexmedetomidine to control tachyarrhythmias in 14 patients with CHD, ranging in age from 1 day to 12 months.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-2150135111421352">21</xref>
</sup> Dexmedetomidine was used as the primary agent in 9 patients and as a rescue drug in 5 others when amiodarone or amiodarone plus hypothermia failed. An initial loading dose of 1.1 ± 0.5 µg/kg was administered to 10 of the patients. Twelve patients received a continuous infusion of 0.9 ± 0.3 μg/kg per h. An infusion was not needed in 2 of the patients as the SVT converted into NSR following the loading dose. Adverse effects were noted in 4 (28%) of 13 patients including hypotension in 3 that responded to a fluid bolus and 1 patient who developed complete AV block with a junctional escape rhythm of 115 beats/min that lasted 2 hours. The primary outcome for rhythm and/or HR control was achieved in 13 (93%) of 14 patients. In the six patients with Junctional Ectopic Tachycardia (JET), the primary outcome was met in all six (HR ≤ 170 beats/min within 2 hours). Five of the six patients eventually converted into NSR. The four patients with SVT converted into NSR. The one patient with atrial fibrillation failed to respond to dexmedetomidine.</p>
<p>Parent et al. reported their anecdotal experience with dexmedetomidine to treat sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) in a 12-year-old with dilated cardiomyopathy.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-2150135111421352">22</xref>
</sup> Despite multiple loading doses and an infusion of amiodarone (to a total dose of 20 mg/kg) as well as 1 mg/kg of lidocaine, the VT persisted. Dexmedetomidine was administered as a loading dose of 0.5 µg/kg over 20 minutes. By the completion of the loading dose, the patient converted into NSR with a decrease in the HR from 144 to 66 beats/min and an increase in his BP from 66/47 to 108/55 mm Hg. There was no recurrence of the arrhythmia noted and the patient was eventually discharged home on amiodarone.</p>
<p>We provide additional anecdotal information regarding the efficacy of dexmedetomidine as a therapeutic agent for the control of arrhythmias following surgery for CHD. Our patient presented with a preoperative history of SVT which had been controlled with digoxin. Although temporary conversion to NSR occurred with cardioversion and adenosine, the SVT recurred. At that time, effective conversion and control of the arrhythmia was noted following the administration of dexmedetomidine as a loading dose of 1μg/kg followed by an infusion of 1 μg/kg per h. As noted in two of the four patients with SVT in the report of Chrysostomou et al,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-2150135111421352">21</xref>
</sup> conversion of our patient’s SVT occurred during the loading dose. Given that the arrhythmia had proven to be difficult to control and had resulted in hypotension, we chose to use a continuous infusion. Although several options exist for the treatment of SVT, given the other benefits of dexmedetomidine in the pediatric cardiac surgical patient, consideration of this agent in such scenarios appears warranted.</p>
