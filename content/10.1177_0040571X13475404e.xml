<sec id="sec1-0040571X13475404e"><title>Kenton L. Sparks, <bold><italic>Sacred Word, Broken Word: Biblical Authority and the Dark Side of Scripture</italic></bold>, Eerdmans: Grand Rapids, 2012; 192 pp.: 9780802867168, $20.00 (pbk)</title>
<p>Spark’s <italic>Sacred Word Broken Word</italic> addresses a growing problem in a postmodern world: namely, the abuse of Scripture in the interests of particular social groups. He states, ‘[W]e will consider Scripture’s peculiar difficulties with a spirit of respect for the written word and for the God who has given it to us’ (p. 11).</p>
<p>In Chapter 2, ‘Creation and the Problem of Evil’, Sparks clearly attempts to showcase the historical and theological arguments on the creation of the universe which will lead to new interpretations of the creation account recorded in the Old Testament. Chapter 3, ‘The Contribution of Christology’, wishes to sound relevant as it states, ‘just as God brought together divinity and humanity in the incarnation, so in Scripture these two natures are joined’ (p. 27). In chapters 4 and 5, Sparks makes very creative and reflective arguments about the brokenness of the Scriptures by citing genuine and sincere arguments from people such as Augustine, Calvin and Dietrich Bonhoeffer.</p>
<p>Chapter 6, ‘Some Theological Queries’, presents some novel frameworks for placing Scripture within the human world-view with a claim that ‘in Scripture, God speaks to us through the finite and fallen perspectives of human authors and thereby, through the limited and fallen horizons of human cultures and audiences’ (p. 59). Chapters 7 and 8 describe the interactions between biblical interpretation and marked cultural changes such as modernism and postmodernism. Chapter 9, ‘Sacred Scripture as Ancient Discourse’, attempts to interpret Scripture in the light of our understanding of the way in which the original hearers would have heard and read the books, ways very strange to our current approaches to texts.</p>
<p>The titles of the next two chapters, ‘Listening to the Diversity and Unity of Scripture’ and ‘Theology beyond the Bible: Spirit, Cosmos, Tradition, and Experience’, vividly illustrate the varied ways in which Scripture has been interpreted, in the light of theological and personal outlook.</p>
<p>The final two chapters, ‘Priorities for Theological Interpretation’ and ‘Validity and Biblical Interpretation’, address the dark side of Scripture and the ways in which this affects its interpretation. Sparks is at his best when offering ‘Final thoughts’ to challenge and equip the readers of the Bible in a very systematic way. This is an interesting book which will encourage exploration of the less well-known areas of scriptural interpretation.</p>
