<sec id="sec1-0265691411428783ah"><title>Barbara Kosta, <italic>Willing Seduction: The</italic> Blue Angel,<italic> Marlene Dietrich, and Mass Culture</italic>, Berghahn: Oxford, 2009; 208 pp.; 9781845455729, £35.00 (hbk)</title>
<p>The film <italic>Blue Angel</italic> came onto the market in a situation of social and political crisis during the late Weimar Republic. Barbara Kosta examines the film within this wider cultural context. In her analysis, it is a film which deals with the binary oppositions between representation/illusion and reality; between mass culture and high culture (the clash between <italic>Zivilisation</italic> or modernity) on the one hand, and <italic>Kultur</italic>, seen as traditional culture, on the other hand. The <italic>Blue Angel</italic> is set on this rupture between different forms of culture, presenting the extreme tensions in regard to the culture that characterizes the interwar period. In this perspective the relationship between Rath and Lola equals the correlation between the two media-formats, literature and film, as two different expressions of culture.</p>
<p>In the first chapter Kosta positions the film in the larger context of the debates on cinema, mass culture and national identity, with culture and art historically playing an important role for the construction of a German identity. In these debates mass culture was often seen as a form of Americanization that undermined traditional ideas of culture and therefore was supposed to be harmful to a German audience.</p>
<p>The second chapter analyses the spectator’s relationship to the sphere of visibility, that is the sphere of the image. Here Professor Rath’s disavowal of reality is related to a misinterpretation of the means and ends of modern mass culture. He is captivated by the image of the seductive female, the entertainer Lola, being at the same time exposed to modern visual mass culture, and surrenders to the appeal of the image and the sexualized body of the modern woman. The concept of modern women is analysed in detail in chapter three: female employment as new societal development and the visibility of women as part of a modern city evoked social transformations, calling into question the binary attribution of women as either whore or mother. Multiple models of femininity developed instead, reflected in a multiplicity of different female roles in both Weimar Germany and in the film itself. Based on this transformation of female roles, the public sphere had to be redefined.</p>
<p>As the<italic> Blue Angel</italic> was one of the first German sound-films, chapter four points out the importance of sound for demarcating two different social and cultural spheres connected to the two main characters: whereas Rath is associated with traditional music, classical culture and the <italic>Bildungsbürger</italic>, Lola is depicted as the embodiment of the modern woman, a present-day siren. In this context Rath’s failure to differentiate between illusion and reality and his personal downfall recall the fate of a failed Odysseus. Finally chapter five pays attention to the revival of interest in Marlene Dietrich and the film in unified Germany after 1989, which can be regarded as a paradigm of a problematic German past. Although opinions about the Hollywood star and her legacy remained divided, Dietrich was transformed into a national icon. Kosta argues that Dietrich’s image was used in many ways to evoke a new German identity, an identity associated with crisis during the twentieth century. ‘The new republic eagerly drew and continues to draw on Dietrich’s symbolic value as Germany’s “first international star” to give a reunified Germany its facelift’ (143). By setting the <italic>Blue Angel</italic> in its broader cultural context, Kosta captivates the reader and provides important insights into cultural debates during the Weimar Republic.</p>
