<title>Special Symposium Issue – Performance Management for Public Infrastructures</title>
<p><italic>Public Works Management &amp; Policy</italic> invites scholars and practitioners to submit articles on topics related to the theories and applications of performance management for public infrastructure. Effective management requires a definition of success that can be translated into transparent and reproducible measures of performance. Techniques such as dashboards, benchmarking, and balanced scorecards have been explored in the literature. However, innovative performance management techniques and practices in the area of public works have not been studied in much depth and little has been published in academic journals.</p>
<p>Suggested topics include, but are not limited to:</p>
<list id="list1-1087724X13480866" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>– Measuring performance of public infrastructure service delivery such as wastewater or transportation</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>– Case studies of applications of performance techniques (e.g. benchmarking, balanced scorecards, dashboards)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>– Performance budgeting for capital projects</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>– Lessons learned from and/or challenges to performance management</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>– Innovative performance management techniques and practices</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>– Theories of performance management for public infrastructure</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Articles should be approximately 25 double-spaced typewritten pages, although shorter or longer manuscripts will not be excluded from consideration. Proposals to write articles should be no more than 500 words and submitted by <bold>June 1, 2013</bold>. Proposals should include a title, description of approach, and linkage to the symposium theme. The symposium co-editors will select proposals and contact prospective authors by <bold>July 1, 2013</bold> and completed papers will be due by <bold>October 1, 2013</bold>. The symposium papers will be published in the <bold>July 2014</bold> issue of <italic>Public Works Management &amp; Policy</italic>.</p>
<p>Decisions to commission papers will be made by the guest editors, Bill Leavitt and Juita-Elena Yusuf (Old Dominion University) and Richard Little, Editor of <italic>PWMP</italic>. Articles will be refereed by anonymous reviewers, and they will be expected to meet standards of scholarly excellence. The co-editors will make final judgments regarding the suitability of manuscripts for publication in the journal.</p>
