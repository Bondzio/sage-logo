<p>Educated people often say they cannot bear Punch and Judy politics. They express a particular aversion to Prime Minister's Questions: the noise, the braying of rival gangs, the exchange of childish insults, the absence of reasoned debate. The received view in high-minded circles is that, like bear-baiting, PMQs is a barbaric activity which it is embarrassing to find still being practised in the 21<sup>st</sup> century.</p>
<p>As one who loves Punch and Judy politics, allow me to spring to its defence. PMQs is one of the few genuinely popular bits of British politics. It is what one might call tabloid politics, with the essential messages subbed down to a few words, making them much more forceful. The Chamber, the public gallery and the press gallery are so full because the spectacle is so entertaining, especially by comparison with more worthy and ponderous occasions such at the Liaison Committee's occasional sessions with the Prime Minister, which last for about two hours, but often seem to last for about two days. During the 30 minutes of PMQs, you can within moments make an idiot of yourself, or score a triumph.</p>
<p>This danger makes PMQs a test of courage, and of the ability to think on one's feet: qualities we are right to demand in those who wish to govern us. It helps to reveal what our rulers are made of. Once a week, when parliament is sitting, the Prime Minister has to answer at PMQs for everything done by the government. The brevity of the exchanges forces people to be witty, or at least prevents them from being dull.</p>
<p>One of the characteristic faults of politicians who have nothing to say is to say it at inordinate length, and this the Speaker, John Bercow, will not allow during PMQs, or indeed during questions to other ministers. Mr Bercow is not a dignified figure, but he is efficient at keeping the business of the House moving. The Commons works much better than it did under his predecessor.</p>
<p>The British idea of liberty includes the right to be as rude as one likes about people who consider themselves to be important, with the aim of cutting them down to size. That is what our politicians try to do to each other at PMQs. Such institutionalised rudeness may not be the most elevated form of debate, but it is part of being a free nation. We have adversarial politics, conducted in a crowded Chamber which lends itself to confrontation rather than consensus, and we allow whichever lot sounds least bad to govern us.</p>
<p>Behind the attack on Punch and Judy politics lies the deluded belief that if only educated people discuss an issue in a calm, rational and disinterested manner, the right answer will emerge. Perhaps this is sometimes true. Calmness, rationality and disinterestedness certainly have their place in public life. But to trust politicians to act on all — or even most — occasions without thinking of their own interests, and without being tempted to put those interests first, would be intolerably naïve.</p>
<p>Just before writing this article, I had lunch with Charles Glass, an American journalist renowned for his reporting and other exploits in the Middle East (in 1987 he was abducted and held hostage in Lebanon for two months before escaping). Glass said: “The word in politics that I hate most is ‘bipartisan’. After the Civil War, the Republicans and Democrats had a bipartisan policy towards the American Indian. You know where that led.” Bipartisanship does not mean a policy is correct. On the contrary: that course of action (or inaction) may just be convenient for those who are in power. Parliamentary politics, in which it is the task of the Opposition to detect the flaws in whatever the Government is doing, checks the tendency of politicians to do whatever suits them.</p>
<p>In December 2005, when David Cameron had his first outing at PMQs as Leader of the Opposition, he declared, “I want to talk about the future,” before saying of Tony Blair, “he was the future once.”</p>
<p>That was a palpable hit, which showed Cameron was capable of competing against as formidable and experienced a performer as Blair. Yet only the day before, Cameron had said: “I'm fed up with the Punch and Judy politics of Westminster — the name-calling, back-biting, point-scoring, finger-pointing.” At his first PMQs, Cameron proceeded to cover himself against the charge that he was only trying to score points, by offering to help Blair to push through school reforms which were opposed by the Labour party.</p>
<p>This constructive pose was of course another way of scoring off Blair. But it had the merit of varying the tone a bit. Even we Punch and Judy fans do not want PMQs to consist entirely of direct blows. As in a game of cricket, one looks for subtlety as well as aggression.</p>
<p>One of Cameron's faults can be to seem too contemptuous of an opponent, and too keen to destroy him. Blair liked to rise above the battle: having seized the moral high ground, he gazed down on his opponents and made them seem petty. His self-righteousness became intolerable, but not before he had spent a dozen years seeing off all rivals.</p>
<p>Cameron admits that he has failed to bring an end to Punch and Judy politics. As he put it in April 2010: “Prime Minister's Questions is a bear pit and you can't change it… There's an element of Christians being fed to the lions and you're either a lion or a Christian.”</p>
<p>It would certainly be wrong for me, as a defender of PMQs, to pretend that it is always an edifying spectacle. Nor does it always work even within its own terms: as in most contests, one sometimes finds oneself watching a scrappy affair from which no one emerges well. But at its best, it is a wonderfully enjoyable piece of political theatre, which deserves to be defended from the puritanical prigs who would like to ban it. As Macaulay said in his History of England: “The Puritan hated bear-baiting, not because it gave pain to the bear, but because it gave pleasure to the spectators.”</p>
