<p>Teachers and other school staff play key roles as partners in the prevention, identification, and intervention of mental health difficulties among children and youth. However, it is essential that teachers are equipped with sufficient mental health literacy to engender effective practices in these areas. This article reviews the literature related to mental health literacy with respect to the perceived preparedness of teachers as well as approaches that have been taken or are under way to improve literacy. A specific focus on bullying is also highlighted. Finally, suggestions emerging from current research as to the elements of effective approaches to teacher preparation are explored as well as recommendations for future research in the area.</p>

<title>Mental Health Needs Among Canadian Children</title>
<p>Many students in Canadian schools are struggling to succeed academically and socially because of ongoing and significant mental health issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0829573512468852">Vaillancourt &amp; Boylan, in press</xref>). According to the Canadian Coalition for Children and Youth Mental Health, the mental health of students is the “number one issue facing schools today” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0829573512468852">Brown, 2011</xref>, p. 1). Although estimates vary widely, the percentage of children and youth experiencing mental health difficulties, including anxiety, depression, or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is suggested to be between 15% and 30% and is predicted to increase by 50% by 2020 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0829573512468852">Arboleda-Flórez, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0829573512468852">Leitch, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0829573512468852">Roberts, Stuart, &amp; Lam, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0829573512468852">Waddell &amp; Shepherd, 2002</xref>). In fact, most psychiatric disorders emerge in adolescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0829573512468852">Leitch, 2007</xref>). And, although rates of suicide have declined slightly in Canada since 1990, suicide remains the second leading cause of death among adolescents, with rising levels among girls and consistently high rates among Aboriginal youth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0829573512468852">Kirmayer et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0829573512468852">Skinner &amp; McFaull, 2012</xref>). In 2008, suicides accounted for 20% of all deaths among Canadians aged 10 to 14 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0829573512468852">Skinner &amp; McFaull, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite the obvious need for timely service provision, it has been reported that only one in five children with a mental health disorder in Canada receives treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0829573512468852">UNICEF Canada, 2007</xref>) and that the treatments they do receive are often not evidence-based (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0829573512468852">Vaillancourt &amp; Boylan, in press</xref>). The barriers facing timely and potentially life-saving service delivery are numerous and wide ranging. The fragmentation, or disciplinary “silos,” in the health care system, as well as insufficient numbers of qualified professionals, inadequate funding, and long wait times constitute system-level barriers to adequate care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0829573512468852">Reid &amp; Brown, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0829573512468852">Sterling, Weisner, Hinman, &amp; Parthasarathy, 2010</xref>). Individual- and community-level barriers include geographic location, socioeconomic status, family health, stigma, and the “fit” between youth-specific needs and available services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0829573512468852">Kutcher &amp; McDougall, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0829573512468852">Mukolo, Heflinger, &amp; Wallston, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0829573512468852">Reid &amp; Brown, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Many of these and other barriers, as well as potential solutions, are detailed in a report that summarizes the findings and recommendations of the Standing Senate Committee on Social Affairs, Science and Technology, chaired by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0829573512468852">Kirby and Keon (2006)</xref> from their investigation into the state of mental health in Canada. One strand of recommendations is focused on the untapped potential of school sites in facilitating mental health prevention and intervention. Kirby and Keon suggest that teachers “be trained so that they can be involved in the early identification of mental illness” (p. 19) and that resources and supports necessary to take on this role be provided. This recognition of educators and schools as key players in the broader community-wide effort to respond to the mental health needs of students has been echoed by researchers and practitioners alike (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0829573512468852">Power, Cleary, &amp; Fitzpatrick, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0829573512468852">Schonert-Reichl &amp; Hymel, 2007</xref>).</p>

<title>Mental Health and Schools</title>
<p>Most educators are aware that mental health difficulties exist among many of their students. It would be impossible not to, given the impact that these mental health challenges have on learning and overall functioning. Students with mental health difficulties are more likely to experience lower academic achievement, less school engagement and participation, poorer peer and family relationships, and are more likely to drop out of school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0829573512468852">Meldrum, Venn, &amp; Kutcher, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0829573512468852">Vaillancourt &amp; Boylan, in press</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0829573512468852">Volk, Craig, Boyce, &amp; King, 2006</xref>). Long-term outcomes, including employment and education, are also significantly poorer for individuals with mental health difficulties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0829573512468852">Fergusson &amp; Woodward, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Canadian educators are presently searching for effective ways to prevent the development of mental health difficulties and to support the needs of students who exhibit such difficulties. However, for any approach to be successful, school personnel need to have the knowledge, skills, and attitudes required to recognize mental health difficulties and know the appropriate steps to take to both integrate these students effectively in classroom activities and to ensure that they receive the care they require.</p>

<title>Mental Health Literacy of Educators</title>
<p>The role of schools, and specifically teachers, in the prevention, identification, and intervention of mental health difficulties among children and youth is essential. Teachers and other school personnel are often the first to observe behaviours that indicate either the development or worsening of mental health problems. These problems affect the functioning of students in many ways, including their ability to learn and participate in positive ways in school and the wider community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0829573512468852">Meldrum et al., 2009</xref>): “It is therefore imperative that teachers are equipped with the practical tools and knowledge required to recognize and intervene appropriately in situations where mental illness may be a concern” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0829573512468852">Meldrum et al., 2009</xref>, p. 3).</p>
<p>It is also important that the beliefs of teachers regarding mental health issues be taken into consideration. Individuals’ beliefs comprise one element of mental health literacy, which is defined as “the knowledge, beliefs and abilities that enable the recognition, management or prevention of mental health problems” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0829573512468852">Canadian Alliance on Mental Illness and Mental Health [CAMIMH], 2007</xref>, p. 4). Research has documented the myths and misunderstandings that members of the general public, as well as medical professionals, hold about mental health issues. Unfortunately, these largely negative attitudes and the stigma they foster have been found to present barriers to successful and timely intervention primarily by reducing access to appropriate referrals and by limiting help-seeking behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0829573512468852">Jorm, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0829573512468852">Martin, Pescosolido, &amp; Tuch, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Only a few studies exist that directly assess the views of educators in regard to mental health issues in the classroom. One study based on interviews with 32 teachers in England documented the need for teacher training to recognize and address mental health issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0829573512468852">Rothi, Leavey, &amp; Best, 2008</xref>). A second study, conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0829573512468852">Walter, Gouze, and Lim (2006)</xref> in the United States involved a needs-assessment survey of 119 elementary school teachers regarding students’ mental health problems. Teachers reported that they lacked information and training, which hindered their ability to solve mental health problems. They also showed a limited amount of overall mental health knowledge, particularly with regards to ADHD symptoms, depression prevalence, and the nature of oppositional defiance disorder.</p>
<p>Recently, the Canadian Teachers’ Federation (CTF), working in collaboration with the Mental Health Commission of Canada, conducted a survey of more than 3,900 teachers across the country (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0829573512468852">CTF, 2012</xref>). The goal of the study was to assess teachers’ perceptions of barriers to the provision of mental health services for students and to indicate their level of preparedness to address the mental health issues they may face. Results indicated that the vast majority of teachers perceived that mental health issues, such as stress, ADHD, anxiety, and depression, were pressing concerns in their schools. As well, 87% of teachers agreed that a lack of adequate staff training in dealing with children’s mental illness is a potential barrier to providing mental health services for students in their schools.</p>
<p>A second Canadian study, conducted with approximately 170 educators in Northern, Ontario, found that whereas the vast majority felt that professional development in the area of students’ mental health was needed, less than 10% felt supported by the mental health community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0829573512468852">Brackenreed &amp; Frost, 2002</xref>). Interestingly, interviews with representatives of the mental health community revealed agreement with the need for teacher training but were unsure of the roles and responsibilities of teachers. From both teachers’ and mental health workers’ perspectives, finding ways to lessen stigma to allow for help seeking among teachers and students was seen as a top priority.</p>
<p>Based on the limited research that exists, teachers have expressed the desire to gain a greater understanding of the nature of mental health difficulties that might be experienced by their students as well as strategies to deal with difficulties when they occurred. Some recent international research indicates that focused and well-resourced programs that aim to increase teachers’ mental health literacy can produce significant positive effects. An evaluation of an intensive campaign in Norway in recent years demonstrated that teachers exposed to such a program are more skilled and confident in identifying the early signs of psychosis in adolescents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0829573512468852">Langeveld et al., 2011</xref>). These efforts are critical in directing youth to appropriate services in the early onset phase of psychotic illness such as schizophrenia, since, as the authors point out, youth tend to be underserved in this respect compared with adults who develop psychotic illness. Another study in Italy illustrates how teachers’ limited knowledge of psychiatric services for youth displaying early signs of psychotic illness in the school context continues to be a barrier to early intervention and proper care for them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0829573512468852">Masillo et al., 2012</xref>). Findings from the recent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0829573512468852">CTF (2012)</xref> survey of teachers suggest that the situation in Canada may not be much different: 68% of teachers reported that they had received no training in mental health literacy, a shortfall that was even more evident among less experienced teachers, 75% of whom reported never having had any training. However, these numbers are no indication of their desire to develop mental health literacy, as nearly the entire sample of respondents expressed a desire to increase their skills and knowledge in the domain.</p>
<p>Another key element within the definition of mental health literacy is a focus on the “prevention of mental health problem” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0829573512468852">CAMIMH, 2007</xref>, p. 4). In addition to developing literacy in terms of recognizing mental health difficulties and identifying appropriate next steps, educators should also have a solid understanding of their role in prevention. One example of an area on which school personnel can focus their efforts to reduce mental health difficulties among children and youth is bullying and peer victimization. Although the contribution of bullying to mental health issues, such as depression and anxiety, are well documented (see below), the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0829573512468852">CTF (2012)</xref> survey reveals that the stigma that accompanies mental illness frequently makes affected children targets of bullying. Twenty-one percent of teachers indicated that they frequently or very frequently see students with mental health issues being bullied by classmates, a situation that surely contributes to these children’s underlying issues and undermines professional efforts to help them.</p>
<sec id="section4-0829573512468852">
<title>Bullying</title>
<p>Bullying extends far beyond an occasional fight or disagreement between peers. Rather, it entails the repeated and intentional humiliation and oppression of a person who has less power than his or her aggressor(s) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0829573512468852">Olweus, 1999</xref>). Bullying occurs at an alarming rate among Canadian students. In a recent population-based Canadian study of 16,879 students in Grades 4 to 12, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0829573512468852">Vaillancourt et al. (2010)</xref> reported that 32% of students admitted to bullying others and 38% of students reported being bullied. These statistics are unfortunately consistent with other population-based studies such as UNICEF’s Innocenti Report Card 7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0829573512468852">2007</xref>) using data from the World Health Organization. In terms of students’ perception of school safety, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0829573512468852">Vaillancourt et al. (2010)</xref> also found that 20% of students reported feeling unsafe at school with elementary school students reporting feeling less safe than secondary school students.</p>
<p>Researchers examining the effects of bullying have documented a host of negative correlates and consequences among students involved in bullying, and in particular, among those who fall victim to their peers’ abuse. Studies in which the concurrent relations between bullying and health outcomes have been examined have shown convincingly that children and youth who are bullied by peers, relative to non-victimized youth, report lower self-esteem and self-worth, greater loneliness and social withdrawal, more anxiety and depression, and more somatic complaints (e.g., headaches, stomachaches; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0829573512468852">McDougall &amp; Vaillancourt, 2012</xref>). Moreover, children involved in bullying as perpetrators or victims also fair poorly in the academic realm. They are more likely than non-involved students to avoid school, do poorly academically, and to drop out (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0829573512468852">McDougall &amp; Vaillancourt, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Disconcertingly, results from longitudinal research strongly suggest that this list of negative mental and physical health “correlates” is the result of being abused and not a precipitator of poor treatment by peers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0829573512468852">Arseneault et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0829573512468852">Kim, Leventhal, Koh, Hubbard, &amp; Boyce, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0829573512468852">Sourander, Helstela, Helenius, &amp; Piha, 2000</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0829573512468852">McDougall &amp; Vaillancourt, 2012</xref> for a review). Because bullying is strongly linked to poor mental and physical health, lower academic achievement, and school adjustment problems, it is important that teachers and other school personal are aware of this link and are committed to prioritizing the reduction of bullying as a way of reducing this burden of illness and improving academic achievement. In Canada, most school boards have prioritized the reduction of bullying, however, teachers nevertheless report feeling ill-prepared for the task at hand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0829573512468852">Blain-Arcaro, Smith, Cunningham, Vaillancourt, &amp; Rimas, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0829573512468852">Mishna, Scarcello, Pepler, &amp; Wiener, 2005</xref>). Moreover, although many teachers are sympathetic to the plight of peer-victimized students, research also shows that this “sympathy [diminishes] with increasing length of service” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0829573512468852">Boulton, 1997</xref>, p. 223). Finally, research suggests that teachers’ adherence to bullying prevention program tends to be poor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0829573512468852">Dane &amp; Schneider, 1998</xref>), perhaps because teachers are rarely involved in the development of these programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0829573512468852">Cunningham et al., 2009</xref>). As suggested by Cunningham and colleagues, program success in the reduction of bullying is likely enhanced when teachers’ (and students’) bullying prevention program preferences are considered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0829573512468852">Cunningham et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0829573512468852">Cunningham, Vaillancourt, Cunningham, Chen, &amp; Ratcliffe, 2011</xref>). Given that bullying has been identified as a significant cause of mental health issues, and that teachers report needing additional preparation to deal with bullying, this is an area that should be included in any mental health literacy program for educators.</p>
</sec>

<sec id="section5-0829573512468852">
<title>Improving Mental Health Literacy of Educators</title>
<p>Given the limited mental health literacy that exists among educators in areas such as signs and symptoms of mental illness and bullying, as well as their desire to improve understanding, professional learning opportunities are clearly warranted. However, the type of training, including curriculum and method of instruction that will be most effective in terms of developing teachers’ mental health literacy has not yet been determined.</p>
<p>Much of the research that does exist exploring the development of mental health literacy among teachers comes from Jorm and his colleagues in Australia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0829573512468852">Jorm, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0829573512468852">Jorm, Christensen, &amp; Griffiths, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0829573512468852">Jorm, Kitchener, Sawyer, Scales, &amp; Cvetkovski, 2010</xref>). They created a Youth Mental Health First Aid course, which instructs teachers on how to apply an action plan when faced with a student experiencing difficulties. In one study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0829573512468852">Jorm et al. (2010)</xref> administered the course to 176 middle-school teachers at 7 schools. As compared with the control group, significant increases were seen in teachers’ knowledge of mental health issues, intentions toward helping students, and confidence in delivering programs. Improvements were seen in teacher beliefs and endorsement of items indicating stigma.</p>
<p>Across Canada, there are a number of initiatives being developed at the school, community, and provincial levels to better help teachers to recognize and deal with mental health issues. Although the efficacy of most of these has not been evaluated, mental health literacy programs have been completed by educators in various parts of the country. For example, in Alberta, more than 800 teachers completed the Youth Mental Health First Aid course. In south-central Ontario, a network of school boards, researchers, and community organizations are working together to provide educators with the knowledge, understanding, and skills required to teach students with mental health problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0829573512468852">Bajus, Buchanan, &amp; Hobbs, 2012</xref>). Evaluation of the specific educator guide being employed is also ongoing.</p>
<p>In 2007, the Mental Health and High School Curriculum Guide was created by Dr. Stan Kutcher in collaboration with the Canadian Mental Health Association (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0829573512468852">Teen Mental Health, 2012</xref>). This initiative provides information for teachers as part of a program delivered to students within the regular Health and Physical Education curriculum. The program has been piloted in a number of schools and several local evaluations have been conducted. Results to date indicate that teacher knowledge and attitudes improved significantly after taking part in training and satisfaction with the training was very high (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0829573512468852">Wei, McLuckie, &amp; Kutcher, 2012</xref>). In their review of school-based mental health programs, however, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0829573512468852">Han and Weiss (2005)</xref> suggested that the provision of teacher training may not be sufficient over the long term, even with structural support. They suggest a combination of classroom practice and performance feedback to maintain the highest levels of fidelity.</p>
<p>There are also a few initiatives related to mental health that exist in pre-service Bachelor of Education (BEd) programs. Clearly, this is a crucial time when large numbers of future educators can be better informed and engaged with information related to the mental health of their students. Previous research has demonstrated the potential that pre-service programs can have in shaping the beliefs, practices, and efficacy of candidates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0829573512468852">Brownlee, Petriwskyj, Thorpe, Stacey, Phillip &amp; Gibson, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0829573512468852">Darling-Hammond, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0829573512468852">Hong &amp; Lin, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0829573512468852">Stacey, Brownlee, Thorpe, &amp; Reeves, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>With respect to pre-service preparation, the curricula of BEd programs vary both within and across provinces but typically comprise courses focused on teachable subjects, pedagogical approaches, educational issues, curriculum and assessment, and classroom practice. Whatever the approach taken by the BEd program, it is becoming increasingly clear that mental health literacy is a topic critical to teacher preparation and that ways must be found to integrate this into courses to better serve Canadian children. It is also important that, rather than simply continuing to add courses to already intensive programs, research and theory in the area of teacher education is carefully considered in exploring thoughtful ways of training teachers more effectively. For example, infusing content such as that related to mental health literacy into existing subject courses such as Health and Physical Education is an approach that has been supported by researchers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0829573512468852">Loreman &amp; Earle, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0829573512468852">Voltz, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0829573512468852">Woloshyn, Bennett, &amp; Berrill, 2003</xref>). A focus on bullying is also being included within some Health and Physical Education courses.</p>
<sec id="section6-0829573512468852">
<title>Bullying</title>
<p>Because bullying is a significant psychosocial problem that is pervasive in Canadian schools, education authorities have implemented some significant policy solutions to address bullying over the past decade. For example, the province of Ontario requires all schools to implement bullying prevention initiatives and more recently amended the Education Act to require educators to report serious incidents of bullying to parents of victimized children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0829573512468852">Education Amendment Act, 2009</xref>). In 2012, the Province of Quebec initiated a multipronged strategy to address school bullying, and education authorities in most other Canadian provinces have implemented similar strategies in recent years. Additionally, there are mounting social pressures on school systems to address bullying, and these are evident in parental expectations about their children’s safety at school as well as in recent law suits against school authorities related to bullying (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0829573512468852">Findlay, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0829573512468852">McKiernan, 2010</xref>). For many reasons, Canadian schools are being compelled to take serious steps to address bullying problems.</p>
<p>Teachers’ roles in these initiatives are pivotal given their proximity to children and to bullying incidents when they occur. Their roles are also critical to curbing bullying, since bullying involves complex power dynamics that often defy children’s capacities to solve them. PREVNet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0829573512468852">Promoting Relationships and Eliminating Violence Network, n.d.</xref>; see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.prevnet.ca">www.prevnet.ca</ext-link>), a Canadian consortium of researchers and non-governmental organizations devoted to the cause of eliminating bullying, defines bullying as a “relationship problem that requires relationship solutions”:
<disp-quote>
<p>Within the relationship context of bullying, those children who bully are learning how to use power and aggression to control and distress another; those children who are repeatedly victimized become trapped in abusive relationships that are increasingly difficult to escape. (p. 1)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>As a consequence, teachers, as responsible adults involved in children’s social lives, must assist children caught in these maladaptive relationships—both victimized children and those doing the bullying—to learn more prosocial ways of relating in order to mitigate the long-term damage to everyone involved in bullying.</p>
<p>Although the case for teachers’ roles in bullying solutions is strong, as mentioned previously, there are many indications in the research that teachers struggle to meet this challenge. The first of these concerns teachers’ difficulty in identifying bullying for what it is. Findings of an earlier U.S. study indicate that educators are, on the whole, not skilled in distinguishing bullying from other forms of aggression that lack the insidious relational dynamics of bullying (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0829573512468852">Hazler, Miller, Carney, &amp; Green, 2001</xref>). Additionally, educators in this study were more likely to identify conflicts as bullying when there was physical aggression versus social aggression. In a Canadian qualitative study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0829573512468852">Mishna et al. (2005)</xref> found that teachers’ stereotypes about children who are victimized (e.g., depressed and unassertive) interfered with their ability to identify victimized children who did not fit the stereotypes.</p>
<p>In light of the difficulties teachers tend to have in identifying bullying, it is not surprising that they also face challenges in intervening effectively. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0829573512468852">Yoon and Kerber (2003)</xref> found that teachers judged indirect relational bullying as less serious than direct physical bullying, and consequently proposed to intervene less frequently and to be more lenient with children who bullied using relational strategies. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0829573512468852">Blain-Arcaro et al. (2012)</xref> found that Canadian teachers’ decisions to intervene in bullying situations were most strongly motivated by the distress evidenced by victimized children when bullied, implying that children who hide their distress during bullying are much less likely to get teachers’ help. There were also remnants of the tenacious myth that victimized children somehow deserve what they get in the finding that teachers were much less inclined to intervene in bullying if it appeared that the victimized child had aggravated the bullying child.</p>
<p>Some of these shortcomings in teachers’ knowledge of bullying prevention and intervention are likely explained in part by shortcomings in training. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0829573512468852">Blain-Arcaro et al. (2012)</xref> revealed that only half of their sample of Ontario teachers had ever received specific training on bullying; and this in a province in which bullying prevention has been required in schools for several years. Not surprisingly, many teachers felt under-prepared to deal with bullying incidents and the large majority of teachers wanted additional training. Similarly, in a recent study of pre-service teachers at the end of coursework in a BEd program, respondents reported that only half had formal instruction related to bullying (through a class or workshop), and 10% of respondents had any instruction in bullying prevention specifically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0829573512468852">Ihnat, 2011</xref>). On the positive side, pre-service teachers in the treatment group of this study that received brief training specifically related to bullying prevention and intervention showed gains relative to the control group in the quality of their responses to a set of bullying scenarios. This suggests that teachers can benefit from structured learning opportunities related to bullying.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The need for the development of mental health literacy among educators, including a focus on bullying, has been highlighted by those within and beyond school walls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0829573512468852">Blain-Arcaro et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0829573512468852">Hazler et al., 2001</xref>). The proportion of children and youth struggling with mental health issues twinned with the lack of literacy expressed by teachers in various studies support this need. The notion that mental health issues are irrelevant in what has traditionally been viewed as a strictly academic environment is, fortunately, on the wane.</p>
<p>Ongoing professional learning for teachers and all school staff is clearly warranted. It is important to include within the many initiatives currently being developed and implemented a focus on research exploring ways to effectively prepare teachers, both in pre- and in-service settings. It is no longer sufficient to provide “one-off” workshops to teachers with facts about mental illnesses and bullying and expect practices to change substantially in school systems. Although many teachers have received some kind of training, studies continue to document the lack of efficacy on the part of teachers with respect to mental health literacy. Recent improvements may not have been captured by the research that has been conducted; it is also possible that the training in place is not as effective as imagined.</p>
<p>The material covered within mental health literacy training needs to reflect the gaps in understanding that is evidenced in the literature. For example, teachers continue to overlook relational bullying and focus interventions on more physical forms and are also less likely to act in cases where the victimized child appears to have aggravated the bullying child; this demonstrates a lack of understanding of the relational nature of bullying and the effective means of intervention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0829573512468852">Blain-Arcaro et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0829573512468852">Yoon &amp; Kerber, 2003</xref>). In addition, although teachers may gain knowledge and understanding of mental health issues as a result of their participation in a particular program, how this affects their future actions within the classroom has yet to be determined. Findings from previous research indicate that the perceptions that teachers have regarding the nature of student difficulties have a significant impact on the steps they take to resolve these (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0829573512468852">Blain-Arcaro et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0829573512468852">Stanovich &amp; Jordan, 1998</xref>). Teacher beliefs and perceptions regarding mental health issues need to be considered within any training program.</p>
<p>It is also important to consider the preferences of teachers when developing and implementing mental health literacy programs. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0829573512468852">Cunningham et al. (2009)</xref> describe the complex preferences of teachers regarding the types of bullying prevention programs they favoured. One finding that emerged from the study was that, regardless of their particular views of the types of programs that should be adopted, teachers tended to opt for programs supported by the anecdotal reports of colleagues rather than those based on scientific evidence. The notion of professional learning communities and the strong and persistent benefits of teacher collaboration and sharing emerge throughout the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0829573512468852">Dufour, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0829573512468852">Joyce, Calhoun, &amp; Hopkins, 1999</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0829573512468852">Fullan (2002)</xref>, “information, of which we have a glut, only becomes knowledge thorough a social process” (p. 18). In order for real changes in practice and culture to take place, educators need to engage in continuous learning by observing each others’ practice, discussing and reflecting on various approaches and strategies, and sharing with other schools engaging in similar processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0829573512468852">Dufour, Dufour, Eaker, &amp; Many, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0829573512468852">Fullan, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>We are not suggesting that teachers bear responsibility for providing therapeutic interventions to their students with mental health problems; this is clearly not their role in the school system. However, given the significant influence that educators have on the development of children and the numerous documented links between academic and psychosocial development, a sustained, research-based focus on effective ways of promoting mental health literacy among teachers will help Canadian children and youth to reach their potential.</p>
