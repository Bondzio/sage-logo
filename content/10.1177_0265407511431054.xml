<abstract>
<p>This study examined the utility of the investment model in understanding the experience and expression of emotion in young adult friendships (179 undergraduate students). The results provide support for the utility of the investment model components (i.e., satisfaction, investment, alternative quality, and commitment) in understanding (a) friends’ anger and guilt experiences and (b) the four types of anger expression examined (i.e., integrative assertion, passive aggression, distributive aggression, and non-assertive denial), but the model provided limited support for the four types of guilt expressions examined (i.e., apology–concession, explanations–justification, guilt appeasement, and denial–withdrawal). Support was found for the investment model’s claim that commitment serves a mediating role between the other model components (i.e., satisfaction, investment, and alternative quality) and other relational components.</p>

<p>Friendships can be salient, supportive, intimate, emotion-filled interpersonal relationships for young adults, particularly as they rely on one another during life transitions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0265407511431054">Bliezner &amp; Adams, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0265407511431054">Davis &amp; Todd, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0265407511431054">Fehr, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0265407511431054">Rawlins, 1991</xref>). In fact, “friends often develop bonds of emotional intimacy that are unparalleled in individuals’ relational lives,” and although people may feel hindered in expressing emotion in family relationships, people “usually can let their guard down when in the company of one or more friends” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0265407511431054">Gaines et al., 1998</xref>, p. 507). Because friendships entail “strong emotional investment” and “high standards of required behavior,” friends are susceptible to negative emotional experiences when standards are violated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0265407511431054">von Salisch &amp; Vogelgesang, 2005</xref>, pp. 837–839). Anger and guilt are two emotions frequently associated with violations of standards in the friendship experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0265407511431054">Seiter &amp; Bruschke, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0265407511431054">von Salisch &amp; Vogelgesang, 2005</xref>). Young adult friends experience more conflict and anger with friends than family members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0265407511431054">Benoit &amp; Benoit, 1987</xref>). Moreover, college students report the expectation of experiencing moderate to moderately high levels of guilt for committing a relational transgression against a friend (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0265407511431054">Seiter &amp; Bruschke, 2007</xref>). Young adults’ inability to manage such emotions effectively could result in dissatisfying or dissolved friendships, subsequently leading to increased loneliness and the loss of an important source of social support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0265407511431054">Owens, 2003</xref>). Hence, the manner in which young adult friends negotiate anger and guilt has important implications for their individual well-being and the quality and stability of their friendships.</p>
<p>The outcome of a relationship (e.g., dissolution) is partly determined by how emotion is communicated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0265407511431054">Gottman &amp; Levenson, 1992</xref>). Yet, very little research has examined the experience and expression of anger and guilt among young adult friends. Research does suggest that peers’ willingness to communicate emotion, and the manner in which they do so, is partially a function of their concern for the relationship (i.e., commitment to the relationship; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0265407511431054">Whitesell &amp; Harter, 1996</xref>). Moreover, relational factors, such as satisfaction, investment, and quality of alternative partners, have been linked to emotional experiences in personal relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0265407511431054">Bevan, 2008</xref>). Consequently, the current study uses the investment model to investigate how friends communicate anger and guilt to one another, specifically examining whether investment, satisfaction, alternative quality, and commitment associate with how individuals respond to emotions of anger and guilt in the context of young adult friendships. Moreover, we mirror previous research on the investment model by examining the mediating role of commitment in understanding communication behaviors among young adult friends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0265407511431054">Farinelli, Babin Gallagher, &amp; McEwan, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0265407511431054">McEwan, Farinelli, &amp; Babin Gallagher, 2007</xref>). To that end, the following sections review the arguments of the investment model and explain why the investment model constructs can inform our understanding of the experience and expression of anger and guilt among young adult friends.</p>
<sec id="section1-0265407511431054">
<title>The investment model</title>
<p>The investment model is derived from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0265407511431054">Thibaut and Kelley’s (1959)</xref> interdependence theory. According to interdependence theory, people are dependent on a relationship to the extent that their comparison level of alternatives is low, meaning they have “few attractive options outside their relationship” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0265407511431054">Rusbult &amp; Buunk, 1993</xref>, p. 180). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0265407511431054">Rusbult and Buunk (1993)</xref>, “the investment model extends interdependence claims in part by asserting that the state of dependence is subjectively represented and experienced as feelings of commitment,” or “feelings of attachment” and “desire to maintain a relationship” (p. 180). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0265407511431054">Rusbult and Buunk (1993)</xref> argue that satisfaction and alternative quality alone are insufficient to fully explain feelings of commitment to a relationship. Instead, one must also consider what is termed investment size. Investments are the “ways in which individuals become bound to their relationships” through resources invested in the relationship (e.g., time) as well as resources that would be lost as a result of relationship termination (e.g., shared social network) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0265407511431054">Rusbult &amp; Buunk, 1993</xref>, p. 184). In an investment model framework, one’s commitment to a relationship is dictated by a combination of varying levels of satisfaction, alternative quality, and investment. Specifically, a person’s commitment grows in cases where his/her investment size and satisfaction are high, and his/her alternative quality is low (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0265407511431054">Rusbult &amp; Buunk, 1993</xref>). Nonetheless, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0265407511431054">Le and Agnew (2003)</xref> argued that commitment can be experienced even when only some of the other constructs are present. Thus, if an individual is highly invested, he/she may remain in the relationship despite lacking satisfaction. Similarly, decreased commitment can result when only one element is present that bolsters commitment (e.g., high satisfaction, but low investment, and high quality of alternatives). Finally, commitment indicates whether or not an individual chooses to remain in a relationship (i.e., stay/leave behavior) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0265407511431054">Rusbult, 1983</xref>).</p>
<p>Perhaps the most important aspect of the investment model is the saliency of commitment. Specifically, the model dictates that commitment serves as mediator between the other investment model elements (i.e., investment, satisfaction, and quality of alternatives) and outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0265407511431054">Rusbult &amp; Buunk, 1993</xref>). The investment model has been used to understand commitment in friendships, whereby commitment is strengthened when one has high satisfaction and investment, and one’s relationship alternatives are not very appealing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0265407511431054">Rusbult, 1980b</xref>). However, the investment model has not yet been applied to the examination of emotional communication in friendships. The next section explains why the investment model is a useful framework from which to examine the experience and expression of anger and guilt among young adult friends.</p>

<title>Emotional communication and the investment model</title>
<p>As a whole, combinations of investment model components have been used for understanding relational dynamics, such as emotional experience and expression (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0265407511431054">Bevan, 2008</xref>). However, little is known about emotional communication in young adult friendships. Most central to the current study are the emotions of anger and guilt. More specifically, this study examines the extent to which investment model constructs can inform our understanding of the experience and expression of anger and guilt in young adult friendships.</p>
<sec id="section3-0265407511431054">
<title>Anger</title>
<p>As noted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0265407511431054">von Salisch and Vogelgesang (2005)</xref>, “anger is one of a number of typically aversive emotions that are often experienced in interpersonal relationships,” including friendships (p. 838). Anger, an emotion centering on a “sense of fairness and justice” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0265407511431054">Averill, 1982</xref>, p. 31), emerges when someone perceives that his/her own goals have been blocked or hindered by someone else (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0265407511431054">Shaver, Schwartz, Kirson, &amp; O’Connor, 1987</xref>). Given the propensity for conflict in young adult friendships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0265407511431054">Benoit &amp; Benoit, 1987</xref>), anger is likely a common experience for young adult friends.</p>
<p>The experience of anger in young adult friendships should be more likely in relationships characterized by high investment and less attractive alternatives. The more a person is invested in a relationship and the less attractive alternative options exist, the more a person becomes “bound to” a relational partner who can influence his/her ability to achieve goals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0265407511431054">Rusbult &amp; Buunk, 1993</xref>). Consequently, a person who is bound is likely to have a strong anger reaction when a relational partner blocks his/her goals because he/she is reliant on that partner for goal facilitation. Thus, friends who are more invested in their friendship and have less attractive alternatives may be more likely to experience anger in their friendship than those who are less invested in their friendship and those with more attractive alternatives. Moreover, the experience of anger should be more likely in friendships characterized by declining satisfaction. Indeed, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0265407511431054">Guerrero, Farinelli, and McEwan (2009)</xref> found an inverse relationship between anger experience and relational satisfaction. Considering the abovementioned ideas and the mediating role of commitment in the investment model, we pose the following hypotheses:<disp-quote>
<p>H<sub>1</sub>: The combination of investment model components associates with the frequency of experiences of anger among young adult friends.</p>
<p>H<sub>1a</sub>: Holding constant the other components of the investment model, an increase in investment and decrease in commitment, satisfaction, and alternative quality associates with an increase in the experience of anger among young adult friends.</p>
<p>H<sub>1b</sub>: Commitment mediates the relationship between (a) satisfaction, investment, alternative quality and (b) anger experiences among young adult friends.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Perhaps one of the most popular ways to think of anger is in terms of its aggressive action tendency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0265407511431054">Averill, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0265407511431054">Lazarus, 1991</xref>), although people choose to express anger in a variety of ways. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0265407511431054">Guerrero (1994)</xref> posited that beyond <italic>distributive aggression</italic>, which encapsulates “direct and threatening” behaviors, people employ indirect, non-aggressive, avoiding behaviors in response to anger, behaviors termed <italic>non-assertive denial</italic>. Further, individuals respond to anger in more indirect, destructive ways with <italic>passive aggression</italic> (e.g., silent treatment, fleeing a situation), or they utilize constructive behaviors, such as <italic>integrative assertion</italic>, which involves “expressing thoughts and feelings directly and honestly so that both partners’ rights are upheld” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0265407511431054">Guerrero, 1994</xref>, p. 127).</p>
<p>The utility of elements of the investment model in understanding responses to anger appears substantiated. Satisfaction is arguably linked to more constructive anger responses. In particular, satisfied people are more likely to use integrative and assertive behaviors when angry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0265407511431054">Guerrero, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0265407511431054">Guerrero et al., 2009</xref>) and avoid destructive responses, such as aggressive and passive aggressive acts and avoidance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0265407511431054">Canary, Spitzberg, &amp; Semic, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0265407511431054">Guerrero et al.. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0265407511431054">Teven, Martin, &amp; Neupauer, 1998</xref>). Moreover, people who are committed and perceive very few alternatives to the relationship are likely to use open, integrative behaviors when feeling violated rather than aggression or withdrawal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0265407511431054">Buunk &amp; Bakker, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0265407511431054">Guerrero &amp; Bachman, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0265407511431054">2010</xref>). In contrast, those with high-quality alternatives may use more destructive communication patterns, such as distributive, aggressive communication and passive aggression, when angry, “as they can exercise options outside the relationship if the discussion goes badly” or they don’t achieve what they hope for (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0265407511431054">Bevan, 2008</xref>, p. 17). Finally, those who are highly invested may use open, integrative communication patterns when feeling violated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0265407511431054">Guerrero &amp; Bachman, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0265407511431054">2010</xref>), but highly invested people have also been shown to use blame, criticism, and shouting during conflict episodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0265407511431054">McEwan et al., 2007</xref>). In light of the previously discussed research and the mediating role of commitment in the investment model:<disp-quote>
<p>H<sub>2</sub>: The combination of investment model components associates with the use of different types of responses to anger (integrative assertion, passive aggression, distributive aggression, and non-assertive denial) among young adult friends.</p>
<p>H<sub>2a</sub>: Holding constant the other components of the investment model, an increase in satisfaction and an increase in commitment associates with an increase in the use of integrative assertion among young adult friends.</p>
<p>H<sub>2b</sub>: Holding constant the other components of the investment model, an increase in commitment and an increase in satisfaction associates with a decrease in non-assertive denial among young adult friends.</p>
<p>H<sub>2c</sub>: Holding constant the other components of the investment model, an increase in quality of alternatives associates with a decrease in the use of integrative assertion and an increase in the use of distributive aggression and passive aggression among young adult friends.</p>
<p>R<sub>1</sub>: Holding constant the other components of the investment model, which responses to anger (integrative assertion, passive aggression, distributive aggression, and non-assertive denial) does investment size associate with among young adult friends?</p>
<p>H<sub>3</sub>: Commitment mediates the relationship between (a) satisfaction, investment, alternative quality and (b) responses to anger (integrative assertion, passive aggression, distributive aggression, and non-assertive denial) among young adult friends.</p>

<sec id="section4-0265407511431054">
<title>Guilt</title>
<p>Guilt, an emotion friends expect to experience with one another (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0265407511431054">Seiter &amp; Bruschke, 2007</xref>), arises from a violation of social or relational obligations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0265407511431054">Planalp, Hafen, &amp; Adkins, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0265407511431054">Vangelisti &amp; Sprague, 1998</xref>). Arguably, guilt initially serves to reduce anormative or negative behavior in the transgressor (e.g., not stealing from a store) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0265407511431054">Amodio, Devine, &amp; Harmon-Jones, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0265407511431054">Kugler &amp; Jones, 1992</xref>). A person <italic>may</italic> subsequently move to approach behavior (to make amends for a relational transgression) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0265407511431054">Amodio et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>A person may experience guilt in an <italic>impersonal</italic> or <italic>distant</italic> relationship simply because he or she has failed to meet an obligation or standard. However, those in close relationships feel guilt more often than those in less close relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0265407511431054">Baumeister, Stillwell, &amp; Heatherton, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0265407511431054">Vangelisti &amp; Sprague, 1998</xref>). Moreover, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0265407511431054">Horan and Dillow (2009)</xref>, who conducted a study on deception in romantic relationships, reported a positive relationship between a deceiver’s commitment to the relationship and his/her guilt experiences. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0265407511431054">Bevan (2008)</xref> reviewed a host of studies showing that people who are committed to a relationship and perceive that the relationship is threatened have strong emotional reactions (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0265407511431054">Aune &amp; Comstock, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0265407511431054">Bringle, Renner, Terry, &amp; Davis, 1983</xref>). Thus, although guilt in its most basic form may be experienced outside the confines of a close relationship, people report stronger guilt reactions in close relationships than in non-close ones. Perhaps a person has a stronger guilt reaction in a close, committed relationship than a non-close relationship because his/her violation of an obligation or standard in a close relationship has threatened a relationship that he/she is satisfied with, “bound to” through investment, and wishes to maintain. Friends who have high-quality alternatives may be less likely to feel guilt for their transgressions. That is, they would have the ability to find fulfillment outside the friendship, and thus would be less affected by their actions that could potentially end the friendship. Hence, friends may experience more guilt when they are satisfied, invested, and committed to their relationships and experience less guilt when their relational alternatives are high. Finally, the mediating role of commitment in the investment model must be considered when examining guilt experiences. Therefore:<disp-quote>
<p>H<sub>4</sub>: The combination of investment model components associates with the frequency of experiences of guilt among young adult friends.</p>
<p>H<sub>4a</sub>: Holding constant the other components of the investment model, an increase in satisfaction, investment, and commitment associates with an increase in the experience of guilt, whereas a decrease in quality of alternatives associates with an increase in the experience of guilt.</p>
<p>H<sub>4b</sub>: Commitment mediates the relationship between (a) satisfaction, investment, alternative quality and (b) the experience of guilt.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Similar to anger, the “self-conscious emotion” of guilt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0265407511431054">Lewis, 2000</xref>) can be expressed in a variety of ways. For example, apology, appeasement, and justification (making amends) are common guilt responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0265407511431054">Vangelisti &amp; Sprague, 1998</xref>), although guilty people may also blame (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0265407511431054">Guerrero, Andersen, &amp; Afifi, 2001</xref>) and/or “avoid those they have transgressed against” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0265407511431054">Planalp et al., 2000</xref>, p. 13). In addition, guilty people may also deny their feelings of guilt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0265407511431054">Lazarus, 1991</xref>). Clearly, guilt can be expressed in different ways, and such responses may be related to investment model constructs, as explained next.</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0265407511431054">Amodio et al. (2007)</xref> “suggest a dynamic function of guilt” (p. 525). In other words, a transgressor may <italic>first</italic> pull away from the person who was transgressed “in order to halt a transgression, survey the damage, and learn from mistakes” (p. 525). Although a transgressor may <italic>subsequently</italic> work to make up for the transgression in a “weak or distant” relationship simply because he/she has violated a personal or social standard, guilt reactions and reparatory behavior are more likely to occur in close relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0265407511431054">Baumeister et al., 1994</xref>). Hence, a committed, satisfied, and highly invested person may likely favor constructive guilt responses (i.e., apology and reparation) in order to maintain the relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0265407511431054">Vangelisti &amp; Sprague, 1998</xref>). Conversely, perceiving attractive relational alternatives, a person may be less concerned with making amends for a relational violation because better opportunities await him/her, and friendship dissolution might be of less concern. Instead, a person with attractive alternatives may use the responses noted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0265407511431054">Guerrero et al. (2001)</xref> of blame, avoidance, or denial when feeling guilt. Finally, one must consider the central claim of the investment model when examining expressions of guilt: commitment mediates the relationship between other investment model constructs and outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0265407511431054">Rusbult &amp; Buunk, 1993</xref>). Given the aforementioned discussion, it appears that investment model constructs may help inform our understanding of friends’ modes of guilt expression. Thus:<disp-quote>
<p>H<sub>5</sub>: The combination of investment model components associates with the use of different types of responses to guilt (apology-concession, explanations-justification, appeasement, and denial-withdrawal) among young adult friends.</p>
<p>H<sub>5a</sub>: Holding constant the other components of the investment model, an increase in satisfaction, investment, and commitment associates with an increase in the use of apology–concession, explanations–justification, and appeasement and a decrease in the use of denial–withdrawal.</p>

<title>Sample</title>
<p>One hundred seventy-nine undergraduates (Men = 53%, Women = 47%) participated in this study. Participants’ average age was 19 years (<italic>SD</italic> = 2.30). The mean reported friendship length was 73.07 months (<italic>SD</italic> = 57.92). One-hundred and thirty-eight participants reported on a same-sex friendship, 36 reported on a cross-sex friendship, and seven individuals failed to report the sex composition of their friendship. Thirty-four percent of participants reported living in the same city as their friend.</p>

<p>Modeled after <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0265407511431054">Guerrero, LaValley, and Farinelli (2008)</xref>, participants indicated on a seven-point scale the extent to which they experience annoyance, guilt, anger, frustration, self-reproach, and remorse in their friendship (1 = not at all, 7 = to a great extent). A principle components factor analysis with an orthogonal rotation revealed two factors. The anger-related emotions (anger, annoyance, and frustration) comprised a factor, and the guilt-related emotions (guilt, self-reproach, and remorse) comprised a factor. All items loaded at .60 or higher on their respective factor and no higher than .45 on the secondary factor. The reliabilities for the anger factor (α = .84, <italic>M</italic> = 2.51, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.24) and the guilt factor (α = .74, <italic>M</italic> = 1.81, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.01) were acceptable.</p>

<title>Emotional expression</title>
<p>Anger expression was measured using <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0265407511431054">Guerrero’s (1994)</xref> scale, which assesses four different types of anger expression. All scale items began with the following stem: “When I am angry with my friend I tend to…,” and responses were recorded with a seven-point scale (1 = strongly disagree, 7 = strongly agree). The four types of anger expression included integrative assertion (e.g., “try to patch things up”) (<italic>M</italic> = 5.28, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.07), distributive aggression (e.g., “threaten my friend”) (<italic>M</italic> = 2.37, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.06), passive aggression (e.g., “give cold and/or dirty looks”) (<italic>M</italic> = 2.75, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.27), and non-assertive denial (e.g., “denies feeling angry”) (<italic>M</italic> = 3.32, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.59). The reliability for each subscale was acceptable, α = .75, .80, .70, .82, respectively.</p>
<p>To measure guilt expression, we adapted <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0265407511431054">Guerrero et al.’s (2008)</xref> guilt scale to apply to friendships. Participants were asked to “think about the times you felt guilty about something you said, did, or did not do in your friendship” when responding to the scale items. Participant responses were recorded with a seven-point scale (1 = strongly disagree, 7 = strongly agree). The scale measured four responses to guilt: apology–concession (e.g., “say I’m sorry”) (<italic>M</italic> = 5.40, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.28), explanations–justifications (e.g., “tell my friend the reason(s) I did what I did”) (<italic>M</italic> = 4.14, <italic>SD</italic> =.91), appeasement (e.g., “do extra things for my friend”) (<italic>M</italic> = 3.75, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.30), and denial–withdrawal (e.g., “deny responsibility”) (<italic>M</italic> = 2.72, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.14). The reliabilities for each subscale were acceptable, α = .84, .74, .77, .76, respectively.</p>

<p>The investment model scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0265407511431054">Rusbult, Martz, &amp; Agnew, 1998</xref>) was used to measure satisfaction (e.g., “I feel satisfied with our friendship”) (<italic>M</italic> = 5.89, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.24), investment (e.g., “I feel very involved in our friendship—like I have put a great deal into it”) (<italic>M</italic> = 5.40, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.23), alternative quality (e.g., “My alternatives are attractive to me”) (<italic>M</italic> = 4.63, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.31), and commitment (e.g., “I want our friendship to last for a very long time”) (<italic>M</italic> = 5.95, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.01).

<title>Results</title>
<p>Prior to conducting the main analyses, we ran a series of <italic>t-</italic>tests to determine if there were any significant differences in the variables of interest among individuals who reported on a same-sex friendship versus individuals who reported on a cross-sex friendship. The results of the <italic>t</italic>-tests indicated that the two groups differed significantly on three of the 14 variables examined in this study. Specifically, individuals who reported on a cross-sex friendship (<italic>M</italic> = 2.12, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.15) reported experiencing more guilt than individuals who reported on a same-sex friendship (<italic>M</italic> = 1.73, <italic>SD</italic> = .96), <italic>t</italic> (167) = 2.10, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05. Similarly, individuals who reported on a cross-sex friendship reported using apology–concessions (<italic>M</italic> = 5.81, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.15) and excuses (<italic>M</italic> = 4.42, <italic>SD</italic> = .80) to express guilt more than individuals who reported on a same-sex friendship (<italic>M</italic> = 5.31, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.28 and <italic>M</italic> = 4.09, <italic>SD</italic> = .91, respectively), <italic>t</italic> (171) = 2.14, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05; <italic>t</italic> (171) = 1.99, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, respectively. Significant differences did not emerge as a function of friendship sex composition for (a) the investment model components of investment, <italic>t</italic> (171) = .60, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .05, satisfaction, <italic>t</italic> (170) = .71, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .05, alternative quality, <italic>t</italic> (172) = 1.77, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .05, and commitment, <italic>t</italic> (170) =.76, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .05, (b) the experience of anger, <italic>t</italic> (170) = .05, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .05, (c) the expression of anger using integrative assertion, <italic>t</italic> (171) = .09, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .05, non-assertive denial, <italic>t</italic> (172) = .10, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .05, passive aggression, <italic>t</italic> (172) = .36, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .05, and distributive aggression, <italic>t</italic> (170) = .71, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .05, and (d) finally the expression of guilt using appeasement, <italic>t</italic> (172) = 1.21, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .05 and denial–withdrawal, <italic>t</italic> (171) = .66, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .05.</p>
<p>To test the hypotheses, a series of multiple regression models were estimated using blocked entry of predictors. Because the <italic>t</italic>-tests reported above revealed significant differences in apology–concessions, excuses, and guilt experience as a function of friendship sex composition, friendship sex composition was dummy coded (i.e., same-sex friendships served as the reference group) and entered in the first block of those analyses (i.e., Model 1) as a control variable, and the investment model components of investment, satisfaction, alternative quality, and commitment were entered in the second block (i.e., Model 2). Furthermore, all mediation tests reported in this study followed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0265407511431054">Baron and Kenny’s (1986)</xref> method for testing mediation and were followed up with Sobel tests to determine whether an observed mediation effect was statistically significant.

Hypothesis 2<sub>a</sub> predicted that an increase in satisfaction and an increase in commitment would associate with an increase in the use of integrative assertion among young adult friends. The data were consistent with Hypothesis 2<sub>a</sub> for commitment and integrative assertion only. The data revealed support for Hypothesis 2<sub>b</sub> such that an increase in commitment associated with a decrease in non-assertive denial. No support was found for the association between increased satisfaction and decreased non-assertive denial. Also, no support was found for Hypothesis 2<sub>c</sub>. Contrary to our prediction, an increase in alternative quality was associated with an increase in the use of integrative assertion, and an increase in quality of alternatives did not associate with an increased use of distributive aggression or passive aggression. Complete statistical information for Hypotheses 2<sub>a–c</sub> is presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0265407511431054">Table 3</xref>. Finally, Research Question 1 asked, when holding constant all other investment model components, whether investment size associates with any of the four responses to anger. The results revealed that investment size did not demonstrate a significant association with non-assertive denial, integrative assertion, or passive aggression, but investment size did demonstrate a significant association with distributive aggression. Suppression appeared to be operating for the association between investment and distributive aggression. Specifically, the bivariate correlation between these two variables was non-significant. However, when investment was entered alongside the other investment model components in the multiple regression analyses, investment demonstrated a significant, positive association with distributive aggression.</p>
<p>Hypothesis 3 predicted that commitment would mediate the relationship between (a) satisfaction, investment, alternative quality and (b) the four types of responses to anger. Partial support was found for Hypothesis 3.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study examined the utility of the investment model in understanding the experience and expression of anger and guilt in young adult friendships and provided a test of the investment model in a relationship context with little attention paid by investment model scholars in the past (i.e., friendship). Generally, the results provide support for many of the hypotheses tested and contribute to our understanding of the experience and expression of anger and guilt in the friendship relationship. For example, as predicted, elements of the investment model accounted for significant variance in friends’ anger and guilt experiences and all four types of anger expression examined in this study. Moreover, the results provide some evidence for the central argument posited by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0265407511431054">Rusbult (1980a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0265407511431054">1983)</xref> that commitment mediates the relationship between the other three investment model constructs and important relational outcomes. These results, as well as their implications for our understanding of the friendship experience, are discussed next.</p>
<sec id="section18-0265407511431054">
<title>Experience of anger and guilt among young adult friends</title>
<p>To begin, the results of this study showed that the investment model constructs can inform our understanding of friends’ experience of anger and guilt. Firstly, the combined effect of satisfaction, commitment, investment, and alternative quality accounted for 18% of the variance in friends’ anger experience. Furthermore, three of the four investment model components demonstrated significant, unique associations with friends’ anger experiences. As predicted, friends’ anger experiences were negatively related to commitment and satisfaction and positively related to investment size; alternative quality did not demonstrate a significant, unique association with friends’ experience of anger. Secondly, the combined effect of satisfaction, commitment, investment, and alternative quality accounted for 13% of the variance in friends’ guilt experience (after controlling for friendship sex composition); however, commitment was the only variable that demonstrated a significant, unique association with friends’ guilt experience.</p>
<p>Prior to this investigation, previous research had not examined the connection between investment model constructs and anger and guilt experience in friendships, but many of the findings of this study complement those of previous research examining the connections between one or more investment model constructs and the experience of emotions in other relationship domains. For example, similar to our findings on friendship, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0265407511431054">Guerrero et al. (2009)</xref> reported an inverse relationship between anger experience and relational satisfaction in marital relationships. Moreover, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0265407511431054">Bevan (2008)</xref> reported inverse relationships between (a) the experience of jealousy in dating relationships and (b) relational satisfaction and commitment, and a positive relationship between (a) jealousy experience and (b) investment; these findings match our findings regarding anger experience in friendships. Despite examining different relationship contexts and different emotional experiences, similar findings across these studies provide evidence that investment model constructs can inform our understanding of emotional experiences across a variety of relationship contexts and emotions.</p>
<p>Although the findings of the current study complement those of previous research and provide evidence that the investment model can inform our understanding of the experience of anger and guilt among young adult friends, our findings regarding guilt do not entirely support our predictions. Specifically, we predicted that commitment would be positively related to the experience of guilt in friendships. In other words, in line with the investment model, we expected that the more committed a person was to his or her friendship, the greater likelihood that he or she would experience guilt over violating an obligation. Instead, our findings demonstrated that the more committed a person was to his or her friendship, the less likely he or she was to experience guilt. This finding was peculiar and contradicted previous research, which found that commitment was positively related to individuals’ feelings of guilt after deceiving a romantic partner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0265407511431054">Horan &amp; Dillow, 2009</xref>). This contradiction between studies might be due to the fact that the current study did not assess guilt experiences that followed a specific relational transgression, but instead assessed the extent to which individuals generally experienced guilt in their friendships. In other words, the contradiction in findings could indicate that the nature of the connection between a person’s commitment to a relationship and the extent to which they experience guilt is contingent on the circumstances in which the guilt is assessed (i.e., following a specific relational transgression versus obtaining a global measure of guilt experience in a relationship).</p>
<p>The findings of this study regarding the experience of anger and guilt among young adult friends extend the application of the investment model to the experience of emotion in friendship. Moreover, they underscore the important interconnections between how friends perceive the quality of their relationship and the frequency in which they experience the emotions of anger and guilt. The next section focuses on the extent to which investment model constructs inform our understanding of the strategies that young adult friends use to express anger and guilt.</p>

<title>Expression of anger and guilt among young adult friends</title>
<p>In addition to examining the frequency in which friends experience anger and guilt, this study also examined how friends express these emotions. More specifically, we focused on the relationships between investment model constructs and friends’ use of four types of anger expression (i.e., integrative assertion, passive aggression, distributive aggression, and non-assertive denial) and four types of guilt expression (i.e., apology–concession, excuses–justifications, appeasement, and denial–withdrawal). Generally speaking, the data demonstrated that the investment model components accounted for a significant amount of variance in friends’ use of all four types of anger expression and only one of the four types of guilt expression (i.e., denial–withdrawal). Furthermore, in some instances, certain investment model components demonstrated significant, unique associations with specific types of anger and guilt expression. These findings are discussed next.</p>
<p>To begin, the investment model variables explained between 4% and 10% of the variance in friends’ use of the four types of anger expression examined in this study. Moreover, the results demonstrated that unique relationships existed between specific investment model components and friends’ use of different types of anger expression. In the current study, commitment was positively related to friends’ use of integrative assertion and was negatively related to non-assertive denial, passive aggression, and distributive aggression among friends. The findings regarding commitment are consistent with previous research. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0265407511431054">Bevan (2008)</xref> reported that more committed romantic partners engaged in more constructive and less destructive responses to jealousy. Moreover, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0265407511431054">Buunk and Bakker (1997)</xref> found that when romantic partners were committed to a relationship, they responded to a violation “with understanding and open communication aimed at preserving the relationship” (p. 394). Taken together, these studies suggest that commitment serves pro-social functions in different types of relationships. Perhaps due to their desire to remain in the relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0265407511431054">Rusbult &amp; Buunk, 1993</xref>), committed friends are more likely to express anger using constructive versus destructive strategies.</p>
<p>Other than commitment, there were only two other instances in which investment model components accounted for unique variance in any of the four responses to anger. The <italic>first</italic> instance involves alternative quality. The investment model suggests that those with better quality alternatives to a given relationship should be less motivated to behave in ways that promote relationship maintenance, such as responding to anger constructively, because they can seek out better alternatives to the relationship when faced with relational costs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0265407511431054">Rusbult &amp; Buunk, 1993</xref>). However, the data demonstrated that the more quality alternatives friends perceived, the more likely they were to use integrative assertion to express anger; alternative quality was not significantly related to the less constructive anger strategies (i.e., distributive aggression, passive aggression, non-assertive denial). Individuals who believe they have high-quality alternatives to their friendship might believe that their friend also has high-quality alternatives; therefore, these individuals might be motivated to use constructive anger responses to reduce their partners’ likelihood of seeking out those alternatives and to protect their friendship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0265407511431054">Bevan, 2008</xref>). Alternatively, highly sociable individuals who can make friends easily likely have a pro-relationship orientation that, in turn, motivates them to use more constructive strategies in response to anger, despite having high-quality alternatives to their friendships. The <italic>second</italic> instance in which investment model components accounted for unique variance in anger expression involves investment size. Despite demonstrating a near-zero bivariate correlation with distributive aggression, investment size demonstrated a significant association with distributive aggression when entered into the regression model with the other investment model components. This finding suggests that suppression might be operating in this case. In other words, investment appears to have no direct influence on friends’ use of distributive aggression, but it indirectly contributes to the amount of variance accounted for in distributive aggression by “suppressing” some variance in the other investment model components that is irrelevant in understanding distributive aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0265407511431054">Cohen, Cohen, West, &amp; Aiken, 2003</xref>). This finding suggests that for young adult friends, investment is only useful for accounting for variance in distributive aggression in conjunction with the other investment model components. Similarly, the lack of significant relationships between investment size and the other three types of anger expression (as well as three of the four types of guilt expression, which are discussed next) provides additional evidence that although investment contributes to the overall understanding of friends’ use of different types of anger expression, investment may not play as central of a role as the investment model might suggest in explaining young adult friends’ anger expression. With that said, since this study represents the first to examine the association between investment and young adult friends’ expression of anger, theoretical conclusions should be interpreted with caution until future research can replicate these findings.</p>
<p>In contrast to our findings for anger expression, the data demonstrated little support for the ability of the investment model constructs to inform our understanding of friends’ guilt expression. Specifically, on the bivariate level, only three of the 16 relationships examined between the investment model components and the four types of guilt expression were significant. Moreover, of the four types of guilt responses examined in this study, only one of the regression models was significant. The investment model variables accounted for approximately 7% of the variance in friends’ use of denial–withdrawal, with commitment demonstrating the only significant, unique association with denial–withdrawal and accounting for the majority of the variance in friends’ use of denial–withdrawal. As expected, commitment was negatively related to friends’ use of denial–withdrawal. Overall, the lack of significant findings connecting friends’ expression of guilt to the investment model components is discouraging. Furthermore, the findings are difficult to interpret given the lack of previous research that has examined the investment model components and expressions of guilt in the friendship relationship, as well as other relationship contexts. Consequently, future research is needed to understand more clearly the factors that influence the manner in which friends express guilt.</p>

<title>Commitment’s mediating role in the investment model</title>
<p>In addition to examining the relationships between the investment model constructs and friends’ experience and expression of anger and guilt, this study sought out to test the claim of the investment model that commitment mediates the relationship between the other investment model constructs and relational outcomes. The results of this study provide substantial support for commitment’s mediating role. All six of the tests that met <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0265407511431054">Baron and Kenny’s (1986)</xref> criteria for testing mediation demonstrated that commitment either partially or fully mediated the relationships between the respective investment model component(s) and the emotional outcomes examined. Specifically, commitment partially mediated the relationship between satisfaction and anger experience, satisfaction and guilt experience, and satisfaction and passive aggression. Moreover, commitment fully mediated the relationship between investment and integrative assertion, satisfaction and integrative assertion, and satisfaction and distributive aggression. Consequently, the current study contributes to the larger body of literature by providing support for the central claim of the investment model (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0265407511431054">Le &amp; Agnew, 2003</xref>, for a review) and by expanding the purview of the investment model into new terrain: friends’ experience and expression of anger and guilt.</p>

<title>Limitations and directions for future research</title>
<p>This study contains strengths as evidenced above, but there are at least three limitations that are important to note. Firstly, conclusions drawn from this study are based on the experiences of individuals in intact friendships and likely do not extend to dissolved friendships. Furthermore, because participants were able to choose the friendship they reported on, there may have been a tendency for participants to select rewarding, as opposed to unrewarding, friendships. Therefore, the methodology may have limited the heterogeneity of friendships represented in this study and the variability in commitment levels reported by participants. Future research should cast a larger net and examine both intact and dissolved friendships to see whether the investment model functions differently. Secondly, emotions are generally ephemeral, fleeting experiences, and self-report methods can only capture participants’ memories of their emotional experiences and expression and not their actual emotional experiences. Although memories inform individuals’ future friendship decisions and communication choices and increase our understanding of emotional processes in friendships, future research should employ methods that would better enable the capture of actual emotional experiences. Finally, the results of this study only apply to the young adult friendships of college students, and they might not generalize to other friendships, such as friendships that individuals experience later in life. Consequently, future research should examine the emotional experiences across different relationship types to more fully understand how friends experience and express anger and guilt.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This study extends research on the investment model by showing that investment model constructs have important connections to emotion management. Specifically, the results of this study are valuable in providing insight into some of the connections between relational quality and the communication of anger and guilt among young adult friends. Given the importance of peer relationships during pivotal life transitions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0265407511431054">Fehr, 1996</xref>), we hope for future research to continue the examination of correlates of emotional experience and expression in such a salient bond in the lives of young people.</p>
