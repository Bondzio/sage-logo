<abstract>
<p>This study extends previous field experimental research on turnout by considering how institutional context moderates the effect of mobilization. Taking advantage of a setting in which some registrants are assigned to vote by mail, the authors find that a door-to-door mobilization campaign has a larger effect on the participation of those who vote at polling places than on registrants assigned to cast mail ballots, but only among individuals whose voting behavior is most likely to be shaped by extrinsic social rewards. The authors conclude that there may be payoff for election reform strategies that tap into voting’s social rewards.</p>

<p>Does the effectiveness of a get out the vote (GOTV) contact depend on the method by which a voter casts a ballot? This study investigates whether those who must vote by mail are more responsive to a door-to-door mobilization campaign than voters who live in traditional precincts with polling places. Following pioneering work by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1065912911421013">Gerber and Green (2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1065912911421013">Green and Gerber 2008</xref>), a series of field experiments has shown that the effectiveness of nonpartisan GOTV campaigns hinges on the medium of communication (telephone, mail, or door-to-door canvassing) as well as the message that is delivered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1065912911421013">Gerber and Green 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1065912911421013">Green, Gerber, and Nickerson 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1065912911421013">Gerber, Green, and Shachar 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1065912911421013">Nickerson 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1065912911421013">Gerber, Green, and Larimer 2008</xref>). These studies all treat institutional context as constant, however, by assuming that everyone votes the same way. State and local experiments with a variety of forms of convenience voting have resulted in over 30 percent of Americans casting their ballots outside of a precinct polling place—by mail, phone, fax, or computer—or ahead of Election Day at an early voting center (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1065912911421013">Gronke et al. 2008</xref>). In 2008, 42 percent of Californians voted by mail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1065912911421013">Bowen 2008</xref>). We do not know whether the forms of outreach that have been shown to be successful in reaching polling place voters have the same effect when individuals vote through alternative means. If they do not have the same effect, then campaigns may need to alter their strategies to mobilize non-polling-place voters.</p>
<p>Our research asks whether reforms in the process of voting affect how people respond to mobilization drives. To test for this interaction between treatment and context, we take advantage of a natural experiment that is conducted in every California election. First employed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1065912911421013">Kousser and Mullin (2007)</xref>, this research design compares voter behavior in traditional precincts to behavior in precincts that county registrars have assigned to vote entirely by mail. Because individuals do not self-select into a precinct type, voters in the two types of precincts are similar in their demographic characteristics and propensity to turn out. Consequently, this design allows comparison between similar types of voters taking part in the same election, who differ only in their method of voting. To gauge the effects of door-to-door canvassing, we layer a field experiment over this natural experiment, randomly assigning fifty traditional and fifty vote-by-mail precincts in San Diego County to be walked by paid GOTV canvassers in the days leading up to the November 2008 general election.</p>
<p>We use this hybrid of a randomized and a natural experiment to study whether the method of voting shapes the effectiveness of door-to-door GOTV campaigns. Vote-by-mail (VBM) advocates emphasize the ways in which mail balloting reduces the costs of voting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1065912911421013">Karp and Banducci 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1065912911421013">2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1065912911421013">Gronke et al. 2008</xref>). Yet along with reducing costs, VBM removes a potential benefit of voting by making the act less socially visible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1065912911421013">Funk 2010</xref>). Recent work demonstrates the importance of social accountability in boosting voter participation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1065912911421013">Gerber, Green, and Larimer 2008</xref>). If GOTV canvassing stimulates turnout, in part, by keying people into the social rewards of voting, it may be less effective in areas where people must cast ballots by mail. Predicting that social accountability will operate most strongly for medium-propensity voters who regularly (but not always) participate in elections, we apply <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1065912911421013">Arceneaux and Nickerson’s (2009b)</xref> theory of contingent mobilization to investigate whether an individual’s propensity to vote moderates the interaction between GOTV canvassing and voting method.</p>
<p>This study contributes to the burgeoning literature on the turnout effects of GOTV canvassing by highlighting the importance of institutional context. Removing voters from the traditional setting of an Election Day precinct-based polling place alters the set of costs and rewards associated with the act of voting, such that individuals respond differently to a stimulus designed to encourage turnout. Moreover, we find that some individuals are more affected by context than others are. Investigating how mobilization operates within the setting of VBM elections is essential to understanding how this voting reform may alter the composition of the electorate. Our findings also address a debate about the wisdom of moving to an all-VBM system. The success of election reforms depends on the presence of voter mobilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1065912911421013">Stein, Owens, and Leighley 2005</xref>). If VBM systems tend to depress turnout in high-stimulus elections, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1065912911421013">Kousser and Mullin (2007)</xref> find, then our evidence suggests that typical GOTV methods may not fully overcome the decrease in turnout—at least among individuals whose decision to vote is mostly motivated by attaining social rewards.</p>

<title>The Rewards of Voting</title>
<p>The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1065912911421013">Riker and Ordeshook (1968)</xref> calculus of voting model provides a useful starting point to consider the effect of VBM on turnout. In this model, Riker and Ordeshook conceptualize the voting decision as a function of four factors: the probability that one’s vote is decisive <italic>p</italic>, the material benefits one gains from their party winning <italic>B</italic>, the expressive benefits one receives from fulfilling one’s civic duty to vote <italic>D</italic>, and the costs that are associated with voting <italic>C</italic>. Riker and Ordeshook’s central prediction is that people vote when the benefits of voting—both material and expressive—outweigh the costs of voting:</p>

</disp-formula></p>
<p>Of course, since <italic>p</italic> is infinitesimally small in modern democratic elections, it is unlikely that material benefits play a large role in motivating people to vote. Instead, Riker and Ordeshook’s model implies that most people vote because the expressive value of voting captured by the <italic>D</italic> term outweighs the costs of voting.</p>
<p>Much of the literature dedicated to studying the effects of VBM on turnout focuses on the <italic>C</italic> term (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1065912911421013">Karp and Banducci 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1065912911421013">2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1065912911421013">Gronke et al. 2008</xref>). Proponents of VBM argue that it lowers the costs of voting, and therefore, if one holds the terms on the left side of the inequality constant, the introduction of VBM to an electoral system should increase turnout (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1065912911421013">Bradbury 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1065912911421013">Rosenfield 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1065912911421013">Davis 2005</xref>). In a mail-ballot election, registrants do not have to learn the location of their polling place or find a way to travel to it. They do not have to worry about parking, accessibility, or the safety of the neighborhood. Voters can fill out their ballots at any time of day or night, in the comfort of their living rooms, with ready access to information about candidates and ballot measures from campaign mailings, newspapers, and the Internet. The absentee voting process provides another way to enjoy these lower costs, but it requires the extra step of applying for an absentee ballot. Because mail voting seems to offer a more convenient way to cast a ballot, the expectation has been that it has a positive impact on voter participation.</p>
<p>Yet it is possible that the introduction of VBM would change the value of other terms in Riker and Ordeshook’s model. In particular, we suspect that VBM may have a direct effect on the <italic>D</italic> term. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1065912911421013">Gerber, Green, and Larimer (2008)</xref> argue that the <italic>D</italic> term can be decomposed into two components:</p>

</disp-formula></p>
<p>The intrinsic rewards of voting come from within the individual. They include the psychic benefit that one personally places on the act of voting. Some people gain a great deal of individual satisfaction from expressing their voice in democratic elections, while others see it as a necessary chore. With intrinsic rewards, the decision to vote is much like the decision to consume any private good: people vote because they gain personal enjoyment from doing so. Extrinsic rewards come from outside the individual, and include social pressure to conform to the norm that one should vote. With extrinsic rewards, the decision to vote involves a social calculation: people vote because they believe that others want them to vote and that their social standing is improved by doing what others want them to do. Taken together, this model is consistent with the theory of planned behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1065912911421013">Ajzen 1991</xref>), in which behavior is a function of people’s attitudes toward the behavior and their subjective estimates of social norms surrounding the behavior.</p>
<p>Using a clever experimental design, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1065912911421013">Gerber, Green, and Larimer (2008)</xref> demonstrate that extrinsic rewards play a dominant role in motivating voting relative to intrinsic rewards. The researchers randomly assigned registered voters in Michigan to receive a postcard encouraging them to vote. Some individuals received a standard GOTV mailer reminding them that voting is their civic duty and encouraging them to turn out on Election Day. Others received mailers informing them that whether one votes is in the public record, in addition to the standard encouragement to vote. These subjects also were told either that researchers would be checking to see if they voted or that a postcard listing whether they voted would be sent to their household or neighbors after the election. Subjects who received the traditional GOTV mailer were about 2 percentage points more likely to vote than subjects in the control group, reflecting the effect of intrinsic rewards (or at least the intrinsic rewards that could be experimentally manipulated). However, the public-records mailer was even more effective: those who were told that their neighbors would be informed about their voting behavior were 8 percentage points more likely to vote than subjects in the control group. This effect is twice the size of effects observed in typical door-to-door canvassing GOTV experiments (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1065912911421013">Green, Gerber, and Nickerson 2003</xref>). It also demonstrates the power that social pressure exerts on people’s decisions to vote and suggests that many people vote not only because they gain personal enjoyment from the act but also because they want to receive approbation for conforming to a social norm.</p>
<p>Viewed from a social psychological perspective, VBM removes social accountability from the voting decision. People vote in the solitude of their home. There are no poll workers or neighbors to see them at the polling place. In most cases, they get no sticker that announces to their coworkers, “I voted.” In short, VBM may reduce the extrinsic rewards people receive from going to a traditional polling place and casting a ballot, potentially counteracting reductions in the costs of voting. A recent study convincingly demonstrates that the removal of social incentives dampened the effectiveness of moving to a VBM system in Switzerland and may have even demobilized voters in small, tight-knit communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1065912911421013">Funk 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Moreover, the impersonal nature of mail ballot voting may also reduce the effectiveness of a GOTV message delivered in person. In traditional precincts, a GOTV campaign reminds people of the extrinsic social rewards that can be gained from voting. Although ballots are cast in secret, appearing at a polling place is a public act. In a campaign environment saturated with mass media appeals to vote for candidates and ballot initiatives, a personal visit on one’s doorstep can focus attention on the visibility of the turnout decision. The highly motivated citizens who opt to cast absentee ballots do not require extrinsic social rewards to stimulate their participation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1065912911421013">1</xref></sup> For the rest of the electorate, the method of voting could influence the effectiveness of a GOTV visit. Voters in traditional precincts can tell a canvasser that they plan to vote and then do so in front of their friends and neighbors, in essence doubling their extrinsic rewards. Because VBM voters have no opportunity to receive this direct social approbation, priming their attention to the <italic>D</italic> term in the calculus of voting, GOTV may have less impact on their turnout decisions. If this is true, the effect of a GOTV contact in VBM precincts, while positive, should be weaker than it is in traditional precincts.</p>

<title>Mobilization and Voting Propensity</title>
<p>In a recent study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1065912911421013">Arceneaux and Nickerson (2009b)</xref> propose that the effectiveness of mobilization varies by the individual’s baseline propensity to vote and the general level of interest that the electoral contest garners from the electorate. Arceneaux and Nickerson argue that in high-stimulus elections (e.g., presidential elections), GOTV canvassing has the largest effect on low-propensity voters—that is, individuals who tend not to vote—while having a minimal effect on high-propensity voters. After all, in a highly visible election, most high-propensity voters decide to vote early on, well before they are greeted by a GOTV canvasser. Many low-propensity voters, on the other hand, are likely to be on the cusp of voting, and the blandishment to vote delivered by a GOTV campaign is instrumental in nudging them to turn out. Medium-propensity voters are likely to fall in between the two extremes, exhibiting a smaller boost in turnout in response to a GOTV message in a high-stimulus election than low-propensity voters but a larger boost in turnout than high-propensity voters.</p>
<p>Here, we consider the theory of contingent mobilization in light of the social calculus of voting discussed in the previous section. Because high-propensity voters tend to cast a ballot under any circumstances, the impact of extrinsic social rewards would be difficult to observe in a high-stimulus election. On the flip side of the coin, low-propensity voters tend not to vote, which suggests that extrinsic rewards generally do not offer them much enticement to participate. If these individuals ever are moved to vote, it will be through direct mobilization, not subtle social pressure. Instead, it is among medium-propensity voters that we are most likely to observe the effects of extrinsic social rewards. Their intermittent records of voting suggest they may be sensitive to the context in which voting takes place. Unlike high-propensity voters who almost always cast ballots and low-propensity voters who have repeatedly ignored social pressure to participate in elections, medium-propensity voters pick and choose when to vote. We think that it is among these individuals that a social accountability mechanism (e.g., an in-person request to engage in the public act of voting) may have the greatest influence on the decision to turn out. By reminding individuals about the visibility of voting in a polling place, a GOTV campaign can prime attention to social accountability.</p>
<p>We summarize all of our expectations thus far as follows:</p>
<list id="list1-1065912911421013" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 1</italic>: Turnout should be marginally higher among registrants who are randomly assigned to receive a GOTV contact.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 2</italic>: The effect of the GOTV contact on turnout should be positive for both individuals assigned to VBM and those who can vote in a regular polling place, but it should be weaker in the VBM context.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 3</italic>: GOTV canvassing should have the largest effect on low-propensity voters, irrespective of voting method.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 4</italic>: GOTV canvassing should have no effect on high-propensity voters, irrespective of voting method.</p></list-item>

<sec id="section3-1065912911421013">
<title>Research Design</title>
<p>The use of mandatory mail balloting by California counties provides an opportunity to compare the effectiveness of a GOTV campaign at turning out individuals who have been assigned to vote using different methods—either they were required to VBM or they could choose between visiting a polling place and applying to cast a ballot by mail—while holding constant other features of the electoral context. In the same elections with the same top-of-the-ticket candidate choices, the same media advertisements, and the same grassroots campaign environments, some California voters are required to vote by a different method. By state law, county registrars may designate any precinct with fewer than 250 registered voters as a mandatory mail ballot precinct. Small precincts are most likely to exist in rural areas, but the complex overlapping boundaries of California’s many local jurisdictions and voting districts create small pockets of voters in urban and suburban communities as well. Registrars redraw precinct boundaries for every election, so it is possible for a household to be assigned a polling place for one election but not for the next. According to county election officials, the establishment of district boundaries is a purely administrative process, with the number of registered voters rather than the rate of anticipated turnout determining the decision.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1065912911421013">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>To compare the effects of a GOTV canvassing across voting methods, we randomly assigned both polling place and VBM precincts to be canvassed. Randomized field experiments have been used extensively in recent years to examine the effects of grassroots mobilization on voter turnout (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1065912911421013">Gerber and Green 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1065912911421013">Gerber, Green, and Nickerson 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1065912911421013">Green and Gerber 2008</xref>). These studies have a number of advantages over traditional observational studies of voter mobilization. Observational approaches measure the effects of voter mobilization after the fact by comparing the voting rates of individuals who were contacted by campaigns to the rates among those who were not. Because researchers cannot know for certain the selection process that caused individuals to receive contact, it is possible that any observable differences in voting rates between the contacted and uncontacted groups may be an artifact of the selection process and not the effect of campaign contact. For instance, voters may simply be more likely than nonvoters to be home and available to receive contact from campaigns. Including a bevy of control variables does not obviate this concern because in observational studies one can never be sure that all relevant covariates have been accounted for (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1065912911421013">Arceneaux, Gerber, and Green 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>In contrast, field experimental designs randomly assign whether citizens receive GOTV contact <italic>before</italic> the campaign begins. Random assignment furnishes unbiased causal effect estimates of the mobilization effort because it balances the treatment and control groups with respect to both observed and unobserved covariates.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1065912911421013">3</xref></sup> Every subject has an equal chance to be in the treatment or control group, so the distribution of subject attributes, such as voting propensity, will be identical (within sampling variability) for each group. Consequently, if the treatment were not administered, there should be no differences in voting rates between the treatment and control group after the study ends. If a statistically significant difference does exist, it can be attributed with confidence to the effect of the campaign intervention.</p>
<p>Before we randomized precincts, we excluded exceptionally small VBM precincts (those with fewer than seventy-five registered voters) and rural precincts located in the far eastern edge of San Diego because these were most likely to be located in remote areas, leaving us with 101 VBM precincts containing between seventy-five and three hundred registrants.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1065912911421013">4</xref></sup> We then matched these VBM precincts to geographically adjacent polling place precincts based on the percentage of the precinct designated as urban; the number of registrants in the precinct, creating a preference for traditional precincts containing fewer registrants; and six demographic characteristics: the percentages of the precinct population that are African American, Hispanic, Asian American, aged eighteen and younger, and aged sixty-five and older, and the percentage of households that are owner occupied.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1065912911421013">5</xref></sup> Because this set of covariates reduces the amount of unexplained variance in the voter turnout, matching precincts on these covariates improves the precision of treatment effect estimates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1065912911421013">Nickerson 2005</xref>). It also increases our confidence that any difference we observe in the effect of mobilization on polling place versus VBM precincts is in fact the result of the difference in the method of voting rather than any measurable difference in the characteristics of registrants living in these precincts. Because our matching procedure allows us to hold constant potentially important factors such as the age distribution of a precinct’s voters, their racial or ethnic background, and the precinct’s urban–rural composition, we can rule these out as explanations of any interaction between the mobilization treatment and the method of voting. Moreover, by matching VBM precincts with the most similar adjacent traditional precincts, we minimize the possibility that observed differences in treatment effects between the two types of precincts are simply a function of neighborhood dynamics.</p>
<p>Of course, matching does not inoculate our design against every conceivable confound, but we have a number of reasons to believe that selection into VBM and traditional precincts is not confounded with suitability to GOTV messages and, as such, our design can be treated as a quasi-experiment that features “as-if” random assignment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1065912911421013">Dunning 2008</xref>). VBM status is imposed on precincts based on the haphazard quirks of overlapping district lines, rather than a reflection of community choice. The redistricting process occurs before every election, so it is not the case that the communities in our study have habituated to a VBM system. We are careful to compare only districts that are geographically and demographically similar. Moreover, nesting a randomized field experiment within this quasi-experimental design further strengthens causal inference.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1065912911421013">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>Beginning with these 101 matched pairs of home precincts, we conducted a field experiment by randomly selecting 50 pairs to receive a nonpartisan GOTV canvassing contact. We also stratified the random assignment by geographic strata, distinguishing the most densely populated urban portion of San Diego County from the suburbs known as “East County,” to further minimize the variance in turnout explained by living in urban and suburban areas. We implemented our field experiment by contracting with a professional voter contact firm, the La Jolla Group. Bob Glaser, the group’s principal, has over twenty-five years of experience in San Diego campaigns and works consistently with a group of trained, professional precinct walkers. We provided Glaser with a list of the 50 randomly selected traditional precincts and 50 randomly selected VBM precincts, and he worked with another vendor to purchase lists of registered voters and precinct maps. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1065912911421013">Table 1</xref> shows the factorial design of our study, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1065912911421013">Figure 1</xref> shows the location of the 202 home precincts included in our study.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1065912911421013">7</xref></sup> We also provided voter contact scripts and postcards with GOTV messages that explained the voting process for the precinct and encouraged participation in the election.

<p>We strove to make the GOTV messages as similar as possible for both the VBM and traditional precincts, so that we can attribute the effects of the mobilization effort to the GOTV contact and not the particular message employed. These messages, of course, could not be identical for the two different methods of voting; the most important difference is the longer explanation required for the process of voting by mail.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1065912911421013">9</xref></sup> We printed these postcards ourselves on colored cardstock and provided them directly to the La Jolla Group, and Glaser trained his canvassers in the verbal scripts. We observed this training and watched him interact with canvassers at his office on numerous occasions, and we coordinated with him on all aspects of the GOTV campaign.</p>
<p>The La Jolla Group carried out this campaign in the nine days leading up to the November 4, 2008, general election, which in addition to the presidential election featured twelve statewide propositions in California, one countywide proposition in San Diego, and many local candidate and proposition contests. Our canvassers began their work on Saturday, October 25, and finished their final two precincts on Monday, November 3. They focused their efforts on weekend days, when more voters are home, walking twenty-eight of the VBM precincts and twenty-two of the traditional precincts on either a Saturday or a Sunday. Canvassers recorded the nature of their contact with each voter on a printout that included information on the voter’s precinct, home address, and voter identification number, allowing us to match this contact information with the county’s individual voter file. Using this information, we can determine whether a given voter personally talked with a canvasser, lived in the same household as someone who personally talked with the canvasser, merely had a postcard left on his or her doorstep, or lived at a residence that the canvasser could not access.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1065912911421013">10</xref></sup> Following standard practice (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1065912911421013">Green and Gerber 2008</xref>), we coded a subject as “contacted” if a canvasser successfully spoke to any member of the subject’s household.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1065912911421013">11</xref></sup> Using this definition, the contact rate was 13.75 percent in traditional treatment precincts and 13.86 percent in VBM treatment precincts.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1065912911421013">12</xref></sup> The small difference in contact rates between traditional and VBM precincts is not statistically significant, <italic>F</italic>(1, 99) = 0.001, <italic>p</italic> = .980, and further corroborates our confidence about the “as-if” randomness of the quasi-experimental component of our design. No subjects in the control group were contacted. Data for our dependent variable come from the voter file prepared by the San Diego County Registrar, an official record of the 2008 election.</p>

<title>The Effects of GOTV Canvassing</title>
<p>We model the effects of GOTV treatment and its interaction with VBM assignment using a linear probability model. The results are displayed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1065912911421013">Table 2</xref>. Columns 1 and 2 report the intent to treat (ITT) effects, which estimate the effect of random assignment—that is, those we <italic>intended</italic> to treat—on the probability of voting. In these models, GOTV treatment is coded as everyone assigned to the treatment precincts, regardless of whether they actually spoke with a canvasser face-to-face, received a postcard on their doorstep, or lived at a residence the canvasser could not reach. Columns 3 and 4 report the average treatment on treated (ATT) effects, which estimate the effect of actual face-to-face GOTV contact on the probability of voting. Because actual GOTV contact is not random and the sorts of people who are reachable by door-to-door canvassers have a higher baseline of voting, simply comparing the voting rates of contacted to uncontacted individuals would produce biased estimates of the ATT effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1065912911421013">Arceneaux, Gerber, and Green 2006</xref>). Consequently, we use random assignment as an instrument to estimate the effect of GOTV exposure. In these models, GOTV contact is coded as those households where canvassers spoke with someone in person. Because voters could be contacted by canvassers only via random assignment, it meets the exclusion restriction as well as the other assumptions underlying instrumental variables regression (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1065912911421013">Angrist, Imbens, and Rubin 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1065912911421013">Gerber and Green 2000</xref>). Finally, we cluster the standard errors by precinct to account for the precinct-level randomization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1065912911421013">Arceneaux and Nickerson 2009a</xref>).</p>

<p>We report the simple ITT model without covariates (save for an indicator for the randomization strata) in column 1. The coefficient for GOTV treatment shows the effect of random assignment on voter turnout in traditional polling place precincts. It represents an unbiased estimate of the <italic>overall</italic> effect of the canvassing campaigns and includes the effect of the face-to-face contact as well as the postcard given to voters at both contacted and noncontacted houses. In many ways, this quantity of interest tells us the real-world effect of door-to-door canvassing since most real-world political groups incorporate leafleting into their door-to-door canvassing operations. Voters living in traditional precincts that were assigned to be canvassed were 1.7 percentage points more likely to vote than voters in traditional precincts that were assigned to the control group (<italic>SE</italic> = 1.7). The interaction term between GOTV treatment and VBM assignment measures the degree to which the effect of GOTV on turnout differs between traditional and VBM precincts. The results show that, as predicted, the effect of GOTV canvassing was somewhat weaker in VBM precincts (interaction = −0.8 percentage points, <italic>SE</italic> = 2.9). None of these effects attain standard levels of statistical significance.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-1065912911421013">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>We can increase the statistical power of our analysis by adding covariates that affect the dependent variable. Because treatment was randomly assigned, adding covariates should not affect the treatment effect estimates but will improve the fit of the regression model and, thus, generate more precise estimates of the standard errors. We report the covariate-adjusted ITT effects in column 2 of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1065912911421013">Table 2</xref>. From the voter file, we include variables measuring subjects’ voting histories, age, and gender; we also account for major party registrants, new registrants (i.e., those who registered after the 2006 election), and permanent absentee voters. In addition, we include measures of precinct-level racial composition, calculated using GIS from U.S. census block-level data. Altogether, these covariates markedly improve the fit of the ITT model; the <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> goes from .001 in the without-covariates model to .21 in the with-covariates model. The more precisely estimated standard errors allow us to reject the null hypothesis with respect to the effect of GOTV canvassing in traditional precincts. As <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1065912911421013">Figure 2a</xref> shows, voters in treated traditional precincts were 1.9 percentage points more likely to vote than voters in traditional precincts that were not canvassed (<italic>SE</italic> = 0.7, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-1065912911421013">14</xref></sup> Voters living in treatment precincts located in VBM areas were only 0.4 percentage points more likely to vote than voters living in control VBM precincts (<italic>SE</italic> = 1.5, <italic>p</italic> = .797, two-tailed). Although this fits with our expectation, the standard error on the interaction term does not allow us to rule out chance as an explanation for the difference in ITT effects between traditional and VBM precincts (interaction = −1.5 percentage points, <italic>SE</italic> = 1.6, <italic>p</italic> = .174, one-tailed).</p>

</fig>
<p>The ATT effects reported in columns 3 and 4 mirror the ITT effects because the ATT effects are essentially the ITT effects divided by the contact rate in the treatment group. Given the standard definition of contact (i.e., the canvasser actually speaking with someone in the household), this quantity represents the effect of the door-to-door canvassing if we were to assume that the postcard had no effect on turnout. It is best to think of the ATT effects in this study as the upper bound of the effect of face-to-face contact.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-1065912911421013">15</xref></sup> Focusing on the covariate-adjusted model (column 4 and see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1065912911421013">Figure 2b</xref>), subjects living in traditional precincts who were exposed to the GOTV message were 13.5 percentage points more likely to vote (<italic>SE</italic> = 4.5, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). This effect is near the upper end of observed face-to-face GOTV effects, as measured by the ATT (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1065912911421013">Green and Gerber 2008</xref>), and is a testament to the quality of the canvassing operation. For VBM precincts, the ATT effect can be obtained by summing the treatment effect shown in the table’s first row with the interaction term in the third row. The effect is much smaller in VBM precincts (ATT = 2.5 percentage points, <italic>SE</italic> = 10.7, <italic>p</italic> = .818, two-tailed), but we cannot rule out chance as an explanation for the difference in ATT effects between traditional and VBM precincts (interaction = −11.0 percentage points, <italic>SE</italic> = 11.3, <italic>p</italic> = .165).</p>

<title>The Moderating Effects of Voting Propensity</title>
<p>Following the approach employed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1065912911421013">Arceneaux and Nickerson (2009b)</xref>, we estimate voting propensity using a factor analysis of all of the available covariates reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1065912911421013">Table 2</xref> (save for the strata indicator).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-1065912911421013">16</xref></sup> The resulting factor scores measure the latent voting propensity baseline and provide a sense of each subject’s underlying propensity to vote. We then placed subjects into low, medium, and high voting propensity categories based on percentiles. Low-propensity voters had factor scores below the thirty-third percentile, high-propensity voters had factor scores above the sixty-sixth percentile, and medium-propensity voters fell in between. We experimented with different cut points (e.g., placing the cut points at the twenty-fifth and seventy-fifth percentiles), and the results did not change (see the <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-1065912911421013">appendix</xref>).</p>
<p>The ITT effects are displayed by subgroups in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1065912911421013">Table 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1065912911421013">Figure 3</xref>. As we expected, GOTV canvassing had a strong positive effect on low-propensity voters, who were 5.5 percentage points more likely to turn out in traditional treatment precincts (<italic>SE</italic> = 2.6, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05), and there is no statistically significant difference in the ITT effects between traditional and VBM precincts (interaction = −2.0 percentage points, <italic>SE</italic> = 4.9). Also, as expected, GOTV had little effect on high-propensity voters in either traditional or VBM precincts. After all, 98 percent of high-propensity voters in the control group casted a ballot in the 2008 election.</p>

<p>In line with hypothesis 5, it is among medium-propensity voters that the expected interaction between GOTV treatment and VBM assignment materializes. Medium-propensity voters living in canvassed traditional polling place precincts were 3.1 percentage points more likely to vote than those living in control-group traditional precincts (<italic>SE</italic> = 1.2, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). In contrast, their counterparts in treated VBM precincts were actually less likely to turn out. Summing the estimates in the table’s first and third rows, the ITT effect is −1.1 percentage points, although we cannot rule out the null hypothesis that GOTV treatment had no effect among medium-propensity voters living in VBM areas (<italic>SE</italic> = 1.5, <italic>p</italic> = .485, two-tailed). The GOTV × VBM interaction term also allows us to rule out chance as an explanation for the difference in ITT effects between traditional and VBM precincts (interaction = −4.2 percentage points, <italic>SE</italic> = 1.9, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). Moreover, the three-way interaction among medium-propensity voter, GOTV treatment, and VBM assignment is statistically significant (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .05), indicating that we can reject the null hypothesis that medium-propensity voters do not behave differently than low- and high-propensity voters.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study offers important new evidence that the effectiveness of a GOTV campaign depends not only on the method and message of the campaign itself but also on the means by which voters cast their ballots. As election officials increasingly embrace mail and electronic voting, early in-person voting, and other alternative modes of balloting, it is essential that we understand how these innovations will affect political participation across different types of individuals and in different election contexts. Previous research has focused on how alternative voting systems can reduce the costs of casting a ballot by increasing voter convenience. Few studies have considered the potential benefits an individual receives from appearing at a polling place on Election Day, or how campaigns might adapt their strategies in response to an election reform. Using a hybrid research design that layers a randomized field experiment on top of a natural experiment, we show that traditional forms of campaign activity may prove less valuable in a context where individuals receive fewer social rewards from casting a ballot.</p>
<p>These findings, combined with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1065912911421013">Kousser and Mullin’s (2007)</xref> earlier result showing a negative turnout effect from VBM implementation, suggest that when evaluating an election reform, we must consider more than the time and convenience costs that the average individual faces when deciding whether to turn out. Contextual factors including campaign activity, the election’s salience, and the composition of the electorate have an important role in conditioning the impact of VBM systems. In high-salience elections, our evidence suggests that campaign activity can boost turnout among low-propensity voters in VBM systems in the same way it does in systems that use traditional polling places. However, for medium-propensity voters, GOTV messages may be less effective in VBM systems.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we expect that the type of voter for whom GOTV is effective in VBM systems varies by the salience of the election. For instance, in low-stimulus elections with low overall rates of participation, mail voting seems to boost turnout by reminding registrants that an election is taking place (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1065912911421013">Kousser and Mullin 2007</xref>). In an election that draws little participation, it is high-propensity voters who are on the cusp of turning out and the most receptive to GOTV messages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1065912911421013">Arceneaux and Nickerson 2009b</xref>). If high-propensity voters are mostly attuned to the intrinsic rewards of voting, GOTV campaigns should be just as effective among those voters in VBM systems as they have shown to be in traditional polling place systems. However, if a local election for a special district board or a narrow ballot question does not on its own excite the interest of a high-propensity voter, a canvassing campaign that reminds the individual about the social accountability of appearing at the polling place may well tip the balance toward the decision to turn out, while a GOTV campaign would be less persuasive in a VBM system without the social monitoring that a polling place provides.</p>
<p>On the whole, our results reveal the value of a richer approach to evaluating election reforms—one that takes seriously both the causal inferences that can be gleaned from a given research design and one that takes account of the complex social context in which American elections take place. Although election reformers seeking to boost political participation have focused their efforts on making voting more convenient, we suggest that there may be greater payoff for strategies that increase and tap into voting’s extrinsic social rewards.</p>

<p>We did so by obtaining a geographic shape file of precinct boundaries from the San Diego County Registrar prior to the election and overlaid it with a block map from the U.S. census. We then aggregated census block-level data up to precinct boundaries, distributing population from split blocks based on the proportion of the block’s geographic area that falls within a precinct. This allocation rule assumes that all components of a block’s population are distributed uniformly throughout the block. We also measured the proportion of a precinct’s geographic area that lay within an urbanized area. We used the genetic matching algorithm created by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1065912911421013">Diamond and Sekhon (2005)</xref> to find one-to-one matches (without replacement). Note that because we had access to the shape file only for larger consolidated precincts, we initially performed this matching on consolidated precincts but then conducted our field experiment on home precincts, which are smaller subunits. For the randomized experiment, we selected a home precinct from within each consolidated precinct to canvass. If a single home precinct contained the overwhelming majority of the consolidated precinct’s population, we selected it; otherwise, we randomly selected from the home precincts with more than one hundred registrants. In the few cases where all home precincts contained fewer than one hundred registrants, we selected the most populous precinct but also took into account population density. The method was consistent between mail and traditional precincts and does not affect the internal validity of the design. At worst, it increases imprecision in the treatment effect estimates and biases against observing statistically significant effects.</p>

<p>If we had more precincts with which to work, it would have been possible to strengthen our design even further by employing a regression discontinuity method in which we compare only people living on either side of the boundaries of VBM and traditional polling precincts.

<p>It is standard practice for door-to-door canvassing campaigns to leave behind postcards at homes where no one answers. Consequently, our study mimics a real-world door-to-door canvassing campaign. To isolate the independent effects of face-to-face contacts from the postcard, it would be necessary to randomly assign the distribution of postcards as well to compare the effectiveness of face-to-face contact and the postcard treatment. The limited number of VBM precincts prevented us from implementing this design.</p>

<p>This postcontact information demonstrates how difficult it can be to reach voters at their residences. Sometimes, an entire precinct was inaccessible. Five of the traditional precincts in our treatment group could not be reached, four because they were located entirely within gated communities and one because it consisted of residences on boats moored in the San Diego harbor. Four of our VBM precincts were unreachable, two because they were within gated communities and two because they were in restricted land on Native American reservations. We did not treat any of these voters, but we did leave all of them in the analysis. Because we randomly selected the treatment precincts, we can assume that an equal number of precincts in our control group also was inaccessible, both to our canvassers and to other campaigns. Leaving these precincts in our treatment groups, both VBM and traditional, keeps them parallel to our control groups in everything but method of voting.</p>

<p>Coding all members of a household as contacted even if only one member of the household spoke with a canvasser allows us to meet the stable unit treatment value assumption, which holds that the outcome of one subject does not depend on the treatment of another (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1065912911421013">Angrist, Imbens, and Rubin 1996</xref>).

<p>f we step outside of the randomized experiment and assume that propensity score matching in the design phase and covariate adjustment in the regression model account for all of the relevant covariates that affect both assignment to VBM and the probability of voting (i.e., we meet the ignorability assumption), then the VBM coefficients in row 2 of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1065912911421013">Table 2</xref> estimate the causal effect of being assigned to vote by mail. Subjects living in these precincts were not canvassed by our GOTV campaign and, therefore, represent the natural experiment that plays out in California every election. Under the ignorability assumption, control group subjects living in VBM precincts were 0.4 percentage points more likely to vote than control-group subjects living in traditional precincts, a difference that is not statistically significant (<italic>SE</italic> = 1.3, <italic>p</italic> = .734). This result departs from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1065912911421013">Kousser and Mullin’s (2007)</xref> finding that VBM significantly depressed turnout in the 2000 and 2002 general elections statewide, but it is consistent with the findings for San Diego County in the earlier study.</p>

<p>As we noted in note 8, it is not possible to disentangle the effects of the postcard from face-to-face contact. Nonetheless, previous field experiments that do isolate the effects of leafleting from face-to-face contact show that face-to-face contact tends to have large effects on turnout (1 to 4 percentage points measured by the intent to treat [ITT]), while leafleting has relatively small effects on turnout (0.5 percentage points on average, as measured by the ITT; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1065912911421013">Green and Gerber 2008</xref>).
