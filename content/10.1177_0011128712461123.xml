<abstract>
<p>The crime of stalking has received much research attention, yet there are still important questions to be explored surrounding this behavior. One such question relates to definitions of stalking, including the requirement that victims must express fear to qualify as victims of stalking. The current study addresses this issue by exploring the “fear factor” among stalking victims. In particular, the authors examine the effects situational and victim characteristics have on the fear experienced by stalking victims. Furthermore, as stalking is a crime of repeated pursuit, precursors to fear are examined at two points during the stalking encounter: when the pursuit first began and as it progressed. The results revealed not only that certain situational and victim characteristics produced fear in victims but also that these influences differed across time periods.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Since the 1990s, stalking has been one of the most researched forms of victimization (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0011128712461123">Basile, Swahn, Chen, &amp; Saltzman, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0011128712461123">Bjerregaard, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0011128712461123">Björklund, Häkkänen-Nyholm, Sheridan, &amp; Roberts, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0011128712461123">Englebrecht &amp; Reyns, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0011128712461123">Fisher, Cullen, &amp; Turner, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0011128712461123">Fox, Gover, &amp; Kaukinen, 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0011128712461123">Mustaine &amp; Tewksbury, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0011128712461123">Nobles, Fox, Piquero, &amp; Piquero, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0011128712461123">Spitzberg &amp; Cupach, 2007</xref>). However, important questions related to the nature of stalking remain, especially pertaining to the inclusion of what has come to be known as the “fear standard” in defining stalking victimization. According to most definitions of stalking, victims must experience fear as a result of the stalker’s repeated pursuit behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0011128712461123">Fox, Nobles, &amp; Fisher, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0011128712461123">Tjaden, 2009</xref>). This criterion, which involves the victim’s emotional response to the offender’s actions, has created challenges not only within the criminal justice system (e.g., policing, prosecuting stalking) but also among researchers in examining the extent and nature of stalking.</p>
<p>To some degree, this is because fear is a complex concept. Indeed, the research community has not reached consensus regarding the best way to define or measure fear of crime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0011128712461123">Ferraro, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0011128712461123">Rader, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0011128712461123">Skogan, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0011128712461123">Warr, 1984</xref>). Furthermore, research suggests that it is important to explore fear as it pertains to specific types of crimes, as opposed to fear of crime generally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0011128712461123">Cook &amp; Fox, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0011128712461123">Fox, Nobles, &amp; Piquero, 2009b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0011128712461123">Wilcox Rountree, 1998</xref>). In other words, fear, and the experiences of fear, may be crime-specific. Measuring fear in the context of stalking creates an additional hurdle in that stalking is a crime of repeated victimization (i.e., the offender must contact the victim in some way at least two times). Therefore, the determinants of fear may be dynamic and changing over the course of time (i.e., over the course of the stalking incident). Finally, research has reported that correlates of fear may vary according to situational or victim characteristics (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0011128712461123">Dietz &amp; Martin, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0011128712461123">Keane, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0011128712461123">LaGrange &amp; Ferraro, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0011128712461123">Scott, 2003</xref>). Collectively, these issues highlight the need for research that explores the determinants of fear among stalking victims, as well as research that examines the influences of the inception and progression of fear among victims of stalking.</p>
<p>The current study makes several contributions to the stalking and fear of crime research literatures. First, we explore victim and situational characteristics that may contribute to feelings of fear among victims of stalking. Doing so potentially allows for comparisons with other studies to determine whether correlates of fear are indeed crime-specific. Furthermore, if it appears that victim characteristics play a role in victim fear, then suggestions to lower or eliminate the fear standard warrant additional attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0011128712461123">Dietz &amp; Martin, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0011128712461123">Ngo, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0011128712461123">Tjaden, Thoennes, &amp; Allison, 2000</xref>). Second, the effects of these influences are estimated at two points in time: when the stalking behaviors first began and as the stalking progressed. Once again, if the sources of fear vary from Time 1 to Time 2, then the question becomes, “At what point are victims required to be fearful for stalking to have taken place?” Third, although many stalking studies have examined small samples of limited generalizability, the data analyzed in the current study are nationally representative of adults in the United States.</p>

<title>Stalking</title>
<p>The crime of stalking involves “a course of conduct directed at a specific person that involves repeated visual or physical proximity, nonconsensual communication, or verbal, written or implied threats, or a combination thereof, that would cause a reasonable person fear” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0011128712461123">Tjaden &amp; Thoennes, 1998</xref>, p. 2). Although not a new phenomenon, stalking was first criminalized by the state of California in 1990, and has since been extensively studied. Past research has focused broadly on understanding the extent and nature of stalking, delving into issues such as the prevalence of stalking, definitional and measurement issues, criminal justice responses, risk factors and consequences for victims, and offender behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0011128712461123">Baum, Catalano, Rand, &amp; Rose, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0011128712461123">Englebrecht &amp; Reyns, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0011128712461123">Fisher et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0011128712461123">Fox et al., 2009a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0011128712461123">2009b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0011128712461123">Fox, Nobles, &amp; Akers, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0011128712461123">Jordan, Wilcox, &amp; Pritchard, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0011128712461123">Ngo, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0011128712461123">Nobles et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0011128712461123">Reyns &amp; Englebrecht, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0011128712461123">Spitzberg &amp; Cupach, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0011128712461123">Tjaden et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0011128712461123">Tjaden &amp; Thoennes, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>This body of research has consistently found that stalking is a widespread phenomenon, with recent estimates indicating that in the United States 1.4% of adults are stalked annually (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0011128712461123">Baum et al., 2009</xref>). Furthermore, in the first national study of stalking in the United States, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0011128712461123">Tjaden and Thoennes (1998)</xref> reported that 8% of females and 2% of males had experienced stalking at some point during their lives. However, these estimates were contingent on the victim experiencing a high level of fear. When these criteria were loosened to only require victims to have felt somewhat or a little frightened, the victimization estimates increased dramatically to 12% of women and 4% of men. This highlights the importance of understanding the nature of fear experienced by stalking victims, an issue that has significant implications for stalking researchers.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0011128712461123">1</xref></sup> The finding that stalking victimization is widespread has been reiterated in other national-level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0011128712461123">Basile et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0011128712461123">Fisher et al., 2002</xref>) and smaller-scale (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0011128712461123">Björklund et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0011128712461123">Mustaine &amp; Tewksbury, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0011128712461123">Nobles et al., 2009</xref>) studies of stalking victimization.</p>
<p>Although this research adds to the general understanding of prevalence, it is complicated by the lack of clear, accepted criteria for establishing the presence of stalking. This issue exists with respect to the fear standard previously discussed as well as for the nature of the contact between the stalker and victim, with research suggesting a relatively thin line between unwanted intrusive behaviors and stalking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0011128712461123">Fox, Nobles, &amp; Fisher, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0011128712461123">Thompson &amp; Dennison, 2008</xref>). This blurred distinction, including when a behavior crosses the line from bothersome to criminal, may also affect victim acknowledgment (i.e., when a victim labels the crime as stalking). Research has reported that victims may be more likely to label a crime as stalking when the scenario meets specific, “stereotypical,” criteria for a stalking victimization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0011128712461123">Cass, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0011128712461123">Englebrecht &amp; Reyns, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0011128712461123">Jordan et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0011128712461123">Ngo, 2012</xref>). For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0011128712461123">Englebrecht and Reyns (2011)</xref> reported that among men and women, certain types of stalker pursuit behaviors (e.g., spying, showing up, cyberstalking) positively influenced whether victims would acknowledge their victimization. Interestingly, other correlates of acknowledgment were unique to men, such as being attacked by the stalker, and women, such as losing time at work as a result of the stalking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0011128712461123">Englebrecht &amp; Reyns, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>With the Internet providing relatively new ways for individuals to be tracked and potentially stalked, the presence of cyberstalking adds to the complex nature of stalking victimization. Recent research has examined the crime of cyberstalking, which includes pursuit through electronic or online mediums (e.g., email, instant messages) as well as monitoring using compatible devices (e.g., global positioning systems, video cameras), but cyberstalking research is still comparatively scant, and more research is needed to better understand this emerging form of victimization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0011128712461123">Jerin &amp; Dolinsky, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0011128712461123">Parson-Pollard &amp; Moriarty, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0011128712461123">Reyns, Henson, &amp; Fisher, 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0011128712461123">2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0011128712461123">Sheridan &amp; Grant, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0011128712461123">Spence-Diehl, 2003</xref>). However, like its physically based counterpart, there is a lack of consistency in the research with respect to how cyberstalking is defined, and whether fear should be a criterion for cyberstalking (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0011128712461123">Reyns et al., 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>The stalking literature has also examined consequences of and responses to stalking victimization, including the impact of stalking on victims (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0011128712461123">Pathé &amp; Mullen, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0011128712461123">Westrup, Fremouw, Thompson, &amp; Lewis, 1999</xref>) and victim reporting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0011128712461123">Jordan et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0011128712461123">Reyns &amp; Englebrecht, 2010</xref>). Stalking victims may experience significant psychological distress, beyond fear, due to their victimization, including depression and a sense of helplessness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0011128712461123">Baum et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0011128712461123">Blaauw, Winkel, Arensman, Sheridan, &amp; Freeve, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0011128712461123">Morewitz, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0011128712461123">Pathé &amp; Mullen, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0011128712461123">Sheridan, Blaauw, &amp; Davies, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0011128712461123">Westrup et al., 1999</xref>). The impact of stalking on an individual’s psychological well-being, including the experience of depression, feelings of helplessness, and indeed fear, are likely influenced by the type of stalking behavior one experiences as well as characteristics of the victim (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0011128712461123">Johnson &amp; Kercher, 2009</xref>). Furthermore, scholarship has emerged on the reporting behaviors of stalking victims. Research has found that individuals who experience more serious types of stalking behavior, as well as fear due to the behavior, are more likely to report their victimization to the police (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0011128712461123">Jordan et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0011128712461123">Reyns &amp; Englebrecht, 2010</xref>).</p>

<title>Stalking and Fear</title>
<p>When creating the Model Anti-Stalking Code, the National Institute of Justice outlined the “fear element” of stalking, specifying that a victim must fear bodily injury or death due to the behavior of the offender. Qualifying this level of fear helped to distinguish felony-level stalking from other types of criminal, but arguably less serious behaviors (e.g., trespassing; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0011128712461123">National Institute of Justice, 1996</xref>). Although not all states have agreed-upon definitions of the behaviors that constitute stalking, including the categorization of stalking as a felony (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0011128712461123">Fox et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0011128712461123">Tjaden, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0011128712461123">Tjaden et al., 2000</xref>), most states and researchers studying this behavior agree that the crime of stalking must meet specific criteria, and many include the presence of fear by the victim. For example, many state statutes articulate that the behavior of stalking must occur repeatedly, the behavior must be unwanted, and the individual must experience fear as a consequence of the behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0011128712461123">Fox et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0011128712461123">Tjaden, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0011128712461123">Tjaden &amp; Thoennes, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>The inclusion of fear as a criterion for stalking also necessitates a brief discussion of the concept of fear itself. The fear of crime and victimization research literature has been divided as to how fear should be defined and measured. Over the years, fear has been conceptualized in several ways, including as an emotional response triggered by cognitive processes, as a feeling of anxiety or stress, and as a perception that one is at risk of victimization or feels unsafe (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0011128712461123">Ferraro &amp; LaGrange, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0011128712461123">Garofalo, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0011128712461123">Maxfield, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0011128712461123">Wilcox Rountree, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0011128712461123">Wilcox Rountree &amp; Land, 1996</xref>). A commonly referenced definition of fear of crime was provided by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0011128712461123">Ferraro (1995)</xref> who explained that fear is “an emotional response of dread or anxiety to crime or symbols that a person associates with crime” (p. 23). Generally speaking, stalking research has not reached a consensus on how best to define stalking or the fear standard, leading to inconsistencies across studies of stalking. In the current study, the operational definition of fear was based on a survey question that asked victims how they felt when the stalking behaviors started and as they progressed. Those who reported they were “frightened” were considered to have experienced fear.</p>
<p>The fear factor makes the crime of stalking somewhat unique. It requires that the victim experience a specific emotion, fear, to constitute a crime. Furthermore, stalking is often a crime that does not, in itself, involve direct violence to the victim, but the threat of violence, making it somewhat more difficult to “see.” Research suggests that victims’ definitions of stalking may not always match with legally defined criteria for stalking. In their analysis, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0011128712461123">Tjaden and colleagues (2000)</xref> explored fear among male and female stalking victims, using a sample from the National Violence Against Women Survey. They reported that approximately 6% of men and 12% of women who self-identified as stalking victims did not meet the legal criteria for being identified as stalking victims, mostly because they did not report feeling fearful or “fearful enough” due to the stalking incident (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0011128712461123">Dietz &amp; Martin, 2007</xref>). As a result, these authors questioned the utility of the fear component of stalking—that an individual must experience fear to meet legal criteria for stalking. Using vignettes with a sample of college students, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0011128712461123">Cass (2011)</xref> found that students’ definitions of stalking did not always match with legal definitions of stalking. Specifically, respondents focused more on the behavior of the stalking incident than on the expression of fear, suggesting that not all victims consider fear as an important indicator of stalking.</p>
<p>Research exploring the relationship between stalking victimization and fear has also found that race, age, and marital status may influence an individual’s likelihood of experiencing fear. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0011128712461123">Dietz and Martin (2007)</xref> found that young, White females were more likely to report being fearful than their counterparts, and women who were single were more likely to report being fearful due to stalking compared with those who were married or widowed. These differences have also been examined with respect to workplace victimization. For example, in their exploration of stalking in the student–faculty relationship, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0011128712461123">Winkleman and Winstead (2011)</xref> reported that female faculty members were more likely to report feelings of fear compared with male faculty members. Other studies have also found higher rates of reported fear by female stalking victims (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0011128712461123">Bjerregaard, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0011128712461123">Englebrecht &amp; Reyns, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Features specific to the stalking incident have also been shown to affect the likelihood of being fearful, including the frequency of the stalking behaviors, the relationship between the victim and offender, and the type of pursuit behaviors. For instance, research by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0011128712461123">Wilcox, Jordan, and Pritchard (2007)</xref> on fear of stalking among college students indicated that students were more fearful of being stalked by strangers, supporting the idea that the relationship between the victim and the offender may be an important predictor of fear. Conversely, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0011128712461123">Dietz and Martin (2007)</xref> found that women who experienced a great number of stalking incidents and women who were stalked by someone known to them were more likely to experience fear compared with women who experienced fewer stalking incidents or were stalked by a stranger. Furthermore, when exploring means of being stalked, these researchers found that being physically pursued (i.e., being followed) merited the most fear compared with women who were stalked by other methods. Research by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0011128712461123">Fox and colleagues (2009a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0011128712461123">2009b)</xref> focused on the time of day in which victims of various types of crime felt fearful. They reported that stalking victims were more likely to be afraid during the day, highlighting the potential influence of situational factors (such as time of day) in eliciting fear in victims.</p>
<p>The present study expands on the previously reviewed stalking literature by further exploring the dynamic nature of fear during the stalking encounter. Since by definition stalking victims are required to experience fear, the current study contributes to the stalking knowledge base by exploring the influences on fear at two different points during the stalking encounter. Precursors to fear are examined when the stalking behaviors first began and as the stalking incident progressed. In doing so, we consider the effects of situational characteristics of the incident and victim characteristics and responses as potential influences on fear. Previous research has suggested that not all victims who are pursued will experience fear, but no research to date has focused on the temporal component of fear and whether these influences change over the course of time. Given the abovementioned issues surrounding stalking definitions and measurement, such a study is long overdue and will provide valuable insights into the fear standard of stalking.</p>

<title>Data and Method</title>
<sec id="section6-0011128712461123">
<title>Data</title>
<p>The data utilized in the current study were collected in 2006 as a supplement to the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS). The NCVS is the most methodologically rigorous source for victimization data currently available, with annual surveys collecting information on a variety of types of victimization among adults in the United States. The Supplemental Victimization Survey (SVS) was a one-time addition to the NCVS that measured stalking among adults in the United States, as well as other important events related to stalking victimization, such as the response of the victim (e.g., victim reporting, consequences of the victimization). Although the full NCVS sample generally includes about 75,000 residents of the United States, the SVS was only administered to a subsample of this group and included 65,270 individuals, and had a response rate of 83%.</p>
<p>A subsample of NCVS respondents (<italic>n</italic> = 1,457) were categorized as stalking victims through a series of screening questions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0011128712461123">2</xref></sup> First, individuals were asked whether they were ever frightened, concerned, or angered by someone: making unwanted phone calls or leaving messages; sending unwanted letters, emails, or other forms of written communications; following or spying on them; waiting outside or inside for the respondent (e.g., home, work); showing up at places where the respondent would be with no legitimate reason to be there; leaving unwanted items (e.g., presents, flowers); or posting information or spreading rumors about the respondent. Next, because stalking is a crime of repeated pursuit, respondents were asked whether they ever experienced these behaviors on more than one occasion. Those that reported experiencing any of these behaviors more than once were identified as stalking victims.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0011128712461123">
<title>Dependent Variables</title>
<p>The current study focuses on two dependent variables related to fear among stalking victims: fear at onset and fear developed during the course of the offender’s pursuit. Feelings of fear were measured with two survey items in the NCVS. First, respondents were asked, “How did the behavior of [this person/these persons] make you feel when it <italic>first</italic> started?” Respondents were given a number of answer choices, such as <italic>anxious/concerned, annoyed/angry</italic>, and <italic>frightened</italic>,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0011128712461123">3</xref></sup> among others. Thus, those respondents who indicated they were frightened when the stalking behaviors first started were labeled as having fear at onset. Similarly, participants were also asked, “How did you feel as the behavior progressed?” Again, respondents were given the same answer choices (e.g., annoyed/angry, depressed, helpless), and those who indicated they felt frightened were designated as developing fear during the course of the stalking incident. As <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0011128712461123">Table 1</xref> illustrates, 28% of victims felt fear when the stalking behaviors began, and 15% were fearful as the stalking progressed.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0011128712461123">4</xref></sup></p>

<title>Independent Variables</title>
<p>Prior research indicates that situational factors as well as victim characteristics explain fear of crime and victimization. Accordingly, the current study considered characteristics of the stalking incident as well as victim characteristics and responses to victimization in explaining fear at onset of stalking and fear as the behaviors progressed.</p>
<sec id="section9-0011128712461123">
<title>Characteristics of the stalking incident</title>
<p>Five independent variables representing characteristics of the stalking incident were included in the analyses: (a) whether the offender’s pursuit was in physical proximity to the victim (i.e., physical pursuit), (b) whether the offender pursued the victim electronically or online (i.e., cyberpursuit), (c) whether the offender used electronic devices (e.g., cameras, listening devices) to track or monitor the victim, (d) the seriousness of the stalking behaviors (e.g., victim was attacked, threatened, intimidated), and (e) how often the offender contacted the victim. We hypothesize that each of these characteristics will increase the likelihood that victims will experience fear, regardless of when during the stalking incident that fear manifests itself.</p>
<p>The <italic>physical pursuit</italic> variable was created utilizing the following survey item: “Not including bill collectors, telephone solicitors, or other sales people, has anyone, male or female, <italic>ever</italic> frightened, concerned, angered, or annoyed you by . . . ?” Respondents were then given several choices, such as “making unwanted phone calls to you or leaving messages” and “following you or spying on you.” If respondents were followed or spied on, if their stalker showed up or waited around places for them, or if they received unwanted items, presents, or flowers, they were considered to be victims of physical pursuit. Therefore, a dichotomous measure was created indicating whether the victim experienced any or all of these behaviors (0 = <italic>no</italic>, 1 = <italic>yes</italic>).</p>
<p>The <italic>cyberpursuit</italic> variable measures whether stalking victims were pursued through online or electronic means. Respondents were asked, “During the last 12 months, did [this person/these people] use any of the following methods of Internet communication to harass or threaten you?” Participants indicated whether they experienced these behaviors through email, instant messenger, chat rooms, blogs, message or bulletin boards, or other Internet sites. If respondents had been pursued by any of these methods, they were coded as a victim of cyberpursuit (i.e., cyberstalking; 0 = <italic>no</italic>, 1 = <italic>yes</italic>). Similarly, respondents were considered victims of <italic>cybermonitoring</italic>, another form of cyberstalking, if their behaviors had been tracked or monitored by their stalker through video or digital cameras, computer programs, electronic listening devices or bugs, or global positioning systems. Respondents who experienced any or all of these behaviors were labeled as victims of cybermonitoring (0 = <italic>no</italic>, 1 = <italic>yes</italic>).</p>
<p>The <italic>seriousness</italic> of the stalking incident was measured by creating a composite measure of actions occurring in conjunction with the stalking behaviors. The seriousness variable represents a mean value of five different behaviors, including whether the stalker damaged, attempted to damage, or destroyed property; illegally entered or attempted to enter the victim’s home or car; attacked or attempted to attack the victim physically; threatened the victim; or attempted to intimidate the victim in some other way (e.g., attack or threaten to attack a pet). Reliability analysis for the seriousness measure produced a Cronbach’s alpha coefficient of .67, indicating acceptable internal consistency.</p>
<p>Finally, measures of the <italic>frequency</italic> of contact between the offender and the victim were constructed based on a single survey item: “In the last 12 months, about how often would you say the unwanted contacts or behavior occurred?” Six dichotomous variables (0 = <italic>no</italic>, 1 = <italic>yes</italic>) were created to measure frequency, including <italic>once or twice in a year, once or twice in a month, once or twice a week, almost every day, at least once a day</italic>, and <italic>sporadically/don’t know</italic>. The “once or twice yearly” frequency variable acted as the reference category in the multivariate analyses. We hypothesize that all of these variables will be positively related to fear. More specifically, those individuals who are physically pursued, pursued through electronic means, and those who experience more serious types of stalking behavior will be more likely to report feelings of fear. Finally, we hypothesize that the more frequent the behavior becomes, the more likely an individual will be to report feelings of fear.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0011128712461123">
<title>Victim characteristics and responses</title>
<p>Six additional independent variables measuring the victims’ characteristics and responses to the victimization were also included in the analyses: (a) whether the victim acknowledged the offender’s pursuit as stalking, (b) the relationship between the victim and the offender, (c) the victim’s age, (d) the victim’s sex, (e) the victim’s race (i.e., non-White or White), and (f) the victim’s marital status. The first of these, victimization acknowledgment, was measured with a single survey item: “Do you consider the series of unwanted contacts or harassing behavior you told me about to be stalking?” (0 = <italic>no</italic>, 1 = <italic>yes</italic>). We hypothesize that individuals who acknowledge their victimization will also be more likely to experience fear.</p>
<p>The relationship between the victim and offender was assessed by asking respondents, “What was the relationship of the persons who did this/these things to you when the contacts or behaviors first began?” Respondents were given several answer choices, which were dichotomized into a nonstranger/stranger variable (0 = <italic>nonstranger</italic>, 1 = <italic>stranger</italic>). The limited research on the relationship between fear of stalking behavior and the offender’s relationship to the victim is mixed. In the current study, we hypothesize that those who are pursued by someone known to them (a nonstranger) will be more likely to experience fear than individuals stalked by a stranger, similar to the findings in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0011128712461123">Dietz and Martin’s (2007)</xref> study.</p>
<p>Finally, victim characteristics including age, sex, race, and marital status were also included in the analyses. For these variables, age was measured in years, whereas sex (0 = <italic>male</italic>, 1 = <italic>female</italic>), race (0 = <italic>White</italic>, 1 = <italic>non-White</italic>), and marital status (0 = <italic>not married</italic>, 1 = <italic>married</italic>) were measured as dichotomous variables. Based on previous research, we hypothesize that individuals who are younger, female, White, and unmarried will be more likely to report feelings of fear. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0011128712461123">Table 1</xref> provides descriptive statistics for each of these variables.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0011128712461123">
<title>Analysis</title>
<p>Given the dichotomous nature of the dependent variables, binary logistic regression is an appropriate statistical technique for estimating relationships between situational and victim characteristics, and fear among stalking victims. Prior to modeling these relationships, the possibility of multicollinearity between the independent variables was explored. The resulting test produced acceptable tolerance and variance inflation factor statistics, indicating that multicollinearity is not a statistical threat to the results of the multivariate analyses.</p>

<title>Fear at Onset</title>
<p>As <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0011128712461123">Table 2</xref> illustrates, characteristics of the stalking incident and characteristics of the stalking victims influenced the likelihood that victims would experience feelings of fear when the stalking behaviors began. Regarding the former, only the seriousness of the incident exhibited statistically significant effects on the onset of fear. More serious incidents—those characterized by such elements as property damage, threats, or physical attacks—increased the victim’s likelihood of feeling fearful by over seven times in comparison with those experiencing less serious incidents of stalking.</p>

<p>With respect to victim characteristics, four statistically significant relationships with fear at onset were uncovered. All of these relationships were in the hypothesized direction. First, acknowledgment of victimization by the victim increased the odds that the victim would experience fear by nearly three times compared with unacknowledged victims. Second, the victim–offender relationship was also significantly related to fear. It was hypothesized that those stalked by someone known to them would be more likely to experience fear compared with those stalked by a stranger. Consistent with the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0011128712461123">Dietz and Martin (2007)</xref>, we found that those stalked by a nonstranger were more likely to report feelings of fear. Third, the sex of the victim was positively related to fear at onset. Specifically, and consistent with past research, females were more likely than males to be fearful, with female status increasing the likelihood of experiencing fear nearly four times. Fourth, victims who were married were significantly less likely to be afraid when the stalking behaviors began than were those who were not married.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0011128712461123">Table 2</xref> indicates some consistency in precursors of fear at onset and progressive fear of stalking, with situational and victim characteristics continuing to exhibit significant effects on fear. Among the situational variables, seriousness of the stalking incident was a strong indicator of progressive fear of stalking. Although the magnitude of the effect was reduced in comparison with fear at onset, seriousness nearly quadrupled the likelihood the victim would be afraid as the stalking behaviors progressed. Of the variables measuring victim characteristics, victim acknowledgment, the victim–offender relationship, and the victim’s sex significantly affected progressive fear. The relationship between victim acknowledgment and fear was positive, increasing the odds of fear by about two times. As was the case in the previous model, those stalked by strangers were less likely to experience fear as the stalking behaviors progressed. In addition, being a female increased one’s likelihood of progressive fear by approximately three times in comparison with males.</p>
<p>Significant antecedents to fear also differed in important ways across models. For instance, the victim’s marital status ceased to be a significant indicator of fear when estimating progressive fear, rather than onset of fear. In addition, the previously nonsignificant situational variable, cybermonitoring, produced an effect on progressive fear not present at onset. That is, victims who experienced cybermonitoring while being stalked were more than two times as likely to be afraid as the stalking progressed than were those who were not electronically monitored by their stalker. Finally, although nonsignificant in explaining fear at onset, one of the frequency variables—contacted once or twice monthly—exhibited a statistically significant negative influence on progressive fear. In other words, those who were contacted by their stalker one or two times a month were less likely to be fearful as the behaviors progressed.</p>

<title>Discussion and Conclusion</title>
<p>The purpose of the current study was to explore the situational and victim-based indicators (characteristics and responses) of stalking incidents that induced fear in victims. Furthermore, this study also assessed whether these factors varied at different points during the stalking incident (and if so, how). To the first point, it appears that situational and victim-centered factors provoked fear in stalking victims. Notably, the seriousness of the crime, the victim’s acknowledgment of stalking, and the victim’s sex (female) each increased the likelihood that the victim would experience fear, regardless of when during the encounter that fear was felt. The victim–offender relationship also consistently influenced feelings of fear, and those stalked by someone known to them were more likely to report feeling fearful than those stalked by a stranger. The correlates of fear also varied depending on whether the fear was experienced at the onset of stalking or as the stalking encounter progressed. At onset, victims who were married were significantly less likely to be afraid. As the stalking progressed, cybermonitoring and frequency of contact between stalker and victim became significant predictors of fear.</p>
<p>With a few exceptions, these variable effects were as expected. Theoretically, more seriousness encounters, such as those involving threats or physical attacks, would be more likely to make victims feel insecure, anxious, and indeed, fearful. Relatedly, individuals who acknowledge that they are crime victims may be more likely to consider their situation to be serious, with uncertain but significant consequences. In addition, consistent with much prior fear of crime research, females were more likely than males to be afraid during their stalking victimization. Similarly, the finding that married victims were less likely to be afraid is not surprising given that marital status brings with it, theoretically anyway, a permanent guardian. However, the measures of frequency of contact between the offender and victim did not perform as expected. We reasoned that more frequent contacts from one’s stalker would elicit a more fearful response. Yet, all the frequency variables performed opposite the anticipated direction. The one significant finding revealed that victims who were stalked once or twice a month were less likely to express fear compared with those stalked less frequently. Perhaps it is the experience of stalking, and to a lesser degree the frequency, that most affects levels of fear. However, the current analysis did not allow for the disentanglement of these variables (e.g., individuals who are stalked less frequently but in more serious ways). Future research should attempt to explore the relationship between seriousness as well as frequency and the effects on fear across stages of the stalking encounter.</p>
<p>The results of the current study also have implications for stalking research and policy. From a research perspective, it is not possible to gauge the extent and nature of stalking and identify patterns across studies absent consistency in how the fear factor is defined and operationalized. Earlier research has already revealed that the fear standard may lead to an undercounting of the crime of stalking. Indeed, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0011128712461123">Tjaden and Thoennes’s (1998)</xref> seminal stalking research revealed that the rigorousness of the fear standard drastically affected the estimated level of stalking among study participants. This study adds yet another dimension to the issue by suggesting that fear varies not only over time but also depending on the victim and the encounter. Thus, attention should also be paid to defining and measuring fear as it applies to stalking victimization, especially given the importance of the stalking label for victims.</p>
<p>The results of the current study also suggest directions for further research, especially related to the time frame of fear. More research is needed to determine how the fear factor changes over the course of the stalking incident. For instance, there may be important correlates of fear of stalking that were not included in these analyses, such as the offender’s characteristics (e.g., age, race, gender, number of offenders), or the features of the domain in which the stalking transpired (e.g., school, neighborhood, workplace). Furthermore, the time frame of fear may affect victim acknowledgment of stalking and reporting behaviors, two key victim-based decisions in the criminal justice process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0011128712461123">Englebrecht &amp; Reyns, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0011128712461123">Ngo, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0011128712461123">Reyns &amp; Englebrecht, 2010</xref>). For example, perhaps those who are afraid as the stalking behaviors progressed are more likely to acknowledge their victimization and therefore report it to the police compared with those who are only initially afraid of their stalker. The time frame itself may also be an important consideration. In this study, we were only able to estimate the extent and correlates of fear as the stalking behaviors started and as the incident progressed, but it is possible that different time referents would produce different results. Therefore, future research should consider different fear time frames and how the fear factor changes over time.</p>
<p>The results of the current study also have implications for policy and practice. If the indicators of fear vary by situational and victim characteristics, then the prerequisite that victims feel fearful before their experience is labeled stalking may need rethinking. We join other stalking researchers in questioning the validity of requiring a specific emotional response on the part of the victim to establish whether a crime has been committed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0011128712461123">Dietz &amp; Martin, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0011128712461123">Ngo, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0011128712461123">Tjaden et al., 2000</xref>). Labeling stalking in this manner (i.e., requiring victims to be fearful) could result in victims not receiving needed services or responses from the criminal justice system. Many victim services are subject to an individual being given the label of <italic>crime victim</italic>. Therefore, it is important to consider definitions of crime, including stalking victimization, as these definitions have important implications for how society and the individual view certain behaviors, as well as opportunities to get support after victimization.</p>
<p>Overall, this study highlights the ambiguity around the concept of fear as well as the different ways in which situational and victim characteristics can influence how one experiences a stalking victimization. Yet, some experiences do not qualify as victimization if the fear factor threshold is not met, even when the victim meets the other stalking criteria. Reconsidering the fear criterion to ensure that those harmed by others receive the support they need, regardless of their response to the behavior, may require lowering, altering, or eliminating the fear standard. At present, the question we raised earlier remains: “At what point are victims required to be fearful for stalking to have taken place?”</p>
