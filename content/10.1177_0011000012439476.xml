<abstract>
<p>Based on a transtheoretical definition of <italic>corrective experience</italic> (CE), the authors interviewed 25 adults who could identify a pivotal event or relationship they had experienced, at any point in their lifetime, as positively transformative. The narratives show that the CEs described by participants often had a negative precipitant or took place during a life transition. CEs involving other people tended to occur when an important relationship ended or was reflected upon in retrospect. Many participants had a new cognitive understanding while the CE was occurring as well as long afterward. Interestingly, the life-changing consequences of the CEs were similar to desired outcomes in psychotherapy: positive outlook, changed relationships, self-affirmation, and determination. Notably, the few individuals who had discussed the circumstances surrounding their specific CE with a therapist reported the importance of common change factors (support, validation, emotional release). Results are examined for their theoretical and practical implications.</p>

<body>
<p>As counseling psychologists, we have long been interested in building on individuals’ strengths and self-determination. We are aware that even in the absence of psychotherapy some people make momentous changes, often due to personal or mentoring relationships that help them transform their lives for the better. Moreover, we often hear clients tell stories about how they and their loved ones overcame addictions, trauma, loss, and environmental adversity without professional help. Yet what kinds of events and relationships stimulate transformative changes? How are these changes understood in the larger narrative of a person’s life?</p>
<p>These questions prompted the present qualitative study of transformative change in everyday life. Specifically, we explored the kinds of events or relationships that stimulated a nonclinical sample of adults to change aspects of their personality, behavior, thoughts, and/or feelings in a way they deemed not only positive but also pivotally transformative.</p>
<p>Our starting point was the transtheoretical definition of <italic>corrective experiences</italic> constructed and agreed upon by a group of more than 20 senior psychotherapy researchers at the 2007 Penn State Conference on Corrective Experiences: “Corrective experiences are those during which a person comes to understand or affectively experience an event or relationship in a different or unexpected way” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0011000012439476">Castonguay &amp; Hill, 2012</xref>). With this definition, the Penn State researchers expanded the psychoanalytic concept of <italic>corrective emotional experience</italic> to be broadly relevant to the study of psychotherapeutic processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0011000012439476">Castonguay &amp; Hill, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>The construct originated in the writings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0011000012439476">Alexander and French (1946)</xref>, who coined the term to refer to processes that result in a patient’s ability to discriminate—both emotionally and intellectually—early, unresolved conflicts from present-day situations and relationships. According to Alexander and French, to bring about a corrective emotional experience the analyst must re-expose the patient to the earlier emotion-charged situation but in a more positive interpersonal context by deliberately creating a relationship that contradicts the patient’s past traumatic experience. In contemporary psychoanalysis, however, the term <italic>corrective emotional experience</italic> has come to represent the client’s general experience within an affirming therapeutic relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0011000012439476">Knight, 2005</xref>), not the purposeful manipulation of the transference as originally described by Alexander and French.</p>
<p>We were intrigued by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0011000012439476">Alexander and French’s (1946)</xref> inclusion of non-therapy-based contexts as potentially “corrective.” According to these authors, self-healing can come about when a person corrects “patterns based upon past experience . . . to take adequate account of the differences between the present and the past” (p. 73). To illustrate their point, Alexander and French described the “conversion” of Jean Valjean in Alexandre Dumas’s 1862 classic book, <italic>Les Miserables</italic>, as a “dramatic change in his personality because of the overwhelming and unexpected kindness of the bishop whom he had tried to rob” (p. 68). The process of Valjean’s corrective transformation was described in eloquent detail by Dumas:
<disp-quote>
<p>He felt indistinctly that the priest’s forgiveness was the most formidable assault by which he had yet been shaken; that his hardening would be permanent if he resisted this clemency; that if he yielded he must renounce that hatred with which the actions of other men had filled his soul during so many years, and which pleased him: that this time he must either conquer or be vanquished; and that the struggle, a colossal and final struggle, had begun between his wickedness and that man’s goodness. One thing which he did not suspect is certain, however, that he was no longer the same man; all was changed in him, and it was no longer in his power to get rid of the fact that the bishop had spoken to him and taken his hand. (cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0011000012439476">Alexander &amp; French, 1946</xref>, pp. 68-69)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>We reasoned that if, indeed, people have these kinds of transformative experiences in life outside of psychotherapy, such experiences might well reflect the Penn State conference researchers’ broad definition of corrective experience (CE). In beginning this research project, we searched the literature widely for scholarship on transformative change and self-healing processes. The idea of transformative change in everyday life is not novel. Both <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0011000012439476">Carl Rogers (1957)</xref> and Abraham <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0011000012439476">Maslow (1971)</xref> postulated that self-actualizing tendencies are a core feature of behavior. More recent existentially oriented humanists have discussed transcendental change as a function of personal will (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0011000012439476">Polkinghorne, 2001</xref>). Moreover, many studies of resilience within the field of positive psychology have demonstrated the “self-righting” capacity of even very young children in the face of adversity (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0011000012439476">Masten, Best, &amp; Garmazy, 1990</xref>, p. 438).</p>
<p>Working in the addictions field, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0011000012439476">Miller (2004)</xref> noted that many people report “spiritual awakenings” that are akin to the “religious conversions” described by William James in 1902. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0011000012439476">James (1902/1994)</xref> described these conversions based on psychologist George Coe’s case studies of people who had experienced dramatic, transformative change. Despite this classic work, Miller found scant literature in modern psychology on transformative change, aside from writings by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0011000012439476">Maslow (1968)</xref> and other humanists on peak experiences.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0011000012439476">Miller and C’de Baca (1994)</xref>, intrigued by the phenomenon of what they called <italic>quantum change</italic> (QC), conducted extensive interviews with individuals who responded to a newspaper solicitation that gave two fictitious examples of a QC: Ebenezer Scrooge in <italic>A Christmas Carol</italic> and George Bailey in the film <italic>It’s a Wonderful Life</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0011000012439476">C’de Baca &amp; Wilbourne, 2004</xref>). Miller and C’de Baca’s respondents described their QC experience as “a vivid, surprising, benevolent, and enduring personal transformation” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0011000012439476">Bien, 2004</xref>, p. 493) that was both highly distinctive and permanent. Two kinds of quantum change were identified from the analysis of respondents’ interviews: insight and mystical transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0011000012439476">Miller, 2004</xref>). The insightful kinds of change are “awakenings [that] break upon the person with great and sudden force, and in the moment of seeing, the person recognizes them for authentic truth (or Truth)” (p. 457). By contrast, mystical transformations are akin to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0011000012439476">James’s (1902/1994)</xref> religious conversions, involving an altered state of consciousness and a keen sense of joy or awe. The benefits of QC experiences most frequently described by Miller and C’de Baca’s respondents included an abrupt shift in values or priorities, a sense of peace that replaced longstanding negative emotions, and deliberate changes in the kinds of social relationships that were sought out and maintained.</p>
<p>Follow-up interviews 10 years later with most of the original respondents showed that the previously described transformations remained vivid in participants’ minds, and the changes attributed to QC experiences persisted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0011000012439476">C’de Baca &amp; Wilbourne, 2004</xref>). The enduring changes reportedly resulting from the transformative experience included behavior change, relief from negative emotions or fear of death, and finding a new direction or life purpose. For some respondents, the initial sudden change was followed by similar life-changing experiences, often milder in intensity; for other respondents, the quantum change was a once-in-a-lifetime event. Still others saw the QC as a catalyst for continuous personal growth and development.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0011000012439476">Miller (2004)</xref> described the difference between nonvolitional quantum change and gradual, self-healing changes in personality and/or behavior. Active, deliberate attempts to change oneself are the defining features of other theoretical models, notably <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0011000012439476">Prochaska and DiClemente’s (1986)</xref> change process model and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0011000012439476">Robitschek’s (1998)</xref> personal growth initiative (PGI). Narrower in scope than Prochaska and DiClemente’s theory of self-change, the PGI is a personality characteristic with both cognitive and behavioral features, that is, awareness of personal changes and purposefully seeking out or taking advantage of growth opportunities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0011000012439476">Robitschek &amp; Kashubeck, 1999</xref>). Supporting the construct validity of PGI, research shows that this personality variable, assessed using the 9-item Personal Growth Initiative Scale, was moderately associated with internal locus of control, instrumentality, and assertiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0011000012439476">Robitschek, 1998</xref>). A more recent study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0011000012439476">Robitschek &amp; Keyes, 2009</xref>) found that college students who were relatively higher in PGI reported being more self-accepting and having more purpose in life, greater control or mastery, more autonomy or self-direction, and better social relationships.</p>
<p>In contrast to the view that striving for self-change is either a personality characteristic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0011000012439476">Robitschek, 1998</xref>) or a process of acknowledging a problem and taking action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0011000012439476">Prochaska &amp; DiClemente, 1986</xref>), narrative theorists (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0011000012439476">White &amp; Epston, 1990</xref>) posit that transformative change results from the intentional exploration of alternative life stories. From this perspective, people can “re-author” their lives to move away from “problem-saturated stories,” thereby bringing about enduring personality change and self-healing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0011000012439476">White &amp; Epston, 1990</xref>). Because personal identity is the composite of an individual’s derivation of meaning from a vast multitude of life events, re-authoring involves reconceptualizing the previous self, the present self, and the change processes that link the past and present selves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0011000012439476">Matos, Santos, Gonçalves, &amp; Martins, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>This constructivist view on positive self-change prompted our interest in the meaning-making aspect of CEs that occur in everyday life. Drawing on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0011000012439476">Gonçalves, Matos, and Santos’s (2009)</xref> narrative study of “innovative moments” in psychotherapy, we reasoned that people who are able to identify and describe a CE do so by engaging in meta-reflection, that is, explaining a felt difference in the self and the processes that resulted in the self transformation. In fact, what Gonçalves et al. called <italic>reconceptualization</italic>, a person’s ability to identify the novelty and distinguish it from the previous self, is in line with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0011000012439476">Alexander and French’s (1946)</xref> definition of corrective emotional experiences. As Gonçalves et al. explained, reconceptualization is “a kind of meta-position over change . . . involv[ing] a reflexive position toward the change process—the person is not only an actor of that process but also its author” (p. 12). From this literature, we reasoned that re-authoring or changing the narrative of a specific experience may be one avenue by which an experience becomes corrective.</p>
<p>We reasoned that when people come to understand an event or relationship in a different or unexpected way, they often begin by reconceptualizing their experience using self-help books or formal support groups. Many adults rely on self-help books to build personal strengths, manage stress, improve functioning, and facilitate resilience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0011000012439476">Bergsma, 2008</xref>). It has been speculated that self-help books are beneficial because they teach people to take an active role in their emotional functioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0011000012439476">Bergsma, 2008</xref>). Additionally, over the past 50 years, people have increasingly relied on 12-step support groups in the community to promote self-healing, the most common of which is Alcoholics Anonymous. Participation in Alcoholics Anonymous fits the Penn State definition of CEs in that “complete recovery from alcoholism involves more than simply staying sober. There must be an overhaul of identity in which the alcoholic comes to look at himself or herself and others in a completely different way” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0011000012439476">Suire &amp; Bothwell, 2006</xref>, p. 252). Of note, the meaning-making process seems to be an essential component of the success of recovery groups. In observations of 12-step groups, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0011000012439476">Arminen (2004)</xref> concluded that the mutual help involved in story telling and reinterpretation of one another’s stories was powerfully effective in achieving and maintaining sobriety.</p>
<p>In the present discovery-oriented study, we began by developing a broad definition of CE in everyday life to include discrete events as well as past or present interpersonal relationships. Like the Penn State conference researchers, our definition was broader than that of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0011000012439476">Alexander and French (1946)</xref> by recognizing the possibility of change that is not limited to resolution of past traumatic or conflict experiences. Rather, meaningful personal triumphs and cherished relationships can also stimulate transformative change. The key, defining element is that the individual perceived the past experience to be pivotal, positive, and life changing.</p>
<p>From interviews with adults who could readily identify having had such transformative events or relationships at some point in their lifetimes, we inductively developed themes related to informants’ descriptions of these personal experiences, staying close to the narratives. Qualitative methods are appropriate when there is a paucity of theory and research in an area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0011000012439476">Creswell, 2003</xref>) because these methods allow for a phenomenon to be examined from the perspective of the individuals involved in it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0011000012439476">Taylor &amp; Bogdan, 1984</xref>). We used Consensual Qualitative Research (CQR; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0011000012439476">Hill et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0011000012439476">Hill, Thompson, &amp; Williams, 1997</xref>), a methodology that is suited for complex phenomena and provides an analysis of narrative data across informants along with a rich examination of each individual’s experiences.</p>
<p>In designing the study, we wanted to go beyond the literature on quantum change, deliberate change processes, and PGI to focus on how the change came about, particularly the interpersonal context of self-transformation. Thus, in addition to discovering the kinds of life events or relationships—positive or negative—that people view as transformative, we also asked, What cognitive and emotional processes take place during and after a CE, especially as time passes in a person’s life? What roles are played by significant others, both during the experience itself and afterward, in the meaning-making process?</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>Twenty-five adult participants agreed to participate in the study based on the following solicitation:
<disp-quote>
<p>Looking back over your lifetime, can you think of a specific event or relationship that was pivotal for you in a positive, life changing way? We are interested in hearing about how you came to understand—on an emotional level—an event or a personal relationship in a different or unexpected way. That is, either the event significantly changed your perception of yourself or led you to feel differently than you did before about some specific kind of situation or circumstance.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The solicitation request was written by the authors and revised based on the feedback of (a) a research team of graduate students in counseling psychology and (b) Clara Hill, one of the organizers of the Penn State conferences on CEs. The wording reflects the definition of CE that had been developed collaboratively in the first Penn State conference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0011000012439476">Castonguay &amp; Hill, 2012</xref>), a definition that is deliberately transtheoretical (i.e., not solely reflective of its psychoanalytic roots) and included discrete events, like the bishop’s pardoning of Jean Valjean, as well as personal relationships. Like the Penn State researchers, we deliberately omitted the word <italic>corrective</italic> so as not to limit responses to changes related to perceived problems or deficits.</p>
<p>Only non-mental-health professionals were recruited because we were interested in lay persons’ understandings of transformative change. Individuals who were working toward a graduate degree in a mental health field were also excluded. The only other exclusion criterion was age: Volunteers needed to be at least 18 years old.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0011000012439476">Table 1</xref> shows the demographic characteristics of each participant. The sample included 14 women and 11 men, aged 23 to 82 (<italic>M</italic> = 39.88, <italic>SD</italic> = 18.39), from six states in the northeastern United States. Eighteen (72%) participants were White, 5 (20%) were Asian, 1 (4%) was African American/Black, and 1 (4%) self-identified as multiracial. In terms of marital status, 12 (48%) were married, 12 (48%) were single, and 1 (4%) was divorced.

<title>Interview Protocol</title>
<p>A semi-structured interview (see <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0011000012439476">appendix</xref>) was used to gain a rich, phenomenological understanding of participants’ everyday CEs. The interview questions were developed to reflect participants’ construals of their experiences at the time they occurred as well as at the present time. Specific questions addressed the life context and nature of the pivotal or transformative experience; participants’ behavioral, cognitive, and affective responses to the event or relationship; and the process of coming to understand how and why the experience was transformative.</p>
<p>The interviewers (the second and third authors, counseling psychology doctoral students) began by asking each participant to recount their experience and the context in which it took place. They then asked each participant to reflect on their meaning-making process and explain the process of coming to understand the life-changing impact of the event or relationship. Additionally, they asked the participant if other people helped them understand or supported them in relation to the experience and whether they relied on psychotherapy, self-help material, or formal support groups. Follow-up questions were posed as needed to gather as detailed an account as possible.</p>
<p>At the end of each interview, interviewers gathered descriptive information verbally, including the participant’s age, education level, marital/relationship status, race/ethnicity, and state of residence.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0011000012439476">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>Prior to conducting the interviews, each of the authors independently wrote a statement of how our expectations and assumptions could affect the interview process and our interpretation of the results. Throughout the interview and coding processes, we discussed these assumptions in light of the emerging data. With regard to investigator biases, all of us reported having had at least one previous CE, as defined in this study. A common assumption was that CEs would typically be precipitated by negative events or by unpleasant relationships (e.g., loss of loved ones, breakup, or divorce) that cause people to feel anxious, uncomfortable, sad, or angry. Second, we expected that life-transforming events and relationships would often involve close friends, romantic partners, family members, or authority figures (e.g., mentors and teachers). Our third assumption was that the impact of pivotal events or relationships would not usually be recognized at the time, that is, that people needed some time to reflect before becoming aware of how such experiences had transformed their personalities or views of themselves and the world.</p>
<p>Because sampling for qualitative research is purposeful rather than random (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0011000012439476">Creswell, 2003</xref>), we began by asking friends, family members, and personal acquaintances if they had a positive, life-changing experience (see wording above) and, if so, whether they would be interested in participating in an interview on the topic. They were also asked to nominate others who might consider volunteering. This snowball sampling method can be used in qualitative research to locate potential participants who meet inclusion criteria and might agree to be interviewed on a specific topic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0011000012439476">Bogdan &amp; Biklen, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>In total, the authors contacted 42 individuals. The sample of 25 adults was considered sufficient, inasmuch as most CQR research uses sample sizes between 7 and 19 participants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0011000012439476">Hill et al., 2005</xref>). Of the 17 individuals who declined to take part (40.48%), 2 gave no reason and 15 indicated a willingness to participate but stated that they had no life-changing experience to relate.</p>
<p>An appointment was scheduled at a convenient time and place for each volunteer. Most interviews were conducted by telephone and, with permission of the participant, audio-recorded for subsequent transcriptions. Participants who preferred to do so were interviewed in person. Informed consent included the purpose of the study, that the interview would be taped and transcribed, that participation was voluntary and confidential, and that participants had the right to withdraw at any time.</p>
<p>Although an hour was allotted, the average interview lasted from 20 to 30 minutes. The interviewers transcribed each interview verbatim, with all potentially identifying information removed. To ensure accuracy and completeness, the transcripts were returned to participants for additions and deletions. Twenty-three (95.8%) of the 25 transcripts were returned to the interviewers with minor changes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0011000012439476">
<title>Analysis</title>
<p>We used CQR methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0011000012439476">Hill et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0011000012439476">Hill et al., 1997</xref>) to analyze participants’ narratives. This methodology is appropriate for discovery-oriented qualitative studies in which the kinds of themes are not predetermined.</p>
<p>Using <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0011000012439476">Hill et al.’s (2005)</xref> recommended CQR methods, the three authors (two White women and one Taiwanese American woman) served as the research team. The judges (doctoral students in counseling psychology) and auditor (a PhD-level counseling psychology faculty member) had previous experience conducting qualitative analyses.</p>
<p>First, we jointly reviewed two transcripts to develop a preliminary list of domains (i.e., general topic areas used to cluster the narrative data). That is, we closely read through each transcript and assigned a domain to each block of data, which could be a phrase, sentence, or series of sentences with similar meaning. The resulting initial list of domains loosely reflected the semistructured interview questions. The following domains were included:</p>
<list id="list1-0011000012439476" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>factors that contributed to the CE,</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>emotions related to the CE at the time the event or relationship occurred,</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>emotions experienced at a later time,</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>cognitive understanding of the CE at the time the event or relationship occurred,</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>cognitive understanding of the CE at a later time,</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>relational factors at the time,</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>relational factors occurring at a later time,</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>role of others involved in the experience,</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>role of others not involved in the CE,</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>consequences or impact on the informant, and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>use of other coping mechanisms.</p></list-item></list>
<p>After we had jointly coded two initial transcripts, the two judges independently coded the remaining transcripts by placing each relevant meaning unit into the appropriate domain. Next, the judges summarized the content of each domain as a core idea. Remaining close to participants’ responses, the judges’ summary statements were succinct representations of the content within each domain. The two judges identified the core ideas independently and then negotiated the content and wording of the core ideas within each domain in all of the interview transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0011000012439476">Hill et al., 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0011000012439476">2005</xref>). Negotiation involved sharing viewpoints and discussing the narrative data until arriving at a common understanding of the core ideas.</p>
<p>The first author served as auditor; she reviewed the text to ensure that it had been appropriately sorted and thoroughly abstracted. Prior to the next step, which involved interpreting the data, the judges considered the auditor’s feedback. All transcripts were re-examined, and similarities in core ideas were identified across cases. Then, as a team, we met to develop titles for the final categories and to determine the placement of core ideas within categories. Majority and minority views were taken into account so that the final titles reflected a common understanding of the data. Finally, a cross-case analysis was conducted. That is, we identified how frequently each category and subcategory appeared in the full sample (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0011000012439476">Hill et al., 2005</xref>).</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0011000012439476">Table 1</xref> shows the nature and characteristics of participants’ CEs. As shown in the table, almost half of the CE events or experiences occurred in childhood (i.e., prior to age 18), and 11 of the 25 participants (44%) reported a negative precipitant to the CE.</p>
<p>Based on guidelines for reporting CQR results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0011000012439476">Hill et al., 2005</xref>), we found no general (universal) categories. Categories that emerged in the majority of cases (i.e., ≥13) were considered typical, those that occurred in 3 to 12 cases were labeled variant, and those that occurred in 1 or 2 cases were labeled rare. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0011000012439476">Table 2</xref> summarizes the categories and illustrative quotes from participants’ narratives.</p>

<title>Factors Contributing to the CE</title>
<p>There were many common factors that contributed to participants’ CEs. A typical response was that the participant was in a period of life transition when the CE occurred. These transitions included starting in a new school, entering high school or college, moving to a new location, or ending a significant relationship. Other factors were negative life events occurring at the time of the experience (including historical events), feeling generally unhappy in life, feeling isolated, lacking social support, being immature, and living in a dysfunctional family. Examples of negative life events included divorce, illness of a family member or friend, and legal difficulties.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0011000012439476">
<title>Emotions Related to the CE</title>
<p>As indicated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0011000012439476">Table 2</xref>, emotions experienced at the time of the CE could be negative or positive. Positive emotions included “pride” and feeling “free,” “happy,” “secure,” and “confident.” One participant described his CE as “a priceless moment.” Participants who described negative emotions at the time of the corrective event or relationship reported having felt “angry,” “upset,” guilty,” “humiliated,” and “scared.” One individual stated that “everything was black.”</p>
<p>Although participants had relatively less to say about changes in their emotions over time, those who did so had both positive and negative affective responses. In discussing her CE, one participant said, “It gave me hope.” Negative emotional responses occurring later in life included “I remember having such a horrible taste in my mouth” and “it made me disgusted with myself even more.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0011000012439476">
<title>Cognitive Understanding of the CE</title>
<p>In describing their cognitive understanding of the CE at the time the event or relationship took place, many participants reported they recognized the need to behave differently, acknowledged a new self-perception, or experienced negative thoughts surrounding the experience. For example, one participant said, “It was a humbling moment.” Additionally, several participants reported having a new or an increased determination with respect to the self or others. In one case, the CE involved finding spiritual meaning.</p>
<p>The majority of participants reported that at some point after the CE took place, they developed a new view of themselves or the critical relationship. Several participants indicated that after a significant period of time had passed, their perspective on the event changed from negative to positive. That is, for these participants, the event or relationship came to be viewed as a learning experience or an opportunity to change. Representative of this theme was the response of one participant who explained that she had initially viewed the event as extremely negative, only to realize much later in life that it had been a momentous moment:
<disp-quote>
<p>The reason why it’s such a long period of time [to understand the experience is] because it really helped tighten so many of the things that had occurred, that I had viewed so negatively in the past and [I] realized that there was a process that I had to go through. I’m going to keep looking back at this and say this is something very, very important.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Another participant, whose CE involved the end of a marriage, said,
<disp-quote>
<p>I’m not sure exactly what triggered me to just sit down and think about it. I just sat there for like 40 minutes or so, just thought about why things ended the way they did. I just realized that she was slowly bringing me down. It sounds kind of wrong, but I was slowly becoming someone I had always despised. Getting into a lot of fights. Yelled a lot. We called each other names, and I didn’t like that. Reflected on that along with the list of things that I did not like about her, coupled with the fact that we hardly agreed on anything, we rarely wanted the same thing, and she had a very strange attachment to her family. I realized that it was a good thing that we got a divorce. It just wasn’t negative anymore.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Similarly, another participant who ended a relationship said,
<disp-quote>
<p>I think when I finally woke up from that, one day I was like, “Y’know what, I don’t need this.” I had started toying with the idea, and I was getting frustrated at the very end, and he definitely didn’t have as much power over me at the end. . . . And literally, one day I was no longer under his spell. And how that’s really changed me since then, is that I look back and see the weak person that I really hated myself for it, and felt really disappointed in myself, but as I’ve grown since then, I have seen it as a learning experience and as a cautionary tale, and how I want to live my life as a strong woman and a strong individual. And that has really affected the way I look at all of my relationships since.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0011000012439476">
<title>Roles of Others Not Directly Involved in the CE</title>
<p>Participants described how people who were not directly involved in the CE influenced their overall experience. The majority of participants reported having received support from individuals or support groups, for example, “I usually talked to my friends or whoever understood the situation” and “I mean I had times where I had mental breakdowns, but there would always be someone to back me up. There was always someone I could turn to.” Another common response was that participants simply disclosed or discussed their experience with others. Some examples were the following statements: “My mother told me how much I changed after becoming friends with <italic>X</italic>. Prior to that, I never realized how much she impacted my life.” “I got a lot of feedback from my family, from my best friend.” “We discussed how we wanted to not screw around like that and basically work hard, and realized that our parents were doing a lot for us. We were thinking kind of the same thing.” Another common response involved having learned from or received advice from others: “My friends brought that to my attention, even when I pretended everything was fine.” “I remember one of my teachers in high school one time told me how she thought I seemed so much more open and participated in class more when he [boyfriend] wasn’t there.”</p>
<p>Of the 14 participants (43%) who described their CE events or relationships as negative, 6 sought professional help. These participants reported that their therapists offered a new perspective on the event, acted as a calming influence, validated their feelings, brought on an emotional release, or focused them on self-direction. One participant said, for example,
<disp-quote>
<p>I felt I was emptying a garbage truck. Everything that ever bothered me in my life started coming out. I think therapy really helped me realize, recognize. One thing I got out of therapy was to recognize that when something is bothering you, you either confront the situation or remove yourself from it. I think that was one of the most important things that helped me.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Another participant said,
<disp-quote>
<p>Absolutely. [My therapist] helped me see the beauty of it and how all of these older things, like the resentment over the cops who had arrested me and how it got to that point. She helped me process that through, so I saw it through the eyes of someone who was grateful. And how to deal with overwhelming positive emotion and beauty. I mean, the beauty thing, it was a beautiful experience.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Yet another participant who saw a school counselor as an adolescent reported,
<disp-quote>
<p>I would get really upset about nothing. I would be crying about something that seems so silly now. So I would go to my school counselor and he always just helped me calm down and think about all the good things. I can’t remember specific things that he said, but he said to think about the things that are positive and remember the good things that you had. He tried to comfort me.

<p>However, one participant stated that therapy was not helpful because the therapist “just listened.”</p>

<title>Consequences or Impact of the CE</title>
<p>The most commonly reported impact of the CE was feeling a greater sense of self-esteem or level of confidence. Some participants indicated having more self-respect, feeling stronger or more authentic as a result of the CE; for example, “I just decided I needed to be me.” Interestingly, quite a few participants reported that one or more of their relationships improved, such that they felt closer to family members and friends or that they generally “became more considerate of other people.” One participant reported,
<disp-quote>
<p>It made me feel much closer to my mom. That incident brought me closer to her and brought the whole family closer together, too. In the end, when I get into a fight with my brother . . . I always think of my mom first.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Another common impact of the CE, which many participants saw as pivotally important in their lives, was a deliberate change in behavior, attitude, or life plans. A couple of participants, whose CE involved poor academic performance, reported that their study or academic habits greatly improved as a result. For example, one participant, whose life changed dramatically in adolescence, explained, “I had to hide everything. I could not cry. I had to be strong. . . . Everyone in the family depended on me now.” Another individual, who described a life-changing friendship in adolescence, said,
<disp-quote>
<p>Since we had so much fun together, it made me a happier, and more optimistic person. I think since she was so outgoing, she made me more outgoing. Today I am an extremely social and optimistic person, and I think that a lot of my personality is a result of my relationship with her.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In conducting this exploratory study and considering the results, we made three initial observations. The first observation is that, when asked to relate a CE, some people were willing to participate in the study but could recall no transformative change in their lives, whereas other people could almost immediately recall a pivotally important event or relationship. Notably, two individuals declined to take part because, we suspected, they felt that their CEs were too intimate to relate to a stranger.</p>
<p>Our second observation is the number of variant and rare themes, which reflects the diversity and complexity of the human experience. Moreover, because we defined CEs as potentially occurring at any point in life and because some CEs were discrete events whereas others were ongoing relationships, several of the experiences described by our participants were quite unique. Nonetheless, there were some meaningful repetitions of experiences, particularly those involving positive or negative interpersonal relationships as well as the emotional, cognitive, and social factors that contributed to our informants having come to view their experience as pivotally transformative. For instance, almost half of the CEs had negative precipitants, which were initially accompanied by negative emotions, followed by positive feelings after some meaningful reconceptualization had occurred, most often with supportive people with whom they could talk. Most of the positive CEs involved having meaningful personal relationships with partners, family members, and mentors or having taken on a specific challenge or a demanding new social role. Often it was not until long afterward that the individuals describing these positive precipitants fully understood their pivotal influence in their lives.</p>
<p>The third observation is that few participants relied on psychotherapy, self-help books, or formal support groups, yet the outcomes described by the sample were consistent with those we most value in our clients: independence, improved self-concept and relationships, a sense of greater well being, and self-affirmation. The informants were able to describe the positive consequences of their CEs in sufficient detail that we could see commonalities despite the varied negative and positive precipitants.</p>
<p>In CQR, relatively small samples are purposefully solicited so as to obtain rich descriptions of informants’ experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0011000012439476">Hill et al., 1997</xref>). One limitation is that many of the informants are personally known to us. On one hand, these personal connections may have facilitated the ability of our respondents to share intimate moments. On the other hand, the personal connections may have limited the nature and extent of participants’ responses. Moreover, the sample includes mostly privileged, highly educated participants. Although qualitative results are not meant to be generalized to a population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0011000012439476">Creswell, 2003</xref>), we suspect that the kinds of life events and our informants’ cognitive processing of those events may be most characteristic of educationally advantaged individuals.</p>
<p>Despite the limitations, the exploratory aims of the study were achieved. That is, we discovered some aspects of CEs in everyday life that offer guidance to scholars and therapists. The themes that emerged were largely consistent with the literature on transformative change. To begin with, most CEs described by our participants came about either (a) when the individual was in a life transition, (b) after a negative event or abusive relationship or experience had occurred, or (c) when an important relationship ended or its value was recognized in retrospect. Additionally, a number of the CEs described by our participants were akin to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0011000012439476">Miller and C’de Baca’s (2001)</xref> insight form of quantum change; one participant did in fact describe a spiritual transformation. The longstanding consequences of some of our participants’ CEs were also similar to those described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0011000012439476">Miller’s (2004)</xref> follow-up interviews, for example, a shift from negative to positive emotions or deliberate changes in self and relationships. Many of our participants made active attempts to change themselves (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0011000012439476">Prochaska &amp; DiClemente, 1986</xref>) or saw the CE as an opportunity for personal growth and new learning (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0011000012439476">Robitschek &amp; Kashubeck, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>Another finding is that our informants were able to distinguish their current understanding of the CE from the cognitions they held at the time it occurred. This distinction suggests that participants engaged in meta-reflection—seeing themselves as not only the “actor” but also the “author” of their personal change process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0011000012439476">Gonçalves et al., 2009</xref>, p. 12). On the other hand, few individuals could identify the specific cognitive processes that resulted in their transformative change. Rather, most cognitive changes seemed to involve a repeated revisiting of the experience over a lengthy period of time.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the informants were more easily able to identify cognitive changes in themselves than either emotional or behavioral changes. Cognitive change was both event- and relationship-specific as well as a generalization. Some participants, for example, described a new view of themselves, a new view of relationships in general, and/or a need or decision to think or behave differently. Of note, the majority of participants received support from people in their lives who were not directly involved in the CE. Whereas some participants relied on others to disclose thoughts and feelings or obtain advice, other participants felt pressured or challenged by others, and some participants simply saw other people as models for their own behavior.</p>
<p>We anticipated that an understanding of the role played by significant others in the meaning-making process might suggest specific therapeutic relational stances, strategies, and interventions to help therapy become a CE for clients and to help clients work through significant or pivotal experiences that occur outside of treatment. Participants who discussed the circumstances surrounding their CEs with a therapist described aspects of the therapeutic process that are common across theoretical approaches: obtaining support, gaining a new perspective, releasing emotions, or feeling validated. Whether the help came from a therapist or from others in our participants’ lives, the key element that was recalled was the disclosure of thoughts and feelings to a caring individual.</p>
<p>This finding, along with the predominant discussion of cognitive processing of CEs, suggests that existential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0011000012439476">Yalom, 1980</xref>) or constructivist strategies and techniques (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0011000012439476">White &amp; Epston, 1990</xref>) may be particularly helpful for clients who are in life transitions or who have just experienced a negative life event. Indeed, because meaning-making seems to be a naturally occurring process, therapists could ask clients who had a significant event or relationship that occurred in the past to reflect on ways in which their thinking changed and what precisely influenced these cognitive shifts. If their thoughts and feelings about the experience are indeed different, therapists might then point to their experience as having been corrective.</p>
<p>Another practical implication of our findings has to do with the common occurrence of CEs in everyday life. Particularly with clients who have difficulty seeing themselves in a positive light, it may be helpful to ask questions about events or relationships that, when the client looks back, were in fact pivotal or life changing. If a client can suggest a potential CE, then the therapist can help him or her make meaning of what took place, focusing on the client’s sense of agency and subsequent changes in outlook or self-concept. Doing so can help clients appreciate their strength or positive characteristics. Consider, for example, a client (seen in the practice of the first author) who persistently saw herself as “ordinary” but who had managed to pass an extremely competitive professional examination by studying no less than 16 hours a day for 3 months. Although the client did not perceive her exam result as transformative, exploration in therapy suggested that it had indeed changed her outlook on herself and on what she could accomplish through “sheer force of will.”</p>
<p>Although we had little information to explain the variability in our participants’ CEs and their meta-reflections, we suspect educationally privileged individuals may be better able to reflect on the evolution of their lives as a result of specific events or relationships. Alternately, if the ability to transform oneself from adversity is indeed a personality variable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0011000012439476">Robitschek &amp; Kashubeck, 1999</xref>), future researchers might use the Personal Growth Initiative Scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0011000012439476">Robitschek, 1998</xref>) to assess whether individuals who deliberately see a life event as prompting self-transformation differ from those who can recall no CE or those who see adverse events in their lives as being persistently detrimental.</p>
<p>Future research might also contrast CEs that result from discrete events from those that stem from important personal relationships. Defining CE more narrowly as positive transformation following adverse events might also be informative. Finally, it would be worthwhile to discover if, how, and when therapists work with clients’ everyday CEs and whether clients see the perspectives of therapists as similar to or different from those of other people in their lives.</p>
<p>As counseling psychologists whose field has been heavily influenced by humanistic theories, we have long been interested in fostering human growth and development, and not only in one-on-one therapeutic relationships. Although <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0011000012439476">Carl Rogers (1957)</xref> theorized that self-actualization is a universal growth tendency, we have strikingly little knowledge of how self-healing comes about in people’s everyday lives. These results suggest that not only do loss and trauma bring about positive growth but also that self-actualizing tendencies are catalyzed during challenging life transitions and in the context of exceptionally meaningful personal relationships. As scholars, psychotherapists, consultants, and designers of health delivery and educational programs, we can make use of this knowledge to better understand and promote human welfare across diverse social contexts.</p>
