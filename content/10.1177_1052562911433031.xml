<p>“Responsible management education” sounds self-evident; who among us think of ourselves as engaged in <italic>irresponsible</italic> management education? Yet the practical aspects of how we educate responsibly (or responsibly educate) the next generation of management professionals are complicated. Who defines what is responsible among competing societal, organizational, and ecological values? How is social responsibility, however defined, nurtured in management education? How do educational institutions make decisions about curriculum and programs in a manner that forces recognition of and engagement with the values that those decisions represent? These questions and others related to ethics, corporate social responsibility (CSR), and sustainability provide the basis for the articles in this special issue.</p>
<sec id="section1-1052562911433031">
<title>The Principles of Responsible Management Education</title>
<p>Established in 2007 and coordinated by the United Nations, the Principles of Responsible Management Education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1052562911433031">PRME, 2011</xref>) are a voluntary global initiative intended to enhance and extend corporate responsibility and sustainability in mainstream business-related education. As explained in July 2007 documentation, “any meaningful and lasting change in the conduct of corporations towards societal responsibility and sustainability must involve the institutions that most directly act as drivers of business behavior, especially academia” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1052562911433031">UN Global Compact, 2007</xref>, p. 3). The PRME call “for business schools and universities worldwide to gradually adapt their curricula, research, teaching methodologies and institutional strategies” to align with internationally accepted values that support an inclusive and sustainable global economy (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.prme.org">www.prme.org</ext-link>).</p>
<p>The PRME were developed by an international task force consisting of 60 deans, university presidents, and official representatives of leading business schools in collaboration with the United Nations Global Compact, the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB), the Aspen Institute’s Business and Society Program, the European Foundation for Management Development, the Globally Responsible Leadership Initiative, and NetImpact, a student organization with more than 13,000 members, all of which remain partners. In addition, the Graduate Management Admission Council and the European Academy of Business in Society are part of the steering committee that guides PRME (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1052562911433031">Waddock, Rasche, Werhane, &amp; Unruh, 2010</xref>). The Principles focus on six elements of management education: purpose, values, method, research, partnership, and dialogue (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1052562911433031">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<p>This special issue is designed specifically to address Principle 3 (method) and Principle 4 (research), and comes as the result of a commitment by the OBTS Teaching Society for Management Educators to support the PRME initiative through its peer-reviewed publication, the <italic>Journal of Management Education</italic> (<italic>JME</italic>). Ordinarily, an editors’ introduction to a special issue is expected to address two elements: (a) to comment on (editorialize) the nature of the issue’s focus and (b) to briefly describe the individual articles included in the issue. Although we intend to do both, we consider responsible management education an extraordinary domain, and we wish to blend these elements somewhat by drawing on two metaphors—“roots” and “waves”—that contribute to understanding the PRME’s relevance for <italic>JME</italic> readers <italic>and</italic> serve as a framework for introducing the articles in this issue.</p>
<p>First, we note that the PRME have “intellectual roots” in the business and management literatures. This means that the PRME and each of the articles in this issue are embedded in a scholarly “ground” or “context” that provided the “soil and nutrients” necessary for their development. For example, the PRME would not be possible were it not for the conceptual roots provided by prior scholarship in business ethics, CSR, and sustainability. And, although every article in this special issue presents the particular literature and/or theoretical framework appropriate to its specific focus, an awareness of the various scholarship roots that contributed to the development of the PRME initiative will help readers connect to this heritage. We discuss some of these roots below.</p>
<p>Second, we note that the PRME represent a “wave of change” in management education. The PRME initiative arose from a desire for a substantial transformation in business education on the part of leaders of the UN Global Compact initiative, fueled by decades of debates about the purpose of management education in the field of business and in society at large. The articles in this issue (and the special issue itself) are the result of processes that have aligned to “push” business and management education in this particular direction of reform. Each of the articles either describes particular change efforts with respect to elements of the PRME or highlights the unforeseen consequences of such efforts. We also discuss below some of the changes in the environment of management education that set in motion the PRME initiative.</p>
<p>Although space limitations preclude a truly substantive discussion of the <italic>intellectual roots</italic> and <italic>waves of change</italic> that inform the PRME initiative, we offer a sketch of each to highlight the complex nature of the PRME and the contributions to the PRME agenda of the articles in this <italic>JME</italic> special issue.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1052562911433031">
<title>Intellectual Roots of the PRME</title>
<p>The PRME focus on issues of corporate responsibility and sustainability grew from intellectual roots in the literatures of business ethics, CSR, and environmental sustainability. We agree with others who recognize significant blurring in their development and the lines of distinction between them (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1052562911433031">Schwartz &amp; Carroll, 2007</xref>, for a more robust discussion of this issue). Therefore, while we discuss briefly each of these roots below, we acknowledge that these are “twisted roots” and not mutually exclusive constructs, and our discussion is not comprehensive of all contributing intellectual fields.</p>
<sec id="section3-1052562911433031">
<title>Business Ethics</title>
<p>Isolated examples of a literature on business ethics exist as far back as the early 1960s (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1052562911433031">Leys, 1961</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1052562911433031">Simon, 1967</xref>). However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1052562911433031">De George (2005)</xref> traces the more common adoption of the term to the early 1970s, followed by growing academic interest in the construct.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>In 1979 three anthologies in business ethics appeared: Tom Beauchamp and Norman Bowie, <italic>Ethical Theory and Business</italic>; Thomas Donaldson and Patricia Werhane, <italic>Ethical Issues in Business: A Philosophical Approach</italic>; and Vincent Barry, <italic>Moral Issues in Business</italic>. In 1982 the first single-authored books in the field appeared: Richard De George, <italic>Business Ethics</italic>; and Manuel G. Velasquez, <italic>Business Ethics: Concepts and Cases</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1052562911433031">De George, 2005</xref>, n.p.)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Consistent with this growing interest, the early 1980s saw the inauguration of the <italic>Journal of Business Ethics</italic> (1982), followed a decade later by <italic>Business Ethics Quarterly</italic> (1991). An AACSB study in 1991 noted the significant increase in the number of professional and academic articles with the term <italic>ethics</italic> in their abstract, finding that “a check of the ABI/INFORM database between 1984 and 1988 revealed that while the rate of increase of article publications in the popular business press in general doubled, the absolute citation of ethics increased nearly fourfold” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1052562911433031">Lyle, Schoenfeldt, McDonald, &amp; Youngblood, 1991</xref>, p. 237).</p>
<p>The business ethics domain includes both normative/prescriptive scholarship, which draws from philosophical traditions and an emphasis on “doing right,” and empirical scholarship, which draws from social science methods of research and focuses on explaining human behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1052562911433031">Donaldson &amp; Dunfee, 1994</xref>). Among the numerous debates in this domain, some critical scholars challenge the conceptualization of the term <italic>business ethics</italic> and “the limits of calculative and legalistic business ethics” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1052562911433031">Jones, 2003</xref>, p. 234) as a basis for illuminating the power dynamics and hidden assumptions of all social arrangements.</p>
<p>It is from these roots in the business ethics literature that the PRME derives normative, empirical, and critical orientations in its scholarship. Consistent with these elements, each of the articles in this special issue focuses on practical avenues for “doing right” or the construction of our ideas about what is meant by such endeavors—within classroom, institutional, or disciplinary spheres—and connects to the PRME as the basis for such activity.</p>

<sec id="section4-1052562911433031">
<title>Corporate Social Responsibility</title>
<p>Although the genesis of CSR can be traced to early arguments about the role of managers (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1052562911433031">Clark, 1916</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1052562911433031">Dodd, 1932</xref>), the beginning of the modern CSR period is linked to the early 1950s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1052562911433031">Carroll, 1999</xref>). The journal <italic>Business &amp; Society</italic> began publication in 1960, and other CSR journals followed. Literally hundreds of articles and numerous books have been written on the topic (for recent reviews, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1052562911433031">Egri &amp; Ralston, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1052562911433031">Lockett, Moon, &amp; Visser, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1052562911433031">Taneja, Taneja, &amp; Gupta, 2011</xref>). The fundamental interest of the CSR literature is on the relationship between for-profit business activities and the public sphere. And, similar to critiques in the business ethics domain, some question the fundamental consistency of the construct itself (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1052562911433031">Banerjee, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Various models of social responsibility have been developed, including those of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1052562911433031">Sethi (1975)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1052562911433031">Carroll (1979</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1052562911433031">1999</xref>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1052562911433031">Wartick and Cochran (1985)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1052562911433031">Wood (1991)</xref>. By the 1990s, “the CSR concept transitioned significantly to alternative themes such as stakeholder theory, business ethics theory, corporate social performance (CSP), and corporate citizenship” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1052562911433031">Carroll, 1999</xref>, p. 292). More recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1052562911433031">Garriga and Melé (2004)</xref> classified the main CSR theories and related approaches into four groups:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>(1) instrumental theories, in which the corporation is seen as only an instrument for wealth creation, and its social activities are only a means to achieve economic results; (2) Political theories, which concern themselves with the power of corporations in society and a responsible use of this power in the political arena; (3) Integrative theories, in which the corporation is focused on the satisfaction of social demands; and (4) Ethical theories, based on ethical responsibilities of corporations to society. (p. 51)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The literature of CSR, a fundamental driver of the PRME, provides a basis for exploring social responsibility themes in several of the articles in this special issue.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1052562911433031">
<title>Environmental Sustainability</title>
<p>Scholarly work on environmental sustainability also blends constructs from outside the realm of business with those of business practice and provides a significant foundation for the PRME. Many authors, including some in this special issue, trace current management interest in environmental sustainability to the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1052562911433031">World Commission on Environment and Development (1987)</xref> report, which defined sustainability as “development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs” (p. 19). However, as early as the 1960s, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1052562911433031">Simon (1967)</xref> characterized “despoiling the natural beauty of the countryside” as one type of “tough-but-legal” ethical dilemma for managers (p. 20).</p>
<p>The early literature on sustainability focused almost exclusively on the natural environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1052562911433031">Schwartz &amp; Carroll, 2007</xref>) and the ways in which business and development practices contribute to the “crisis” of economy and ecology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1052562911433031">Shrivastava, 1993</xref>). Publication of the book <italic>Management for a Small Planet</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1052562911433031">Stead &amp; Stead, 1992</xref>) represented one watershed in the scholarly link between management and environmental sustainability, as did inauguration of the journal <italic>Organization &amp; Environment</italic> in 1997. And, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1052562911433031">Bilimoria et al. (1995)</xref> note, although global environmental change has been a significant focus of interest within the scientific community since the 1950s, it was not until the 1990s that the “human dimensions of global environmental change” (p. 73) came into scientific focus, and its importance for the social sciences became apparent.</p>
<p>Since that time, the literature on business and the natural environment has expanded dramatically. In addition to hundreds of articles published in the specialized journals noted above, the topic has been addressed in special issues of <italic>Academy of Management Journal</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1052562911433031">Starik &amp; Marcus, 2000</xref>), <italic>People &amp; Strategy</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1052562911433031">Wirtenberg, 2010</xref>), <italic>Journal of Management Education</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1052562911433031">Egri &amp; Rogers, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1052562911433031">Rusinko &amp; Sama, 2009</xref>), and <italic>Academy of Management Learning &amp; Education</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1052562911433031">Starik, Rands, Marcus, &amp; Clark, 2010</xref>), among others. As a result of this rapidly growing scholarship area, the conceptualization of sustainability has broadened (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1052562911433031">Bansal &amp; Hoffman, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1052562911433031">Starik, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1052562911433031">Walck, 2009</xref>). The roots of environmental sustainability in the PRME focus on sustainability are evident in several articles in this special issue.</p>

<title>The PRME as a Wave of Change</title>
<p>The PRME is the first large-scale global initiative for change in business education, and its unique voluntary governance structure was developed in response to several specific social and institutional waves of change. Acknowledging and understanding these efforts is also helpful in understanding the relevance of the PRME for management educators. In particular, we note two shifts in social arrangements that created surges in the momentum for change: (a) a geometric growth in international trade and the globalization of business and (b) the emergence of a corporate responsibility infrastructure. Each of these elements highlights the basis for changes in societal values that pushed the PRME initiative forward.</p>
<sec id="section7-1052562911433031">
<title>Growth in International Trade and the Globalization of Business</title>
<p>The International Monetary Fund reports that although world trade has grown steadily since World War II, expansion has accelerated over the past decade and is associated with growing trade interconnectedness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1052562911433031">International Monetary Fund, 2011</xref>). This growth and interconnectedness has been accompanied by a dramatic expansion of multinational corporations (MNCs). From 1982 to 2007, in the United States alone, the number of MNCs increased more than threefold, from just over 1 million to 3.7 million businesses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1052562911433031">Barefoot &amp; Mataloni, 2009</xref>). These institutions have facilitated the globalization of both markets and production, with ongoing questions about the implications of such activities.</p>
<p>Numerous concerns surrounding globalization, global economic and social inequities, and global crises such as the current global recession have created unique pressures on corporations, countries, and communities. These pressures have resulted in varying responses: business orientations range from a singular interest on bottom line profits to those with triple bottom line policies of “people, planet, and profit” and sophisticated corporate citizenship policies; countries have adopted widely different policy responses from implementing national legislation to brokering voluntary compliance groups; some communities have sought local change through regulation whereas others are using activism and advocacy to address a wide range of issues (such as sweatshops or environmental degradation), engaging in association with nongovernmental organizations, or participating in broad protest movements such as Occupy Wall Street. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1052562911433031">Waddock (2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1052562911433031">2008</xref>) proposes that avenues necessary for negotiating this new social and economic order belong to three broad categories: market/business institutions, civil society/societal institutions, and state/government institutions. Each avenue, she suggests, represents an emerging infrastructure for corporate responsibility.</p>
<p>The growth of international trade and the globalization of business provided a springboard for the development of the PRME. As a global initiative, the PRME depend on the interconnectedness of management educators worldwide and the influence those educated within signatory institutions are likely to have on the global community. This interconnectedness is reflected in the international voices of the articles in this special issue.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1052562911433031">
<title>Emergence of Corporate Responsibility Infrastructure</title>
<p>Waves of change can only be sustained with the emergence of an infrastructure that nurtures and supports them. Our discussion below focuses on elements of market/business institutions and civil society/societal institutions that are particularly relevant to the emergence of the PRME.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1052562911433031">Waddock (2008)</xref> suggests that market/business institutions are made up of responsibility assurance infrastructures, business associations, and the responsible investment movement. Responsibility assurance infrastructures include codes of conduct, standards, and principles that require a values-based commitment by businesses to certain practices and procedures (e.g., UN Global Compact, CERES Principles), credible verification, monitoring, and certification services that support transparency for stakeholders about what companies are actually doing (e.g., ISO 26000, Transparency International), and generally accepted reporting systems for environmental and social responsibility (e.g., the Global Reporting Initiative). Business associations include prominent business membership organizations such as Business for Social Responsibility and the Conference Board Center for Corporate Citizenship &amp; Sustainability. Finally, the responsible investment movement (or Socially Responsible Investment) is a niche but growing part of the finance industry that is characterized primarily by investment funds and firms that focus on directing investment dollars into values-based institutions using religious, social, or ecological screens. Although discussed as a global phenomenon, research indicates that practices and principles of the SRI movement differ in different countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1052562911433031">Arjaliés, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The growth of civil society institutions, sometimes known as the “third sector” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1052562911433031">Levitt, 1975</xref>), also represents the emergence of social responsibility infrastructure. Civil society institutions include voluntary organizations, not-for-profits, and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs). In particular, NGOs such as those geared to business students, foundation think tanks, and accrediting agencies are particularly relevant to the PRME. The development of MBA student advocacy organizations such as NetImpact, whose mission is “to mobilize a new generation to use their careers to drive transformational change in their workplaces and the world” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1052562911433031">NetImpact, 2011</xref>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://netimpact.org/about">http://netimpact.org/about</ext-link>), is consistent with a shift in social values among those born between 1981 and 2000, the generation known as “Nexters” or “Millenials” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1052562911433031">Zemke, Raines, &amp; Filipczak, 2000</xref>). Additional evidence of this shift in social values can be found in the second type of NGOs—foundation-based think tanks. One of the best known of such U.S. organizations in the PRME domain is the Aspen Institute’s Business and Society Program. Partnered initially with the World Resources Institute, this influential NGO now publishes an alternative ranking report of MBA programs, “Beyond Grey Pinstripes,” that focuses on social and ecological criteria (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1052562911433031">Aspen Institute, 2011</xref>). In addition, prominent business school accreditation NGOs such as AACSB International and EQUIS are beginning to use Aspen Institute standards to encourage greater coverage of ethics, CSR, and sustainability in the management curriculum.</p>
<p>The PRME, arguably now an element in the corporate responsibility infrastructure, would likely not have been possible without the activities noted above. And, if reading the articles in this special issue causes management educators to engage with the PRME as the basis for change, then the civil society/societal institutional aspects of the corporate responsibility infrastructure are strengthened.</p>

<title>In This Issue</title>
<p>After months of discussing this special issue with interested potential authors, we were simultaneously overwhelmed and delighted to receive a vast array of interesting articles as a result of our efforts. Each of the 27 submitted manuscripts received extensive and rigorous feedback thanks to our global crew of reviewers. And, like most special issue editors, we wish we had space for more articles. We believe the five articles included in the special issue provide <italic>JME</italic> readers with a broad range of conceptual, empirical (qualitative, quantitative, and case), and practice-focused material that address course, institutional, and disciplinary levels of the PRME.</p>
<p>Our Call for Papers highlighted the special issue’s unique opportunity for affirmative dialog about the role of management education in developing a new generation of leaders capable of managing the complex challenges faced by business and society in the 21st century. We believe this focus is especially salient given the ongoing critiques of management education and the numerous debates about the influence of business education more broadly on corporate scandals and the current economic recession. Our goal was threefold for this special issue: (a) to help readers understand the PRME initiative including its evolution and relationship to corporate citizenship, CSR, ethics, and sustainability; (b) to share knowledge about interdisciplinary course content, pedagogical strategies, and curricular innovations that reflect the PRME elements; and (c) to critically interrogate the opportunities and challenges associated with the PRME. Our earlier discussion of roots and waves reflects these goals.</p>
<p>This special issue includes something for everyone interested in responsible management education. For our quantitative colleagues, the issue includes an evidence-based, how-to guide for assessing faculty PRME readiness. For our qualitative colleagues, there is a comparative case study of two European business schools. For those interested in action-based learning and ethical praxis, an integrated semester-long ethics exercise is included. There is an innovative course and program model for those seeking cutting-edge models focused on the bottom billion. And, for those interested in critical perspectives, there is a conceptual article on the importance of recognizing the hidden curriculum when attempting to implement PRME objectives.</p>
<p>The first three articles focus on different institutional aspects of the PRME. We open the special issue with a piece by Mike Maloni, Shane Smith, and Stuart Napshin titled “A Methodology for Building Faculty Support for the UN PRME,” which systematically considers the institutional concerns of introducing and garnering support for the PRME across a business program. Their piece provides a quantitative, evidence-based process that addresses a fundamental question about PRME implementation: What political and/or intellectual challenges might individuals face in advocating for PRME adoption at their institutions and how, at one institution, were these overcome?</p>
<p>The second article is a cross-national comparative case study of two European universities that are implementing the PRME. In “We Are the Champions: Organizational Learning and Change for Responsible Management Education,” Nikodemus Solitander, Martin Fougère, André Sobczak, and Heidi Herlin walk us through their experiences and institutional responses to the questions: What curriculum configurations support PRME principles? How do differences in cultural or nation state environments influence PRME integration?</p>
<p>In the third article, “Aligning the Hidden Curriculum of Management Education with PRME: An Inquiry-Based Framework,” Maribel Blasco alerts us to the importance of considering not only the formal curriculum but also how the informal curriculum intentionally and unintentionally affects student learning. This conceptual piece asks us to consider how theoretical perspectives such as critical theory and liberation pedagogy influence the teaching and learning of PRME content and the importance for us as educators to question and challenge current educational assumptions or practices in order to fully leverage the PRME as a learning framework.</p>
<p>The last two articles in this issue focus on course and disciplinary levels. Madhubalan Viswanathan’s article, “Curricular Innovations on Sustainability and Subsistence Marketplaces: Philosophical, Substantive, and Methodological Orientations,” provides a detailed and comprehensive overview of grassroots efforts to build a set of innovative interdisciplinary courses that help students and instructors learn with and from entrepreneurs in the bottom-billion marketplace. This work aptly takes up questions such as “What are course designs that successfully integrate PRME values?” and “How might a bottom-up approach reconfigure our understanding of sustainability and social responsibility?”</p>
<p>Finally, in “From Idea to Action: Promoting Responsible Management Education Through a Semester-Long Academic Integrity Learning Project,” Marc H. Lavine and Christopher J. Roussin provide us with a comprehensive experiential exercise that leverages students’ learning within an ethics course deeply tied to PRME ideals.</p>

<title>Future Directions</title>
<p>As noted earlier, this particular special issue developed as a result of the commitment to the PRME by the OBTS Teaching Society for Management Educators when it became a signatory in 2007. As part of the Society’s support for this initiative, the first head of PRME Secretariat, Dr. Manuel Escudero, was invited to speak at the annual OBTC teaching conference in Charleston, South Carolina, in 2009. Although Dr. Escudero’s flight was unable to depart New York due to thunderstorms, an eager group of OBTCers still attended the session to learn more about the PRME, which is testimony to the long-standing interest of OBTS members in responsible management education.</p>
<p>At the end of that session, we proposed a special PRME issue of <italic>JME</italic> to Jane Schmidt-Wilk, editor of the journal. Jane enthusiastically supported our desire to shepherd an issue focused on the PRME, both to deepen the OBTS commitment to the initiative and to provide cutting-edge scholarship on an emerging topic in an area of long-standing interest to <italic>JME</italic> readers. Almost 3 years later, we now offer the community a journal edition complete with examples that will expand our knowledge base and provide tactical strategies for moving the PRME initiative and its content areas deeper into our institutions. We are able to do so only as a result of the support from the leadership of OBTS, colleagues from around the globe who participated at various special issue–related professional development workshops, caucuses, and networking events, the 60 individuals who authored or coauthored a submission, and the thoughtful and developmental contributions of more than 50 reviewers.</p>
<p>We benefit as a community of management education scholars from the <italic>Journal of Management Education</italic>’s long-standing commitment to publishing individual articles and special issues on the PRME-related topics such as ethics, sustainability, indigenous voices, and poverty, among others. Poignantly, in the introduction to the special issue on poverty, guest editors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1052562911433031">Peredo and Moore (2008)</xref> noted the new PRME initiative with a bit of caution, stating, “[A] worry is that the PRME may be a flag that educators choose to fly but without engaging in the critical reflection that might have an effect on their actual performance” (p. 692). We share this concern about surface adoption of the values and agenda encompassed in the PRME. At the same time, we believe the submissions we received and the articles published in this special issue demonstrate that we have cause for optimism; many of us have engaged in the messy and politically challenging process of critical reflection about the PRME in classrooms, curricula, and institutions.</p>
<p>With the pleasure of presenting the first special issue on the PRME, we anticipate many more to come as this voluntary collaboration between higher education and the United Nations continues. We believe that the collaborative relationship between management education journals enhances our field. As such, we note upcoming special issues on PRME-related topics in two management education journals: “Educating Social Entrepreneurs and Social Innovators” (<italic>Academy of Management Learning &amp; Education</italic>) and “Expanding Minority Representation in Management Education” (<italic>Decision Sciences Journal of Innovative Education</italic>).</p>
<p>We hope this special issue and those that follow spawn expanded discussion and debate among authors focused on the PRME, PRME-related topics, and management education reform in general. Based on our “roots” and “waves” reflections, we see the PRME as having significant potential for deepening connections across domains and fostering change in management education. We encourage the development of additional studies related to implementation in a variety of contexts as the body of PRME signatories grows. We emphasize the importance for future scholarship to further interrogate and debate the broad nature of the PRME and the PRME “construct” itself. Since the PRME are fundamentally a platform for educational reform, we see the need for more connection to the organizational development and change literatures, and the need to identify the key issues and new models for change management within the higher education context that address fundamental barriers to PRME adoption and implementation. Last, and perhaps most urgent, we strongly encourage the support and development of PRME scholarship from the Global South and other underrepresented voices. Since the majority of the world’s population resides outside of North America and Europe, we are especially eager to see research that addresses the PRME from multiple cultural and political perspectives.</p>
