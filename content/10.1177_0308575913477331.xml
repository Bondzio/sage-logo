         <abstract>
            <p>Research suggests that caring for a child with Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) creates unique challenges for carers. To investigate this, three focus groups and education sessions, attended by 66 people, were held in the UK. Knowledge about FASD and its impact on families was evaluated using the focus groups, the Parental Stress Index and knowledge questionnaire. Eight broad themes were identified from thematic analysis of the focus groups. The findings suggest more support is needed for carers of children with FASD, especially as carers grow older. The implication for current practice should be further evaluated in this group.</p>

         <title>Introduction</title>
         <p>Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) and Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) represent a range of preventable conditions, categorised by impairments to growth, facial features and neurological deficits that can lead to ongoing difficulties with behaviour, learning and day-to-day function. This damage is caused by maternal use of alcohol during pregnancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0308575913477331">BMA Board of Science, 2007</xref>). FAS and FASD are not always easily recognised (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0308575913477331">Chandresenna, Mukherjee and Turk, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0308575913477331">Mukherjee, Hollins and Turk, 2006</xref>) and evidence suggests that the rates of both of these conditions are increasing in the UK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0308575913477331">May et al, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0308575913477331">2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0308575913477331">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0308575913477331">Petkovic et al, 2010</xref>). Thus, the most recognisable part of the spectrum represents only a small proportion of the overall group (BMA Board of Science, 2007; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0308575913477331">Mukherjee, Hollins and Turk, 2006</xref>).</p>
         <p>While the precise prevalence of FASD in the UK is currently unknown, studies which have looked at reported clinical cases in hospital episode statistics suggest that these rates are underestimated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0308575913477331">Morleo et al, 2011</xref>), with a recent study of children in care suggesting that the rates in this population were possibly as high as a third of the whole group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0308575913477331">Selwyn and Wijedesa, 2011</xref>). The impact of these factors on both children and their carers is currently unclear.</p>
         <p>In order to understand and identify the needs of carers of children with FASD in the UK it was decided to conduct an exploratory study to help generate specific recommendations for practice and for further research.</p>
         <p>There has been no apparent research published in the UK looking at the experiences or needs of carers of children with FASD. This contrasts with other parts of the world where several studies have been conducted. These have looked at the impact on carers, both biological and adopted, living with children affected by the condition. One such study interviewed adopted parents in the US state of Massachusetts, charting their experiences over time. It reported the journey of anticipation and expectation about adoption, described concerns over the amount of initial information provided about the child and documented frustration about not knowing how to manage a child with FASD and his or her associated behaviours, despite a sincere desire to support such children in realising their full potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0308575913477331">Granitas, 2004</xref>).</p>
         <p>Concerns about parents’ ability to bring up children with FASD have been studied over several years, for example in a series of publications from Canada. The first of these investigated what it requires to be a good parent of such a child. In a series of interviews with 19 foster carers and adoptive parents, the study found that close collaboration and support from professionals and educators, alongside the development of functional management skills for the children (who were recognised as being unique in nature), correlated with better outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0308575913477331">Brown and Bednar, 2003</xref>).</p>
         <p>In 2005 a study of 65 foster carers reported what made a successful placement of a child with FASD. It highlighted the need for support from professionals and extended family alongside structured environments with an understanding of the specific needs of the children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0308575913477331">Brown, Sigvaldason and Bednar, 2005</xref>).</p>
         <p>The final two studies from the series, published in 2007, involved 63 foster carers in Canada. The first investigated the motivation to provide foster care to a child with FASD and showed carers’ desire to achieve positive changes in the children, with helping the children to stay connected with their biological family as an important part of their decision to look after a child. The carers also reported that the children with FASD required different parenting skills than others previously fostered by the same families, even if those children also had special needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0308575913477331">Brown, Sigvaldason and Bednar, 2007</xref>). The second study looked at factors that led to the breakdown of placements. The dominant reasons for placement disruption were: feeling taken for granted by professionals, the perceived possibility of burnout and the lack of information and support about how to manage difficult behaviours associated with FASD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0308575913477331">Brown, Bednar and Sigvaldason, 2007</xref>).</p>
         <p>These studies all point to the difficulties faced by carers and the unique parenting needs of children with FASD. Moreover, these difficulties appear to be often exacerbated by poor communication at the time of adoption. For example, one US study reported that the following factors increased stress in the adopting family: lack of knowledge on the part of professionals, blame directed at parents for the behaviour of their children and a failure by those same professionals to communicate sufficient information about potential difficulties to be faced by the parents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0308575913477331">Caley, Winkelman and Mariano, 2009</xref>).</p>
         <p>The impact on families who have adopted children with FASD has also been documented. Interviews conducted with eight US foster carers, who had fostered over 17 children with FASD, found that the difficulties with memory, lack of understanding of consequences, aggression and a lack of parental strategies to address these difficult behaviours caused the most problems for both the children and the host family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0308575913477331">Gardner, 2000</xref>). The requirement for constant observation, the apparent absence of support from professionals and a lack of understanding in the wider community about the difficulties faced in child management were found to place excess stress on the carers’ relationships. In some cases this led to marital breakdown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0308575913477331">Morissette, 2001</xref>). The impact on the physical and mental health of adults, as well as ongoing financial and emotional pressures on the family, was reported to be a large source of the stress found in US families needing professional support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0308575913477331">Gelo and O'Malley, 2003</xref>).</p>
         <p>Some researchers have used the Parenting Stress Index (PSI) alongside other measures to measure the impact of children with FASD, aged six to 12, on family stress dynamics in adoptive parents. Problems with executive function (the umbrella term for cognitive processes such as planning, working memory, attention, problem-solving and other such processes) in the children, and poorer parental resources, such as being a biological parent or a single parent, were associated with increased stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0308575913477331">Paley et al, 2006</xref>).</p>
         <p>However, as is often the case with risk factors, these findings do not appear to be unique to FASD. Other neurodevelopmental disorders have raised similar issues and may also offer insights to help improve the situation. For instance, a study of 43 families of children with Joubert syndrome (a genetic disorder associated with neurodevelopmental problems) showed that the increased difficulties with behaviour and its management led to heightened stress in families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0308575913477331">Farmer et al, 2006</xref>). Similar findings emerged from a longitudinal survey of four carer groups of children with broader neurodevelopmental disorders. The caregiver groups were more likely to have poor health and be depressed, and displayed greater problems with family functioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0308575913477331">Lach et al, 2009</xref>).</p>
         <p>Despite these negative implications, other studies have shown possible avenues for improvement. A ten-year follow-up of both knowledge and stigma related to children with autism noted a shift in attitudes and decreased stress felt by families, a trend that the authors suggested could be related to changes in societal attitudes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0308575913477331">Gray, 2002</xref>). When families retained balance in their lives and received social support to help them access adequate services for their children, outcomes improved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0308575913477331">Trepagnier, 1999</xref>).</p>
         <p>A scrutiny of the literature reveals that the impact of children with FASD upon carers in the UK has been little investigated. Research in other countries suggests that such children can create unique stressors for carers and provides some insights into factors that influence these. However, it is not possible to directly transfer evidence from one country to understand needs in another. Differences in social and health care systems mean it is important to investigate the situation in each country. Therefore, based on direct observations from clinical samples and suggestions in publications from other countries, we decided to test our hypothesis: namely, that despite universal access to health and social care services, carers within the UK struggle to bring up children with FASD. We also hoped to identify and explore factors that lessen or enhance the stress experienced by the carers of such children.</p>

         <title>Methods</title>
         <p>The research presented here was part of a wider study designed to ascertain what is known in the UK about FASD and its impact on individuals. The study was undertaken in a series of focus groups in different populations, supplemented by questionnaires developed and approved by research ethics to allow broad participation. The mixed-methods approach was used throughout in the hope that they would ascertain what people thought and inform a deeper understanding of associated issues. This article presents the findings of the carers’ evaluation.</p>
         <sec id="sec3-0308575913477331">
            <title>Ethical considerations</title>
            <p>In view of the sensitivity of the questions being asked about FASD, permission for the use of unsolicited questionnaires or direct mail contact was not granted by the research ethics committee. Specifically, direct contact with teenagers and pregnant women was also rejected, unless people from these groups themselves responded to advertisements. This introduced limitations to possible analysis, but as this population had not been studied in the UK, it was considered necessary to investigate the knowledge of a wider group before focusing on those associated with greater risk. Ethical protocol also required information to remain anonymous, keeping only broader, non-identifiable data. This requirement limited comparison and correlation of some parts of the data.</p>

         <sec id="sec4-0308575913477331">
            <title>Sample</title>
            <p>Advertisements for the project were sent to carers via three main FASD support charities in the UK. These are based in the north-west of England, London and Oxfordshire. Those carers wishing to participate were asked to contact the research team and were then invited to attend an educational question-and-answer (Q&amp;A) session conducted by the lead researcher. In keeping with ethical committee requirements, it was made explicit that people could register to attend the Q&amp;A session without having to participate in the overall study. Three focus group sessions for carers took place immediately before the education session and these provided the qualitative data. A maximum of 10 people per group was implemented so that if more wanted to participate, 10 were randomly selected and invited to a focus group. All interested parties were welcome to attend the education session from which quantitative data were collected.</p>

            <title>Measures</title>
            <p>The Parenting Stress Index questionnaire (PSI), a validated tool to look at the source of stress in a parent–child relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0308575913477331">Abidin, 1995</xref>), was completed by all participants. As the PSI has been validated up to and including age 12, those parents whose children were older than this were asked to report the situation as they remembered it when their child was that age. While this was known at the outset to potentially introduce recall bias, we believe the value of this response outweighed the risks the method used.</p>

            <title>Statistical analysis</title>
            <p>PSI data were analysed using SPSS Version 18. The distribution of the data was confirmed using skewness and kurtosis as well as the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0308575913477331">Field, 2009</xref>). Frequency data for multiple categories were assessed and comparisons between two continuous variables measured using t-tests. Suitability criteria for multivariate analysis were confirmed: namely, that the predictor variables were quantitative and outcome variables were continuous, and that multicollinearity had been avoided. ANOVA was used to address the variations seen by subtests. Post hoc Bonferroni corrections were made (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0308575913477331">Field, 2009</xref>).</p>

            <title>Focus group process</title>
            <p>Focus groups were conducted on all occasions by the lead researcher using a semi-structured interview with support from the project research assistant. The questions used had been previously approved by the research ethics committee (see Appendix 1). Each interview was allowed to flow freely based on participants’ responses to initial questions.</p>
            <p>The project research assistant took field notes and each session was recorded on a digital tape recorder following written permission from the participants. The transcription was compared to written notes to allow for later data completion and verification. This was to ensure accuracy of the transcription as well as allow for annotation with supplementary information collected in the handwritten notes. There was no time limit on the sessions and participants were allowed to express their views openly.</p>

Transcribed and verified data were entered into NVIVO Version 8. Initial coding was made separately by the two lead authors before coming together to complete more selective coding of the data and extract themes.

         <title>Results</title>
         <p>Sixty-six people aged between 30 and 62 attended the three education sessions from which 10 people were selected randomly for each focus group. No one who was invited to attend a focus group refused. While the majority were adoptive or foster parents, two were biological parents. It is unclear why more biological parents did not attend. Of the 66 people who completed the PSI, only 54 completed it sufficiently to allow for analysis. The numbers participating overall were considered low. As such, only the parental domain met the basic assumptions required for multivariate analysis and analysis of variance.</p>
         <p>
            <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0308575913477331">Table 1</xref> summarises the ranked variance that accounted for parental stress for all cases in which the PSI was completed. As this was an exploratory study and the numbers participating affect the ability to draw conclusions from the data, it suggests possible trends that may be influencing the overall stress. The variance highlights the relative importance of various types of stress found in parents of children with FASD and offers suggestions into the areas that increase this stress by their rank. The higher the figure the more influence that factor has on the overall stress in the parent–child dynamic.

               <title>Different from other children</title>
               <p>Families held the strong view that parenting a child with FASD was a very unique experience. In some families, other children with special needs and emotional difficulties had previously been fostered, yet the children with FASD were still considered to be exceptional:<disp-quote>
                     <p>It wasn’t until I had my other two children and noticed that R’s behaviour was substantially different to the other two.</p>
                  </disp-quote>
               </p>
               <p>A competence deficit relating to the parenting of children with FASD was revealed in the PSI scores (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0308575913477331">Table 1</xref>). This suggests that the unique needs of children with FASD reported by carers have an effect on parents’ perceived ability to adequately rear the child. Even among experienced parents who reported having successfully parented other children, examples of unique difficulties were forthcoming:<disp-quote>
                     <p>Just a different behaviour totally, isn’t it? We had two boys of our own so we knew how to bring children up but with C she was just hot and cold all the time, wasn’t it?</p>
                  </disp-quote>
               </p>
               <p>Parental stress was less influenced by the attachment between child and parent as seen in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0308575913477331">Table 1</xref>. This suggests that their own internal sense of competence and inability to rear their children were the main causes of stress. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0308575913477331">Table 2</xref> highlights that this is exacerbated by age.</p>

               <title>Lack of information</title>
               <p>Adoptive parents felt they had not been given enough information by social workers to make informed decisions about the children:<disp-quote>
                     <p>We were absolutely told no information at all even though we requested it many times.</p>
                     <p>You should have enough information to be able to make an informed decision.</p>
                  </disp-quote>
               </p>
               <p>There was a sense that families’ difficulties with children with FASD were belittled or distorted. Parents reported (based on what they knew post adoption), that at the time of the pre-adoption interview, they had not been given enough information to allow for a truly informed decision. Whether this was related to the unavailability of information or information being withheld was not possible to establish.</p>

               <title>Lack of knowledge among professionals</title>
               <p>Many of the families reported difficulties in getting appropriate and sufficient support from professionals they met. This included doctors, social workers and educators. This led to greater perceived difficulties and the impression that they had nowhere to turn to obtain answers about how to best support their children:<disp-quote>
                     <p>He was diagnosed with Fetal Alcohol Syndrome before he came to me and then I got the letter back saying he can’t have FAS, he’s too young to have it [group laugh], and that was from a proper consultant.</p>
                     <p>You yourself have to educate the people that you are asking to help you about what is wrong with your daughter [laugh], so you end up feeling like you’re the professional!</p>
                  </disp-quote>
               </p>
               <p>These and similar experiences were reported to have increased rather than reduced the stress and difficulties for families caring for children with FASD.</p>

               <title>Having to ‘fight’ for things</title>
               <p>The lack of perceived support led some respondents to assert that they had to struggle to obtain the support to which they felt they were entitled. They felt that too much of their time was spent trying to obtain the help needed for their families, often with little benefit. These struggles were often experienced with multi-professional groups. The unrecognised uniqueness of the needs of children with FASD – and the different presentations of symptoms in that group when compared to other disabled groups – were seen as compounding these problems:<disp-quote>
                     <p>I would want someone to say you’re not going to have to fight social services, you’re not going to have to fight education to get a placement, you’re not going to have to argue with health over resources or whatever, and then I would have felt more confident about carrying on.</p>
                     <p>It’s this brick wall I keep hitting, what is FAS, that’s the brick wall I keep hitting all the time.</p>

               <title>Feeling misunderstood and blamed</title>
               <p>Often families reported that as a result of this lack of knowledge about FASD, they were blamed for poor parenting rather than supported by professionals. When comparing total scores for the child and parental scales, the PSI suggested that the child domain, which reflect the child’s influence on overall stress score, had a significantly greater effect than parental domains [<italic>t</italic>(53) = 7.09, <italic>p </italic>&lt;0.0001]. Those parents whose children were aged 12 years or under showed a similar result [(t(44) = 6.28, p&lt;0.0001]. The lack of understanding regarding these child factors in the behavioural presentation by some professionals and the subsequent blame attributed to the parent compounded the effects on the stress experienced by families:<disp-quote>
                     <p>I wonder how many of us round here have been called dysfunctional parents? [Group put up hands] All of us.</p>
                     <p>Teachers would come out and blame us for bad parenting.</p>

               <title>Family stress and benefits of one to one</title>
               <p>Families reported that the impact of feeling blamed and lack of support increased the pressure they felt. In at least one case, this led to marital breakdown:<disp-quote>
                     <p>We divorced five years ago. It was just ... the family just exploded, it was just, it broke down. Totally broke down.</p>

               <p>These are also seen in the PSI data from <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0308575913477331">Table 1</xref>. The levels of difficulties with a spouse were reported to have an influence on the stress.</p>
               <p>This sense of familial discord contrasts with the harmony reported when carers were on their own on a one-to-one basis with the children. Here the children were described as wonderful and great company:<disp-quote>
                     <p>On a one-to-one he’s fantastic. In a family unit it’s a nightmare when we’re all together [group agree] -- an absolute nightmare.</p>
                     <p>I love being with him on my own you know, we go out places or at home we do cooking, we do lots of stuff. He’s great.</p>

               <title>Isolation</title>
               <p>The families said that the difficulties they experienced with the children led them to become isolated. They were not able to go out socially, and this led to a restricted role that differed from their previous situation (e.g. prior to adoption) also seen in the PSI data (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0308575913477331">Table 1</xref>):<disp-quote>
                     <p>We’re not doing any of the things that we thought we would be doing now when we adopted S.</p>
                     <p>She doesn’t get invited anywhere herself and we don’t go with her anywhere, do we?</p>
                  </disp-quote>
               </p>
               <p>This is made worse when the themes overlap; for example, where there is marital breakdown, further increasing the sense of isolation. This in turn was reported as possibly enhancing the risk of depression in carers, which was shown to have an impact from the PSI data.<disp-quote>
                     <p>The other two children can go [to my ex-husband’s home] but you know, his partner doesn’t want R there because of something he may have done, or because of his interaction with their son, so I very rarely [go out], we don’t much get invited to friends’ houses when R is around, very rarely.</p>

               <title>Concerns about the future</title>
               <p>The final theme identified related to concerns about what would happen to the children in later stages of their development. Depending on the age of the child, this varied between anticipated difficulties faced in primary schools to how the child would manage in secondary education. Further longer-term implications as an adult, for example, if the individual would be able to live independently, also caused worry:<disp-quote>
                     <p>The professional said that we had no dreams or hopes for this child and I was putting him down and I said: ‘Yeah, he’ll be really good at maths and when he’s living out on the streets rough, he’ll be able to count how many cardboard boxes he’s got to live in that night.’</p>
                     <p>The long-term implications, that’s what everybody wants to know, you know what kind of life is the child going to have, what kind of difficulties that YOU are going to face.</p>
                     <p>Our big issue again is now going to be secondary school. That’s when we’re really, really worried.</p>

         <title>Discussion</title>
         <p>Consistent with our initial hypothesis, these results are similar to findings from other countries. People in the UK do struggle to obtain help for their children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0308575913477331">Brown and Bednar, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0308575913477331">Brown, Sigvaldason and Bednar, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0308575913477331">Brown, Bednar and Sigvaldason, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0308575913477331">Brown, Sigvaldason and Bednar, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0308575913477331">Caley, Winkelman and Mariano, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0308575913477331">Gardner, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0308575913477331">Gelo and O'Malley, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0308575913477331">Granitas, 2004</xref>).

            <title>Support and isolation</title>
            <p>Carers reported finding it difficult to care for a child with FASD in many different ways, but these were universally exacerbated by the perceived lack of support and isolation. The initial lack of information about potential difficulties in bringing up the children, and concern for their future, combined to prevent potential parents making informed decisions about adoption. This was associated with the later realisation that their decision increased the stress they experienced. This may well have contributed to the isolation they felt in contrast to the idea of what their lives may have otherwise been.</p>
            <p>One important difficulty relates to the amount of accurate information that can be predicted early in the child’s life. Information about a child’s longer-term potential may well be limited in the early years. For example, two children may well develop in different ways even though they were exposed to similar risks. This lack of clarity leaves many carers with a sense that professionals simply cannot advise them adequately. Considering that a recent study showed that up to 30% of a subgroup of children in the foster care system may well have prenatal drug and alcohol exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0308575913477331">Selwyn and Wijedesa, 2011</xref>), this is a potentially serious problem.</p>
            <p>Since 2002, the Adoption and Children Act highlights the importance of post-adoption support from social services and health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0308575913477331">Department for Children, Schools and Families, 2010</xref>). Studies suggest parents of children with FASD still feel unsupported and unskilled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0308575913477331">Neil, Cossaar and Young, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0308575913477331">Sellick et al, 2007</xref>). Helping these parents adapt their child-rearing skills to the needs of children with FASD, and encouraging parents not to blame themselves, may be key to longer-term reduction of stress in the family. It would be hoped that by doing this, the difficulties revealed by the PSI results in this study may be minimised.</p>

            <title>Adoption policy</title>
            <p>The results further raise questions about the strategies currently used by adoption and foster care services. The benefits of kinship adoption and staying with the family have been documented by several authors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0308575913477331">Aldgate and McIntosh, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0308575913477331">Children 1st, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0308575913477331">Department for Education, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0308575913477331">Department for Children, Schools and Families, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0308575913477331">Neil, Cossar and Young, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0308575913477331">Rushton, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0308575913477331">Sellick, 2007</xref>; Sellick et al, 2007). The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0308575913477331">Department for Education (2010)</xref> report underscores the complexity of how and why people are adopted and points out the need for continual support.</p>
            <p>The benefits of kinship care and staying together as a family (such as feelings of being loved, maintaining relationships with friends and family, and more stable, longer lasting placements) were affirmed by this research, even though there are often difficulties such as limited freedom, financial problems and overcrowding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0308575913477331">Department for Education, 2010</xref>). A report on fostered children in Scotland, for instance, estimated that 1400 children were in such placements, often with older carers, in particular grandparents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0308575913477331">Aldgate and McIntosh, 2006</xref>).</p>
            <p>Our findings suggest the need for more detailed research and for great care in policy implementation within the specific population of carers for children with FASD. Older carers found the children’s behaviours more difficult to manage and that children were easier to handle in a one-to-one situation, questioning some of the assumptions made about kinship care discussed above. Current policy may well be placing an unintentional burden on the carer. These results are not conclusive but do warrant further exploration in this population.</p>

            <title>Secondary disabilities</title>
            <p>Longer-term follow-up studies of people with FASD have highlighted difficulties with secondary disabilities and mental health vulnerabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0308575913477331">Famy, Streissguth and Unis, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0308575913477331">Gray and Mukherjee, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0308575913477331">Mukherjee, Turk and Hollins, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0308575913477331">Streissguth and O'Malley, 2000</xref>). However, these can be minimised by good parenting that specifically meets the needs of this groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0308575913477331">O'Connor, Kogan and Findley, 2002</xref>). Unfortunately our findings suggest that problems faced by parents as a result of not receiving support to modify parenting techniques combine with a perceived lack of recognition of difficulties by professionals to produce an inauspicious situation. There are opportunities to make a difference, but that requires that these difficulties be addressed.</p>

            <title>Limitations</title>
            <p>These results cannot be seen as conclusive as this was primarily an exploratory study to identify areas of deficit and guide future more focused research. As the number of participants was small, the power of the quantitative analysis was limited and should therefore be considered as an indicator of trends. Further, the ability to follow up themes identified was not always available as part of this project. In addition, while the original sampling frame was self-selected, randomisation was used for the focus groups. Thus, while the views presented clearly reflect the subgroup who took part, it may not represent the wider population.</p>

         <title>Conclusions and recommendations</title>
         <p>The results suggest that in the UK, carers of children with FASD feel unsupported and blamed. The difficulties they face are unexpected and could be reduced by more openness and discussion about possible longer-term outcomes. Ongoing post-adoptive support (both emotionally and financially, in keeping with other research) is likely to help. This needs to be balanced with closer investigation into which groups are best placed to bring up these children. The practice of placement with older foster carers and adopters may well need further investigation.</p>
         <p>While this is a small-scale study, some recommendations can be suggested from the findings. First, better training for professionals involved with these children. This should be correlated with better information for those looking to adopt, for example at the matching stage of the process. Second, specific access to training for parents around the needs of individuals with FASD, alongside ongoing support from both statutory and charitable organisations would be helpful for families. The outcomes of these would require evaluation to confirm their longer-term benefits. However, the findings here would suggest this may be a way to improve the outcomes faced by these children and their families.</p>
