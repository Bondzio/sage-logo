<abstract>
<p>Cultural studies took hold in the USA in the context of politics fronted by youth, multi-racial, and gender movements that emerged in the wake of the much larger Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s. With a full-blown academic legitimation crisis well under way, cultural studies resonated strongly with social struggles that shaped both its reception as well as its capacity to augment new intellectual academic formations. Retrieving the historical nexus questions views that treat and limit British cultural studies to being mainly an intellectual import-export phenomenon. The overlooked historical nexus fosters trivialization anad caricature of cultural studies’ incorporation in the American academia, resulting in both conservative antipathy and left disappointments feeding into the common binary narratives of the ‘failure’ of cultural studies for being <italic>too Marxist</italic> and <italic>not Marxist enough</italic>. Restoring the historical nexus underscores the value of cultural formations and projects Williams proposed, while cautioning theoreticist and methodological enclosures.</p>

<title>A preface of gratitude</title>
<p>The article that follows represents a set of reflections that were prompted by interviews published in this issue, which were carried out with Lawrence Grossberg, Andrew Ross, Janice Radway, George Lipsitz and Constance Penley.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1367549412449724">1</xref></sup> Adding to my motivations were conversations I had with Dick Hebdige, who resonated with the ideas and interests that formed this project. His contribution published here represents a melding of his reflections that look back at this classic study in <italic>Subculture: The Meaning of Style</italic> and carry forward with shared insights on the contours of his intellectual career. Taken together, I owe a deep gratitude to the individuals who have contributed so generously to the pages that follow this article.</p>
<p>As conceptualized and presented to the editorial board for consideration, this project was to center on interviews with individual scholars who have played a major role in cultural studies – directly, indirectly and ostensibly – in the USA. There were several goals in mind. Using an interview-conversational format, I wanted to capture and document in personal voice the reflections of those whom I interviewed. It was my wish to bring to a larger readership a feel for the personal engagement that these thinkers experienced, along with a recognition that their distinct efforts emerged in the context within which cultural studies was taking hold in the USA. Thus, my purposes were also quasi-documentary, with the intent to chart the interplay of intellectual work and historical circumstances.</p>
<p>Each of the interviews began with an attempt to achieve certain goals. A set of guidelines shaped the interviews. Although the questions varied considerably, I attempted to get at the following horizons: I sought to obtain their reflections of how they began their work as critical intellectuals, so aspects of personal biography were crucially important. It was imperative to get a sense of how they came to see issues, how they struggled in negotiating their way into challenging and confronting what would come to matter to them (and, by extension, cultural studies in the USA). Questions aimed to explore how they came to study and write, the places that shaped their ideas and careers and the initial intellectual problems, theories, issues and currents that they found most challenging. In addition I was hoping to understand better how they built their ideas and work. Reflecting on their own intellectual formations thus opened up the chance to ask them to reflect on work they had carried out, and of their current and future plans. With some of these aspects in front of us, we could proceed to probe particular aspects of their work – ideas, core problems and particular publications. This offered a chance to get at why certain concerns were felt to be central and crucial. This work-specific aspect of the interviews was meant to yield something of pedagogical value to those unfamiliar with such work and useful to newer generation of thinkers in cultural studies. Finally, the last part of the interviews hoped to explore reflection on the current juncture and offered a chance to assess present and unfolding crises and struggles that we ought to confront.</p>
<p>As the interviews neared completion, I began to sketch a short introduction to them. In it I ventured modestly into some issues of contextualization. I shared that first brief draft with my fellow editors – Pertti Alasuutari, Ann Gray and Joke Hermes. It was upon their encouragement and suggestion that I ought to push and expand on what my initial framing was introducing, that the following article came to be written. Without their support and trust in what I might contribute to the readership of this journal, this essay would not have emerged. I am deeply grateful for the stimulation and motivation they have given me and for their intellectual camaraderie that makes such thoughts – and risks – so welcoming.</p>
<p>The article that follows is the result of the interviews – wonderful conversations, actually – with Larry Grossberg, Andrew Ross, Janice Radway, George Lipsitz, Constance Penley and Dick Hebdige, and working with colleague Lisa Parks. Though greatly stimulated by their selfless generosity and seasoned acumen, there should be no assumption whatsoever that what I present below would be automatically endorsed by any of them. However, the careful reader will see in the totality of these pages how, where and to what extent I run with issues and themes that were generated in the interviews, as well as where I venture into additional interpretive terrain.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Cultural studies has been an intellectual enterprise for approximately four decades, and over this period it has achieved significant recognition. Since its inception in Britain in the 1970s it has become a transnational intellectual export finding ground in numerous countries throughout Europe, North America, Latin America, Asia and the Middle East. However, intellectual frameworks do not have fixity like other exports. A material export, such as a garment or car, leaves its home factory and arrives basically as intact as when it left; but such intactness seldom happens with ideas, let alone major intellectual frameworks. When intellectual frameworks travel they leave the fermentation from which they were nurtured, and there is no guarantee that the same mental investments – the historical, social, political and ideological impulses that enabled them to emerge and which are encoded in their form and purpose – will follow them to their next destination. With ideas, some aspects may travel well, while some may not. This is not perplexing; ideas usually change with changing situations. Ideas that are both the impetus for, as well as the culmination of, complex theoretical debates come with strong intellectual investment and a sense of hard-won achievements. It is not surprising that in the process of travel, changes in them can generate strong feelings. Such has been the case with British cultural studies. Ever since cultural studies began to move beyond Birmingham and the Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies (CCCS), it has had to negotiate transitional engagement with ensuing arguments and reassessments over what it initially was, and what it should or should not be. The process of ongoing debate seems persistent and intractable.</p>
<p>How cultural studies came to intersect social and intellectual developments in the USA is the primary aim of what I shall discuss. In the USA cultural studies has registered in important ways in most of the areas of the humanities and the social sciences, and its impact has been very valuable; yet many retrospective accounts reflect fretting and disappointment. In my assessment, while these views are formed with useful criticism, they overlook or simply occlude the conditions of reception and absorption of cultural studies, and do so by usually focusing on issues that are amplified to the point of crowding out developments which have contributed to the theoretical and analytical strengthening of critical intellectual discourse in the USA. The theoretical expansion that characterized the emergence of cultural studies in general, and the context that enabled it to take hold, deserve reflection and historical appraisal. Cultural studies took hold in the USA in a period in which important intellectual concerns were forged as part of modern social and cultural analysis. It was a period that engaged the articulation of new social movements within a context of much larger social, political and cultural transformations. As I hope to chart, the lessons to be gleaned suggest new questions relevant to cultural studies today.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1367549412449724">
<title>Cultural studies and the export–import model</title>
<p>In considering the mix of issues, problems and debates which have emerged in cultural studies in the USA, there appears to be a general and overriding perspective that frames much of what is critically discussed. This perspective begins with a sense of absolute beginnings, with cultural studies having an original theoretical and political impulse. Ensuing from this are various narratives of cultural studies going forth to multiply. This starting point rightly taps into the founding fermentation of cultural studies crucial to its development in Britain. Thus narratives follow cultural studies as it became something of an export item, and from this moment narratives begin to gather a sense of strong disappointment. In making the transition from Britain to the USA, cultural studies was weakened, watered down and the core of its critical spirit dissipated. This view, quite widespread, pivots more so over time on an argument that the importance of class and political economy were emptied out of cultural studies by its new adherents, who focused on cultural terrain and increasingly in ways that spindled the original critical perspective by turning toward problems of trivia and inconsequence – mainly through misguided foci on popular culture. This criticism also hinges on other symptomatic problems that specify serious and intransigent flaws: a view that attributed cultural studies’ dispossession that took place as it became incorporated and commodified, the outcome of accommodating to the pressures of the American university system.</p>
<p>A different but equally disappointed thematic (one shared by the Left and the Right) is a frustration with cultural studies’ initial mode of analysis and intellectual and theoretical orientation. This view orbits around the criticism that cultural studies did not develop and solidify around some recognizable set of methods or approaches. Thus, those sympathetic to cultural studies criticize it for not pushing ahead with more formalized approaches, while those not supportive of cultural studies lambast its lack of methodological formalism and pronounce it dead on arrival. In either case, the view is framed with the notion that methodological maturation, formalism and discipline-like rigor would clear things up and set things right for good. Those who embrace the initial spirit of cultural studies wish to see it operate with more objectifiable practices, methods and purposive consequences (e.g. cultural studies should conduct itself in ways that have allowed other disciplines to evade the crisis of illegitimacy); and those who find no value in cultural studies are quick to write it off. The weakness of cultural studies for not possessing paradigmatic formalism has been core to its criticism, and usually such criticism has been from established disciplines that already stake claims in the study of things cultural.</p>
<p>A further set of criticisms leveled at cultural studies has to do with some of its analytical content (along with methods or lack thereof). In addition to focusing on cultural trivia, these criticisms see cultural studies as floundering on the shoals of identity politics; gender, sexuality and ‘race’ are often implicated as the signifying siren-sites where cultural studies is mislocated and then wrecked. To put it another way, this view operates on the notion that the enterprise’s intellectual property is devalued when inhabited by such concerns – such subject matter is akin to an intellectual residential crisis that houses the wrong inhabitants.</p>
<p>Many of these criticisms come in knotted strands. They have their critical virtues and drawbacks, important insights and blind spots, but they are obfuscating in other ways. Shaped by an intrinsic overreliance on the export view, the problem is attributed either to a good thing gone awry, or to an import flawed from the outset. Both views obscure deeper and engaged developments between cultural studies and the social context in the USA, thus the conditions of engagement deserve to be retrieved. Undoubtedly such views, which are highly evaluative and critical, will sound familiar, and are symptomatic of intense debates. The value of their criticisms, the kinds of arguments that they best serve and the prescriptive work that they propose deserve to be illuminated. With the advantage of hindsight it is possible to identify some of the common views and how they account and mis-account for how cultural studies is understood. As I argue, grasping the conditions in which cultural studies became institutionally engaged requires an understanding of the aggravations within American society that were already in place, or which were being brought into negotiation with cultural studies.</p>
<p>Cultural studies began to have an impact in the late 1970s and early 1980s as it was absorbed into academic disciplines. In what follows, I chart aspects of the American context in which cultural studies was introduced. I take these steps in order to contrast the common and critical views noted above with a perspective that situates cultural studies within an educational context that was deeply engaged in brokering crises that were the result of the Civil Rights Movement, arguably the most important social movement in the USA over the entire 20th century. In taking this approach I hope to highlight two basic problems. First, we need to retrieve an understanding of the installing role that social movements played, enabling cultural studies to take hold in the American context. This view offers an important check on the political neatness that begins with the critique that cultural studies abandoned class – or at least the privileged ontology that class is given in perspectives governed by political economy. While this view has merit, it emerges in ways that fail to acknowledge the cultural prehistory of the deeply racialized antagonisms (which have class-related valences). When this criticism is later grafted on to the juncture in which cultural studies is absorbed, it harbors an unfortunate historical, if not outright political, amnesia. What ensues is an analytical dualism: the historical importance of cultural studies itself is trivialized by this abandonment, while amnesia simultaneously operates to trivialize subjectivity and identity issues that complicate class. As cultural studies is trivialized on the basis of such analytical errors, the arguments that seek to salvage class perspectives revert to the position that cultural studies could be redeemed if it returned to carrying out the older but rigorous approach to political economy and class – as if the theoretical irruption that we have come to know as western Marxism or cultural Marxism, which are so important to the broader intellectual crises that enabled cultural studies to emerge, had never existed. Second, the criticism of cultural studies as a British import that went sour, fell into disrepair, did not arrive intact and lost its way spirit by being contaminated in the American context, deserves to be rethought. This rethinking, I argue, requires that we move beyond the basic framework that begins with a simple ‘export of ideas’ model. What is needed is an exploration of the juncture in which a deeper set of shared historical, political and ideological conditions can be grasped, which help in understanding the issues surrounding how, when and why cultural studies was important to the American intellectual – e.g. academic – context. The routes and developments I examine suggest that the impact of cultural studies has been deeply significant, but this impact has taken the form of remarkable intellectual diffusion. The ‘export–import’ model of intellectual ideas (the dominant perspective) has predisposed many to expect something that cultural studies in the USA could never be: cultural studies failed to materialize into a ‘school’ (or schools and programs) that took on the relative (and reified) appearance of something kindred to the CCCS. While the export model encourages the kinds of perspectives I associate with common criticisms, it actually obscures the ability to recognize the important diffusion-based efficacy that cultural studies has had in the USA.</p>
<p>The common export view of cultural studies has its beginnings in Britain; cultural studies then traveled abroad. The presumptions of the export view runs into problems because the main narrative is locked into a somewhat fixed framework that mimics an older behavioral ‘stimulus → response’ communications model of ‘sender → receiver’. Obvious questions then ensue: how was cultural studies received? What was appropriated? What was modified, or adopted and perhaps distorted? What was ignored or not attended to? In other words, the export model comes with an explanatory grid that is linear and organized around origins and reception. However, the traveling of critical ideas is more complicated. I suggest that the important historical distinctiveness of British cultural studies shares deeper resonating currents with developments in the USA, and that there are good reasons to think through aspects that are constitutive as well as dialogic in a formative and conditional sense. To undo the dominant S–R model, I flag what I think is crucial in understanding the conditions within American society that account for the important value that cultural studies presented; and this has to be understood in relation to the intense and wrenching social movements that threw American society into upheaval. Cultural studies entered the American context in a very troubled and deeply conflicted moment in which the educational sphere was pulled into social antagonisms: it was pressured from below and outside by social groups that made unprecedented demands for inclusion and reform, and from above, to ameliorate and ‘cool out’ social unrest. Cultural studies also registered these developments, yet along different social, cultural and historical valences, as it responded to the larger juncture that enveloped Cold War politics, the solidification of post-war capitalism and the transformation of the entire cultural sphere, especially through the new developments of mass communication. Cultural studies entered the USA <italic>in medias res.</italic> Thus, my attention focuses on the earlier era of its engagement in the American context. Although there have been numerous recent attempts to propose new directions and challenges for cultural studies, I remain attuned to the historical nexus.</p>
<p>This revisitation does not offer a charting of cultural studies’ institutionalized history or its manifestations within specific departments – a ‘what happened, with whom and where’. Although that story has yet to be carefully told, I am not convinced of its importance. Neither am I interested in defining cultural studies and what it ‘really is’ (as has been repeatedly attempted); this challenge can quickly become as shifting as the various changing narratives which have ‘evolved’ to explain the USA invasion and occupation of Iraq; more generally, it beckons various intellectual enclosures. However, I note some of the principles that are arguably core to some of cultural studies’ founding impulses. I also do not adopt, dwell upon or deploy some of the popular evaluative positions that have become somewhat expected, which characterize critical as well as conservative (or Left and Right) perspectives. These tensions continue on their own.</p>
<p>Yet, not to slight: the critical and conservative views regarding cultural studies do matter, as they constitute many of the parameters and appraisals of cultural studies. On the one hand, there is a critical view that springs sympathetically but unfolds with dismay. Cultural studies is seen as undergoing erosion and losing significance: such developments come with disapproval and disappointment over the shortcomings or outright failure of cultural studies. Such views signal a mix of nostalgia, lament and even betrayal. Cultural studies, it is argued, is no longer the class act that it is supposed to be. The arguments often trot out the reductionist horse that cultural studies was apprehensive to always ride from the outset, even though class concerns often were recognized as crucial. The problem of class was not automatically given the affirmation of a resolute ontology; sometimes other cultural factors could be more salient in accounting for things, and this meant that historical openness could yield social dimensions that might trump the view of class as the alpha and omega of social analysis. From this view, cultural studies was not Marxist enough.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the conservative criticism of cultural studies pivots on the argument that the enterprise was too Marxist from the start. It began flawed, with the basic mistake of embracing the New Left and western Marxism. This more conservative criticism indicted cultural studies for its intellectually genetic, and thus chronic, confusion. Cultural studies was tarnished further by its undisciplined disregard for the history of established disciplines, whose simple existence and duration within academe was justification enough. Furthermore, each perspective held the view that cultural studies lacked a firm position, a committed method and far too much willful embrace of indeterminacy.</p>
<p>The irony is that both perspectives have some traction, but not enough to move ahead. Cultural studies did not embrace uncritically the received ontologies of orthodox Marxism and the attendant analytic schemas of a narrowed political economy. Lukacs’ interrogating probe, which problematized economic reductionism, suggested that the very notion of ‘orthodox Marxism’ was an oxymoron – especially with regard to how it promoted a formalist and ahistorical mode of analysis. Such criticisms were amplified in Gramsci’s writings, as he extended the critique of Marxist Party fondness for a positivist scientism that flirted with its own misrecognized theology. The unfinished challenges that signaled possibilities for complicating mechanistic approaches within Marx’s initial project, presented in the Introduction to the <italic>Grundrisse</italic>, became key to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1367549412449724">Stuart Hall’s (1974)</xref> important probes. Yet if cultural studies was too Marxist or not Marxist enough, it was because it took Marx seriously. It was impelled to engage with ensuing theoretical debates surrounding western Marxism and cultural Marxism, enough so to insist that the crises of capitalism, class and economy were crucial, but had to be reconciled with the rupturing problem of the cultural, and that this was not rendered simply by recourse to <italic>a priori</italic> resolution in theory or method. Not Marxist enough or too Marxist: both are scenarios that have grown over the last four decades to indict cultural studies for not being amenable to discipline. Cultural studies was successful in presenting a much-needed alternative to disciplinary rigidity, the source of its strength and continual ability for renewal. Yet it drew attacks for its failure to promote a sense of discipline and its anti-disciplinary posture. From the outset, cultural studies harbored the irony by having to work with this Janus-faced profile. It was caught in powerful crossfire. This has not changed.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1367549412449724">
<title>Projects and formations: the framework reassessed</title>
<p>Before turning to the American assimilation of cultural studies, I want to retain some of the challenges, issues, problems and conflicts that marked its inauguration in Britain. Even though four decades have passed, many of the formative issues remain relevant today. Holding in play early formative (and shared) problems alongside unique developments, as can be seen in the American case, helps to underscore distinctions and continuities that illuminate larger histories that tend to be overlooked.</p>
<p>Time engenders development and sometimes development breeds its own notions of moving things forward, of some kind of progress. Considering the intellectual and historical crossing and meshing of issues that spurred cultural studies into being in the first place, we might wonder: what of its legacy remains vital? Of its various theoretical engagements, which are still important? What has been resolved? Are there certain problems that remain intractable or naggingly recalcitrant? What can afford to be forgotten? What lessons have been learned or are still in need of being learned – or simply retrieved – as cultural studies continues to be voiced as an important intellectual enterprise? These questions have been, and continue to be, asked in a variety of ways and with regard to the various sites of cultural studies’ absorption and practice. Rehearsing things past is always a wager on and a claim to relevance. However, remembering also checks the rush to move things along (to advance cultural studies or to dismiss it); it pauses to consider things that are subject to forgetting. Forgetting can be strategic and intentional, with older ideas discarded for newer ones. But remembering seems crucial in this case, and is an antidote to the pitfalls of a presentism (the forgetting about formations, as warned by Williams) that pushes full speed ahead with emptied memories and a full tank of amnesia. The willful chant to just ‘get on with things’, sometimes for reasons more costly than profitable, is not always an intellectual virtue, although there is an air of it being so. As critical thought moves forward in high gear, eager to leave the past behind, there are times to pause, take stock of baggage shed or things gained, and of the things to hold on to. This, I think, applies to the case with regard to cultural studies more generally, its adoption in the American context more particularly, and its movement forward from the earliest moments to ongoing strategies for thinking it into the present.</p>
<p>I find it helpful to recall passages from Raymond Williams written shortly before his passing, in which he reflected on what might lie ahead for cultural studies. His remarks flagged what he felt was core to cultural studies, which was not a definition so much as a challenge that made cultural studies possible:
<disp-quote>
<p>I want to begin with the quite central theoretical point which to me is at the heart of cultural studies but which has not always been remembered in it and this is – to use contemporary terms instead of the rather more informal terms in which it was originally defined – that you cannot understand an intellectual or artistic project without also understanding its formation; that the relation between a project and a formation is always decisive; and that the emphasis of cultural studies is precisely that it engages with both, rather than specializing itself to one or the other [as this requires] the refusal to give priority to either the project or the formation.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>This was the ‘crucial theoretical intervention’ that constituted cultural studies. However, this very intellectual and analytical framework also applied to cultural studies itself:
<disp-quote>
<p>We have to look at what kind of formation it was from which the project of cultural studies developed and then at the changes of formation that produced different definitions of that project. We may then be in a position to understand existing and possible formations which would in themselves be a way of defining certain projects towards the future. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1367549412449724">Williams, 1989</xref>: 151–152)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The statement appears simple and cogent: hold on to the necessary and productive tension between a project and its formation – but this has proven to be enormously difficult, especially if dealing with complex modes of thought that also move from one social context to another. Projects may change in their new settings. The formation that initially mattered may not be so formidable in another context; a qualitatively different formation may eclipse an earlier one. Numerous attenuating circumstances make this task immediately complex. Yet, having a sense of bearings is the constant requirement, as formations never come neatly packaged or simple to unwrap. There is always some kind of starting point in carrying out this principled approach, and it too is likely to be interpretively contentious.</p>
<p>For starters then: cultural studies emerged out of the post-war/Cold War, mid-century upheavals in which major transnational political and ideological realignments were in movement. It is no accident that the primary theoretical axes with which cultural studies felt compelled to work were associated with a modernity that was adjudicating the larger tensions of the Marxian legacies: the nation-state orthodoxies; the new arcs of transhistorical forces; the various irruptions within Marxism that took form as ‘western’ and ‘cultural’ Marxism; and wrenching efforts to grasp and understand the fractures and reconsolidations of mid-20th-century capitalism. Cultural studies also inherited the major issues of the old Left and the New Left, but it was the new and newly-available theoretical productivity associated with the New Left that enabled cultural studies to emerge and flourish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1367549412449724">Gray, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1367549412449724">Hall, 1990</xref>). The installing work of key founders such as Raymond Williams, E.P. Thompson and Richard Hoggart can be read as particular attempts to work with these political inheritances and merge them with new theoretical contributions. To state things so generally is already sufficient to sense a context so ripe for refracting intense conflicts across the spheres of social and political theory. With its inaugural intervention into the theoretical, political and social problems in contemporary British society, cultural studies struggled to comprehend, take stock, address and critique the debates on how to grasp the problem of culture. This required engaging a host of interpretive frameworks, including but not limited to the Marxian theoretical legacy, traditional and critical theory within the ongoing economic irruptions of an advancing capitalism, the legacies of inherited ideologies, the characteristics of the social formation – and, of course, persistent questions of class, but quickly after its inception, made more complicated by racial and ethnic diasporas and an increasingly pressing recognition of gender – and all this unfolding against an omnipresent and pervasive mass-mediated culture.</p>
<p>Beyond exploring theories, the CCCS sought its own arenas of interpreting the moment’s inheritance and demands. It mobilized students and faculty, it launched studies, it published papers and monographs, it literally intervened in the academy’s epistemological order of things while it simultaneously experimented with pedagogy. It posed ways of rethinking the knotty relations that manifested as culture and culture’s embeddedness with the problems of how history, social formations, economies, politics, ideologies and regimes of power were complicit in, and constitutively involved, the sprawling terrain of institutions and the state. In so doing it disordered, disembedded, dislocated and unsettled erstwhile grids of explanation; it pushed hard, consistently and consciously on the logics and boundaries of established knowledge formations.</p>
<p>By willingly occupying such a nexus of tensions, cultural studies had to have a particular audacity and verve for without such, cultural studies would likely have withered, perhaps not even leaving a trace of something striving to be born. One such major impulse was the willingness to traverse established knowledge formations and to reject disciplinary fidelities in exchange for transdisciplinary interrogations and appropriations. It is not surprising, then, that it was met with a range of responses that ran the gamut from strong endorsement to purging punishment. Thus on the one hand, cultural studies offered a much-needed breath of fresh air, rekindling life into a moribund and ossified body of social thought, and enabled a reinvigorated sense of theoretical and political relevance to bear upon the new social and cultural formations of contemporary life. On the other, it was castigated as being wrong-headed, fostering (un)intellectual naivete, a thorn in the side of those who felt that they had earned their professionalized walks in life and were not to be tripped up by unleashed interlopers trespassing upon sanctified intellectual property. Cultural studies found fans and enemies. Thus the gamut of responses to cultural studies ran along expected lines.</p>
<p>Historical narratives and recollections of the founding years have been written along the way, and there are no shortages of documents that capture aspects of this important intellectual development. They range from brief and personal anecdotes to intense recall of various kinds of engagements, to biographical profiles. The composite sets of images that have emerged are just as passionate and varied, as are the responses to the terrain of issues and ideas that cultural studies attempted to confront, and for so many social and historical reasons. There are those actual sensibilities of carrying out the work, which take the form of testimonials to critical awakenings, of war stories and accounts of battle scars, of problems opened and closed, of intensely partisan orbits around particular issues, as well as a keen feel for inhabiting the shifting ground between institutional collusion and collision. Many of Stuart Hall’s writings convey the complex challenges of work carried out in complicated milieus, for Hall has been exceptionally eloquent in reflecting analytically on the steps that merged problems and questions, clarifying the historico-theoretical terrain that shaped and governed unavoidable perspectives and discourses, and stating the urgent stakes involved in the very act of intellectual and analytical engagement. Many others who have reflected on cultural studies have continued to inhabit such tensions; hence the frequent and valuable accounts that impart a unique sense of selves involved and engaged in intellectual horizons that enabled the grasp and synthesis of some of the most important social, cultural, political and theoretical dialogues of the era.</p>
<p>The sprawl of observations and accounts and the sense of investment and commitment – as well as the external opposition to cultural studies – are understandable. They also share in the constitution of cultural studies. More a verb than a noun, the notion of cultural studies as an intellectual project, conceived here in this broadest and fundamental sense, meant that it was not a readied formalist paradigm. Indeed, the contrast between these two orientations was provocative as well as antagonistic, and it remains so today. It is difficult to hold on to with ease the notion of a project that strives (in this case) to operate with an openness to the interplay of theory and politics, that tries to work at a transdisciplinary level, that seeks to hold on to a historically attuned flexibility of sentiment and sensibility while struggling in the discrete moments of living on the ground, as it were – since living day-to-day always feels much more a condition than a project. The appeal of formalization and paradigmatic order certainly offers comfort if it produces a sense of feeling in possession of (or feeling compelled to normalize ourselves to) models and paradigms, for they offer guidance and procedures and keep things in check (and are rebuffed as well as rewarded).</p>
<p>Project or paradigm? Sensibility or system? Informed indeterminateness or formalized certainty? It is not surprising that many of the ensuing debates around cultural studies, especially as it gained transnational mobility, would center on the inherent tension between the notion of project as a theoretical and political sensibility and the impulse to encapsulate things into a program and paradigm that could be grounded in selective issues, questions and notions of method: what enables smooth entry into the trade of institutional currencies. Thus the gamut of views always abound. Certainly, cultural studies endured the shifting fate of an enterprise with intense commitments on its behalf, but also vituperative diatribes celebrating its faults, if not failures. The tensions intrinsic to project and program are rooted in attempting to tack back and forth between them, which Williams saw as fundamental. To the extent that cultural studies is a project, it inherits this condition. Moving back and forth between these two positions, straddling them if possible, required one foot in the project and the other in a program. How well or problematically this is carried out offers a way to read historical accounts as well as the current diagnostics and prognostics of cultural studies, past and present.</p>

<title>Brokering abroad: initiating challenges and dilemmas</title>
<p>Delving into the knotty peculiarities of the American case requires that we keep in mind strands of commonality and exchange that were important in both the British and the American situations (and perhaps having some relevance to other situations). Some of these shared ties appear to be lost – indeed, they may not have been important or even perceived – in the rapid assimilation, or talk thereof, of cultural studies becoming ‘incorporated’ into the academy, along with a host of appraisals regarding the virtues and drawbacks that this intellectual development entailed. I pause to reflect on the so-called ‘incorporation’ moment in order to retrieve relations that raise and sharpen issues that bear on evaluating projects and programs falling under the rubric of cultural studies.</p>
<p>As cultural studies was being resisted in Britain, it began to flourish abroad, gaining traction in new contexts willing and able to absorb it, even though the recognized unsettledness intrinsic to its formative framework remained. In the American case the adoption and adaptation of cultural studies was met with both appreciation and consternation. However, there was the added conflict among those committed to cultural studies that involved debates shaped by the process of cultural studies moving from Britain to other settings (I will return to this below). There were –and remain – many who rejected and dismissed cultural studies outright, as was the case with its inception in Britain. Nonetheless, there was a markedly broader willingness to host cultural studies in the American academy, a sharp contrast to the case in Britain. In the American context cultural studies could find new traction, although there were many who (and who still) viewed it with a jaundiced gaze emanating from the gatekeeping work of traditional disciplines and paradigms. As a CCCS-centered enterprise, cultural studies’ key disposition toward transdisciplinary work could emerge in concentrated form through its working papers. The array of writings affiliated with the CCCS and its intensity of mission, shifting urgencies, theoretical engagements and accommodations to ongoing as well as emergent projects were published as stenciled papers and working papers. Fortunately, many of these papers from the CCCS’s archives have been republished, some for the first time, which now give us access to the range of problems taken up in work generated there (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1367549412449724">Gray et al., 2007</xref>). Given its highly centralized operation, the migration of cultural studies to the diffuse context of the USA would immediately alter its identity as an intellectual project.</p>
<p>It was not surprising that the application of cultural studies to other contexts would involve appropriations that shared many of CCCS’s interests. The nexus of theory and politics that Hall identified in the inheritance of ‘old’ and ‘new’ theoretical discourses were just as much a vibrant tradition in the USA, and rooted in an already heated legacy of social moments. Yet, there were different conflicts in the USA that resonated with the uneasy relationship between intense civil strife and academe. Thus, the appropriation of cultural studies would develop attachments to different problems, questions and interests. As to be expected, there was strong debate about the origins of cultural studies, its relevance and adaptability. While predictably, traditional disciplinarians fretted over cultural studies, those who embraced it vented frustration with the notion that cultural studies was being weakened, watered down, even betrayed and defiled, its political importance withering to become merely another academic enterprise. As it was appropriated by and applied in new and different contexts, others argued that cultural studies was never meant to be rigidly interpreted and reified into a paradigm or school, that it was never constructed to be one thing, and so moving to another social context inevitably would entail transformation. Yet, it also could be expected that cultural studies would continue to expand its challenge, to unsettle presumably settled views and disciplinary comforts, while also lending itself to various applications that could ran the gamut from intellectual query to concrete political struggles. By the early 1990s cultural studies had hosted a broad set of topics, problems and interests as it proliferated in new contexts – but not as a body of readily compatible ideas, problems or approaches. Debates and contentions aside, such diverse perspectives also underscored the new contributions that cultural studies could make to both academic and non-academic concerns.</p>
<p>In the American context it is helpful to flag two quite important publications that capture well the period in which cultural studies began to be recognized as having taken hold, for better or worse. I do so not to mark textual origins for cultural studies, but rather to illustrate the presence and transitory qualities of certain intellectual strands that coexist as contextually significant. In both cases, the publications mark important and multiple lines of force (socially rooted developments) and thought (theoretical engagements) that enable such documents to emerge (as symptoms rather than causes). In summer 1983 a large conference was convened at the University of Illinois. Many of its presentations were published in <italic>Marxism and the Interpretation of Culture</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1367549412449724">Nelson and Grossberg, 1988</xref>). A second conference held in spring 1990, also at the same institution, reflected a more focused orientation to cultural studies per se. These presentations and contributions were published in <italic>Cultural Studies</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1367549412449724">Grossberg et al., 1992</xref>). Eight years passed between these two conferences, yet both documents reflect in distinct ways the discovery, assimilation and tensions over what cultural studies could or could not, or should or should not be in the American context. I reflect on these two publications because they signal important moments in the assimilation of cultural studies into the American academy.</p>
<p><italic>Marxism and the Interpretation of Culture</italic> represents a deep engagement with the sympathetic yet critical relationship with Marxism, centering often on the challenge and need to overcome the separation of culture from social, political and economic relations. In this regard, the period of the early 1980s marked an ever-widening appraisal of critical thought which had moved along multiple fronts and beyond an older orthodoxy of a hermetically privileged approach to political economy. The tensions that manifested in the new critical spirit were not new; indeed, they had been well underway since the mid-century, and were taking shape in the post-war political atmosphere that grew in intensity with the deepening of the Cold War and concomitant struggles involving geopolitical realignments that were emerging in both East and West. Many of the theoretical reassessments centered on a ‘troubled’ Marxism (rooted mainly in notions of orthodoxy and its discontents) and a growing and concerted need to ‘trouble’ Marxism (interjecting problems into orthodoxy that demanded inclusion and rethinking – e.g. culture). There were problems within an older legacy of Marxism increasingly viewed as having become ossified theoretically and inflexibly encased in nationalist applications; there were implications in theory as well that were recognized as having been sidelined and muted; and there were historical developments linked to new formations as well as additionally complex spheres of subjectivity. These and other problems culminated in a host of new problems which had to be brought to Marxism and the extent to which Marxian theory did or did not offer meaningful accounts. These debates involved issues that had simmered for decades, and many of them irrupted as core concerns of an emergent western Marxism or cultural Marxism. Many of these concerns were duly noted on many occasions within the theoretical challenges that informed British cultural studies, precisely because they were being transposed onto terrains of everyday life, thus becoming currents in both academic-centered intellectual struggles and manifested in the subjects and objects of new critical enquiry. Thus the nexus of problems being honed in Britain offered possibilities of a cultural studies relevant to USA thinkers, who also registered the historical ruptures brought in by mid-century social upheavals that bookended the Cold War era. The writings registered in the 1983 proceedings which culminated in <italic>Marxism and the Interpretation of Culture</italic> offer a sense of the juncture in which British cultural studies became relevant in the USA and in the context of new theoretical ruptures.</p>
<p>Yet it is interesting to note that in the 1983 proceedings, the editors flagged ‘cultural practices’ (not cultural studies) as the provocative terrain that required exploration. Contributors to the edited volume represented a rather remarkable transnational sprawl of intellectuals, theoreticians and cultural practitioners, each offering provocative reflections on a wide range of issues, but having some bearing on the emergent and urgent problem of culture. The proceedings also captured the sense of something breaking into visibility, a recognition of a larger and shared notion that intellectual business as usual – from an ossified Marxism to entrenched academic disciplinarity – was woefully inadequate to confront the new junctures, and that new possibilities of thought and practice were plausible and necessary. Many of the presentations, as did the conference as a whole, refracted the larger intellectual currents that were being accommodated within social and cultural theory, especially the widespread critiques of economic reductionism and the cultural crises – or the crisis of culture – within Marxian theory. It was a period in which the legacy of the Soviet Union was undergoing political transformation under the <italic>glasnost</italic> movement, while neo-conservative politics in the West (pushed especially by the USA and Britain in the Reagan–Thatcher alignment) was in ascendancy. In addition, theoretical developments were undergoing major reconsideration, with the emergence of critical assessments of representation championed by poststructuralism, deconstructionism and postmodernism. These theoretical impulses were never rigid and autonomous, as they were often critically engaged, sometimes caustically and irreconcilably, with Marxian theory. Moreover, these intellectual incursions were joined by the growing tensions that sprung from new (or perhaps the return of repressed) social subjectivities, especially expressed in feminist and racial forms of identity theorizing, with each developing and expanding upon larger and important aspects of problems of culture. Taken as a whole, the writings in <italic>Marxism and the Interpretation of Culture</italic> present the flash of issues opening onto multiple fronts, each demanding to be critically fathomed, if not integrated. The perspectives also convey the provocation that intellectual work was quickly moving beyond staid disciplinary confines, and opening up to increasingly urgent needs of exchange and risk.</p>
<p>The follow-up conference, which took place several years later and was captured in 1992 in <italic>Cultural Studies</italic>, remained equally stimulating and provocative with its wide range of contributors. However, unlike the proceedings from the first conference, the term ‘cultural studies’ became a central object of intense concern and took on the notion of something potentially objectifiable – which also meant that it (whatever it was) could be wrestled over. The modes of objectifying and questioning cultural studies also served as grounds to object to as well as affirm. The title of the publication highlighted the significance of British cultural studies’ incorporation into American critical discourse. As a dominant intellectual thematic, cultural studies was realized as having traveled to social, historical, cultural and political sites different from its inception in Britain. It was being carried out and in many sites, although nowhere was it centralized as it had been in Birmingham. What it was, what it ought to be and what was happening to it, along with many questions of its intellectual and political fate, were subjected to strong debate. In 1990 Stuart Hall had written an important critical reflection on cultural studies in which he reiterated earlier positions on the juncture of history and intellectual formation. In that writing, he noted how cultural studies in Birmingham was not the only way to do cultural studies: cultural studies ‘has been ever since, an adaptation to its terrain; it has been a conjunctural practice. It has always developed from a different matrix of interdisciplinary studies and disciplines’, and even in Britain the ‘three or four places bold enough to say they are offering courses in cultural studies have different disciplinary roots, both in the humanities and the social sciences’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1367549412449724">Hall, 1990</xref>: 11). Hall’s assessment actually was refracted in the contentiousness over what to make of cultural studies as it moved into different social and theoretical spaces.</p>
<p>The insurgent growth and mobility of cultural studies could not help but conjure difficulties in relating origins with new applications. As a publication, cultural studies signified this new juncture. The edited volume is a valuable document, yet a selective archive, of views within or significantly related to cultural studies. It presented a broad range of perspectives but also served as a sphere attracting fierce arguments over the identity and fate of cultural studies, the problems that it engaged and the issues and fronts that remained major challenges. The contributions throughout <italic>Cultural Studies</italic> illustrate numerous attempts to reposition and restate the stakes in cultural studies. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1367549412449724">John Stratton and Ien Ang (1996)</xref>, in a telling manner, also criticized the book in another edited book (devoted to Stuart Hall), arguing for a rethinking of cultural studies in relation to reconceptualizing a subversive subalternity. They acknowledged cultural studies as a <italic>tour de force</italic>, but then quickly noted its largess (800 pages, 40 papers and derived from a conference attended by some 900 people). In Stratton and Ang’s account, the value of cultural studies rapidly evaporated; it transformed into the grotesque. The book was described as ‘monstrous’ and a failure as a ‘map’: ‘Just like Frankenstein’s unnamed larger-than-life creation, <italic>Cultural Studies</italic> is an excessive book.’ The book was then equated by analogy through another analogy – a quote from Borges is deployed, which refers to how an overdrawn or wrongly drawn cartography can be woefully distorting. Cultural studies was reduced to a bad map that would fall into disuse for its inherent ‘Platonic formulations of representation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1367549412449724">Stratton and Ang, 1996</xref>: 363).</p>
<p>The temptation to draw up cartographies based on assessing the holdings of an archive – an edited book in this case – is always seductive. Stratton and Ang sought to uncouple cultural studies from its historically formative moments, acknowledging its spreading (transnational) influence and how such developments raised the ‘impossibility of a global cultural studies’ navigable by one dominant map. This appeared to be a reasonable move: in essence, it reiterated Hall’s argument, but Stratton and Ang’s review pivoted toward a different motivation: a search for a <italic>subversive subaltern</italic>. What subject? Where to find? Stratton and Ang then argued that ‘the most <italic>subversive</italic> “international” cultural studies <italic>rendez-vous</italic> was held in Taipei, Taiwan in 1992’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1367549412449724">Stratton and Ang (1996)</xref>: 386; emphasis added) and represented the ‘first international cultural studies conference in a non-western context’. From this they concluded to ‘characterize the position of “Taiwanese” cultural studies in relation to all versions of western cultural studies as subaltern’ (p. 387). Aside from staking out moves of re-authentication, the thematic pitched in this case is a concern for where intellectual meetings take place. The proposition might strike one as reminiscent of an older spirited debate once vibrant but now dormant in Marxism: the problem of actually existing socialism. In this case the problem appeared to be aimed at pinpointing an actually existing subaltern conference location.</p>
<p>There are reasons to be critical about ideas that emerge in one setting but are applied to different contexts, as problems of dislocation and relocation do alter meanings. However, similar problems emerge in the moves suggested in locating subalternity, and here we need to pause on the problems involved when critical terminology is transposed from one setting to another. The term ‘subaltern’ is an informative example of why we should pay attention not just to theoretical and programmatic transpositions, as is the case with British cultural studies traveling ‘abroad’, but also to the way in which terms are disconnected and redeployed, for what purposes and with a sense of what new traction is gained or lost. There is nothing intrinsically easy or neat about theorizing that aims to reconstitute the meaning of subaltern, and it is reshaped in postcolonial frameworks for identifying, tracking and grasping what accounts for positionally fixed or diasporically dislocated subjects in relation to conceptualizations of power that serve as the operational definition of subalternity. Subalternity subjected to diasporic forces (movement of subjects and subject matter) is complicated by an ontology of origins (national, geographic, ethnic, racial, etc.) inherent in both terms. Subjects (which in this case, include people, intellectual theories and projects) that are subjected to diasporic forces and conditions that result in mobility (forced or willed) are presumed to have begun somewhere, to be going somewhere, to land somewhere; and they may be subjected to constant dislocation (perhaps traveling in ways that are not just material, spatial or geographic, but even ideological and psychic). Thus transformations (including the impact on identity, making the latter fluid) happen in movement – which can be extended and applied to theories and politics (much like what the history of ideas or intellectual histories have long suggested) – which is the case for subaltern as a term.</p>
<p>However, as an edited book, <italic>Cultural Studies</italic> is fundamentally a collection of ideas, a moment of writings that refract ideas of conference attendees and emanated from a gathering in the USA which, in itself, would accrue its own particular problems. It is not a map; if anything it is a historically momentous archive, open of course to questions of representation, and in its moment and on its pages, we see cultural studies taking on a broad range of sensibilities which are intensely debated. If one sought and wanted order, direction and paradigmatic neatness – or a better venue for subalternist validation based on new and better subject-positioning, and all the re-theorizing that such a move implies – this was not to be found in this text. In his review, Frederick Jameson summed up the text, not as a map with its virtues and limitations, but as symptomatic of a particular desire.</p>
<p>If <italic>Cultural Studies</italic> was flawed in ways presumably rectified by relocating discourses outside the West, American sociologists of culture rejected both this text and British cultural studies as a field of analysis, not because of a failed mapping that warranted redrawing, but because it failed ‘in its professed goal’. According to these sociologists, the major flaw was not in its being too western; it was western enough. What it lacked was proper intellectual accents. More precisely, cultural studies had the wrong western accents: it was overly Marxian, and this was measured by neglecting the inclusion of American cultural sociologists rooted in Weberian and Durkheimian paradigms. The problem, it was argued, is that ‘Neo-Marxist strands of British and French cultural studies’ come with an insularity that excludes ‘the large and impressive body of work by sociologists as DiMaggio, Griswold, Wuthnow and Lamont’, as well as ‘Wagner-Pacifici, Zarubevel, Alexander and Seidman’. What is immediately noteworthy about these named sociologists is that they are identified by their corresponding insularity from Marxism: they represent ‘not only the distancing [in their work] from Marxist language but also a much stronger emphasis on the relative autonomy of cultural actions and meaning systems’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1367549412449724">Sherwood et al., 1993</xref>: 374). In short, these American sociologists were cast as offering a viable double-move: to get away from Marxism and to get at culture’s ontological and autonomous foundations, and with this came an objective or objectivizing grasp of the autonomy of culture. Interestingly, we are presented here with a mirror of ontologically oppositional inversions: Marxism’s flaw in positing the autonomy of economy is rectified by positing the autonomy of culture. This kind of dualism and dichotomization was precisely what the more theoretical reflections in cultural studies often addressed and sought to get beyond.</p>
<p>Whether finding redemption by relocating beyond the West, or erring by ignoring core figures in western sociology, these juxtaposed views each posit their own distinct issues regarding cultural studies as it found its way out of Britain and into new appropriations and critiques. Both cases highlight quite oppositional tendencies while attempting to reset theorizing and approach and posing their own notions of what is at stake and how to move ahead. While emanating from quite different intellectual perspectives, both illustrate an impulse to purge wrong-headedness and secure a new coherency; both seek some variation of re-theorized and re-disciplined thought, along with presumably fine-tuning the proper analytical enclosures and situated definitions that might bring one closer to an acceptable feel for what is preferred epistemologically.</p>
<p>To return to cultural studies’ moves abroad: the examples raised thus far begin to signal the growing complexity and contention that cultural studies would invariably encounter in and beyond the West. They are symptomatic but not exhaustive of the new complexities. However, what interests me is not the problem of bad cartography or the neglect of the core figures within a discipline’s subfield. Whether we dwell on an edited book or an intellectual sphere, I do not wish to suggest, as do many of its embracers or detractors, that cultural studies has had a monopoly on wheel-spinning, ideational sprawl while moving along in a parade of problems and probes, characterized by irreconcilable arguments, incommensurabilities, wrong starting points or wrong conclusions – that is the stuff of open discord fueled by various analytical comfort and preferred approaches.</p>
<p>As for sociology, often considered deeply kindred to cultural studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1367549412449724">Inglis, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1367549412449724">Morley, 2007</xref>), it is instructive to note what Randall Collins, a leading American sociologist, had to say about the discipline around the time that cultural studies was entering the American intellectual horizon. According to Collins, sociology had absolutely no sense of core or center. His view is valuable to quote at length:
<disp-quote>
<p>The deepest part of our intellectual malaise, then, is due to crises in the making of intellectual careers today. Wide recognition of intellectual accomplishment seems so much less likely to happen; persons who are elevated – either through the publishing business, the electoral process of professional associations or the vagaries of college reading lists – can only satisfy the intellectual alliances of comparatively small parts of the total intellectual field and hence seem illegitimate to adherents of other specialties. Mathematical sociologists, historical Marxists (and non-Marxian historical sociologists, nonhistorical Marxists, etc.), phenomenologists, analysts of contemporary social problems, organizational researchers and others seem scarcely to recognize the names of the eminent practitioners in specialties other than their own. There are no longer rival theories and alliances within a single intellectual field; instead, we have become <italic>congeries of outsiders to each other</italic>, unable to see what the rivalries actually are in other fields and hence prone to view the statements of those whose names do ‘accidentally’ stick up above the watermark as arbitrary and meaningless. Hence the vituperation that permeates our intellectual life today, when members of one subfield look out at the specialties beyond. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1367549412449724">Collins, 1986</xref>: 1340; emphasis added)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>It would be a mistake to think of Collins’ observation as out of date. At the risk of humor, it is tempting to compare Collins’ description of sociology with the painstaking attempts in some of the best aspects of early British cultural studies, where there were unique moves to embrace, interrogate, compare, contrast and merge various theoretical traditions – from Marx’s writings to Marxism’s ‘cultural’ and ‘western’ packages; semiotics, literary theory, structuralism and poststructuralism; media and communication theory and studies, subcultural and deviance or criminology theory. When one looks at a weighty collective work such as <italic>Policing the Crisis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1367549412449724">Hall et al., 1978</xref>) as an intellectual project, and in contrast with Collins’ description of sociology, <italic>Policing the Crisis</italic> demonstrates what sociology would appear to lack: a highly unusual sense of necessary intellectual integration and corresponding gravity, even as it engages in disparate and far-flung problems. Moreover, cultural studies practitioners were generally in conversation – even though at times they were at each other’s throats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1367549412449724">Hall, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1367549412449724">Johnson, 1997</xref>). In contrast, sociology in Collins’ view appears to be something like a Tower of Babel or of prisoners happy in solitary confinement, who have their niche beyond which little more matters. More important to note is that Collins’ inside view of entrenched sub-specialization is not sociology-specific; it resonates accurately in many disciplinary fields. After all, it is in the spirit of academic professionalization to pursue the twin paths of specialization and area demarcation. Moreover, as with other disciplines, sociology is well capable of harboring quite discrepant interpretations on this account: Weber would flag this as a moment in modern rationalization; Durkheim would note the expanded competition within an intellectual discipline as a case of moral density that is likely to produce a presumably appeasing segmentation and subdivision; and Lukacs would indict the reification of specialized knowledge fields as a symptomatic refraction of modernity’s relentlessly competitive commodification manifesting in intellectual work itself. Collins’ criticism is not about things mysterious, given how the reward structures within intellectual fields come with an incessant march along paths of a rationalized division of intellectual labor, pivoting on the expertise that champions the realm of things demarcated and discrete and constructing walled-in systems of specialist recognition. Rigorous focus comes with license to ignore the problems that are conveniently screened out and beyond the pale of favored cases, sites, theories and methods. Nonetheless, given Collins’ description of sociology and the period of observation, it is ironic that many practitioners of sociology (and other fields in the humanities and social sciences) at this very time were quick to indict cultural studies as having nothing to say, or of speaking with the wrong analytic accents, or worse yet, trapped in bedlam and flirting with the seduction of the innocent who would follow the new Pied Pipers.</p>
<p>Even in their sprawl, the tenor and fretting in the probes and positions reflected in the pages of <italic>Cultural Studies</italic> were provocative – unnervingly so. They also embodied many of the tensions noted in the earliest accounts of the CCCS’s formative years, but now they were occurring beyond Britain and were being writ large, as cultural studies was brokered upon an increasingly larger terrain of actors, institutions and contexts. Moreover, inverse relations appeared to take hold: as cultural studies moved outward and encountered new contexts and an ensuing proliferation of interests, there was a sense of looking inward to a notion of what had been or should remain as the core and formative issues. Hence, the intensity over the query for moorings, the reassessment of histories and the challenge of the present and what might lie ahead. In perusing any of the numerous accounts, key questions invariably emerged. As cultural studies traveled, was there something to fix and pin down? Was there something that had to be firmly known and reached through a strategically efficacious focus? Were aspects of the past and moments of inception no longer relevant? If consensus and focus were not available – or at least not generally shared – would the present turmoil with which cultural studies was associated doom its future? Should cultural studies resist being held too rigidly, so as to avoid the intellectual closure of a discipline? Should cultural studies accept multiple angles – and the coinciding notion of pluralist unraveling – in the spirit of multiplying interests and topics? Should some domains be given far more importance than others – and if so, always, or just in certain circumstances? Which, if any, key factors or concepts should retain their urgency and gravity? The strains in the various writings published in <italic>Cultural Studies</italic> – marvelous, actually, when we re-read this text today – suggest more a creative, critical and valuable self-conscious cacophony than a useless cartography.</p>
<p>In the fervor of intellectual expansion and the flurry of topical proliferation, one of the strongest criticisms was that cultural studies was being ‘incorporated’, ‘commodified’ and ‘institutionalized’: terms that signaled with negative apprehension a creeping condition that purportedly came with cultural studies’ acceptance in the American academy. There were numerous criticisms for things going awry. A common argument was aimed at text-centric approaches in literary studies (the autonomy of texts as the unconscious and transcendent literary moment kindred to the autonomy of culture). In the early 1980s, literary studies could ponder the American literary theorist Stanley Fish’s influential question: ‘Is there a text in this class?’ Cultural studies had altered this proposition a decade earlier: ‘What does a text have to do with class?’ The inversion was not unusual or theoretically novel. In some ways the criticisms leveled at approaches that embraced literary autonomy – which had its roots in the post-Leavis and new criticism critiques – boiled down to the notion that the problem of class was being usurped by classrooms that dealt only with texts. The seminar room walled off society. There was, after all, an early concern in British cultural studies to transcend the separation between education and publics: this took the form of adult education (an engagement initiated by Leavis and carried forward by both Williams and Hoggart). Over time, higher learning had become severed from working-class and middle-class communities. Reinvigorating and carrying forward this tradition meant that popular knowledge and practices rooted in historical struggles ought to be challenged through a critical rethinking of strategies aimed at adult education. What should a contemporary cultural pedagogy seek to accomplish? As was often the case in adjudicating politics and the academy, such concerns came with the tension of seeing cultural studies as offering a politically focused sensibility, on the one hand, and as a flexible and supple enterprise, on the other.</p>
<p>The initiating impulses behind cultural studies certainly included a strong focus on confronting the problems of capitalism and class formation: these were always central concerns in the widest reaches of western Marxism and refracted in founding arguments and writing in British cultural studies. However, there were new intellectual irruptions which had nettlesome relations with the mold of class, and which were not easily reducible to class. The problem of ‘race’ and gender soon challenged the more general categorical imperatives of a Marxian legacy so deeply centered on class and political economy. Stuart Hall’s reflections on cultural studies, published in <italic>Cultural Studies</italic>, recalled the conflict between general theoretical work and the ‘interruptions’ of theoretically marginalized subjects of gender and ‘race’, as both social categories forced a reconfigured understanding of power, politics and hegemony (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1367549412449724">Brunsdon, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1367549412449724">Hall, 1992</xref>). His language captures the sense of how these two issues appeared to classical Marxism as if from outer space, and outside the established problems of theory more broadly. The concern was not about discovering ‘race’ or gender, but rather of acknowledging the insurgency of a social problem that was critically recognized already, yet largely eclipsed by the received canonical emphasis on class. Here it is crucial to note that the complications reflected early on in the expansion of problems taken up by British cultural studies were symptomatic also of the intellectual and social tensions that were well underway in the USA. The theoretical agonisms introduced by the problems of ‘race’ and gender were deeply grooved in the politics of academia already, and they emerged to problematize the near-ontological notion of class. Such shared tensions mark mutual developments within British cultural studies and American social conflicts at the moment in which cultural studies was being assimilated by American thinkers.</p>
<p>These observations open up the need to reflect on the larger context in which a confluence of issues, problems and interests shaped the period in which cultural studies became important in the USA. Reviewing some of these developmental ties – or ties to developments – offers a more nuanced sense of history. Exploring this juncture allows us to rethink the criticism leveled at the incorporation of British cultural studies, as it was being dislocated and relocated within a shifting American setting.</p>

<title>Cultural studies <italic>in medias res</italic>: American antagonisms</title>
<p>There was much that was unique and remarkable in the emergence of British cultural studies that came with internal developments. Embedded peculiarities are not so easily amenable to simple export. Cultural studies in Britain had its gravitational impulses in its formation, with intellectual sensibilities kindled and grounded as well within an actual location. The CCCS was an existing center which had a location in Birmingham. From the outset, British cultural studies also had the benefit of leadership, both administrative and intellectual, but also relied on significant collective (even if at times contentious) work, and could avail itself of the concentration that came in having its own social–local presence. The moniker ‘Birmingham School’ indicated a place of association and work, an actual point of intellectual production, of face-to-face coordinated or battled interests, a distinctive orientation, a body or school of thought (although in some accounts this latter term was resisted) and an intellectual impulse – but not to be equated with a ‘discipline’ as traditionally conceived.</p>
<p>Immediately crucial is the fact that cultural studies in the USA would never even come close to realizing and achieving the organizational and operative working milieu that developed in Britain’s CCCS. The sense of consolidation and compressed gravity that the CCCS could claim did not export well, and other key factors impacting its assimilation were determinate. Indeed, a somewhat reverse or inverse mode of development continued (which I shall note below). Yet, there were many developments shared between the USA and Britain that shaped cultural studies and which help to account for its resonation and value for intellectual struggles within academe. It is worth bearing in mind the complicating moments already noted in reflexive histories of the CCCS, in which ‘race’ and gender emerged to problematize the already salient role of class. These additional concerns coincided with and impacted many of the analytic domains so important to the applications and elaborations taking place within cultural studies, as it analyzed subcultures, popular culture, music, mass media and communication and literature.</p>
<p>In the American case, the moment of assimilating cultural studies had its own immediate history in which the academy was being impacted by a combination of demographic and political mobilizations that had grown out of the larger political culture of the Civil Rights Movement. Such pressures would transform certain teaching and administrative aspects of universities and in tandem with new curricula (pedagogical program developments), new personnel (hiring a new generation of faculty) and a changing student body (expanding outreach to minority ethnic students and women). Thus as cultural studies was experiencing a deepening, broadening and expanding range of problems, it also was being exported into an American context with its own distinct social and political struggles. In retrospect, the absorption of cultural studies into the academy and the agitation for a broader inclusion of marginalized racial groups and women were connected through an ethos of liberalized educational rehabilitation. However, the tensions being brought into the university had had a significant running battle well before American intellectuals enlisted cultural studies. These issues coincided with significant social groups that sought both presence and representation within higher education. They also brought with them a critique of the university’s long-established posture of benign neglect – of scholars who, in their intellectual work, were emerging to represent the racial and gendered margins and such scholarship’s marginalized demographic corollary in the form of hitherto-excluded populations.</p>
<p>Some recall of events – which are also developments – is helpful. It was due to the legacy and agitation of the long Civil Rights Movement that came to a crescendo in the 1960s that the American academy began to admit and incorporate ‘race’, gender and sexuality into various aspects of curricula, although with discernable unease, unevenness and hesitation. This milestone came on the heels of a century-long struggle after the abolition of slavery in 1865. In the opening pages of <italic>Souls of Black Folk</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1367549412449724">1903</xref>), W.E.B. Du Bois asked the question of being black: what does it mean to be a problem? The entrenchment of deep racial divisions persisted over the next six decades until the antagonisms turned into the most powerful social movement on American soil in the 20th century. Nearly a half-century after Du Bois posed that question, the Swedish social scientist, Gunnar Myrdal, was enlisted to carry out a thorough study of black–white relations in the USA. The result was the massive two-volume study entitled <italic>The American Dilemma: the Negro Problem and Modern Democracy</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1367549412449724">[1972]1944)</xref>. W.E.B. Du Bois had published already his magnum opus, <italic>Black Reconstruction in America</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1367549412449724">1935</xref>), a painstakingly thorough analysis of the fate of black Americans after slavery was abolished. Du Bois tracked the contours of the progressive political disenfranchisement of African Americans and their enclosure within debt peonage in the American South. A skilled social scientist, and neither black nor American, Myrdal had been selected by the Carnegie Foundation for his presumed national neutrality. Recognizing himself as a ‘European’ and a ‘foreigner’, who was asked to take the lead in studying America’s deepest domestic crisis, the ‘Negro problem’, Myrdal carried out one of the era’s most extensive evaluations of the country’s deeply entrenched racism. Myrdal noted how overwhelmed he felt in taking on the work, not having
<disp-quote>
<p>support from the social scientists then working in the field of race relations, whose views in the main were more static, fatalistic and, more particularly, lacking in an appreciation of the importance for social change in the moral, ideological and political forces in the nation … I was shocked and scared to the bones by all the evils I saw and by the serious political implications of the problems which I could not fail to appreciate from beginning. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1367549412449724">Myrdal, 1972[1944]</xref>: xxv)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Twenty years after Myrdal’s massive indictment of the failure of American democratic liberalism, the long-simmering frustration and anger among black Americans erupted in numerous cities. The mid-to-late 1960s were marred by violent responses to civil rights protests and the escalating frustration and bitterness culminated in major urban conflagrations. Significant bloodshed followed many of the pitched street battles (‘riots’ in the terminology of media reportage), with black Americans frequently dying at the hands of law enforcement officials. The decade also included political assassinations of national magnitude: President John F. Kennedy (1963), Medgar Evers, Field Secretary for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (1963), Malcolm X, author and founder of the Organization of Afro-American Unity (1965), Robert Kennedy, US senator and candidate for Democratic Party presidential nominee (1968), and Dr Martin Luther King, major leader of the Civil Rights Movement (1968). There were other killings of non-elites associated with racial conflict.</p>
<p>The middle of the decade also saw the irruption among white college students who launched the Free Speech movement in 1964 on the Berkeley campus of the University of California. Unlike black Americans, these students were anchored in the privilege of higher education. However, as the war in Vietnam escalated and spilled over into the larger Indo-China arena, students quickly learned that desire to contest the dominant political culture would be met with harsh repression. Although different in many socio-economic, demographic and racial aspects, both movements shared a fundamental recognition that the American polity was intolerant of substantive challenges.</p>
<p>Such upheavals remained as fresh and unhealed scars seared in the American body politic when universities began to feel the political pressures of the Civil Rights Movement. In 1968–1969 students at San Francisco State University launched a major strike against the institution. The strike quickly took on national significance, as strikers demanded an end to the Vietnam War and demanded the development of ethnic studies courses. These combined demands represented new and critical linkages between aspects of an unpopular foreign policy abroad and domestic pedagogy at home. It was a very unusual development as a youth movement that quickly formed alliances with the Civil Rights Movement and the anti-war movement. It was unprecedented also in that it initiated the emergence of social subjects who were asking to be brought – as subjects and as subject matter – into the academy.</p>
<p>More institutional challenges and conflagrations would soon take form. Three key initiatives, each aimed at the academy, were launched in 1969. The ‘Plan de Santa Barbara’ written at the University of California, Santa Barbara, was a manifesto arguing for the formation and implementation of a Chicano studies program – the first of its kind in the USA. That same year, a black studies department was officially formed at San Francisco State University and an ethnic studies department was launched at the University of California, Berkeley (which later became the nation’s first PhD program in comparative ethnic studies). The following year, the first two women’s studies programs in the USA were established at San Diego State College (which became San Diego State University) and at the State University of New York-Buffalo. As the Civil Rights Movement in the USA spread to encompass a host of new subjectivities, gender was included (or more appropriately, retrieved), and was encoded in the important proposed Equal Rights Amendment to the USA Constitution of 1972. This further invigorated egalitarianist pressures, which grew into a significant political force and a re-energized Women’s Movement. These developments, although socially broad, had a major impact upon the American university system, which responded partially by incorporating multi-racial, multi-ethnic and feminist, gender and sexuality dimensions into curricular accommodations. By the early 1970s, this new melding of institutions and social groups became associated with the term ‘multiculturalism’, which was also being adopted in various ways, in some cases as formal policies, in many European countries as part of the more transnationally diffused liberal–managerial framework for brokering the rapidly expanding tensions of social heterogeneity that grew out of old colonial vestiges as well as new immigration and diasporic flows.</p>
<p>However, to underscore the importance of American demographic complexities: it is no accident that the State of California would register such an academic crisis and become a key flashpoint for confronting the inegalitarian operations of higher education. The State of California was not unique with regard to exclusionary practices. However, its demography was too crucial not to harbor developing social tensions. With its vibrant history as having once belonged to Mexico (but annexed with the 1846–1848 war with Mexico), California already had a deeply embedded Mexican American population that grew significantly throughout the 20th century. California and the western American states also had numerous Native American populations, long a magnet for early American anthropological research launched by Boasian ethnology. With its location on the Pacific Rim, California also emerged as a nationally important agricultural region, relying as early as the mid-19th century upon waves of immigrant labor from Asian-Pacific regions, especially from China, Japan, the Philippines, Korea and India. This early reliance on Asian–Pacific agricultural laborers shifted to Mexican-drawn workers after the Second World War, which concentrated and demarcated a large racialized labor force based on Mexican-identified populations – it was in the agricultural fields of California that the United Farm Workers Movement took hold – thus inaugurating a deeply structured reliance that continues into the present and is constitutive to both the US political economy and its on-again/off-again floating hostility toward immigrant communities (immigration remains one of the most wrenching policy issues to date).</p>
<p>The university systems in California, already the largest public institution of higher education in the world, began to accommodate the political-demographic changes. By the mid-1970s numerous ethnic studies initiatives began to surface. First to develop were stand-alone special topics and courses, which occurred at the behest of singular pedagogical initiatives; then came programs which organized pedagogical offerings through a more consistent, if not routine approach, but which, like stand-alone courses, remained vulnerable to the mix of instructor availability coupled with negotiating the blessings or rejection by institutional administrators; and eventually legitimized departments emerged, which offered intellectually sustained modes of intervention, a systematically conceptualized curriculum and a sense of an achieved field of knowledge. In the structure of the university, departmental status – at least in public institutions – offered greater freedoms protected by faculty governance. Colleges and universities began to move toward engaging and including marginalized subjects (subject-matter as conceptual content as well as demographic subject-groups).</p>
<p>Cultural studies would soon enter the American academy at a time when political accommodation was being extended to mitigate tensions in academic contestations involving ‘race’, ethnicity and gender, and with sexuality beginning to be incorporated with the coming ascent of feminist theorizings. These developments were important and signaled historically new relations between the state and racial and gender exclusion. In the USA it was marginalized groups that fought for the right to enter the academy and to have some recognized place – to be incorporated into the body politic with rights and access to education. This struggle epitomized the current moment in a complex national and increasingly transnational juncture. Again, the political spirit was steeped in the legacy of the Civil Rights Movement and its recent history of mass public violence, bloodshed and elite and political assassinations. In this juncture large and powerful social, political and cultural conflicts had kindled a large sector of youth who held critical views of domestic and foreign policy while embracing a politics of justice and inclusion in academia. For the more marginalized minorities, incorporation was not regressive; it meant something quite different for those who had long felt disenfranchised and who sought to belong to and receive benefits from the larger ‘Great Society’: the term given to the reforms following the Kennedy presidency that addressed racial inequality and anti-poverty programs launched by President Lyndon Johnson. Gaining access to colleges and universities was an important partial resolution to what had been so chronically unattainable.</p>
<p>In its inception, ethnic studies drew initially on intellectual and ideological frameworks that represented a blend of cultural nationalism and political economy. These critical dispositions refracted already established and influential currents associated with self-determination movements fueled, in part, by the decolonization politics that took place as major European nations relinquished overt colonial relations, especially in Africa. Decolonization abroad fostered a politically charged rhetoric that reverberated with, and was transposed upon, the grammar of domestic struggles in the USA, and which fed into the American Civil Rights Movement. This accounts in part for why the content in the earliest stages of pedagogy in the university centered on renarrativized histories that situated racialized groups and peoples within the interpretive contexts of economic and political domination. Over time, the pedagogy would expand to reflect interdisciplinary developments, with larger ethnic studies programs and departments emulating curricula that resembled a broader liberal arts profile, achievable since the faculty servicing them received its training in various humanities and social science disciplines. The convergence of such interests within a single program often resembled the open breadth of cultural studies and the latter’s attempt to integrate work from different disciplines. However, from the outside and over time, often the identification of ethnic studies and women’s or feminist studies in the USA was seen axiomatically as sites for ‘identity politics’, a term that unfortunately conflates aspects of historically inescapably structuration with racial and gender solipsism.</p>
<p>The new programs and established departments that began to accommodate hitherto marginalized subjects worked in kindred ways with cultural studies. The key observation offered here is that cultural studies entered the American academy after major institutions already had begun to assimilate ethnic studies and women’s studies. Both of these academic enterprises, with roots in antagonistic social movements, harbored intrinsic criticisms of dominant disciplinary profiles of the academic world and brought issues that were intrinsically cultural in the form of counter-interpretations to critical-revisionist histories, retrieved cultural practices, community studies, expressive arts and struggles to wrest a critical understanding of the contours, often imposed from the outside, upon shifting notions of subjectivity. All of these interests aimed to impact and alter the academy’s discursive terrain and curricular offerings. In the case of ethnic studies programs, their emergence and presence varied according to regional-demographic urgencies and pressures: California’s role was not accidental or arbitrary, but situational, historical and demographic.</p>
<p>Gaining access to the university was inseparable from modes of arguments and advocacy. As with any viable political posture, such advocacy operated around provisionally defined relations of subjects, practices, institutions, histories and social structures. Ethnic or racial studies and feminist studies were constitutively enabled and shaped in a context that struggled with the tensions of what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1367549412449724">Gayatri Spivak (1987)</xref> called ‘strategic essentialism’: seizing upon a provisional identity relevant to political struggles and social movements that is likely to be efficacious in achieving desired goals. In this regard, identity was not about some transcendent wholeness coterminous with ontogenetic truth, but – to recall Foucault – about achieving truth effects, or what can be truly affected, brought into being, the result of accomplishing desired outcomes. From this perspective, it is understandable that the initial struggle to gain access to dominant institutions relied politically on frameworks tending toward aggregated and unified identities. However, over time, such strategic essentialism would become increasingly problematic as differences and fissures emerged, opening the door to more complex analyses of pluralized forms of racialization and gendering as both moved into new analytic fronts.</p>
<p>By the early 1990s, earlier essentialist and unified identities anchored in ‘race’ and gender were morphing into complex dimensions, as attention shifted toward the more difficult work of grasping and analyzing identity as a sociocultural and historical articulation. Identity became less assumed and increasingly interrogated and problematized in critical approaches: an orientation encouraged by poststructuralist theory and the emphasis on the role of discursive practices and discursive formations. Earlier social and historical gravities that anchored identity-centered stakes were uprooted in moves away from notions of fixed identities, toward challenges that attempted to get at the knowledge epistemologies behind socio-historical categories. This pushed identity and subjectivity increasingly toward postcolonial-inflected theories of fluidity and hybridity. If the earlier politics of identity derived political viability on the basis of solidarities in the face of exclusion, the morphing of identifications that ensued worked against earlier fixities while simultaneously proposing the new formations as both expressive of new conditions of social life and as new intellectual and academic currencies. By the mid-1990s a dualistic set of analytical accents were clearly discernable and somewhat reflective of the generational shifts unfolding within changing analytical orientations. On the one hand, the legacy anchored in earlier identified formations so central to the rights struggles and crucial to academic inclusion persisted, but alongside the theoretical unraveling of the identitarian paradigms which had been so central in previous institutional struggles.</p>
<p>However, to set aside dependency on abstract poststructuralist and postcolonial accounts: the idea of strategic essentialism gets at something that is not at all esoteric and abstract, nor requiring jumping through more recent theoretical hoops. It flags aspects of politics that actually seem basic, pedestrian and fundamental. Strategic essentialism may be restated as a way of advancing the provisionality required to battle things out and hopefully to get somewhere or something. It is about how to maximize the benefit of conditions. I do not wish to trivialize these struggles, for they are extremely urgent for those who come to things from the disadvantage point of being crushed in choice, stripped of chances and denied fundamental mobility. Such conditions are not moral fictions. Strategic essentialism, brought down to flesh and blood, involves the subjective mobilization – be it singular or group or collective – of sentiments, ideas, feelings, arguments, memories, emotional intensities, situated lives in historical limitations. It lives in a grounded and compelling sense to bring what is needed and desired into what is tangible – what Marx meant by the term ‘realize’– to make something real, in an actual-material sense in one’s life that hitherto was not there. To realize is, in essence, to see through the change of lived conditions. It hinges on attainment. From this perspective, such strategies always involve people in purposive enactments. It is the very stuff of politics, from the mundane to the grand. If birds fly and fish swim, then we could say that human beings strategically essentialize. It is surely convenient; it may be inescapable.</p>
<p>It is an irony in the height of theorizing – after postructuralism – that something so basic and manifested time and again in countless cases throughout human history, is pivoted upon and becomes both explanation and justification. First, as the manifestation of need and desire, then attributed to subjectivity and identity, then reassessed as performativity, then opening up as various actions that run the interpretive gamut from the theoretically logical, to the esoterically anguished, then dismissed as excessive blunder under the increasingly shriveling function behind the term ‘identity politics’ – and then put to intellectual rest as grievance studies. Notwithstanding all this, strategic essentialism has enabled achievement: subjects became present in the American academy who simply were not there before, who wrenched out of exclusionary institutions new places and positions on behalf of seeking certain desired outcomes. It is impossible to imagine American universities moving toward the inclusion of marginalized subjects, had the latter not marshaled the merged foci that highlighted political desire with institutional criticism – which came in the form of so-called strategic essentialism.</p>
<p>The developmental politics of inclusion would continue to unfold and become entwined in complications and contradictions. In some cases, positions won invariably would give way to new theorizing that unfixed and transcended earlier identity formations. If history was the font of discursive formations that ‘set up’ identities, which could be critically grasped as moral and political fictions, then why not take matters into one’s own hands and remake one’s self accordingly – and thus, according to what? No matter how the problem of performativity is broadly or narrowly conceived, ultimately it is a historical one, and cannot escape being a phenomenologically situated act – hence the nagging analytical questions apply. Under what conditions is a performance a mimetic act that bears unconsciously the unthought unreflexivity of the moment? To what extent is it an uncritical manifestation of the formation in which it obtains its dramaturgical grammar? When is a performance able to rupture rather than reinforce (whether playfully or antagonistically) received traditions, and succeed in bringing about new spaces for what may eventually be transformative? Put this way, the problem highlights the way that urgencies for political expediency, and/or a frenetic and frantic search for a fix – with no guarantees – in the face of unrelenting forces of upheaval and unfixing, are not easily grasped. The radical deconstruction of identity as the symptom of discursive formations and practices, and thus historical in its temporality rather than essential, also produced disparate results that could run the gamut from the critical deployment of collectively strategic identities to the distrust and dismantling of any tendencies toward the solidification of identity, to an autonomy-insistent sense of license to seize and self-fashion idiosyncratic identities in the spirit of performative do-it-yourself enactments.</p>
<p>With these developments in mind, two aspects need to be grasped. First, the historical process that began with crucially substantive social movements and which came to include modes of engagement, became affiliated with cultural studies, and these developments are very complex and diverse. Second, the examples that arguably are most removed from collective actions as well as social and historical engagement, and which are quickly identified in the shriveled and most dismissive meanings attributed to identity politics, are what critics of cultural studies frequently seize upon to indict the entire intellectual project. In this regard, conservatives and Left critics of cultural studies sometimes roll out arguments that echo one another.</p>
<p>The train I have been tracking – from social movements to institutional confrontations and assimilations to a deepening sense of identity crises, which appear to culminate in the proliferation and, at times, the conflation of subjectivities and intellectual subject matter – is not disconnected from the parallel developments of cultural studies as an ideational movement that found new institutional settings and then became enmeshed in the diffusive context of the USA. The critical view shared by the Left and the Right often centers on identity politics. For the Left, identity politics is exaggeratedly conflated with cultural studies’ abandonment of the centrality of class: it grounds identity politics as the failure to deliver a larger common-critical orientation. However, this critique is often shorn from the historical nexus of social movements noted earlier, or it selectively embraces some movements at the dismissal of others – a move also refracting emergent notions of identity. For those who had, and still have, the intellectual luxury of dismissing the sense of underlying crises of identities that came unexpectedly (and still comes) with such historical ruptures, and who are not compelled to share in empathetic dialogue, all this remains simplified in the aberration of ‘identity politics’. For the Left, the fault of dispensing with class led to <italic>class-disabled</italic> fictions that are reflected in opting for improperly grounded cultural crises. For the conservatives, it was the problem of <italic>fictitious classifications</italic> both artificial and contrived: they imposed unnecessary cultural divisions antithetical to a presumably unified body politic preferably understood as classless. In sum, the errors at hand were the result of either not enough class or too much classification. However, taken together, what flows from these assessments is a fundamental warrant of attack on cultural studies: it promoted a runaway culturalism.</p>
<p>Yet, identity politics is also quite open to criticism. Inasmuch as identity struggles are rooted in and owe much to the major social movements that unfolded in the 1960s, there were tangents that did and do still culminate in the evacuation of history: a naive obliviousness to structures that remained present even if not on one’s horizon, and to operating under an eclipsed sense of limits and constraints that remained with formidable problems of politically and economically ossified forms of power. Identitarianism shorn from a critically engaged awareness of socially contingent relations could appear preferred enclosures, where autonomy and separation were ultimate virtues. Understandably, such peripheral edges and marginal moments would garner serious criticism, mainly from the perspective of political ideals (e.g. membership and participation in ongoing social movements).</p>
<p>Such criticism can run the risk of misplaced concreteness, in associating the shallowest forms of identitarianism and kindred attention around cultural trivia with the theoretical center of cultural studies: a common critique for both disappointed Left-lamenters and Right-detesters of cultural studies. For the Left, this entails an imagined ideal of a unified front awaiting the return of troops who happened to go astray, who ought to shake off political irresponsibility and come back to rationality by merging with common progressive politics and returning to their <italic>a priori</italic> class location. For conservatives, identitarian splintering was sheer manipulation masquerading behind political correctness. In either case, seen from the outside, identitarianism was a politically confused aberration.</p>
<p>However, it could be argued that more forces were in motion and involved developments stretching beyond disgruntled politics. Such struggles also signified a culture undergoing conditions that arguably fostered the proliferation of identity options that emerged in tandem with societal processes that were increasingly speeding up, thus destabilizing all hitherto received and taken-for-granted conditions, eroding yesteryear’s neat binaries, making more fluid previously fixed social locations and resulting in dislocating just about any identity construction. Identitarianism colluded and collided – constitutively – in a culture that was increasingly incessant in teasing out more and more niches for psychic redemption, offering a sporadic proliferation of symbolic placeholders (the post-war consumerist cornucopia being one of these fronts) to ease the relentlessness of larger social upheavals and transformations well underway. All this remained the source of nagging attention demanded by ever-expanding pressures of the popular, and this was beginning to be noted anew by cultural studies, as charted in the work of Dick Hebdige. Such categorical imperatives could run the gamut from the playful as well as deadly serious performativity of moral fictions in search of realizing something, to inescapable constrictions (which were, and remain, often inseparable). What was emerging was an expanding critical-theoretical context in which older, ossified subjectivities and identities that embodied the fated mixture of essentialized as well as historically overdetermined identities – including but not limited to class, and largely shaped by repressive social structures – came progressively into situated contact with new theoretical reconfigurations. Many of these developments were put into practice through provocative dialogic relations between ethnic studies, women’s studies and cultural studies. Intellectual and analytical segregationists aside, the nexus facilitated a host of new fronts, critiques and reassessments that struggled to come to terms with the social and cultural (e.g. historically institutionalized) logics of the past.</p>
<p>The issues I have raised are important to keep in mind, as they shaped the very formation of the relations between American social movements, the rise of ethnic and women’s studies and the ‘import’ of British cultural studies. It is ironic that cultural studies was being criticized for being ‘incorporated’, for losing its original punch and succumbing to a watering down of verve, engagement and intellectual efficacy. The question of incorporation takes on a different inflection when we puncture the romanticist autonomy that never was core to cultural studies; cultural studies in Britain also was an institutionally affiliated form, nonetheless struggling within a historical moment in a crisis-ridden social formation. This is certainly the case in the American context. As Michael Denning has noted, ‘if we are incorporated in the university, it is because we are living in a corporation, not because conflicts and struggles have given way to “guilt and alienation”’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1367549412449724">Denning, 2004</xref>: 146).</p>
<p>What matters, beyond the Sender→Receiver model, is not so much the issue of cultural studies crossing the Atlantic and becoming something different – along with the awareness that it might lose its vital <italic>élan</italic> in mid-passage. What matters more is the deeper relations between historical forces, social transformations and the array of socially specific ruptures which have conditioned and contextualized the relevancy and efficacy of critical ideas and their transposition and fit. The agonistic social movements that preceded cultural studies’ incorporation helped in a major way to soften up the academy for cultural studies. Social conflicts, interjected into the university, made such an adoption possible. When the major social movements began to ground themselves in American academia, their intrinsically counter-oppositional sensibilities translated into intellectual content and immediately became linked to cultural issues. What developed were new modes of expressivity and representation emergent in literary and cultural retrievals, a desire to recollect collective histories and the work of inscribing the new subjectivities – of groups beginning to write themselves actively into the hitherto guarded canons of social and cultural knowledge. Frankly, that these subjects were allowed to write – even if from the outside their writing was not quite right – is far more socially significant than the errors associated with failing to immediately in joining the rank-and-file in class struggles and for failing to conform to already hardened cultural categories. The short-circuits and conflation of problems performed a particular kind of cultural work that filled in for not fully grasping and holding in critical play the tension that Williams argued for: the need to understand the constitutive ties between projects and formations.</p>
<p>What about this notion of ties? Let us return to the problem of the major social movements, as the ties between projects and formations are not readily evident, and there is always the problem of missing the connections that matter most. I can only suggest aspects of these ties and apprehend them in their partiality. I will sketch some general problems and then follow this with more specific observations that apply to disciplinary domains.</p>
<p>The context in the USA that favored the reception of cultural studies had much in common with that which fostered British cultural studies. There was a long and contentious history of labor struggles: Cold War politics induced forms of domestic repression and subordinated the needs of various publics to a narrow culture of conformity, which would wear thin in the post-war years; and issues of ‘race’ and gender egalitarianism challenged the rhetoric of liberal democracy (and the fundamentalism of economic reductionism). The expansion of mass media restructured the ideological terrain and introduced the antinomies of corporate enclosures as well as new modes of contesting the latter. Forms of popular culture took hold among working class youth, and antagonisms in competing uses of social science highlighted a growing critique within the social-managerialism of normative expectations through a critically insurgent perspective on deviance and delinquency – the de-demonizing of delinquency and crime. All of these were shared between the USA and Britain.</p>
<p>More specifically in the USA, the Civil Rights Movement, anti-war movement, women’s movements and the youth movement enabled an intellectually widening interest in critical social, political and cultural theory. As noted, the institution of higher education became a focal point for brokering social tensions. Social groups able to gain access to higher education brought certain needs and demands to academia, and cultural studies became part of the social matrix in which social struggles merged with educational reform. In this context, the notion that cultural studies was meant to be more than an academically centered practice – whether plausible or not – nurtured the lament over its incorporation and commodification.</p>
<p>However, there was actually little substance in the notion that cultural studies had lost its traction because of its university affiliation. On the contrary, cultural studies could become meaningful in and through its absorption and uneven assimilation into the various pockets of interests that the university provided. What else was there for cultural studies? It was not an autonomous social moment. Social moments, even if they appeared inchoate, often had focused and strategic goals to achieve. Moreover, the raging social movements did not need cultural studies. Social and political struggles did not require the high and refined theoreticist debates that juggled the pros and cons of western Marxism, the intense dialogic exchanges of paradigmatic confrontations, or the ponderings of whether actually existing interdisciplinarity was being achieved. Indeed, the reverse seems much more plausible. Cultural studies could take hold because it could rely upon social ferment that was spilling into the university, from where it could establish bulkheads and build from such.</p>
<p>Far more significant than identity issues, cultural studies would become enmeshed relationally with the historical dynamics that were reshaping higher education in the USA. In this regard, cultural studies drew upon as it also fed into the intellectual and academic arena. Indeed, the academic matrix infused cultural studies with the conditions of its intellectual acceleration. In the American context this acceleration unfolded not in concentrated and discernable gravity (a feature that CCCS could better symbolize, if not totally claim), but in uneven and unpredictable diffusion. Such diffusion was another source of the Left lament, and it made things harder for conservatives to track as well – although the latter did its best through the National Association of Scholars, whose spokespeople were, and remain, ready to indict the liberalist aberrations diffused throughout academe. Criticism of its incorporation implied an autonomy that it never had. Lament aside, the project of holding theory and politics in tension had its possible achievement in the terrain of intellectual struggle, and this took place in the sphere of education in both Britain and the USA. Cultural studies was possible as a constitutively formed intellectual struggle. This is not to say that it did not have important relations with popular (non-academic) struggles in adult education in the British context, and social moments in both Britain and the USA. The social milieu that these developments helped to shape privileged the reception of cultural studies.</p>
<p>Arguably, cultural studies was enabled by societal struggles and thus able to enter and even inhabit intellectual and academic terrain because of such movements. This development is larger and far more significant than the frustration that came to conflate institutional engagement with political regression (a progressive indictment of original sin). This was matched with the nostalgia, lament and romanticist pining for the ever-fleeting genuine subaltern (again, the challenge reappeared to be from which of the many subaltern subjects to choose). Given the trajectory of social movements and the new subjectivities coagulating around ‘race’ and gender that were demanding institutional inclusion, it is not surprising that the subalternity prone to political mobilization was not anchored in class identities. As noted, these were the very same issues that were being simultaneously brokered in the shifting currents within CCCS. However, more seriously: the criticism that cultural studies was becoming politically insipid amounted to dismissing an important institutional site of critical contestation and struggle over knowledge hitherto unavailable to a large array of classed, ‘raced’ and gendered subjects and numerous alliances both in and outside academe.</p>
<p>In their insurgent fluidity, these emergent tensions within academia provided a climate suitable to affinities for British cultural studies. Cultural issues were intrinsic to these intellectual struggles; they enabled cultural studies to have easier institutional access as a kindred project, and their relationship fostered synergistically ideational combinations with the new subjectivities that the American academy was forced to host. This historical juncture marks the moment in which ethnic studies, women’s studies and (shortly thereafter) cultural studies would intersect the academy and become academically entwined. These programmatic initiatives and their corresponding modes of critical enquiry found numerous ties and interests that fed into and drew upon each other, although not without consternation from anti-amalgamational orthodoxies. In doing so, the nexus served to empower the critique of disciplinary rigidities and fostered multidisciplinary and transdisciplinary lines of enquiry in a spirit very much like that promulgated by British cultural studies. All of this complicates the lament that cultural studies was taking a regressive turn through incorporation and commodification and tending increasingly toward cultural content – which often boiled down to a view of a waning gravity that was to anchor the issues of class, labor and political economy.</p>
<p>‘Incorporation’ and ‘institutionalization’ are not mere observations; they are loaded with analytical lenses and evaluative claims that already pose certain interpretations in their initiating frames. I take this angle to underscore the pre-existing affinities already in place in the formation of critical-intellectual work taking place within various academic arenas that drew upon relations with cultural studies. Such considerations enable us to get past superficial and false dichotomies and convenient binaries that simplify cultural studies in terms of its origins in crisis through ensuing relations with other contexts: a view that omits the deeper intellectual and analytical ties that cultural studies has with developments in the USA, ties that are missed from the onset. Their under-recognized absence flirts with the tendency to evacuate the crucial tension proposed by Williams: the need to hold in play the understanding of both an intellectual project and its formation, <italic>in medias res</italic> and in transformation. In what follows, I turn to opening up aspects of the context not commonly considered in the lament over the absorption of cultural studies in the USA, while continuing to hold on to aspects of a comparative perspective in the interplay between British and American cultural studies.</p>

<title>Fielding cultural studies: underlying continuities</title>
<p>Throughout 1980s to the 1990s, the assimilation of cultural studies took hold with young faculty and graduate students who were attempting to solidify their desired sense of incorporation. Cultural studies was drawn upon by many of the fields in the humanities, which is often noted, but it also found interest in the social sciences, such as history, sociology, anthropology, film studies, media and communications studies, and to a much lesser extent in political science, although not in economics. This interest reflected the intellectual milieu that enabled new ideas to enter the academy and fueled challenges on academic terrain to engage with the dominant narratives of civil society. Often, literary programs and disciplines were viewed as the most open to cultural studies, and received the most criticism for favoring textual analysis at the expense of social and contextual concerns. Yet the assumption that literary fields only found interest in texts and monopolized cultural studies appears to be an exaggeration. It did seem to be the case that literary studies, especially English departments, were more free to embrace and employ the term ‘cultural studies’, as did the field of communication and media studies. Arguably, these fields did not feel the terminological restrictions found in the social sciences. After all, sociology and anthropology had long claimed ‘culture’ as stock currency in their terminological capital and were presumably carrying out the study of culture all along. For these long established fields, to readily adopt ‘cultural studies’ would amount to embracing the value of a rival framework, while ceding intellectual turf to it. Whether to invoke and embrace or not, as cultural studies gained ground in American universities, virtually every discipline in the humanities and the social sciences harbored a more pronounced interest in studying ‘culture’, and the term was broadly resurrected.</p>
<p>In the exuberance of new horizons and the feel that cultural theorizing was being rejuvenated and again relevant, it was not unusual to find new graduate students who took quickly to Stuart Hall before having read much of anything by Marx; to Dick Hebdige but with no knowledge of Barthes; to Foucault but not Durkheim; to Derrida but not Kenneth Burke; and to Paul Willis and other British ethnographers, while oblivious to the Chicago School and its critical wing, which was so important to critical ethnography. This reflected not so much a reading dis-order, but rather an opportunity that kindled a new <italic>order of discovery</italic> being opened up by cultural studies. It was a moment that marked starting afresh and then moving outward to hitherto unknown theoretical horizons that were central to the spirit of cultural studies. These reading associations signaled something like the ‘two-step flow’ opinion trajectory that occupied mass communication researchers in the 1950s. Younger entering scholars and freshly minted junior professors could experience cultural studies’ theoretical retrievals much like the generation before them, those American college students who fueled the youthful ranks of the New Left, who caught wind of Marx and the Frankfurt School and other critical traditions through the marginalized sociologist C. Wright Mills and other disciplinary outliers.</p>
<p>Unlike other disciplines safe in their own modes of incorporation and boundary maintenance, the newly-formed ethnic or racial and gender and women’s studies programs and departments, and parallel explorations in emergent cultural studies programs, displayed a necessary shrewdness in grasping and understanding that their political and intellectual viability and survival as new enterprises was contingent on not replicating established disciplines and going after the formalism of theory and methods characteristic of disciplinary paradigms. Disciplinary approaches had screened out the impulses, rationale and content of the new initiatives. Emulating those disciplines would likely be redundant and invite conditions conducive to their dismissal. Strength was grasped in embracing interdisciplinarity, of bringing various approaches into conversation, of cross-readings (for and against the grain), and of seeking out provocative and profitable intellectual antagonisms. This was the very opposite of niche specialization or discipline boundary maintenance. Such intellectual commingling was a mode of query that disciplinarians, ensconced in their own intellectual property, were keen to avoid. To recall Collins’s criticism of sociology: disciplines tended toward fracturing into subfields encased in segmented specialization, with little spirit for exchange between them. Cultural studies offered an urgent and critical sensibility for recognizing and occupying the chasm – it minded the gap. This was its strength, but also the condition of its incessant vulnerability. Yet cultural studies was able to enter as well as augment ongoing struggles in the American academy. As it did, it gave additional license and resources to the new terrains of intellectual cohabitation – even as gatekeepers were ever quick to flag the new acts as misguided moments of intellectual miscegenation.</p>
<p>It was in this context that some in the American universities began to see cultural studies for its important intellectually strategic value. Students and younger academics welcomed the fresh critique and the attention to critical problems that came with the newly-expanding theoretical struggles taking place in British cultural studies. They were quick to grasp cultural studies’ relevance to confronting ossified institutions and entrenched and guarded epistemologies, and the intellectual and theoretical reflections that it fostered for understanding everyday life. These dispositions were aided from the margins – from ethnic studies, women’s studies and even art-orbiting aesthetic pockets – but also found confirmation in parallel sentiments within established disciplines and departments. These latter developments were also important, and their receptivity to cultural studies aided the opening of new academic fronts, even in the midst of a more generalized unease.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, the expansive-oriented competitiveness of American academia soon found the new interests favorable to various forms of institutional entrepreneurialism. A parallel growth in critical journals and magazines servicing the new publishing culture took place (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1367549412449724">Denning, 2004</xref>). Some academic departments were quick to seize upon the prospects for the programmatic incorporation of cultural studies. The class, ‘race’, gender and history thematics that were being consolidated opened up their interest in the new theoretical fronts. It was not long before course syllabi spanning humanities and social science disciplines would offer overlapping readings. Much of the intellectual crossover was the inadvertent result of cultural studies and the ease with which it could be engaged by both existing and new academic programs. Cultural studies came to play a transposing role, enabling the shift of theoretical literatures and its own studies to be read in the context of another social and cultural key: of course, for some this was discord, but for those in search of additional ways to reinforce their newly-established stages in the university, cultural studies helped to harmonize their various intellectual struggles. After all, cultural studies had done the reaching out, the absorbing and brokering, mashing and melding of insights and resources that were readily available in the theoretical proliferation of post-war era western Marxism and kindred writings. This sense of openness to new intellectual vistas and to think outside the narrowed conformism of Cold War culture also owed much to the rupturing impact of the free speech and Civil Rights Movements, as both were crucial in making possible the psychically expansive capabilities to break down social and intellectual barriers.</p>
<p>Various academicians viewed the new current for its potential to expand intellectual production and to wrest new positions of thought and work. This development could occur in larger institutional settings where the incorporation of new readings and lines of thought cohabited with those more entrenched in the comfort of firmly established disciplines, which included those who disapproved of any such canonical tampering by undisciplined interlopers. Tolerance or rejection was not uniform; discipline-centered departments could differ significantly within various colleges and university campuses, with some welcoming the influences of cultural studies and others happy to close the borders. In some cases, university administrators saw the moment as conducive to program development and just plain good business sense: new interests, if courted properly, translated into enrollments, tuition from below and increased public budgets from above would follow. Thus the appropriation of cultural studies served numerous interests – not all of them compatible, and certainly not reducible to some kind of ideological uniformity. Were cultural studies anathema to the ideological and economic posture of higher education, it is likely that it would not have seen the light of day. However, such struggles are never neat, and as many sectors of the academy were dealing with the massive legitimation crisis unleashed by the Civil Rights Movement, cultural studies remained adept in accommodating and even thriving in some pockets of dissent. In the American context, the university system could demonstrate a peculiar dualism, harboring a contradictory strength and fragility central to capitalist-democratic liberalism: it could foster developments that threatened to bite the hand that fed it, especially if the net result could bring about program expansion.</p>
<p>Cultural studies found itself in this contradiction. Thus, on the one hand, any orthodoxy that harbored a monotheistic understanding of what cultural studies ‘really was’, was fated to recoil at its incorporation, especially if and when this involved the commingling and meshing of social movements, identities and frustrated sentiments, as the latter took on the messy pantheism of multiple interests, all vying for space and place in the university. From this angle, holding to any fixed definitions was tantamount to an intellectual-managerial nightmare: if cultural studies was incorrigible in Britain, it remained so in the USA, but for the altered reasons noted. Yet this multiplicity of engagements was inseparable from the moment’s broader (as opposed to enclosing) pressures. As cultural studies worked older and newer discourses into intellectually novel frameworks, it fed into a host of struggles that were unfolding in American society. In the process, cultural studies was being transformed, just as it was transforming the American intellectual juncture of the period. It did this along multiple and diffused lines of impact. It did not have a place; rather, it aided in the new placement of critical discourses in a wide array of intellectual fronts – a development arguably more important than the rise of some stand-alone department or set of programs.</p>
<p>Suffice it to say that British cultural studies did not make the move intact; it was retro-fitted. Cultural studies’ presumed crisis and fall from grace is a simple narrative only in some fictitious obituary. This is not to diminish certain sensibilities that register displacement, loss and nostalgia, and which turn on urgent criticism and debate about what kind of (strategically essentialist) identity cultural studies itself should best embrace. In a manner of analysis, the arguments for more or less viable postures were, and remain, contingent on how to grasp a project and its formation – situated in shifting locations and complex strands of historical conditions. The notion of cultural studies crashing on the shoals of incorporation and culturalism is just too simple, although it is a good argument for the loss of, or the strategies to retrieve, intellectual property.</p>
<p>If the process of enlisting and drawing upon cultural studies was not uniform, it was because it was appropriated selectively and thematically by and within varying program and departmental interest. Hence, literature departments with members already moving beyond the increasingly serious limitations of (a not so) ‘new criticism’ could find a strong ally in cultural studies. Raymond Williams’ work offered a historical analysis and sympathetic deconstruction of Leavisite literary thought and Arnoldian aesthetics, showing how criticism actually could be emancipated from an adherence to the autonomous text, which presupposed only a certain kind of legitimate reader that was capable of grasping and deciphering its inner architecture. Williams’ historical studies (especially in <italic>The Country and the City</italic> and <italic>Culture and Society</italic>) reinforced and augmented theoretically the critical angles provided earlier by the historico-literary insights of Americanists such as Kenneth Burke and F.O. Matthiessen, among numerous additional writers. The intellectual synergy aided the turn toward engaging the mode, manner and institutionalized histories that resituated literature’s constitutive ties to national and institutionalized politics. Textual analysis could be augmented with an eye for its embedded ideological functions, which meant that such analytic moves had to consider a text’s relations to other texts and contexts – the very challenge of conceptualizing formations. Thus, the British contributions of such ideology-critique could blend with an already emergent counterpart in the critical wing in American studies and its strong critical-literary tradition. In addressing the American Studies Association annual conference in 1988, the association’s president, Robert Berkhofer, pointed out that the earlier emphasis on the analysis of ‘myths and symbols’ was rapidly giving way to the new field of ideology critique and semiotics. The ‘new cultural studies’ featured prominently in this shift (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1367549412449724">Berkhofer, 1989</xref>). Seven years later, in her 1995 presidential address to the association, Elaine Tyler May was compelled to look back and take inventory of an older and deeper tradition of critical thought that had emerged in the 1930s and 1940s, with roots in socialism, labor struggles, anti-racism and sharp critiques of industrial capitalism. Referencing older and contemporary scholarship, May’s address illustrated the keen absorption of the theoretical upheavals and discoveries that thematized work being carried out in the contemporary juncture, as the field of American studies deepened and broadened a transdisciplinary integration of labor studies, cultural studies, ethnic and racial studies and women’s studies. The prominence that she gave to the struggles of groups from below pressed the importance of grounding cultural probes in their historical framework. The recuperative horizon could be read as a way to grasp projects and formations that linked to an older critical tradition within American studies and the reflexive expansion of the field, especially as it resonated with social movements and came to incorporate larger areas of social and cultural theory made possible in part through cultural studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1367549412449724">May 1996</xref>. Cf. also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1367549412449724">Denning 1996</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1367549412449724">Lipsitz,1982</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1367549412449724">2001</xref>). The ruptures in literary and historical analysis and corresponding canonical battles also provided the new opportunities for ‘minority’ (e.g. racialized and gendered) literatures to be taken seriously. Parallel to Hall’s various probes into the constitutive relations between ‘centers’ and ‘margins’, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1367549412449724">Abdul JanMohamed and David Lloyd (1987)</xref> shifted the question from historical identity to epistemological processes. The term ‘minority’ demanded being subjected to decentering criticism for its ideological complicity in shoring up an unproblematized notion of what the ‘dominant’ culture was supposed to mean through interrogating its blind spots.</p>
<p>In the case of the American Studies Association, the impetus for interdisciplinary scholarship was not centered on the critique and rejection of any particular discipline, but rather upon the opening up of disciplines and to acknowledge, explore and rectify intellectual and ideological blind spots; furthermore, to carry out a broader sharing of disciplined angles that could shed light on the larger critical object – that of American society itself, with the notion of ‘American’ becoming increasingly problematized over time. Similar to emerging critiques within British cultural studies around the need to unpack the term ‘Englishness’, American studies scholars also interrogated the legacies, programs and ideologies implied in the notion of ‘American’ in ways that probed the various intellectual as well as geographic boundaries implied in the term (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1367549412449724">Radway, 1999</xref>). Individual scholars were not so much implored to shed their disciplinary identifications (history, literature, etc.), theories and methods, as they were called upon to foster a critical analysis of American society by drawing broadly upon a variety of analytical approaches. The formation as well as transformation of American studies as an openly interdisciplinary orientation presented a rich set of historical, ideological, intellectual and political impulses which perhaps had more built-in affinities with British cultural studies than any other distinct discipline in the American academy. American studies in the 1970s already had developed a strong intellectual enquiry into working class cultures and labor histories, but in ways constitutive and consistent with the other intellectual developments taking place in the early 1970s: the problem of class – which was not abandoned – was complicated by the incursions of gender, ‘race’ and ethnicity in ways that British cultural studies was beginning to engage. Such expanded foci represented a major thrust of critical revisionism which embraced a return to studies of social forms, forces and conditions ‘from below’ in a manner that shared core thematics with British cultural studies and its attention to working class cultures.</p>
<p>The closely related field of sociology and its interest in ethnographic work also had strong interests in cultural studies. The ethnographic vein in cultural studies presents the deepest ties to American sociology, and in particular to the older legacy centered in the Chicago School located at the University of Chicago. In addition to ethnography, the Chicago School explored symbolic and performative dimension in social research. The CCCS explorations in youth, deviance, leisure and popular culture were all very close to the social domains that the Chicago strain in sociology studied. Youth, deviancy and criminology, along with dramaturgy, symbolic interaction and criminology, were perhaps the most immediately connected areas for sociologists and cultural studies ethnographers who worked the legacies of older paradigms in sociology. Embodied in British cultural studies, ethnographic reinvigoration found a relatively easy fit with the legacy of such ethno-sympathetic interests that the Chicago School had championed in its urban, racial and ethnic subcultural investigations. Birmingham ethnographies, especially those that tapped youth politics, racial signification and engendered frameworks were easily assimilated into American social science, and made their way into many required reading lists.</p>
<p>These analytic fronts also meshed well with post-war critical theories of criminology and deviancy that were emerging to counter the sociological dominance of Parsonian structural functionalism and normative sociology, because they were informed by this. The work in the late 1950s and into the 1960s carried out by American sociologists such as Howard Becker, Erving Goffman and David Matza, who advanced critical theories of social labelling in the fields of deviance, had challenged the political unconscious of structural functionalism and its manifestation in the dominant positivist discipline of criminology. At the time, criminology was re-evaluated for its role in masking the operations of normative power and institutionalized systems–maintenance models of social explanation. The emerging and critical ‘new criminology’ also reverberated in Britain, where American and British work was incorporated and then further radicalized through an exploration of ties between youth and authoritative definitions of deviance and crime. Shared considerations and cross assimilations formed a strong bridge between the classic work of the Americans Becker (<italic>Outsiders</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1367549412449724">1963</xref>) and Matza (<italic>Becoming Deviant</italic>, 1969) and the work in Britain carried out by Stanley Cohen (<italic>Folk Devils and Moral Panics</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1367549412449724">1972</xref>) and Ian Taylor, Paul Walton and Jock Young (<italic>The New Criminology</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1367549412449724">1973</xref>). Such shared and merged views of American and British sociologists and criminologists led to a recasting of critical understanding of youth, deviancy and crime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1367549412449724">Ferrell et al., 2008</xref>). A new and critical appreciation for youth subcultures grew directly out of this important institutional critique. This nexus of intellectual affinity work deserves to be seen as a harbinger of sorts for certain aspects of cultural studies, as it helps in our understanding of the theoretical integration of labor and culture and the importance of popular culture. Such syntheses were explored in the ethnographic work of Paul Willis’s <italic>Profane Culture</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1367549412449724">1978</xref>) and <italic>Learning to Labour</italic> (1981), and the politicized cultural aesthetics of the youth-popular that informed Dick Hebdige’s <italic>Subculture: The Meaning of Style</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1367549412449724">1979</xref>). Willis and Hebdige, along with others, helped bridge the earlier critical tradition that problematized the youth–labor–deviancy nexus with new theoretical ruptures taking place within the cultural crisis of Marxism. The new criminology also harbored theoretical affinities with the later work on racial formation, theorizing found in Michael Omi and Howard Winant’s <italic>Racial Formation in the United States</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1367549412449724">1994[1986]</xref>). <italic>Racial Formation</italic> was published in 1986, the same year as the CCCS publication <italic>Policing the Crisis</italic>. Omi and Winant noted the importance of the CCCS study. Although engaged in different national contexts, both studies signaled the growing tensions with and limitations regarding class reductionism. <italic>Racial Formation</italic> also contained numerous theoretical and analytical thematics that resonated deeply with developments taking place in cultural studies, especially with attention to notions of articulation, discursivity, racialization and the concern to bring racial projects into theoretical visibility.</p>
<p>As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1367549412449724">Elizabeth Long (1997)</xref> pointed out, sociology in general had marginalized the study of culture in the mid-century. However, a series of studies outside the mainstream sociological canon emerged in the mid-1950s and into the early 1960s. These studies, which we might loosely call <italic>characterological</italic> examinations of aspects of the normative or dominant culture, reflected a growing sense of unease, criticism and, in some cases, a marked dystopianism. This sensibility can be found in Sloan Wilson, <italic>The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1367549412449724">1955</xref>), Paul Goodman, <italic>Growing Up Absurd: Problems of Youth in the Organized System</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1367549412449724">1962</xref>), David Reisman, Nathan Glazer and Reuel Denney, <italic>The Lonely Crowd: A Study of the Changing American Character</italic> (1963) and C.Wright Mills and Hans Gerth’s <italic>Character and Social Structure</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1367549412449724">1964</xref>). Of these writers, it was Mills who provides an interesting and intellectual link to the emergent ferment of the New Left – which was so important, as Hall recalled, to the formation of British cultural studies. Mills spent 1957 to 1958 in Oxford; he came to feel at home intellectually in Britain and considered permanently relocating there. The BBC’s magazine, <italic>The Listener</italic>, gave Mills more popular-critical attention than he could find in the USA. By the early 1960s, he had already penned several critical studies of class, politics and power in the USA. He wrote much of his classic <italic>The Sociological Imagination</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1367549412449724">1959</xref>) while he was at the London School of Economics. Mills established intellectual ties with British scholars who were affiliated with the <italic>New Left Review</italic>, and it was in that publication that Mills first published his famous ‘Letter to the New Left’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1367549412449724">1960</xref>). It was published again in the American Left counterpart, <italic>Studies on the Left</italic> and reprinted by the organization Students for a Democratic Society in the following year.</p>
<p>The importance of labor and labor histories offered another deeper connection between American social and historical studies and the reception of cultural studies. The shared reciprocity between the New Left in Britain and the USA was extended in academic history journals. American historians launched the <italic>Radical History Review</italic> in 1974; British historians inaugurated the <italic>History Workshop Journal</italic> in 1976. The intellectual camaraderie linking both journals is documented in their mutual commemoration of the life of the social and popular historian Raphael Samuel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1367549412449724">Pfister, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1367549412449724">Dworkin, 1997</xref>). American historians paid tribute to the importance of E.P. Thompson to Marxian historical studies and, along with facets in historical sociology, the field of American studies also drew on this critical nexus. Norm Fruchter, an American who served as Stuart Hall’s assistant editor at <italic>New Left Review</italic>, returned to the U.S. where he helped in editorial work with <italic>Studies on the Left</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1367549412449724">Geary, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1367549412449724">Brewer, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>The sense of popular culture having a long and entrenched relationship with the dominant culture runs deep in American society. Music, both high and popular, has been a frequent feature of this historical tension. In the American case, the challenges posed by sonic production and its constitutive relations with labor, class, ‘race’, gender and the cross-referential dynamics of subjectivities and socio-historical contexts stretch over a long critical history: from slave songs and spirituals to work songs, urban-immigrant musical retentions and their modification in sites associated with vaudeville and burlesque; the social and class aestheticism behind the bifurcation between classical and popular; the systematic de-popularizing of classical music as it was resituated in the conservatory and the university; and the insurgency of jazz and the vernaculars that inform country music to folk, rock ‘n’ roll, rhythm and blues, punk and hip-hop.</p>
<p>Popular music studies in the USA was divided among numerous approaches: from anecdotal to systematic formalism; from the urban and ethnographic-rooted traditions of the Chicago School, to structural functionalist orientations associated often with the ‘production of culture’ approach and a reliance on organizational and institutional sociology; with genres derived out of popular vernaculars from below, to genres produced by market monetization from above. Add to this the music-centered field of ethnomusicology, with its distinct indebtedness to the paradigms of anthropology and musicology as a discipline that primarily tracked high or art music, but which also began to expand critical interest in popular music. Popular music was crucial to the irruption of American youth in the 1950s, especially with the forms of rhythm and blues, rockabilly and rock ‘n’ roll. The centrality of popular music shifted in the mid-1960s as rhythm and blues shaded into the anger of soul and funk music in tandem with the Civil Rights Movement, and with the great popularity of British pop and rock artists, who drew heavily from American popular musical genres, especially black music. It is not an exaggeration to say that the protest movements of the era were also sonically underscored. A vast literature on this aspect of subcultures, politics and movements has since developed.</p>
<p>Thus, when the CCCS began to produce ethnographies that gave serious attention to popular music, carrying out connective explorations that American social scientists were not so eager to encourage, that work struck immediate chords with younger emergent students and scholars who grew up with popular music and who recognized music’s intrinsic ties to identities, institutions, politics and shifting histories. Yet when one examines the sociology of culture as a subfield in the mid-1970s through the mid-1980s, popular music study appears anemic. Instead, the sociology of culture in the USA was much more attuned to focusing on dominant political values (usually from normative-institutional perspectives, but sometimes in crisis) that were refracted in the elite arts, museums, lived modalities of urban cosmopolitanism and, of course, the ‘big’ areas of religion, ethics, politics and civic values. In the preoccupation for presumably more serious institutional sites, the popular appeared rather ‘unpopular’. Conversely, when British cultural studies fused new social theory with popular music, as did Paul Willis, Dick Hebdige, Ian Chambers, Simon Frith and others, their work illuminated ways in which the popular could be critically recovered. The popular-infused ethnographic work of CCCS could speak to students of popular music who were scattered across the fields of sociology, American studies, ethnomusicology and mass media and communication.</p>
<p>The ties between the study of popular music and cultural studies are well known. However, in musicology, the work of Susan McClary, often associated with ‘new musicology’, marked an important attempt to merge formal musicological analyses and frameworks core to cultural studies. Looking back a decade after her groundbreaking work, McClary noted that formalist-oriented musicology ‘had lost sight of cultural meanings’. The legacy of her study, <italic>Feminine Endings</italic>,
<disp-quote>
<p>granted North American scholars license to discuss meanings and to exchange interpretations; it has encouraged the development of cultural studies in musicology; and it has made music accessible to the people working in disciplines far outside of music. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1367549412449724">McClary 2002[1991]</xref>: xviii)</p>

</p>
<p>The new connectivity that cultural studies brought to music studies could resonate immediately with the entwined concerns of cultural politics, youth culture, marginalized subcultures and popular music in ways that sought to overcome the tendencies to separate the organization of social power from the phenomenology of everyday life. In so doing, cultural studies restored the hermeneutical and phenomenological dimensions of music by addressing and unpacking the ethnographic terrain of the popular aesthetic to get at formulations of meaning, thus giving music studies an angle different from the production of culture paradigm. The sociologist Richard Peterson, a key founder of the production of culture approach, was one of the first American sociologists studying music to notice and incorporate CCCS-influenced work. As Peterson accounts:
<disp-quote>
<p>I learned a great deal from their ethnographic studies of how groups of young people take the types of commercial music on offer and reconstruct them to fit their own purposes. The 2004 anthology <italic>Music Scenes</italic>, edited jointly with the Brit Andy Bennett … is an attempt to systematically understand the context in which such grass-roots cultural formations are created and exploited.

<p>The hermeneutic and phenomenological dimension that British ethnographies taped reverberated with the same currents that were emergent in ethnic studies, as the latter sought modes of study that restored aspects of lived cultures and everyday life. The turn toward culture in general and popular culture in particular caught the younger intellectuals where they lived their everyday lives – culturally – in the push-and-pull of the popular. Cultural studies helped to foster new intellectual spaces for critical exploration of the popular by providing additional analytical and theoretical legitimacy to an already deeply-felt sense of what popular culture refracted and engendered in spite of its relative trivialization, if not exclusion, in academia where it was often held in disdain by scholars on the Right and Left.</p>
<p>The attention that cultural studies brought to media and mass communications also prodded the field of communication and media studies and re-established older and newer theoretical bridges. Interestingly, sociology once had a strong media and communications tradition, which it largely discontinued for other endeavors. Consider how early American sociology in the first half of the 20th century (rooted in the Chicago School) blended pragmatism, philosophy, symbolic interaction; journalism, newspapers, film and music; investigations into urban, ethnic and racial analysis; and youth, crime and delinquency and deviance, etc. This kind of synthetic sociology – which also championed early research in communications – was largely abandoned as sociology’s center of gravity moved to Columbia and Harvard, where the mode of enquiry favored social managerial frameworks amenable to the rise of structural functionalism and normative sociology, as the discipline became more aligned with the larger currents of Cold War society. If sociology once had strong ties to the study of mass culture and mass communication, those ties had largely frayed by the 1960s. Correspondingly, the fields of journalism ascended, along with public opinion and communications (with the latter two often associated with public relations, marketing and instrumentally hired out survey research). By the 1970s to the early 1980s, sociology and these new formalized disciplines seldom intersected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1367549412449724">Gitlin, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1367549412449724">Pooley and Katz, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>The fields of media studies and communication are important in that both hosted and were enhanced by cultural studies, which also pulled these fields, along with sociology, to begin treating popular and mass culture more seriously. Problematizing mass culture was already an issue of central concern within western Marxism’s attempt to understand the relations between structures of power, social conformity, social conflict and antagonism. The post-war juncture demanded such attention. Mass culture had become increasingly consolidated, had gained in diffusive power and emerged as an omnipresent feature in the USA, yet the analysis of its impact had become scattered and segmented into various walled-off disciplines. As noted, cultural studies refused to honor or perpetuate such boundary work in order to grasp the historically situated interplay of politics and theory beyond paradigmatic disciplines. Indeed, the fusion of media and culture, drawing firmly on sociological insights of earlier eras (the Chicago School) and insurgent theories from Europe (cultural Marxism, critical theory, semiotics and poststructuralism) were being knitted together in various patterns across British cultural studies, and in ways of problem formulation that offered key lessons to how and why such work might matter in the USA.</p>

<title>To look back and forward at the same time</title>
<p>It is a misreading to see cultural studies as simply trickling in from the outside, as an export being imported and then snapped up by theoretically hungry and shrewd consumers – or worse, by dilettantes doomed to join the ranks of the intellectual <italic>manqué</italic>. Such narratives that hold this view are easily sidetracked by – and identifiable through – the energetic foci they place on the shortcomings of cultural studies. They overlook the larger social and historical context that shaped the attraction offered by cultural studies, and which helped to install the conditions of relations and the relations of conditions, as the new intellectual sensibilities took. Up-and-coming students in the USA learned from this retrieved connectivity and melded it with the historical crisis of the Cold War, the Civil Rights Movement, anti-war politics and a resurgent Women’s Movement. The problem with the critique of cultural studies being trapped and short-changed by a reductionism to ‘race’, class and gender, is that
<disp-quote>
<p>it takes the starting point of cultural studies as its conclusion. Race, class and gender are not the answers in cultural studies, the bottom-line explanation to which all life may be reduced; they are precisely the problems posed – their history, their formation, their ‘articulation’ with particular historical events or artistic works. These are the issues to be explained and understood. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1367549412449724">Denning, 2004</xref>: 140)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Denning is right to point out how criticism demonstrates short-circuiting by misrecognizing the conditions of its own mode of argumentation, when ‘the attempt to trivialize cultural studies by citing the worst examples of pop culture analysis is not dissimilar to the attempt to trivialize the liberation movements by citing ridiculous examples of so-called identity politics’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1367549412449724">2004</xref>: 150).</p>
<p>The short-circuits that have arisen to dismiss cultural studies, especially by dwelling on the trivial, share an alliance with views of cultural studies as a series of failures. Seeing British cultural studies only as an export has encouraged views in which it was likely to fail. As I have argued, this view assumes that cultural studies was a thing capable of traveling intact and should have taken hold in ways resembling the Birmingham School. This notion, as Hall often addressed, had its own flaws and was even doubted within British cultural studies. However, the expectation still had its adherents, and that the CCCS could not be replicated led to unavoidable disappointment; this fostered criticisms of cultural studies that eclipsed its historical juncture with intellectual and institutional developments already brokered in the American context. It was an easy move for critics to latch onto the problem of class as the missing or abandoned rationality responsible for its American failure. This ascribed identification attributed to the ‘origins narrative’ of cultural studies appears to be a latter-day preferred reading, given that the crisis of Marxism and the problem of reductionism was already a serious debate, with challenges to orthodoxy and reductionism having nearly a half-century to ground itself before the CCCS was formed. British cultural studies did not invent this tension; it inherited it along with the theoretical irruptions that it struggled to assimilate. However, in its own historically remarkable way it gathered them up, brought them into critical dialogue and sought to focus them on the interplay of history and power, structures and subjectivities – projects and formations.</p>
<p>The overwrought criticisms that began to gain traction as cultural studies entered the USA <italic>in medias res</italic> obscure – perhaps strategically so in a theoretically essentialist way – the historical interplay, cross-fertilization, shared historical nexus and constitutive developments at root and, thus overlook the importance of subject-centered sociopolitical movements in the USA which, I have argued, were crucial in helping prepare cultural studies’ reception in the American academic milieu. Although the criticisms of cultural studies being not Marxist enough and yet too Marxian stem from quite different political ideologies and orientations, both indulge in the obfuscation and eclipse of this historical juncture. No wonder, then, that the trivialization of cultural studies for not ‘maturing’ into something like a bona fide discipline issues from both critical and conservative quarters.</p>
<p>Given the very long history of theoretical irruptions, many of which were central to the formation of cultural studies, it is perplexing that the solution to cultural studies is simply to get back to Marxism – as if this is somehow a neat and simple move. Yet this appears to be one of the most recent proposals to repair cultural studies today. As Paul Smith has argued, cultural studies got in trouble in the USA because it had harbored ‘an extreme desire not to be seen as Marxist’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1367549412449724">Smith, 2011</xref>: 252). According to Smith, cultural studies can now be renewed: it is now in a position to retrieve its responsibilities by embracing a sober Marxism that will deliver ‘notably, the definition of the field, its assumptions, its proper objects of study and its methods and methodologies’ (3). Smith speaks of an achievement that has moved past a ‘looseness’ that is ‘wholly out of date’ due to its association with the ‘early US importers of cultural studies’ (2), in that moment when Stuart Hall was (purportedly) ‘happy enough with the idea that “no single, unproblematic definition of culture” would underpin the operation’ (2). This hasty caricaturization of Hall’s perspective aside, Smith’s view is that cultural studies at his institution is finally able to shake off its British import and get on with academic professionalism. The renewal of cultural studies, Smith suggests, is to be had by distancing itself from the errors of past disappointments. In another section of the book, Smith identifies one of the major problems that befell cultural studies:
<disp-quote>
<p>I would identify as crucial in that narrative what I call the ‘thematization’ of cultural studies, where instead of thinking of culture as a structural phenomenon, it became a series of rote topics or themes: race, ethnicity, gender and so on. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1367549412449724">2011</xref>: 252)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Class, of course, presumably escapes rote trappings and, with structures, survives in this renewal. This neatness and sense of resolution, along with a corresponding appeal to formalist professionalization, probably makes sense as a strategically essential move when one deals with university culture and administrators, particularly at a time when disciplines are under increased scrutiny to produce legitimate intellectual products. This position of formalized enclosure is symptomatic of the historical terrain of interpretation that I have presented. It is a perspective that hopes to salvage cultural studies by positing culture as a solely structural phenomenon that should disentangle itself from the nettlesome social subjectivities themes of ‘race’, ethnicity and gender. Cleansed of the latter, the real is again presumably ‘graspable’.</p>
<p>Not so benign are policies that actually take steps to expel cultural forms seen as an impediment to well-run programs. One solution, regressive in its motivations, is to simply expel the excessive cultural margins. At the time of writing, the State of Arizona recently passed legislation that withholds public funds for secondary schools that teach ethnic studies, mainly targeting Mexican-identified arenas of pedagogy. This policy decision is coupled with a call to ban books affiliated with such ‘divisive’ subject areas. These cultural conflicts have their European counterparts refracted in a pronounced unease with ‘multiculturalism’, as numerous articles in this journal have documented over the recent years.</p>
<p>Abandoning class and structures is unacceptable. But we should be wary of accepting the historical amnesia that fails to grasp the interplay of historical formations and cultural projects. If the past is still in need of reckoning with, the present and future appear to yield more complexities that make it even more difficult to wish away new subjectivities by recourse to the neatness of theoretical technicism. New subjectivities continue to insinuate themselves into social and cultural developments that have become increasingly complicated within a rapidly transforming socio-historical and cultural context. We enter a world characterized by massive crises, taking the form of sprawling and hard-to-locate syndromes of violence along with ossified regimes of state violence; the rapid decomposition and reconstitution of functions of governmentality as well as structures of capital; religious apocalyptic views that seek to be realized; and technocultural capacities that can immediately link millions through the <italic>structurally disembedding</italic> capacities of new social media, producing massive transnational and somewhat accidental publics that cannot be grasped simply as expressions of class, gender, ‘race’, or as organizations or institutions. These are the very conditions that easily could bring into being entirely new horizons upon which even more troubled trans-subjectivities emerge. The challenge that these new conditions pose is not that they could become the next rote topics or thematizations that might distort a preferred reading of cultural studies. Rather, they challenge the grids of formalized paradigms rooted in the previous century, as they cannot be easily placed into neat structural categories, for structures are not fixed, there to be read off as analytically evident – structures, too, undergo restructuration.</p>
<p>I have argued that it is important to let go of the rigidities of the ‘export’ frame – not because cultural studies was a flawed import (the conservative critique), or that its virtues were spindled in its adaptation (the critical perspective). It is because it obscures the fine-grained interplay of a deeper and shared historical juncture. The ‘export’ frame precludes an appreciation of the complex negotiations that took place as cultural studies intersected the social struggles that were being interjected into the American university, which came from American society and which spilled profoundly into the most central societal apparatus of culture and consensus: the university. In distancing ourselves from the distracting quagmire of multiple accounts of failure so common among American critics, and from the laments within the viewpoints that indict cultural studies for being a ‘Marxist failure’ (which find some Marxists and anti-Marxists in agreement), we begin to see something quite different. We see that the historically valuable work that marked the rise of British cultural studies, especially its recognition and painstaking willingness to push open a much-needed theoretical expansion that was coming into visibility after the Cold War, had great import for critical studies and had impact upon a much broader terrain. This, in itself, is a remarkable historical phenomenon.</p>
<p>Although cultural studies did not find itself becoming cloned neatly and quickly, its collision and collusion with the social movement-inspired transformations that were taking place and shaping the crisis of higher education in the USA remain one of the most important developments to affect critical thought in the American case. This process was not likely to revolve around a distinct program formation, method or theoretical resolution and no ‘school’, but rather in a remarkable assimilative diffusion across, and in tension with, many sectors of the humanities and social sciences. This more general development, which did not result in an intellectual-managerial formation that was ‘headquartered’ somewhere – either in a discipline or in self-appointed guardians and gatekeepers – is much more formidable than the laments and obituaries that arose and that continue to swirl about today.</p>
<p>Cultural studies in the USA did not develop with the same kind of autonomy, neither did it encounter the level of institutional resistance that characterized its formation in Britain. In lieu of not having a center or school to opt towards, individuals were and remain in the condition of having to incorporate cultural studies sensibilities – the meaning, forms and angles and theoretical probing that now vary widely – within and in tension with institutional and disciplinary environments. The academic environment, also the site of social antagonism, enabled intellectuals that aspired to engage with and carry out cultural studies-identified work. It was the main terrain upon which such thought and work was possible (although never limited in this manner), and such work always took hold at the edges, or in the shadow, of established disciplines that both supported and remained wary over such innovations. Individuals attempting to move forward with cultural studies often did so in the negotiation of their work with the governing paradigms of disciplinary supervision. In the American context it seems much more the case that cultural studies was actually sought and enlisted as a strategy to give academic empowerment to thought and analysis, criticism and action, both in tension with and in support of a university system conceived (even if ideally) as the site within civil society where there was a primary responsibility to enable and protect such possibilities for the development of critical thought and practice. In this vein the university could be challenged – as it has long been, with varying degrees of failure and efficacy – to fulfill its most ideologically contentious and contradictory role: wanting to promote itself as a bastion of freedom from a powerful and encircling corporatist polity and culture while also operating as a corporate entity. This is not perplexing, given that the university at present is constitutively engaged in collision and collusion with a much more powerful corporatist formation. Yet this is the institutional condition in which we carry out critical work – and, again, with a necessary feel for relations outside and beyond the academy.</p>
<p>Raymond Williams’ reflection on the need to hold in critical play the understanding of intellectual work and the historical terms of its formation were important in the launching of cultural studies. His advice is perhaps even more urgent in the present context, which seems to be more aggressively interested in pruning back the idealist rhetoric that pertains to liberal arts education, a luxury that crackpot pragmatism and instrumentalist market logic would rather purge. Local as well as transnational milieus today recoil in the near collapse of global capitalism’s legitimacy and the fallout that threatens to shrivel the economically precarious will to keep education as part of the social contract. The current juncture fosters the view that education needs to be remade to fit diminishing expectations of yesteryear’s notions of progress and aspiration, and as the new discipline is needed to prepare a workforce which can compete in the new global marketplace. It is an environment in which academic disciplines are increasingly viewed with regard to their questionable usefulness that was once firmly anchored in the intellectual virtues of providing citizens with fundamental exposure to education as a civic good. Behind the rationales for readjusting to these interpretations is a larger anxiety that American society is ill-prepared to examine. Up to the recent past, American culture (which is not limited to its geopolitical borders) was constituted in the spirit of governing in the globalized inequality that underscored ‘the West and the Rest’. Today, the current crisis comes with the raw anxiety of inhabiting a ‘West like the Rest’, which is not limited to the USA. Both frames are built on the shambles of a world marked by historical structures of massive inequality. The moment is ripe for panicky and defensively dystopian enclosures around critical thought, and yet it is also ripe for a reinvigoration of critical thought.</p>
<p>The nexus of social moments and cultural studies was not accidental: the relationships that developed were dialogic as well as constitutive. The social conflicts that preceded the assimilation of cultural studies – some of which were present in shaping cultural studies in Britain – played a major role in how distinct social, cultural and politic strands developed in their constitutive relations. Certainly, the social movements noted above were fundamental in creating new institutional space for both the emergent social subjectivities that resulted in the demographic transformation of education and, in turn, the charged urgency and relevancy of the subject matter crucial to the intellectual sensibilities fostered in cultural studies. In addition, these relationships were historically situated. Grasping the nexus not only provides some important intelligibility with regard to what happened with cultural studies and why; it also begs the problem of the present: how attuned might cultural studies be today to the social moments and movements that swirl in many places in the world? The remarkable social movements of the moment – environmental struggles, expanding women’s struggles, economic justice, mass mobilizations against political authoritarianism, communication-enabled new publics and others – raise the question: what kind of intellectually flexible mode of critically productive thought will be available to enable the much-needed comprehending, combining and juxtaposing capable of bringing new conditions (combining formations and projects) into critical visibility and dialogue? Rather than hope and wait for some existing discipline or refurbished department to rise with readiness to grant degrees, we ought to think about what it means to be able to retain and keep kindled the critical yet now diffused spirit. It may be that the diffused assimilation of cultural studies across the many disciplines and many new places in other parts of the world will have another chance to show its value.</p>
