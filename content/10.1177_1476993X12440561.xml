<abstract>
<p>Richard Hays’s 1989 work <italic>Echoes of Scripture in the Letters of Paul</italic> defined the terms and established a method for the study of Pauline intertextuality. Neither the method (Hays’s well-known sevenfold criteria for identifying intertextual allusions) nor the terms (‘echo’ and ‘allusion’) have proved uncontroversial, however, and so this article surveys their reception, outlining and critiquing the major attempts to amend, replace or overthrow them. Concerns relating to the stability of the criteria themselves or to the theoretical framework in which they operate do not nullify their usefulness. Criticisms of Hays’s terms, and the inconsistency with which they are deployed, are, on the other hand, more easily sustained, and so rival taxonomies are reviewed and recommended.</p>

<p>The recent abundance of studies addressing the New Testament’s intertextual engagement with the Old speaks not only of how fashionable such studies have become but also of how fruitful their results have been. Within this flourishing field of New Testament studies the influence of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1476993X12440561">Hays’s 1989</xref> work <italic>Echoes of Scripture in the Letters of Paul</italic> (hereafter <italic>Echoes of Scripture</italic>) is considerable. No study of intertextuality seems complete without some discussion of his work and not a few publications echo even his title, for example Beetham’s <italic>Echoes of Scripture in the Letter of Paul to the Colossians</italic> (2008) and Litwak’s <italic>Echoes of Scripture in Luke-Acts</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1476993X12440561">2005</xref>).</p>
<p>The field is now so crowded and the debate so complex that no thorough survey can be offered in the space available. The more modest aim of this paper, therefore, is briefly to outline two of Hays’s more significant contributions to Pauline intertextual studies and the discussions and critiques they have provoked. To that end I will consider first his criteria for detecting scriptural allusions, finding much to appreciate and defend from his detractors, and second, his terminology for intertextual references (‘allusion’/‘echo’ etc.), which has done less to advance the debate and so some alternative proposals will be commended in conclusion. The focus, therefore, largely will be on the first and most discussed chapter of <italic>Echoes of Scripture</italic> entitled ‘The puzzle of Pauline hermeneutics’. For a broader engagement with the whole work see the four responses in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1476993X12440561">Evans and Sanders 1993</xref>, which contains a rejoinder by Hays himself. This response also forms part of collection of essays entitled <italic>The Conversion of the Imagination: Paul as Interpreter of Israel’s Scripture</italic> (2005) where more of Hays’s intertextual readings can be sampled.</p>

<title>Hays’s Criteria for Intertextual Detection</title>
<sec id="section2-1476993X12440561">
<title>Outline of the Criteria</title>
<p>There is an irony in the fact that Hays’s work has become best known for his sevenfold criteria for detecting allusions when in fact they serve as a prologue to his central thesis. Indeed he writes in protest that Pauline scholars satisfy themselves with questions of Paul’s sources and the extent to which he relies on Jewish hermeneutical practice without considering how Paul deploys those sources in the service of his rhetorical aims. Thus the main body of <italic>Echoes of Scripture</italic> is concerned not with identifying allusions but with interpreting them. That said, Hays is rightly concerned to defend himself against the charge that in some instances he has invented allusions where Paul meant none. To that end, and in the absence of an existing methodology, he offers his sevenfold criteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1476993X12440561">Hays 1989</xref>: 29-32) which can be briefly outlined as follows:</p>
<list id="list1-1476993X12440561" list-type="order">
<list-item><p><italic>Availability</italic>. Was the proposed source of the echo available to the author and/or original readers?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Volume…</italic>determined primarily by the degree of explicit repetition of words or syntactical patterns, but other factors may also be relevant: how distinctive or prominent is the precursor text within Scripture, and how much rhetorical stress does the echo receive in Paul’s discourse?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Recurrence</italic>. How often does Paul elsewhere cite or allude to the same scriptural passage? This applies not only to specific verses that are cited more than once, such as Hab. 2.4, but also to larger portions of Scripture to which Paul repeatedly refers, such as Deut. 30-32 or Isa. 50-54.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Thematic coherence</italic>. How well does the alleged echo fit into the line of argument that Paul is developing?… Do the images and ideas of the proposed precursor text illuminate Paul’s argument?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Historical plausibility</italic>. Could Paul have intended the alleged meaning effect? Could his readers have understood it?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>History of interpretation</italic>. Have other readers, critical and pre-critical, heard the same echoes?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Satisfaction</italic>. Does the proposed reading make sense? Does it illuminate the surrounding discourse? Does it produce for the reader a satisfying account of the effect of the intertextual relation?</p></list-item></list>
<p>The extent of scholarly engagement with these criteria is testimony to their significance even if, as we shall see, not all are persuaded of their value.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1476993X12440561">
<title>The Usefulness of the Criteria</title>
<p>The variegated reception of these criteria can briefly be outlined as acceptance, adaptation and rejection.</p>
<sec id="section4-1476993X12440561">
<title>1. Acceptance</title>
<p>Although it does not necessarily indicate wholesale agreement with Hays, several authors are content to cite his criteria without criticism, for example Beale subjects his own intertextual readings to them in his biblical theology of idolatry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1476993X12440561">2008</xref>: 24-25). Guthrie’s contribution on Hebrews in the <italic>Commentary on the New Testament Use of the Old Testament</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1476993X12440561">Beale and Carson 2008</xref>: 919-20) similarly notes their usefulness without further comment.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1476993X12440561">
<title>2. Adaptation</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1476993X12440561">Thompson (1991</xref>: 30-36, my emphasis) expands Hays’s seven criteria to eleven as follows:<disp-quote>
<p>(a) Verbal agreement, (b) Conceptual agreement, (c) <italic>Formal agreement</italic>, (d) Place of the Gospel saying in the tradition, (e) Common motivation, rationale, (f) <italic>Dissimilarity to Graeco-Roman and Jewish traditions</italic>, (g) Presence of dominical indicators, (h) Presence of tradition indicators, (i) Presence of other dominical echoes or word/concept clusters in the immediate context, (j) Likelihood the author knew the saying, (k) Exegetical value.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In part this extension is due to Thompson’s specific concerns—identifying allusions to Jesus’ teaching—but two criteria (those italicized) have wider application. Hays’s criterion of volume is equivalent to Thompson’s first and would be improved upon by the inclusion of the third, for that would concede that an author might not explicitly repeat ‘words or syntactical patterns’ but may still replicate the structure of an antecedent narrative or argument. This point is also made by Brawley who observes that allusions become audible when they ‘replicate the form, genre, setting or plot of their precursor’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1476993X12440561">Brawley 1995</xref>: 63). Second, Thompson’s criterion of <italic>dissimilarity to Graeco-Roman and Jewish traditions</italic> helpfully highlights potential allusions to texts other than the Old Testament. Thompson may also have overstated his case, however. If it could be proven that a suspected citation was dissimilar to anything found in Graeco-Roman or Jewish literature then that would be a strong confirmation of a biblical allusion, but that does not exclude the possibility of an author alluding to a concept drawn from biblical <italic>and</italic> non-biblical sources. To give just one example Heb. 5.14 speaks of the ability to discern good and evil, a capacity referred to in Graeco-Roman sources as diverse as Homer, Epictetus and Marcus Aurelius as a sign of maturity or the goal of education, but this does not make inadmissible the Old Testament parallels of <italic>inter alia</italic> Deut. 1.39, Num. 4.23 <sc>lxx</sc>, and Isa. 7.16. Therefore a better criterion than one concerned only with <italic>dissimilarity</italic> would allow for this circumstance also and recommend that the reader assess both the biblical and extra-biblical claims to be the source of the allusion.</p>
<p>It ought to be noted, however, that Hays is not unaware of this potential for extra-biblical parallels and responds to criticisms that his work should include greater discussion of such phenomena (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1476993X12440561">Hays 2004</xref>: 165). He insists that his approach remains an important and a more confident one since while we know that Paul had access to the Old Testament (Hays’s availability criterion) it is hard both to date many extra-biblical texts and to assess Paul’s knowledge of them or their hermeneutical techniques. In particular Hays rightly urges restraint and clarity when Pauline exegesis is labelled as midrashic. As he notes, the ‘exegetical yield’ is low even where Paul’s argumentation bears structural similarities with midrash and oftentimes the term is deployed by commentators only to explain away ‘their embarrassment over some piece of fanciful Pauline exegesis…as though the wholesome Hebrew label could render Paul’s arbitrariness kosher’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1476993X12440561">1989</xref>: 13 and see the wider discussion on pp. 11-14). Nevertheless, his criteria would be strengthened by the acknowledgement of other sources for allusions than the Old Testament.</p>
<p>A second means of adapting Hays’s criteria is to reduce, rather than increase their number. Some, such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1476993X12440561">Litwak (2005</xref>: 63) detect duplication across the seven criteria, for in his view ‘recurrence is essentially one form of volume’ and judgments ‘about historical plausibility and satisfaction of a proposed echo share much in common’. This accusation is hard to sustain, however, even if there is some overlap, for ‘volume’ concerns the proposed allusion in isolation, assessing its verbal and syntactical correspondence to the proposed antecedent text. ‘Recurrence’ takes into account the whole Pauline corpus and asks if the same text has been alluded to elsewhere. Similarly something would be lost if ‘historical plausibility’ were to be folded into ‘satisfaction’, for then there would be no explicit guard against anachronistic or historically implausible readings. Contrariwise, if ‘satisfaction’ were brought under ‘historical plausibility’ then the reader would not be invited, having used the first six more specific criteria, to sit back and take all into account.</p>
<p>A final form of adaptation involves the introduction of a two-tier system, whereby some criteria are held to be essential and others secondary. Brawley argues that only ‘availability’ and ‘volume’ are essential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1476993X12440561">1995</xref>: 13), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1476993X12440561">Berkley (2000</xref>: 60-64) generates his own list of seven criteria, and lists ‘common vocabulary’, ‘vocabulary clusters’, ‘links with other texts’ (drawing here on Stockhausen’s observation of Pauline hook-words [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1476993X12440561">1989</xref>: 56-59]) and ‘explication’ as ‘primary’, while for <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1476993X12440561">Beetham (2010</xref>: 27-34), ‘availability’, ‘word agreement or rare concept similarity’ and ‘essential interpretive link’ are essential, and an allusion must pass all three tests. On the other hand ‘scholarly assessment’, ‘Old Testament and Jewish Interpretive Tradition’, ‘recurrence’ in the same letter or in wider Pauline corpus and ‘thematic coherence’ are ‘supplemental in character and are of limited help in some instances’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1476993X12440561">2010</xref>: 32). Beetham is more prescriptive because, unlike Hays, he distinguishes allusion from echo and these criteria pertain to allusions only. In Beetham’s scheme allusions signify more than echoes for ‘if the author’s attempt to allude fails, then the alluding text will not be fully understood’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1476993X12440561">2010</xref>: 34) whereas the text will make much more sense in the case of an echo going unnoticed. Consequently Beetham outlines a more relaxed application of the criteria in the case of echoes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1476993X12440561">2010</xref>: 34–35). Within such a framework it makes sense to place a burden of proof on those who imply that a Pauline passage cannot be understood without their proposed allusion, and the three necessary criteria proposed by Beetham are, in this author’s view, fitting.</p>
<p>Such then are some of the proposed adaptations of Hays’s schemes. What they all share is an appreciation for the pioneering <italic>Echoes of Scripture</italic>, and their alterations, in the words of Litwak, ‘in no way detract from the “roadmap” Richard Hays has provided’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1476993X12440561">2005</xref>: 63). In this they stand apart from those who have questioned Hays’s criteria at a more fundamental level, and to those we now turn.</p>

<sec id="section6-1476993X12440561">
<title>3. Rejection</title>
<p>Stanley Porter expresses regret that Hays’s criteria have not been sufficiently scrutinized and sets out to demonstrate that they are all ‘very problematic’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1476993X12440561">2008</xref>: 39). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1476993X12440561">Porter (2008</xref>: 39), Hays admits that of his seven criteria the ‘last four are not so much criteria for determining echoes as they are attempts to establish the interpretation of these echoes, in other words, Hays has offered only three criteria for determining echoes’. By this stage Porter has already sought to undermine those three, of which more in a moment, but first this concession by Hays is not what it seems. In the course of describing the fourth criterion, ‘thematic coherence’, Hays does say that ‘this test begins to move beyond simple identification of echoes to the problem of how to interpret them’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1476993X12440561">1989</xref>: 30), but he clearly intends it to serve as a guide to identifying as well as interpreting. Nor does this comment mark a shift from the former to the latter in the criteria, for the fifth and sixth, ‘historical plausibility’ and ‘history of interpretation’, are concerned almost entirely, in Hays’s account of them, with identifying echoes. In truth the consistent argument in <italic>Echoes of Scripture</italic> is that these are, as advertised, ‘rules of thumb that might help the craftsman decide whether to treat a particular phrase as an echo and whether to credit my proposed reading of it’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1476993X12440561">Hays 1989</xref>: 29). Certainly Hays sees the criteria as a help in the interpretation of an echo, but they serve first as tests of an echo, and only second as a steer in its interpretation.</p>
<p>The first three tests are discarded with little more warrant. Porter’s discussion of availability notes that Hays expresses some agnosticism as to whether the hermeneutical effect takes place in the author’s or the readers’ minds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1476993X12440561">1989</xref>: 26). This much is true. Early in <italic>Echoes of Scripture</italic> Hays distinguishes five possible loci for the event of an intertextual connection being made: in Paul’s mind, in the original readers of the letter, in the text itself, in ‘my’ act of reading, in a community of interpretation. Hays claims to ‘hold them all together in creative tension’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1476993X12440561">1989</xref>: 27) although his account of satisfaction as ‘finally the most important test’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1476993X12440561">1989</xref>: 31) suggests a preference for the last two of the possible loci. In light of this Porter expresses concern that a text’s meaning itself is unstable if meaning depends upon the variable understanding of an audience. Nevertheless, the question of the availability of a proposed source text to author and recipient remains a common sense test, <italic>especially</italic> if your presuppositions of the foundations for textual meaning are those of Porter. Thus Hays’s criterion of availability remains a useful one, even if his account of the intertextual event would seem to minimize its importance in his own reading.</p>
<p>‘Volume’ is dismissed merely with a proverbial warning that ‘defining a metaphor [i.e. echo] with another metaphor is always dangerous’ and a complaint that Hays fails to include ‘verbal coherence’ which might argue for the criterion’s expansion, but not its rejection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1476993X12440561">Porter 2008</xref>: 38). Regrettably, Porter does not define ‘verbal coherence’ so it is not clear what he feels the deficiency to be. Finally, an objection is raised against recurrence which ‘may work for identifying more or less frequent echoes, but it does not seem to be able to determine a singular echo’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1476993X12440561">2008</xref>: 38). That is precisely the point, however. If an interpreter believes they have found a citation of a work never elsewhere cited by an author, the recurrence criterion by its very inapplicability urges caution.</p>
<p>Hays’s criteria have been scrutinized therefore more than Porter admits, and, with some minor revisions, they remain a helpful sketch of the various factors which ought to be weighed in the search for intertextual references.</p>
<p>Two more fundamental challenges have been mounted against Hays’s criteria which arise from the first and the last of them and so will be discussed here. The first concerns the availability to Paul’s recipients of the texts to which he supposedly alludes. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1476993X12440561">Stanley (2004</xref>: 3) questions Hays’s ‘maximal’ interpretations of Paul by highlighting the fact that ‘literacy levels were low in antiquity, access to books was limited, and most non-Jews had little or no prior knowledge of the Jewish Scriptures’. As a consequence Stanley argues that ‘we should not assume that the original recipients of his letters would have recognised even a verbatim quotation from Scripture unless it was marked as such within the text’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1476993X12440561">2004</xref>: 47) and that therefore <italic>Echoes of Scripture</italic> ‘is seriously flawed at this point’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1476993X12440561">2004</xref>: 47 n. 29). This is not such a fatal blow to Hays as it first appears, however, for even Stanley allows for the presence of ‘informed audiences’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1476993X12440561">2004</xref>: 68) within Paul’s congregations, presumably including elders who would be sufficiently informed to instruct their congregations from Paul’s letters. There were also those such as Epaphroditus and Tychicus who carried Paul’s letters and presumably were in a position, indeed were commissioned to expound Paul’s text. We would also have to conclude Paul was an appalling communicator had he constructed arguments whose force depended upon knowledge which, at least within those congregations with whom he was personally familiar, he knew to be absent. Better then to assume that ‘Paul’s own discourse is a more reliable guide to understanding him and his readers than hypothetical reconstructions about what was possible for him to intend or conjecture about supposed reader competencies’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1476993X12440561">Abasciano 2005</xref>: 26).</p>
<p>Finally, there are concerns raised by Hays’s criteria of satisfaction and to what extent this final criterion embraces the relativistic agenda of those literary theorists who first developed ‘intertextuality’, tarnishing the other six criteria in the process. Principally this objection comes from those who would regret such a move (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1476993X12440561">Moo 2007</xref>: 83-84; and, as we have seen, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1476993X12440561">Porter 2008</xref>: 38) although Green complains of Hays’s ‘minimalist notion of intertextuality’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1476993X12440561">1993</xref>: 63) and urges him to a still warmer embrace of a reader-response hermeneutic. Hays, on the other hand, seeks to reassure those who fear that his project amounts to interpretive relativism: ‘While I am well aware of the philosophical context in which these theorists employ intertextual analysis, I fail to see why my interest in intertextual echo should compel me to accept their ideological framework’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1476993X12440561">2004</xref>: 173). Nevertheless, as noted above, his advocacy of the satisfaction criteria as ‘finally the most important test’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1476993X12440561">1989</xref>: 31-32) suggests some degree of acceptance and a later statement makes this explicit:<disp-quote>
<p>The ideal of a perspicuous authoritative text that contains an unchangeable meaning is untenable because it denies the necessary contribution of the reader and the reader’s community in the act of interpretation. No longer can we think of meaning as something contained by a text; texts have meaning only as they are read and used by communities of readers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1476993X12440561">1989</xref>: 189).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>As a consequence, according to Hays, ‘original intention is not a primary hermeneutical concern’ but rather the focus is on an exercise of poetic imagination, on ‘the freedom of intertextual play’, and daring to ‘take the risks of interpretive freedom’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1476993X12440561">1989</xref>: 189):<disp-quote>
<p>While we will continue to recognise Paul’s readings of Scripture as abidingly valid figurations, we will also create new figurations out of the texts that Paul read, and we will do so in part by weaving Paul’s own writings into the intertextual web, perhaps discerning correspondences that did not occur to Paul himself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1476993X12440561">1989</xref>: 187, cf. 154-92).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This position should not be used, however, as grounds to dismiss the criteria, for to do so would be to commit the genetic fallacy. Regardless of Hays’s account of the reader-led generation of new meanings, his criteria remain a helpful checklist. In fact there emerges here a tension in Hays’s work. When setting out his literary and hermeneutical theory in abstract Hays diminishes the significance of the original meaning of the text cited, and the importance of establishing the later author’s intention to cite that text. However, in several worked examples Hays shows, quite brilliantly, how in Beale’s phrase ‘an Old Testament text keeps imposing its original sense on the later text’s author’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1476993X12440561">Beale 2008</xref>: 29; see e.g. the treatments of Isa. 52.5 in Rom. 2.22-24 and Ps. 51 in Rom. 3.3-4; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1476993X12440561">Hays 1989</xref>: 44-51) and of his seven criteria, the first five all seek to establish the likelihood that Paul intended the allusion. Thus those who hold a more conservative view of textual meaning and authority can employ Hays’s criteria and oftentimes imitate his practice, even as they question his theoretical foundations. The fault of inconsistency is not in them but in Hays.</p>
</sec></sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1476993X12440561">
<title>The Clarity of Hays’s Terminology</title>
<p>While the criteria offered by Hays have given the debate some clear terms of reference, the same cannot be said for his use of ‘allusion’ and ‘echo’ to describe the New Testament’s appropriation of the Old. There are as many proposals as there are theorists but a brief survey will highlight some issues relating to intertextuality not yet explored and serve as a warning to pay attention to how any given writer defines their terms.</p>
<p>Early in <italic>Echoes of Scripture</italic>, Hays makes clear his reliance on John Hollander’s study <italic>The Figure of Echo: A Mode of Allusion in Milton and After</italic> and that debt is in part demonstrated by his use of ‘echo’ and ‘allusion’ as synonyms, just as they are in Hollander’s title. If there is any shade of difference between them it is that ‘in general…<italic>allusion</italic> is used of obvious intertextual references, <italic>echo</italic> of subtler ones’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1476993X12440561">Hays 1989</xref>: 29). Even this breaks down on occasion, however, for example where Hays describes Paul’s interaction with Leviticus and Deuteronomy in Rom. 10.5-10 as an ‘echo…so loud that only the dullest or most ignorant reader could miss it’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1476993X12440561">Hays 1989</xref>: 29). For Hays these terms also encompass the whole spectrum, for throughout his work direct quotations are discussed as allusions, albeit obvious ones.</p>
<p>Porter would prefer rather more precision, and his objections in this case are more easily sustained. He highlights that the term allusion ‘has been a stock-in-trade of literary studies for countless years’ and denotes an intentional but indirect reference to ‘historical or literary entities, including people, events, or objects’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1476993X12440561">2008</xref>: 30). This has the benefit of distinguishing quotations from allusions for the latter are <italic>indirect</italic> citations. It also allows Porter to distinguish allusions from echoes for in his formulation an echo is an indirect reference to ‘a more general notion or concept’, compared to the specificity of an allusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1476993X12440561">2008</xref>: 40). Thus Porter’s scheme both shows more respect for the established use of allusion language and retains sufficient semantic difference between echo and allusion to avoid making one of them superfluous. Porter is not immune, however, from Hays’s weakness for defining terms and then deploying them differently for within the space of a page he distinguishes quotation from allusion before stating that ‘allusion involves the unacknowledged (indirect) quotation of previous sources’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1476993X12440561">2008</xref>: 33). There are also questions that remain. How ‘indirect’ does an allusion have to be to not be worthy of the name ‘quotation’? Or again, how general does the notion or concept need to be for an allusion to fade to an echo? An absence of illustrations from Porter suggests his definitions are harder to apply in practice, even if they offer some welcome order at a theoretical level.</p>
<p>Other attempts suffer the same fate, becoming impractical at the very moment they become specific, but perhaps the most helpful categories are those proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1476993X12440561">Abasciano (2005</xref>: 16-18). Within the range of the term ‘quotation’ he, like Porter, distinguishes between formal (i.e. those accompanied by a citation formula) and informal quotations, but also between exact and loose quotations, recognizing that some quotations are clearly meant as such, although they differ slightly in wording. Helpfully he notes a broad and narrow sense of ‘allusion’:<disp-quote>
<p>In its broad sense, allusion will refer to any intentional reference to a text, person, event etc. On this definition, allusion encompasses quotation and can refer to it. To quote is to allude but to allude is not necessarily to quote. In its narrower sense, ‘allusion’ will refer to informal, intentional reference to a text, person, event, etc. other than quotation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1476993X12440561">Abasciano 2005</xref>: 16).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Finally, Abasciano reserves ‘echo’ for those cases in which any clear intention to allude is hard to adjudicate and so locates it, as Hays does in theory if not in practice, at the fainter end of the spectrum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1476993X12440561">2005</xref>: 17).</p>
<p>A similar formulation but one which lacks Abasciano’s flexibility is that of Beetham. He limits allusions by insisting that they refer the reader to ‘a single identifiable source’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1476993X12440561">2010</xref>: 20), which prevents an author alluding to multiple texts as Paul does, for example, by describing his divine commission in prophetic terms in Gal. 1.15, and thereby alluding to both Isa. 49.1 and Jer. 1.5. He also, rather arbitrarily, defines quotations as ‘a verbatim or near verbatim citation of a former text of six or more words in length’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1476993X12440561">2010</xref>: 17). Abasciano sensibly declines to specify a number of words ‘since theoretically an author can quote just one word. Each case will need to be examined individually and judged against its context and what we deem to be Paul’s intention based on our exegesis of the text’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1476993X12440561">2005</xref>: 16; similarly, Allison urges flexibility while offering his own brief but helpfully illustrated taxonomy, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1476993X12440561">2000</xref>: ix-x).</p>
<p>Thus Abasciano’s formulation offers clarity with sufficient flexibility to encompass most of the data, and those involved in the debate would do well to adopt his terminology. Until such a time, readers will need to be alert to how any given writer is employing terms and will also be well served by those authors whose focus is upon interpreting Paul in light of his clearer allusions to Scripture rather than those whose interest in echoes threatens to fall into what has been recognized as the besetting sin of intertextual readings since it was first given a name: parallelomania (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1476993X12440561">Sandmel 1962</xref>).</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>For better or for worse, <italic>Echoes of Scripture</italic> defined the terms and established a method for the study of Pauline intertextuality in the first instance and it has been appropriated in wider fields and proved fruitful there also. Our brief survey has outlined the criteria proposed by Hays, the terminology he adopted, and, along the way, we have had cause to note an emphasis upon the act of reading in which the ‘freedom of intertextual play’ yields meaning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1476993X12440561">1989</xref>: 156). Generally speaking the most constructive criticism of the criteria is to be found among those who uphold their usefulness, while the concerns of those who seek to overthrow them are overstated, whether those concerns relate to the stability of the criteria themselves, or to the theoretical framework in which they operate in <italic>Echoes of Scripture</italic>. Although there is as yet no consensus upon the best terminology for instances of intextuality, Hays’s use of quotation/allusion/echo is too inconsistent even if some attempt is made to distinguish them, and proposals such as that of Abasciano are to be preferred for they allow the reader to know where on the terminological spectrum they are, and therefore what significance to attach to any particular case. These concerns aside, Hays’s method stands up to scrutiny and his own readings of Paul, by attending to authorial intent more often than his hermeneutical theory might allow, attune his readers’ ears to the resonances between Paul and the scriptures he echoed.</p>
