<p>The importance of John Berger’s <italic>Ways of Seeing</italic> can be summed up through the two s-words: ‘seeing’ as an active verb form, and the ‘s’ of the plural of ‘ways’. Today the plural of ways of seeing may seem obvious, but that is because people like Berger drew attention to it. The active nature of seeing, which makes it comparable to a speech act, is now taken for granted as well, but this was not the case in, say, the 1970s. Berger’s critique of the Western (singular) dogmatic way of seeing, with its depiction of women as passive and available for consumption, came about as a television series and a book containing more images than text; the text of that book consisted of short, clear sentences all printed in bold. <italic>Ways of Seeing</italic> unveiled something that had always been there but remained unseen. It showed this potential plurality and activity for all to see, realize, and act upon. Vision has never been the same since. This enhanced its impact outside the academy. It became an intervention within that visual culture it critiqued. At the same time, the depth of his insights made it also an enduring reference for critical art history and in a sense contributed to generating the visual studies movement.</p>
<sec id="section1-1470412912444187">
<title>Pluralizing Seeing</title>
<p>Just a few weeks ago I was visiting the brilliant collection of Thyssen-Bornemisza in Madrid. There was a spectacular Frans Hals painting, both larger than his usual format and brilliant in composition and painting. Its title was <italic>Family Group in a Landscape</italic> (c. 1645–48). We see father, mother, two children, and, a little more to the back and smaller, a black person – probably male. It was unclear whether this fifth person was small because he was a still a boy, because he was pushed backwards, or because he was theatrically minor in the composition. What bothered me immediately was the fact that even in 2012, the title had not been adapted. Given that the painting dates back to the 17th century, the person was most likely a slave, put on display by the wealthy family that owned him, along with the land that was probably theirs (as Berger has argued in his third chapter).</p>
<p><italic>Ways of Seeing</italic> offers numerous insights, some of which are naturally contestable. It takes for granted that the figure in Manet’s <italic>Olympia</italic> is a prostitute, and becomes sentimental about Rubens’ love for Hélène Froment ‘in spite of’ her fat flesh, forgetting the different conventions of female beauty. It posits the genre of still life as ostentatious, but omits to mention the Spanish <italic>Bodegones</italic>, that do the opposite of boasting. The reading of <italic>The Ambassadors</italic> (pp. 94–95) is meticulously historically knowledgeable, and thus ‘forgets’ the pluralization of seeing the book proposes – to the point of becoming somewhat boastful itself as a display of knowledge. The idea that the portrait became more ‘distant’ (p. 97) in the course of the 17th century is belied by some portraits in the Frankfurter Städel collection that emanate insecurity, confinement, and even incipient madness. No matter: provoking contestation is part of what a great intervention does. The important thing is that the book’s concept itself solicits such contradictions; it empowers its readers.</p>
<p>The pluralization of ways of seeing has been inspirational for artists as well. Who can continue to ignore the haunting presence of the history of slavery in the Hals, after Fred Wilson’s installation <italic>Mining the Museum</italic> in 1992, at the Maryland Historical Society – the artist’s international break-through, and a perfect instance of Berger et al.’s pluralization of ‘ways’. Since 17th-century art is usually titled after the fact, there seems to be no reason to continue ignoring the presence of black figures in these paintings, embarrassing as their positioning and scale may be. Especially in the case of international masterpieces, this presence would be an occasion for the museum’s visitors to reflect on the complex relationships between art and its beauty, on the one hand, and history and its cruelty on the other. This reflection would join and continue, complicate and resist aspects of, Berger’s crucial intervention.</p>
<p>From a feminist perspective, pluralization has been taken up with fervour. Griselda Pollock began to use an insistent plural ‘s’ after the word ‘history’. Her influential use of the idea of ‘histories of art’ was a crucial liberating gesture that helped answer conservative objections to the attention finally paid to the figures of women. Berger’s book makes this plain to everyone able to look. Rembrandt’s <italic>Danaë</italic> and <italic>Bathsheba</italic> led me to explore a pluralization within single paintings in my first book on visual art, <italic>Reading ‘Rembrandt’</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1470412912444187">1991</xref>). The final chapter of <italic>Ways of Seeing</italic> on the common elements as well as the differences between art and advertisement has been inspirational for the movement that led to visual studies. For me, the idea that art is in the present and advertisement in the future tense, in all its simplicity, refocused my interest on the tense of visual imagery. But all these insights require that we reframe the verb ‘seeing’ itself.</p>

<title>Seeing, Showing, Selecting, Space</title>
<p>I remember the time when seeing was considered a passive occurrence, something that you could not help – as distinct from looking. You look because you choose to, and you see what happens to be there. You can refuse to look and look away, but what you see is not in your power. I imagine that this old conception of seeing was implicitly derived from the predominance of linear perspective. The world lies at your feet, or in front of your eyes, and whatever is within the triangular space perspective draws is inevitably what you see (and visually own). This <italic>dispositif</italic> may have lost its predominance in art practice already with baroque painting, but it continued to dominate thinking about visuality long after.</p>
<p>So much so, that after speech act theory made its appearance, great theorists such as Louis Marin and John Searle established visibility as its equivalent, rather than understanding the obvious: if there is an equivalent in the visual domain, an act of visuality, it cannot be passive seeing, but making visible; in other words, showing. Thus, another s-word implicated the painter, curator, or other agent of visibility who is responsible for <italic>showing</italic>. However, if seeing sheds its passivity and, with the help of yet another s-word, selecting, becomes an activity for which the view is entirely responsible, we have an equivalent of speech acts that is a true form of agency. Seeing is not happening upon visibility but selecting from what is visible that which one wishes to see, acknowledge, and act upon; that which is useful for the subject.</p>
<p>This seeing is not only active; it is also dialogic. For it can only select from what is visible, and that is where showing comes in, as seeing’s counterpart. Thus, in the wake of Henri Bergson, an alternative conception of seeing surfaced, primarily through the work of the Bergsonian Deleuze, who incorporated it into his cinema books. This insight has had a defining impact on my recent work.</p>
<p>This dialogic seeing occurs in, and through, space; not the flattened space of perspectival painting, but a space within which the subject is and participates. Bergson is primarily known as the philosopher of duration, but he also reconceptualized space – an s-word fundamentally implicated in seeing. Space is what Bergson called a ‘natural feeling’; it is not – as in Renaissance perspective – geometrical and hence measurable and identical for everyone who perceives it. This ‘natural feeling’ is, instead, heterogeneous, different for everyone depending on where they stand. Such heterogeneity is the more forceful as it is strictly haptic. I have greatly benefitted from this conception of space for my book <italic>Of What One Cannot Speak</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1470412912444187">2010</xref>).</p>
<p>As I recall there, such Bergsonian space can be neither divided nor measured. Bergson calls this space ‘extensity’. Emanating from the subject, it extends outward; hence the term. In fact, I contend in that book, extensity is foreshortening considered in reverse. Foreshortened space extends from the ‘other’ towards the subject, not the other way around. The other thus touches the viewer. Reversed foreshortening is the kind of seeing that emanates from the subject, but in response to a (heterogeneous) space from which the subject selects his or her realm of visibility.</p>
<p>This concept can be refracted temporally. Bergson does this through multiplicity. He distinguished two kinds of multiplicity to argue for the continuity of duration:
<disp-quote>
<p>… that of material objects, in which the conception of number is immediately applicable; and the multiplicity of states of consciousness, which cannot be regarded as numerical without the help of some symbolical representation, in which a necessary element is <italic>space</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1470412912444187">Bergson, 2002</xref>: 54, original emphasis)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Instead of a numerical conception of duration as a succession of instants, he proposes the idea that living in duration is a form of <italic>gathering</italic>: each moment is accompanied by the memory of the preceding ones. This is why the presence of black figures in historical paintings cannot be ignored, lest the present endorse their neglect and enslavement.</p>
<p>The two forms of multiplicity can be said to merge in the occurrence of seeing that involves both the materiality of objects and that of the human body. Bergson considers the body to be a material entity, and seeing, consequently, a material practice. As a result, it is not simply time but spacetime that matters. This is due to the participation of memory in all acts of seeing (and other forms of perception. This participation undermines the possibility of the instant. Instead, our active acts of seeing gather, respond to, and pluralize history.</p>
