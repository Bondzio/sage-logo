<p>Historical knowledge makes a crucial contribution to our understanding of con-temporary questions. It is tempting, therefore, to read the past through contemporary sensibilities and with a view to making a case for specific approaches to professional practice. It involves working towards personal and social change by breaking down barriers to participation in society, particularly discrimination on the grounds of race, gender, class, disability, age, sexual orientation or religion. The essays highlight the fact that women formed networks aimed at addressing various local and most often gender-related problems that limited their quality of life. As women develop strategies through networking, their resistance seems to become increasingly significant for the ongoing transformations of the gender order.</p>
<p>The reviewed book provides a historical insight into women’s agency and ac-tivism in education from the seventeenth to the twentieth century. The collection is designed to recover the variety of voices of women inhabiting different geo-graphical and social contexts while highlighting commonality and continuity with reference to creativity, achievement and the management and transgression of structures of gender inequality. The essays in the book empirically describe and theoretically discuss the idea of agency in the context of women’s social practices of networking and to examine how the participants either reproduced or transformed the gendered structures that shaped them. However, the editor could have interpreted the participants’ networking agency as acts of protest against everything that limited their living conditions.</p>
<p>As rightly emerges from the chapters, education has the potential to confirm both the social mores as well as initiate discontent and become a means of change. Historical accounts of girls’ education have often emphasised change over continuity and have documented progress. However, this approach has been challenged by the women historians of the 1970s and 1980s as they have challenged the terminology of ‘revolution’, and have asked instead: Why so little had actually changed? The essays have explored how education encouraged women to achieve political ideals and individual ambitions. They also draw attention to the obstacles and exclusion and social censure of the contemporaries faced by women. Profound questions are raised about education, social change and women’s capacity both as individuals and as social beings. The chronological presentation of the chapters offers a journey through the historical narrative of women’s struggle to achieve agency. The hallmark of the book is the combination of a global perspective and historical period spanning four centuries.</p>
<p>An attempt has been made in the book to bring to light peculiarities of women’s agency as midway between formal educational institutions and institutions of care and social service. Their marginality, exclusion and secondary status has relegated their educational achievement to the background instead of in the mainstream educational setting. Because of their assumed caring role, women have expressed their educational agency within related institutions of social care and development in which the tensions of their public role can be more effectively resolved. This explains why Ramabai’s and Rokeya’s concern for the welfare of the poor and the marginalised was central to their educational perceptions.</p>
<p>The book has captured the biographical material and women’s own perspectives that can go a long way in articulating a female history of education as the boundaries between the private and the public in women’s lives have been so fluid. Writing in the seventeenth century, Wollstonecraft regarded female education as fundamental to improving the mind, rather than for ornamental accomplishments and projected it as a key to public service and citizen’s rights and duties (Joyce Senders Pedersen, p. 40). It is in this spirit that Sukufe Nihal championed the ideal of modern Turkish women and the creation of a modern Turkish State (Aynur Soydan Erdemir, p. 132).</p>
<p>The centrality of education is the common theme in all the essays and an attempt has been made to demonstrate how an improvement came about in the status of women. The question of a ‘feminine’ identity has been brought to light by highlighting the equation of science with ‘masculinity’ and the binary opposites in operation, for example, mind/body, reason/instinct, rational/emotional, etc., which have projected women as incapable of handling science and mathematics disciplines (Ruth Watts, p. 49, and Claire Jones, p. 149).Though a group of women in England in the late-eighteenth and nineteenth century contributed to a scientific culture, the fact that they were not allowed to become members of scientific societies (Ruth Watts) speaks volumes about the discriminatory attitude towards them. Women mathematicians at Cambridge in nineteenth century were described as ‘faithful followers’, ‘diligent’ who paid ‘meticulous attention to details’ but who were ‘not capable of great creative work’. Though Cambridge women targeted Mathematics in their campaign for intellectual equality with women, paradoxically it came to be viewed as a subject which would preserve a woman’s femininity which other disciplines (natural sciences) might threaten (p. 163).</p>
<p>The essays highlight the fact that male scholars have consistently questioned the ability of the female mind to conceive science and the ability of women to undertake extensive research. Thus, the female mathematicians in Cambridge, unlike their male counterparts, did not take part in the strenuous physical drill that was regarded as an important part of mathematical training. Women were forced to undertake gentler physical training amidst fears that their mental and physical training might rob them of their fertility (Claire Jones, p. 149). Conceptions about femininity and female roles denied women the right to education and banned women from universities in nineteenth-century Russia, forcing them to seek higher education outside the mother country. These Russian female students in European universities (Zurich and Paris) deconstructed the myth of inferior female intellectual abilities and gained an education in disciplines like medicine, law, mathematics, chemistry and philosophy. The Russian women represented the first example of mass academic mobility which is being encouraged today as Bologna process (Marianna Muravyeva, p. 86). Even when women were given recognition for their intellectual capacity, it was at the expense of their femininity and were complimented for possessing a ‘masculine brain’ as is reflected in Barbara Wootton’s memoir (Anne Logan, p. 215). A constant theme running in most of the essays is an ‘ambiguity towards the female intellectual as is reflected in the experience of the female humanists of renaissance like Anna Maria van Schurman. Being learned and being intellectual were in principle incompatible and even exceptionally intelligent women continued to remain intellectually inferior to men (Barbara Bulckaert, p. 23).</p>
<p>Religion has been central to the foundation and development of educational institutions and particularly non-conformist faith groups pursued the ideal of equality of women. The Quakers and the Unitarians pursued the issue of equal educational opportunity for women (Katherine Storr, p. 176). The centrality of religious belief, discourse and positioning is revealed in the educational achievements of Ramabai and Rokeya in nineteenth-century India (Barnita Bagchi, p. 71). Entry to the most prestigious institutions has remained problematic both in relation to professional societies as well as in institutions of higher education. Women’s educational agency is often practised in informal and marginal circumstances, outside of the mainstream, formal institutions. Educated women are able to play more active role in subjects which are in a state of flux and still evolving like criminology in Britain in 1930s (Anne Logan, p. 204). This consignment of women ‘to the fringes’ complimented their lower status in the public sphere.</p>
<p>The essays have highlighted the importance of ‘networks’ and friendships, formal as well as informal in advancing women’s education. Friendships with men have played a key role in facilitating access to learning as Johnston’s assistance helped Wollstonecraft with a home and social life which centred on a circle of progressive intellectuals, professionals and artists who gathered at his home and influenced her thinking (Joyce Senders Pedersen, p. 40). Besides friendships with men, the essays also outline the importance of associations with like-minded women. Female friendships, networks or communities have enabled women to develop support systems and new institutions giving rise to the notion of gendered social capital (Bagchi, p. 79). Some of the essays have considered the private sphere of the family in exploring the development of women’s agency. Belonging to a progressive thinking family was of great benefit to some of the women studied in this collection and enabled them to face the challenges of the public sphere. Phillipa Fawcett’s mathematical abilities were recognised by her family and special coaching arranged for her helped her become a future mathematician. Jane Marcet, the scientific writer, was given the same education as her brothers, as was Anna Maria van Schurman. Pandita Ramabai was fortunate enough to have a father who imparted advanced Sanskritic learning to the whole family, including his wife and daughter. Sukufe Nihal also was imparted elementary and secondary education through private schools and private tuition. While exploring the positive side of the role of family, the book also draws attention to the fact that girls’ education was largely informal; for example, in the case of Mary Wollstonecraft, her education was not made on the same basis as her brothers’ and books and conversations were her main source of information. Mary Sommerville was also self-taught unlike her brother.</p>
<p>An attempt has been made in the book to trace the history of individuals and groups of women who through education wanted to make a valuable contribu-tion to the society. The essays empirically trace how women had to transcend the social structures and lay claims to equal citizenship. However, to trace feminism over a span of four centuries entails multiplicity of perceptions as the meaning of feminism has shifted with time and place .The book has given a very broad meaning of feminism without going into the nitty-gritty of plurality and existence of a range of traditions that existed from 1600 to 2000. An attempt has been made to find interlinkages between educational opportunities and gender inequality. There has been an attempt to establish linkages between agency with reference to education and agency with regard to the pursuit of female rights, citizenship, equality and freedom. However, the essays are lacking in deeper reflections on specific cultural and social conditions and the structures that operate within female agency and which have played an important role in altering women’s social position.</p>
<p>The book could have paid attention to the variety of ways in which contemporary feminists negotiated and reconstituted conceptions of the female mind and its relationship to the body. While recognising similarities, the authors could explore how in each country the higher education debates and the underlying conceptions of women’s nature were shaped by distinct historical contexts.</p>
