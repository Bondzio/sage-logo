<p>Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease characterized by several serum autoantibodies and multiple clinical manifestations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0961203312436856">1</xref></sup> Prognosis may be determined by the involvement of the nervous system. The American College of Rheumatism (ACR) presented a nomenclature and case definitions for neuropsychiatric manifestations of lupus that include 19 neuropsychiatric syndromes classified in three main categories: diffuse psychiatric/neuropsychological syndromes that include anxiety disorder, cognitive disorder, acute confusional state, mood disorder and psychosis; neurological syndromes of the central nervous system that include cerebrovascular disease, demyelinating syndrome, headache, aseptic meningitis, chorea, seizures and myelopathy; and neurologic syndromes of the peripheral nervous system that include acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy, mononeuropathy, autonomic disorder, plexopathy, and polyneuropathy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0961203312436856">2</xref></sup> The most common neurological manifestations found in SLE are cognitive dysfunction, headache and mood disorders.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0961203312436856">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0961203312436856">4</xref></sup> There are no good serological markers for this type of SLE, although anti-neuronal, anti-p-ribosomal, and anti-ganglioside antibodies have been studied.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0961203312436856">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>Gangliosides are a family of sialylated glycosphingolipids expressed in the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane in cells of vertebrates. They are very abundant in the nervous system, particularly at synapses, and they are involved in neurotransmission at the neuromuscular junction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0961203312436856">6</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0961203312436856">8</xref></sup> Gangliosides have a hydrophilic sugar chain that contains antigenic determinants and a hydrophobic ceramide. In humans, gangliosides elicit a T-cell-independent IgM response.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0961203312436856">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>Anti-ganglioside antibodies (AGA) are associated with several neuropathies, such as Miller–Fisher syndrome, Guillain–Barré syndrome, and multifocal motor neuropathy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0961203312436856">10</xref></sup> Furthermore, in vitro experiments have shown a pathogenic role for these antibodies, and a decrease in the serum antibody concentration results in a clinical improvement, reinforcing the importance of these antibodies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0961203312436856">11</xref></sup> AGA IgM can cause leakage of the blood brain barrier in a concentration-dependent and complement-independent manner. They can also bind to neuronal gangliosides to create a neuromuscular block, and serve as a marker of axonal damage in neuropathies such a multiple sclerosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0961203312436856">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>A number of studies have explored the presence of AGA in SLE patients, focusing on neuropsychiatric manifestations and peripheral neuropathy with contradictory results.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0961203312436856">13</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0961203312436856">20</xref></sup> It must be pointed out that the origin, the number of the antigens studied and the methods used were different in each study. Until now, all studies of anti-ganglioside antibodies in SLE patients have been performed using non-standardized ELISA methods, and they did not perform TLC as a confirmatory test of ELISA results.</p>
<p>The aim of this paper was to determine the presence of antibodies against nine commercially available gangliosides in SLE patients with neuropsychiatric manifestations, using a standardized ELISA.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0961203312436856">21</xref></sup> The positivity of ELISA results was confirmed by TLC.</p></sec>

<sec id="sec3-0961203312436856" sec-type="subjects"><title>Patients</title>
<p>From a total of 364 consecutive patients diagnosed with SLE over the last 24 years at our hospital, 65 presented neuropsychiatric manifestations.</p>
<p>All 65 patients fulfilled ACR criteria for SLE.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0961203312436856">22</xref></sup> They were classified into three groups according to the ACR criteria for neuropsychiatric manifestations of SLE<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0961203312436856">2</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0961203312436856">Table 1</xref>). Group 1 included 29 patients with diffuse psychiatric or neuropsychological syndromes such as anxiety disorder, cognitive disorder, acute confusional state, mood disorder and psychosis. Group 2 included 48 patients with neurological syndromes of the central nervous system, such as cerebrovascular disease (strokes), aseptic meningitis, seizures and myelopathy. Group 3 included 11 patients with neurological syndromes of the peripheral nervous system, such as acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy, mononeuropathy, and polyneuropathy. The total number of clinical features is higher than 65 because 15 patients presented clinical manifestations corresponding to groups 1 and 2, 6 patients had manifestations belonging to groups 2 and 3, and 1 patient showed clinical features included in the three groups.

<p>The control group comprised 50 consecutive SLE patients without neurological manifestations. To date we have studied over 4,000 patients with peripheral neuropathies not related to SLE in search of anti-ganglioside antibodies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0961203312436856">23</xref></sup></p></sec>
<sec id="sec4-0961203312436856" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title>
<p>Serum samples from all patients were obtained during the acute phase of the disease and stored at −80°C until analysis. GM1, GM2, GM3, asialo-GM1 (aGM1), GD1a, GD1b, GD3, GT1b and GQ1b antigens (more than 95% purity) were purchased from Sigma (St Louis, USA). A standard ELISA and TLC were used to study AGA antibodies (IgG and IgM) as previously described.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0961203312436856">21</xref></sup></p></sec>
<sec id="sec5-0961203312436856"><title>ELISA</title>
<p>ELISA was performed as follows: briefly, standard 96 well plates were used; row ‘A’ wells were coated with 100 µl 100% ethanol alone whereas the rest of the rows were coated with 100 µl of a 2 ng/µl concentration of ganglioside in 100% ethanol (one ganglioside in each row) and evaporation was allowed to dryness at room temperature. Plates were stored at least overnight at 4°C. After blocking with PBS-BSA 1%, serially diluted serum samples (1 : 100, 1 : 500, 1 : 2500, and 1 : 12500) were added to the wells. Test sera were incubated overnight at 4°C. Plates were developed using o-phenylenediamine as substrate for peroxidase-conjugated anti-human IgM or anti-human IgG (Dako). Titres were calculated by end-point dilution analysis as follows: blank well optical densities (ODs) were subtracted from coated well ODs to obtain a working OD; means of working OD were obtained from duplicate wells; linear OD values (x-axis) were plotted against log test serum dilution (y-axis) on semi-log paper and a best fit dilution curve drawn; the titre was assigned to the point at which the dilution curve crosses the OD = 0.1 unit. The cut-off point was a difference of OD = 0.1 at dilution 1 : 500.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0961203312436856">21</xref></sup></p></sec>
<sec id="sec6-0961203312436856"><title>Thin layer chromatography (TLC)</title>
<p>Sera positive by ELISA were confirmed by TLC. The TLC method was performed as follows: 1 µg of each tested lipid was left to dry out and redissolved with methanol:ethanol (1:1). An established volume of this solution was loaded in each patient lane of a TLC plate. TLC plates were then transferred to a fume cupboard. A methanol, chloroform and calcium chloride solvent was placed at one side of a twin glass chamber and the silica plate was placed on the other side. After 1 h 20 min the buffer was dipped into the second dip and allowed to run to the top of the plate. The plate was then left to air dry overnight. The next day the silica plate was cut in several little plates (one for each patient) and one standard plate was developed with resorcinol stain. Each patient-plate was then placed for 20 seconds into poly-isobutyl-methacrylate beads diluted in chloroform:hexane (24:1) and air dried. After blocking with PBS/BSA each plate was covered with 2.5 ml of the diluted tested serum (1/100) and incubated for 4 h at 4°C. After washing, plates were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with horseradish peroxidase anti-human IgM or anti-human IgG. Finally, plates were developed by chemoluminescence.</p></sec>

<p>Neuropsychiatric manifestations of SLE lack a sufficiently specific and sensitive serogical marker. Although AGA have been studied in patients with these clinical features, results are controversial. We studied patients with SLE and neurological manifestations using standardized methodology (INCAT, 1999)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0961203312436856">21</xref></sup> to test the presence of serum autoantibodies to gangliosides in an attempt to establish a correlation with the clinical findings.</p>
<p>Antiganglioside (anti-asialo-GM1) antibodies were first associated with neuropsychiatric lupus by Hirano et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0961203312436856">13</xref></sup> and the finding was supported by Endo et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0961203312436856">14</xref></sup> and others.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0961203312436856">15</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0961203312436856">19</xref></sup> Furthermore, in a cohort of 91 patient with connective tissue disease, 38 of them with neuropsychiatric manifestations (including 22 SLE patients with neurological manifestations), Weiner et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0961203312436856">20</xref></sup> found a 63% prevalence of anti-ganglioside antibodies. However, no correlation was found between these antibodies and major neuropsychiatric manifestations. Nevertheless, regarding minor neuropsychiatric symptoms, these authors reported that 37% of anti-ganglioside-positive patients had headache versus 0% of anti-ganglioside-negative patients. In a recent work, Mostafa et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0961203312436856">24</xref></sup> reported that 83.3% of young SLE patients that were positive for serum anti-GM1 at the initial evaluation of the disease developed neuropsychiatric manifestations, and that seropositivity for these antibodies was a significant risk for association with cognitive dysfunction (odds ratio: 36; 95% CI: 4.3–302.8). However, all these studies were incomplete because the number of antigens studied and the methods used were different in each study (including few cases confirmed by TLC). The most frequently found antibody was aGM1. Based on our experience we consider all gangliosides should be tested first by standardized ELISA and subsequently by confirmation with TLC; otherwise some reactivities might remain undetected.</p>
<p>Regarding the pathogenicity of AGA, there is experimental evidence that anti-GM1 antibodies can block neuronal voltage-gated sodium channels.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0961203312436856">25</xref></sup> Also, IgG anti-GQ1b antibodies from Miller–Fisher syndrome patients have been shown to interfere with acetylcholine release in mouse phrenic nerve-hemidiaphragm preparations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0961203312436856">26</xref></sup> McGoniagal et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0961203312436856">27</xref></sup> recently wrote that nodes of Ranvier in intramuscular motor nerve bundles of mice are targeted by anti-GD1a antibodies that are associated with a motor axonal variant of Guillain–Barré syndrome, and reported that complement deposition triggered by these antibodies is responsible for nodal injury. However, the pathological significance of a single reactivity to aGM1 in patients with neurological manifestations has not been demonstrated.</p>
<p>Our results show that 24.6% (16/65) of SLE patients with neuropsychiatric manifestations were positive for anti-aGM1 and only 6.2% (4/65) had antibodies to gangliosides other than aGM1. Moreover, anti-aGM1 was found in all the different subgroups of SLE and neurological manifestations. In our routine practice we have found that about 9% of patients with peripheral neuropathy (including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) are positive for aGM1 antibodies as a single reactivity, at low titres in most cases, but we have been unable to correlate this reactivity with specific clinical subgroups (unpublished results). Furthermore, as yet there are no in vitro studies supporting their pathological role in autoimmune neuropathies.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our results show that AGA are not a useful tool in the diagnosis and management of patients with SLE and neurological manifestations.</p></sec>
