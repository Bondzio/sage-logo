<title>Introduction</title>
<p>I was hugely fortunate to have had the opportunity to teach with, and learn from, Stan Cohen during our shared years at the LSE. It was a chance meeting with him that led me to apply for a job in the Sociology Department/Human Rights Centre at the LSE where I have worked since 2004. Stan became a mentor, friend and inspiration to me from the outset.</p>
<p>Stan was a vital figure in the emergence, life and direction of the Human Rights Centre where I taught with (and learned from) him during the years we spent teaching successive cohorts of students on the Human Rights MSc. This was a huge pleasure for me, and I will never forget how enjoyable, and sometimes hilarious, those shared teaching sessions were, and how much he inspired the students he taught. He was the only person I knew who could shoehorn the odd genocide joke into a lecture, a controversial privilege he could, rightly, claim. I feel that I will continue to learn from him through his always insightful, elegant and deeply morally engaged writings and will definitely remember some of the very many, and very funny, jokes he told (even if it is not my privilege to repeat them). In particular, his work on torture and his position on the question of Palestine/Israel was, to me and to many others, unflinching, invaluable and brave. More parochially, Stan was always hilariously caustic about the rise of the new academic manageriat, inventing new acronyms to replace those that symbolized new forms of bureaucracy and surveillance in academic life.</p>
<p>It is entirely axiomatic, now, to note how hugely important and influential Stan’s work was, and will continue to be, first in the field of criminology and later in human rights. In this tribute, I want to concentrate on his characteristically shrewd and entirely distinctive contribution to thinking about human rights, and upon the ways in which his ideas have imprinted my own work.</p>

<title>Denial, atrocity and social suffering</title>
<p>Cohen’s invaluable contribution to two key areas of human rights – the commission of atrocities, and social responses to suffering – is a contribution that exceeds in its insight, power and influence the discipline of sociology and its subdiscipline, criminology. We might see his denial thinking as continuous with his earlier moral panic idea. If moral panic was about the <italic>over-reaction</italic> to social problems, denial concerned its opposite: the social and political <italic>under-reaction</italic> to atrocity and suffering.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1741659013488470">1</xref></sup> I am always reminded, when thinking about denial, of Borges’ famous story, <italic>Funes the Memorias</italic>, which presaged a number of themes to which late twentieth-century human rights and transitional politics promised to respond – ‘looking without seeing’, ‘listening without hearing’, ‘forgetting everything’ – and to which Stan Cohen’s <italic>States of Denial</italic> attended with characteristic acuity and wisdom.</p>
<p>Typically, Cohen took an unsettling approach to these problems, what might be called a 360-degree approach which tackled state denials of atrocity, the humanitarian communicators (human rights organisations), <italic>and</italic> the consumers of humanitarian communication who seemed to avoid responding to appeals about ‘distant suffering’. Let’s take these in turn. Cohen became interested in the strategies by which states deny state crimes when faced with claims to the contrary, usually voiced by human rights organisations. He identified different types of state ‘voodoo talk’: (a) literal denial: ‘X was not tortured’; (b) interpretive denial: ‘it’s not what it seems, it’s not really torture, just “moderate physical pressure”’; (c) implicatory denial: ‘the suspect is a ticking bomb and torture is justified under the special conditions in which we find ourselves’ (a justification that acquired new life in the post-9/11 context, favoured by neo-conservatives and liberal intellectuals alike). That work on state denials has its roots in Cohen’s enduring interest in torture. He noted that in understanding torture we were equipped with the history of fluctuating social reactions to torture – the oscillation between the extremes of tolerance and prohibition from Roman law, to the Enlightenment, to the mid twentieth century when the era of human rights declarations seemed to signal its end. However, he argued that we needed a different, companion history to this in order to make sense of this oscillation. This companion history would chronicle the justifications for torture, including documenting the official discourse of torture (weasel words) used by governments to conceal or deny that they were actually practising torture. For example, France’s ‘special procedures’ in Algeria, Israel’s ‘moderate physical pressure’ used against Palestinians in the Occupied Territories, or British ‘depth interrogations’ in Northern Ireland.</p>
<p>Cohen also argued that human rights organisations should not escape critical scrutiny. He investigated the credos that underpin their work, particularly the assumption <italic>if only people knew they would act</italic>. Is this the case, Cohen wanted to know. Does knowledge break through denial and facilitate action? What is the real relationship between knowledge and action? In order to address these questions, Cohen had to address a second sphere of denial: that of the consumers of humanitarian communication. The problem is illustrated in one of the opening gambits of <italic>States of Denial</italic>, which I’ve come to call the ‘croissant vignette’, in which Cohen depicts a ‘nice, middle-class couple’ enjoying a lazy breakfast of coffee and croissants and browsing the weekend papers, out of which fall various humanitarian appeals and campaigns. What, Cohen wants to know, does this information do to the croissant eaters, and what do they do with it? Instead of action, Cohen reveals a set of responses, a denial of suffering, that operate as bystander alibis that expose apathy, detachment and self-justification:<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1741659013488470">2</xref></sup> ‘oh, it’s just one thing after another’, ‘it’s always gone on, that’s just the way it is’, ‘it’s not my problem’. He exposes these as ideological justifications that masquerade as common sense, which simply increases their authority and popular appeal.</p>

<title>Influence</title>
<p>Cohen has left a powerful and challenging legacy to thinkers about human rights. Specifically, his important ideas have enabled me to open up insights into some of the problems at the heart of human rights and transitional politics and helped me to question some of the conventional wisdom in these fields. Cohen has influenced three main areas of my work: on (a) transitional politics and the problem of acknowledging the crimes of the past; (b) reparations to victims of atrocities as a form of social control; and (c) humanitarian communication and the knowledge–action nexus in human rights reporting.</p>
<p>Cohen’s most important influence on my work has been around the idea of retroactive social control, or ‘policing the past’. This concerns the question ‘how do states in transition confront atrocities perpetrated by an outgoing (authoritarian) regime?’ This question became relevant to an important set of political transitions to democracy across Latin America, Eastern Europe and South Africa from the early 1980s to the present. My work on South Africa is concerned with the idea of policing the past by analysing the particular story the state told about the history of apartheid violence. I looked at the ways in which the Truth and Reconciliation Commission opened up the past by investigating only political crimes, that is, gross violations of human rights (torture, extrajudicial killings and so on) that had been perpetrated in the course of political violence between the state and its armed opponents. I showed how this way of policing the past generated particular silences and problems: (a) it seemed to create a moral equivalence between the crimes of the apartheid state and the actions of those who challenged apartheid, who were fighting a war of liberation; and (b) it left the problem of regular, quotidian, structural violence of apartheid inadequately addressed since it escaped the logic of the amnesty bargain which sought responsibility for political crimes alone. Yet structural violence affected many more people than did political violence.</p>
<p>Cohen’s ideas about the social control of the past (‘control by opening, control by closing the past’) continued to be relevant to my work on post-junta Argentina. In that work I examined the practice of granting reparations to victims of atrocities, a now established norm of human rights practice (in theory, at any rate). In this work I outlined the ways in which contemporary debate about reparation for past wrongs turns on the assumption that state reparation benefits the victims of atrocity by acknowledging harm and ameliorating victim suffering. However, I argued, drawing on Cohen, that reparation can also function to placate victim demands for criminal justice and to regulate the range of political and historical meanings with which the crimes of the past are endowed. As such, state reparation can work to control social suffering with the consequence that it sometimes intensifies rather than alleviates it. I evidenced this claim by investigating the refusal of reparations by the victims towards whom it is addressed, with special reference to Argentina’s <italic>Madres de Plaza de Mayo</italic>.</p>
<p>I have also drawn on Cohen to examine the problem of humanitarian communication in relation to human rights reports. I took up Cohen’s identification of the credo that underpins human rights knowledge production, <italic>if only people knew they would act</italic>, in order to investigate the knowledge–action nexus. In that work I show how much of the reported information on violations of atrocity is conditioned by a stylistic characteristic that represents violence as stripped of social, historical and political context. This feature, Cohen argues, is attributable to one of the core ideas that underpins human rights work: no context can ever justify violations. In addition, in order for human rights ‘measures’ to be applied, violations must be universally comparable, and therefore reduced to taxonomic relations. I take this argument further to suggest that such decontextualisation might itself be fundamental to the problem of denial: the less consumers of humanitarian communication know about the context of a violence, the more likely they are to disengage because they can’t see how they might be implicated in, responsible even, for distant suffering, nor how they might act to make a difference.</p>
<p>Cohen’s work was unusual in that he made it possible to critique the practices and protocols of humanitarianism, but in a generous way that opened up debate among and between the thinkers, writers and practitioners. He simply was unafraid to subject the ‘good guys’ to social scientific scrutiny too. His work on denial is appealing to academics and human rights entrepreneurs alike because it is profound but it shuns the arcane, and offers a rich and provocative agenda for the thought and practice of human rights.</p>
