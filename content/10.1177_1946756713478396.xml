<p>What will become of Libya, Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, and a host of other Middle Eastern countries that are now either in the grip of violent political upheaval or emerging from it? Mark Katz, professor of government and politics at George Mason University and the author of <italic>Leaving Without Losing: The War on Terror After Iraq and Afghanistan</italic> (Johns Hopkins 2012) doesn’t claim to have definitive answers. But he speaks authoritatively on what will <italic>not</italic> transpire.</p>
<p>There will probably not be flourishing democracies in Afghanistan and Iraq but neither will there be any ultimate Al Qaida victory. And even if one or more countries should fall under Islamic terrorists’ control, Katz argues, don’t expect others to follow suit. He calls for the United States and other nations to exercise restraint, engaging but not overreaching. Rick Docksai, assistant editor for <italic>World Future Review</italic>, spoke with Katz in this interview.</p>
<speech>
<speaker>World Future Review (WFR):</speaker>
<p>All this turbulence in Syria, Egypt, and elsewhere in the Middle East, how is it influencing the ground situation in Iraq and Afghanistan—or, is it affecting them to any great extent at all?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Mark Katz:</speaker>
<p>Not only is Iran aiding the Assad regime in Syria but the Iraqi government led by the Arab Shi’a politician Nuri al-Maliki is, too. There is logic (however unfortunate) as to why he is doing this. Among his principal opponents inside Iraq are the Arab Sunni minority. The Assad regime in Syria is based on the minority Alawite (an offshoot of Shi’ism) in that country. The Syrian opposition hails mainly from the Sunni majority. If the Sunni majority comes to power in Syria, Maliki may well fear that it will help the Sunni minority of Iraq to retake their political dominance, which they maintained not just under Saddam Hussein, but previously as well.</p>
</speech>
<p>The Arab Spring does not seem to be having an impact (at least, not yet) in Afghanistan. One possibility, though, is that if Moscow becomes so annoyed with Washington over Syria, it might reduce American access to—or increase the cost to the U.S. of using—the Northern Distribution Network (the alternative supply route to Afghanistan running through Russia and Central Asia that has allowed the U.S. to reduce its dependence on unreliable routes through Pakistan). But since the American presence in Afghanistan benefits Russian security interests, this seems unlikely.</p>
<speech>
<speaker>WFR:</speaker>
<p>Analysts are calling the Benghazi embassy attack a “terrorist” incident, and some say that Al Qaida was behind it. Whether Al Qaida was involved or not, how worried should we be that terrorist movements in general are going to take on new leadership roles in the uprisings still taking place in the Arab World? How feasible is it that the Arab Spring could inadvertently serve as a springboard for Islamic terrorist groups to seize power?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Katz:</speaker>
<p>To the extent that the Arab Spring leads to a breakdown of the previous authoritarian order, it may allow groups linked to Al Qaida opportunities to launch attacks. But gaining a greater ability to launch attacks is a far cry from seizure of power. The popular forces of the Arab Spring appear to be as much opposed to Al Qaida and the sort of dictatorship they know it would erect as they are to the incumbent authoritarian regimes they have replaced (or seek to). Any attempt by groups linked to Al Qaida to seize power will be resisted by internal forces within any country they attempt to seize power in. And if they do manage to seize power anywhere, they will undoubtedly rule so malevolently that they generate even greater opposition to them.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>WFR:</speaker>
<p>Dissatisfaction with Prime Minister Maliki seems to be brewing among Iraqi lawmakers, and there is growing talk of a “political crisis” (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.iraqinews.com/baghdad-politics/replacing-maliki-to-settle-current-crisis-still-valid-options-says-kurdish-mp/">http://www.iraqinews.com/baghdad-politics/replacing-maliki-to-settle-current-crisis-still-valid-options-says-kurdish-mp/</ext-link>). How dangerous a situation is this? What are the chances for a peaceful resolution?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Katz:</speaker>
<p>This political crisis is the inevitable result of Maliki’s increasingly authoritarian rule. It should come as no surprise. Indeed, it would have been a real surprise if Iraq’s disparate and well-armed communities simply accepted his misrule without opposing it. The situation is likely to result in an intensification of the current intercommunal conflict in Iraq. Neighboring powers are very likely to also become involved through supporting different Iraqi groups. We could see fighting there for many years. It is doubtful, though, that any one group will be powerful enough to defeat the others—especially when each is receiving outside help. Conflict resolution is unlikely to be successful in the short term, but may have more of a chance if fighting drags on inconclusively and the major players in Iraq get sick of it.</p>

<p>An Israeli military strike against Iran is perhaps a “wild card” event, but it’s one that a lot of people fear might well occur. What do you think is the likelihood of this happening? And if it did, what repercussions might it inflict upon Afghanistan and Iraq?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Katz:</speaker>
<p>When Israel launched attacks on nuclear facilities in Iraq and Syria previously, it did not announce that it might do so in advance. They just acted. The fact that Israel is threatening to attack Iranian nuclear facilities now suggests to me that they might not actually be serious about doing so, but hope the U.S. will do something instead. It is possible, of course, that Israel will launch an attack. Iran can be expected to lash out at both Israel and the U.S. With the U.S. having left Iraq, though, it is not clear what Iran could do that wouldn’t threaten to lead Tehran into its own quagmire there. And while Iran could take actions that harm the remaining American and Coalition presence in Afghanistan, anything it might do that could result in increased influence for the anti-Shi’a Taliban would hardly be in Iran’s long-term interests.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>WFR:</speaker>
<p>Some reports have circulated in the last few months that Iran is helping Venezuela build missile silos that, once completed, could fire Iranian ballistic missiles at targets in the United States (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.businessinsider.com/iran-is-building-rocket-bases-in-venezuala-2012-1">http://www.businessinsider.com/iran-is-building-rocket-bases-in-venezuala-2012-1</ext-link>). Suppose that Iran did succeed in building nuclear weapons. How realistic is it to think that it could threaten the United States with them? How would international relations, in general, change if Iran actually did become a nuclear-armed power?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Katz:</speaker>
<p>I simply do not find these reports about Iranian missile bases in Venezuela to be credible. Any Iranian attack against U.S. interests from Venezuelan territory would lead to immediate American retaliation against Venezuela—which, of course, could threaten the survival of the Chavez regime. And as for Iran threatening the U.S. with nuclear weapons (presumably based on Iranian territory), this would clearly be suicide for Tehran. And however repulsive the Iranian leadership might be, they do not appear to be suicidal but to much prefer remaining in power. The Iranian acquisition of nuclear weapons, though, would probably lead to results similar to what occurred following their acquisition by other countries (such as India, Pakistan, and North Korea): The rest of the world would suddenly treat them more politely.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>WFR:</speaker>
<p>You suggest at a few points in your book that Iran could also play an opposite role: that of peacemaker. The United States and its allies could find common cause with Iran and enlist its help in stabilizing other countries’ domestic strife. This scenario sounds like a major 180° turnabout from the current state of affairs between the United States and Iran. How feasible, though, would it be for us to transition from the current state of U.S.–Iranian enmity, to one in which the two countries work together? What steps would have to occur first?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Katz:</speaker>
<p>An Iranian–American rapprochement certainly does not seem likely any time soon. But in addition to being anti-American and anti-Israeli, Al Qaida and other radical Sunnis are virulently anti-Shi’a and anti-Iranian. I find it interesting that while it is widely reported that Iran is backing the Assad regime in Syria and Al Qaida supports the Sunni opposition against it, little attention has been paid to the fact that Iran and Al Qaida are on opposing sides here. If and when radical Sunni forces grow strong enough to seriously threaten Iranian interests, I would not be surprised if Tehran becomes more amenable to cooperating with America—just as the Sino-Soviet rift led these two anti-American regimes to cooperate with Washington.</p>
</speech>
<p>Iranian–American relations could also improve if an “Arab Spring” movement should seize power in Iran. The 2009 Green Movement there (which the U.S. did precious little to support) shows that the potential for this does exist.</p>
