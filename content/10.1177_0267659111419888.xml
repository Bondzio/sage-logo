<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Jugular venous oxyhemoglobin saturation (SjO<sub>2</sub>) is an acceptable monitor of the global balance of cerebral blood flow and the cerebral metabolic rate. Previously, Nakajima, et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0267659111419888">1</xref></sup> reported that a significant reduction of SjO<sub>2</sub> was noted during the rewarming phase of hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and subsequent clinical studies reported that cerebral venous oxygen desaturation was associated with postoperative cognitive dysfunction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0267659111419888">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0267659111419888">3</xref></sup> Thus, an increase in SjO<sub>2</sub> during rewarming could contribute to prevention of cognitive dysfunction after CPB. Some interventions to induce vasodilatation may facilitate an increase of cerebral blood flow and prevent the cerebral oxygen imbalance during the rewarming period. Hypercapnia-induced vasodilatation was reported to be effective in preventing a decrease in SjO<sub>2</sub> during the rewarming period.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0267659111419888">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Milrinone, a phosphodiesterase III inhibitor, is known to have a direct vasodilating action on arteries, including the cerebral artery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0267659111419888">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0267659111419888">6</xref></sup> In addition, it also has an inotropic action and this action is useful for weaning from CPB.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0267659111419888">5</xref></sup> Thus, milrinone may be more suitable than any other vasodilators in the anesthetic management of patients undergoing cardiac surgery with hypothermic CPB.</p>
<p>The present study was designed to examine the effects of milrinone on the balance between cerebral oxygen supply and demand by monitoring SjO<sub>2</sub> during the rewarming period of CPB.</p>

<sec id="section3-0267659111419888">
<title>Patients</title>
<p>This study had the approval of the ethics committee of our institution and written, informed consent was obtained from all patients. Fourteen patients scheduled for elective valve surgery with CPB were studied. Patients with a history of cerebrovascular disease, psychiatric disease, and renal disease were excluded from the study. The number of patients in this study was calculated to detect the statistical difference in SjO<sub>2</sub> at 10 min after the start of rewarming of CPB by treatment with milrinone, with a P-value of 0.05 and a power of 80% in our preliminary test.</p>

<title>Anesthesia and cardiopulmonary bypass</title>
<p>Patients were not premedicated. Anesthetic management was performed with a modified neuroleptanalgesia technique. Anesthesia was induced with midazolam 0.2 mg/kg and fentanyl 2 µg/kg, followed by vecronium 0.2 mg/kg to facilitate tracheal intubation. After tracheal intubation, the lungs were mechanically ventilated with oxygen in air (F<sub>i</sub>O<sub>2</sub>: 0.3 to 0.5). Anesthesia was maintained with fentanyl (total dosage of fentanyl: 30 µg/kg) and midazolam 0.2 mg/kg. Muscular relaxation was achieved by intermittent administration of vecronium. No volatile anesthetic was administered until the study was completed. A 22-gauge radial arterial catheter was inserted into the radial artery to monitor arterial blood pressure and to sample the arterial blood for blood gas analysis. A pulmonary arterial catheter (Vigilance<sup>®</sup> Swan-Ganz CCO Thermodilution Catheter; Baxter, Irvine, CA, USA) and a triple lumen central venous pressure (CVP) catheter were inserted through the right internal jugular vein. A 5.5 F fiberoptic oximeter catheter (Opticath; Abbott Laboratories, North Chicago, IL, USA) was also inserted via the right jugular bulb retrogradely through the right internal jugular vein for continuous monitoring of SjO<sub>2</sub>. The catheter was calibrated in vivo immediately after insertion and just before introduction of CPB.</p>
<p>CPB was introduced with gradually increasing flow and total flow was established within the first minute. During CPB, a non-pulsatile pump flow of 2.5 L/min/m<sup>2</sup> was maintained using a membrane oxygenator (Mera excelung; Sennkou-Ika, Saitama, Japan) and an arterial line filter. CPB was managed according to the alpha-stat regime under moderate hypothermia and PaCO<sub>2</sub> was maintained between 35 to 40 mmHg. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) was maintained between 45 and 70 mmHg by infusion of a vasoconstrictor (noradrenaline) and vasodilator (nicardipine), if needed. After establishment of hypothermic CPB (a nasopharyngeal temperature (NPT) of 32.6 ± 1.1°C), mean arterial pressure, SjO<sub>2</sub>, and NPT were monitored continuously and recorded every 5 minutes after the start of rewarming during CPB.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0267659111419888">
<title>Protocol</title>
<p>Patients were assigned randomly to two groups before anesthesia: one receiving continuous infusion of milrinone, 0.5 µg/kg/min during CPB (n = 7) and the other receiving saline for control (n = 7), according to a computer-generated random numbers table. The administration was started just after the establishment of hypothermic CPB and maintained throughout the CPB. The aim of the present study was to examine the effect of milrinone on cerebral oxygen balance during the rewarming period of CPB. Since a previous report documented that the speed of increasing temperature is a critical factor that aggravates the cerebral oxygen balance,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0267659111419888">1</xref></sup> we measured a reduction of SjO<sub>2</sub> (ΔSjO<sub>2</sub>) and an increase in NPT (Δt) from start of rewarming to 10 minutes and 10 to 20 minutes after rewarming and then calculated a quotient of ΔSjO<sub>2</sub>/Δt at two measurement points for each treatment group, respectively.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The present study demonstrates that milrinone significantly prevented a reduction of SjO<sub>2</sub> during the early rewarming period of CPB. Our results may suggest that milrinone improves a mismatch between global cerebral oxygen demand and supply during the early rewarming period.</p>
<p>It is well recognized that rewarming from hypothermic CPB is associated with a reduction in SjO<sub>2</sub>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0267659111419888">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0267659111419888">7</xref></sup> This phenomenon indicates that cerebral oxygen imbalance occurs during the rewarming period and it may be due to a temporary greater increase in the cerebral metabolic rate for oxygen than an increase in cerebral blood flow.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0267659111419888">8</xref></sup> Thus, It can be supposed that any vasodilator might have a beneficial effect by improving cerebral blood flow. For example, a previous report documented that hypercapnia-induced vasodilatation was reported to be effective in preventing a decrease in SjO<sub>2</sub> during the rewarming period.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0267659111419888">4</xref></sup> Since milrinone is a phosphodiesterase III inhibitor and has a direct vasodilating effect,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0267659111419888">5</xref></sup> milrinone may be effective in preventing inadequate cerebrovascular dilatation as neural activity increases during the rewarming period.</p>
<p>Because of a potent vasodilatation, milrinone may induce systemic hypotension. Unexpectedly, however, the mean arterial pressure during the rewarming period in the milrinone group was not different from that in the control group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0267659111419888">Figure 2</xref>). This may be due to our dosing regimen of milrinone. Generally, the loading dose of milrinone is used to reach the therapeutic concentration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0267659111419888">5</xref></sup> However, in this study, we omitted the loading dose to prevent potent hypotension and to avoid frequent administration of noradrenalin during CPB in the milrinone group, because blood pressure elevation by noradrenalin may affect the value of SjO<sub>2</sub> during rewarming.</p>
<p>The systemic hypotensive effect of milrinone may not be so potent at the dose we used. This finding may produce additional attention to the mechanism of the beneficial effect of milrinone. Since we could not obtain potent vasodilatation in the milrinone group, we may consider another possible mechanism involved in the beneficial effect of milrinone; that is, reducing brain metabolism and tissue oxygen consumption. So far, there has not been any report demonstrating that phosphodiesterase III inhibitors reduce brain metabolism during the rewarming period. However, a recent neurobiological study suggest that another phosphodiesterase III(olprinone) attenuates a Ca<sup>2+</sup> rise through voltage-sensitive Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels and inhibits presynaptic glutamate release.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0267659111419888">9</xref></sup> We speculate that this effect might contribute to suppressing brain metabolism and improving a mismatch between global cerebral oxygen demand and supply during the rewarming period.</p>
<p>Previously, Nakajima, et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0267659111419888">1</xref></sup> demonstrated that the decrease of SjO<sub>2</sub> was significantly related to an average increase in temperature per minute during the rewarming period of CPB and another clinical study documented that slow rewarming was reported to improve SjO<sub>2</sub> during the rewarming period.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0267659111419888">10</xref></sup> Thus, it was important to consider the change of temperature when we evaluated the reduction in SjO<sub>2</sub> during rewarming period. In the present study, in order to evaluate the effect of milrinone during the rewarming period, we calculated a quotient of ΔSjO<sub>2</sub>/Δt at two measurement points after the start of the rewarming, although the change in temperature during the rewarming period was designed to be comparable between groups. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0267659111419888">Figure 3</xref>, milrinone decreased the ΔSjO<sub>2</sub>/Δt at 10 minutes from start of rewarming, but not from 10 to 20 minutes after rewarming, suggesting that milrinone produced a better cerebral balance between oxygen supply and demand at the start of the rewarming period.</p>
<p>Some potential limitations which exist in this study should be discussed. First, we measured NPT, but it is not the core temperature of the brain. Thus, ΔSjO<sub>2</sub>/Δt may not be an accurate parameter in the brain. Secondly, the present study showed the beneficial effect of milrinone on SjO<sub>2</sub> during the rewarming period and SjO<sub>2</sub> during the rewarming period was reported to be associated with postoperative cognitive dysfunction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0267659111419888">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0267659111419888">11</xref></sup> However, it is unclear if milrinone is clinically useful in preventing postoperative cognitive dysfunction. Further clinical trials have to be designed to answer this question. Thirdly, it may be doubtful whether the dose of milrinone we used in this study is optimal in clinical situations because our dosing regimen may not reach the therapeutic concentration of milrinone. However, we did not have any problem in our anesthetic management of the patients enrolled in this study after weaning from CPB, including the postoperative period as well as during CPB. Thus, we consider that the dose of milrinone in this study may be acceptable in clinical anesthetic management.</p>
<p>In summary, our data suggest that milrinone suppresses the reduction of SjO<sub>2</sub> and improves the balance between cerebral oxygen supply and demand during the rewarming period of CPB. The implication on whether milrinone improves the postoperative cognitive function requires further investigation.</p>
