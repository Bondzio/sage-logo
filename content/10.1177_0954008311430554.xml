<abstract>
<p>In this work, a copolymerization of 4-(1′,1′-dimethyl-1′-vinyl) silylbenzocyclobutene (4-DMVSBCB) and CH<sub>2</sub>=CHSiMe<sub>2</sub>Ph (DMVSPh), which have similar structure, was performed by the anionic polymerization method, leading to a synthesis of a series of cross-linkable random copolymers. Attractively, the 4-DMVSBCB/DMVSPh ratio in the copolymer was almost consistent with the DMVSPh/4-DMVSBCB feed ratio, which allows the control of polymer structure. Most importantly, the replacement of partial 4-DMVSBCB by DMVSPh units provided relatively economical materials which were capable of preserving almost all the advantages of poly(4-DMVSBCB). Furthermore, the curing dynamic of copolymers can be tuned by varying 4-DMVSBCB incorporation ratio.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Benzocyclobutene (BCB) moiety constitutes the basis of a broad new family of polymer-forming technologies that have been widely used to prepare various resins. BCB resins generally have good thermal stability, chemical resistance, and low dielectric constants and dissipation factors,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954008311430554">1</xref>
</sup> and are commonly used as insulating materials. Another characteristic of BCB resins is that the cross-linking process from ring-opening reaction of BCB moieties does not need a cross-linker to give out any small molecules, which makes BCB a very good candidate for developing high performance materials. A typical BCB resin is the commercialized CYCLOTENE (trademark of the DOW Chemical Company), which is derived from bis(benzocyclobutenyl) divinyltetramethylsiloxane (DVSBCB) monomer.</p>
<p>In the authors’ recent work,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954008311430554">2</xref>
</sup> a new silicon-containing benzocyclobutene (BCB) monomer, 4-(1′,1′-dimethyl-1′-vinyl) silylbenzocyclobutene (4-DMVSBCB) and some derived homopolymers were synthesized. The poly (DMVSBCB) was proved to have good film-forming properties, a smooth and flat film surface and low dielectric constants of 2.41–2.45 and good thermal stability. These new materials have already displayed some superiority over poly (DVSBCB).</p>
<p>However, the poly (DMVSBCB) needs further modification to improve its performance. Particularly, the high cost of benzocyclobutene dramatically limits its application. It has been well recognized that copolymerization is one of most important methods to modify the properties of the present polymers<sup>

</sup> and also a method to produce materials economically.<sup>

</sup> A lot of studies related to BCB copolymerization, which is generally used to modify the surface with a wide variety of metal, metal oxide, semiconductors, and polymeric surfaces, have been reported. Hawker et al. have prepared benzocyclobutene-functionalized random copolymers of styrene and methyl methacrylate. The crosslinked copolymer can be used as a coating with high stability, well-defined surface energy and controlled interfacial interactions.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0954008311430554">11</xref>
</sup> In their later work, they have introduced benzocyclobutene crosslinking groups in the poly(methyl methacrylate)-<italic>b</italic>-polystyrene block copolymers.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0954008311430554">12</xref>

</sup> The thermal crosslinking of the polystyrene domains by the ring-opening reaction of the BCB groups resulted in a dramatic improvement in the dimensional stability of the nanoscopic patterns.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0954008311430554">14</xref>
</sup> Zuo et al. have reported the synthesis of novel silphenylene-siloxane copolymers bearing latent reactive BCB groups and their high thermal stability and good dielectric properties were demonstrated.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0954008311430554">15</xref>
</sup> Furthermore, So et al. have synthesized styrene and 4-vinylbenzocyclobutene random copolymers by free radical polymerization and studied the suitability of the copolymers as a dielectric material for microelectronic applications.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0954008311430554">16</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Herein, continuing the authors’ present work on poly (4-DMVSBCB), they have chosen DMVSPh as a new comonomer, which has almost the same structure with 4-DMVSBCB except that the benzocyclobutene was replaced by benzene, to copolymerize with 4-DMVSBCB, giving rise to a series of copolymers with different 4-DMVSBCB contents. Subsequently, the structure and properties of the copolymers were characterized, and the effect that the percentage of 4-DMVSBCB that was incorporated on polymer properties was investigated in detail. Furthermore, the properties and performance of homo-poly (4-DMVSBCB) (HP) and poly (4-DMVSBCB-co-DMVSPh) were compared. The major goal of the present study was to clarify whether the copolymers, which were prepared from DMVSPh and 4-DMVSBCB with similar structure, were capable of preserving the advantages of homo-poly (4-DMVSBCB), such as good thermal stability and flatness of the film surface.</p>

<title>Anionic copolymerization of 4-DMVSBCB (M1) with DMVSPh (M2)</title>
<p>In a typical reaction, 4-DMVSBCB (0.88 g, 4.68 mmol) and DMVSPh (0.62 g, 3.83 mmol) in toluene (1.5 mL) was added to a dry double-necked flask equipped with a magnetic bar.

<p>In a dry and clean reactor, the linear polymer (100 mg) was dissolved in 1 mL of mesitylene, and was refluxed for 10 h under the nitrogen atmosphere at 160–170°C. A transparent polymer solution with relatively high viscosity was obtained.</p>

<title>Formation of polymer films and curing reaction</title>
<p>The film of pre-crosslinked polymer was formed by the spin-coating method (KW-4A Spin Processor, 2000 rpm), using silicon wafer as the substrate and mesitylene as solvent. The residue solvent was allowed to evaporate under vacuum at 140°C. The film was cured at 200°C for 8 h under the nitrogen atmosphere to give rise to highly cross-linked materials.</p>

<title>Testing methods</title>
<p>Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) measurements at 400–4000 cm<sup>−1</sup> were conducted on a Nicolet FTIR 5700 spectrophotometer at room temperature and the sample films were prepared by casting solution on KBr plates. <sup>1</sup>H-NMR spectra were obtained with a Bruker Avance-400 using deuterated chloroform as the solvent and tetramethylsilane as the internal reference. <sup>13</sup>C-NMR spectra were obtained with a Bruker Avance-400 using deuterated chloroform as the solvent and tetramethylsilane as the internal reference. The molecular weight and polydispersity index were measured by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) equipped with a refractive index detector (Optilab rEX) and a Dawn Heleos light-scattering detector. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was performed on powdered samples using a TA Q200 differential scanning calorimeter at a heating rate of 10°C min<sup>−1</sup> under a nitrogen atmosphere. A SDT-2960 TG-DSC thermogravimetric (TG) analyzer was used to investigate the thermal stability of the products. Thermal analysis was conducted in nitrogen from 20°C to the desired temperature. The surface morphology of the samples was observed by atomic force microscopy (AFM). The AFM images were obtained by means of a Digital Instruments Dimension 3100 microscope working in tapping mode. The samples were prepared by spin-coating from mesitylene solution. The surface hardness of crosslinked copolymer films was determined by the pencil test according to the standard method ASTM D3363. Pencils with hardness from 2H to 6H were used to scratch the surfaces of flexible PC substrates at an angle of 45°. No scratching was recorded on the surfaces of flexible PC substrates.</p>

<title>Copolymer synthesis</title>
<p>The copolymerization of DMVSPh and 4-DMVSBCB was carried out by anionic method using <italic>n</italic>-BuLi as initiators (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0954008311430554">Scheme 1</xref>). Structural studies have shown that dΠ–pΠ interactions in the vinyl–silicon bond give a resonance contribution to the bond, probably leading to the polarization of the vinyl group necessary for anionic polymerization. Additionally, the addition reaction between vinylsilane and organolithiums is favored by the low activation energy and high reactivity toward carbolithiation.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0954008311430554">17</xref>
</sup> Furthermore, early literatures support that the addition of alkyllithium to the two monomers should mainly give rise to a secondary lithium compound.<sup>

</sup>H-NMR spectra of copolymers of several DMVSPh/4-DMVSBCB ratios are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954008311430554">Figure 2</xref>. The signals at 1.12 to 0.88 ppm in the <sup>1</sup>H-NMR spectrum were assigned to CH and CH<sub>2</sub>, respectively, in the polyethylene main chain indicating that the vinyl polymerization products [–CH<sub>2</sub>CHSiMe<sub>2</sub>BCB–] were obtained. The <sup>1</sup>H-NMR spectrum does not reveal any resonances, characteristic for partly rearranged poly (vinylsilane)s. The increase in the signal intensity at 7.00 and 3.17 ppm, which correspond to benzenyl and cyclobutene moieties in BCB, indicates an increase of 4-DMVSBCB incorporation ratio. The <sup>13</sup>C-NMR spectrum of copolymer shows the characteristic peak of BCB moieties at 30 ppm. Moreover, the existence of two wide resonances at 22 to 26 ppm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954008311430554">Figure 3</xref>) reveals that the main chain of the copolymer is mainly a head-to-tail arrangement but does not possess stereoregularity. The single peak, as shown in the GPC spectrum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954008311430554">Figure 4</xref>), suggests a pure copolymerization without homo-polymerization.</p>

<p>As revealed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0954008311430554">Table 1</xref>, the copolymerization can not induce any considerable reduction of molecular weight and yield. The high yield, &gt; 90%, was attained for the copolymerization of 4-DMVSBCB, possibly owing to the same phenyl substituting silane structure of 4-DMVSBCB and DMVSPh. Phenyl groups play an important role in providing the silicon atom with an enhanced positive charge and α-stabilizing effect, leading to relatively high reactivity compared to alkyl substituting vinylsilane. Furthermore, it was found that the 4-DMVSBCB/DMVSPh ratios in all of the copolymers were almost consistent with the feed ratios (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0954008311430554">Table 1</xref>), and thus the content of 4-DMVSBCB and the amount of BCB units in resultan copolymer can be well controlled. It appears that this controllable anionic copolymerization was due to the similar reactivity of 4-DMVSBCB/4-DMVSPh, correlated to the similar structure. In regard to this, the random copolymerization seems more reasonable.</p>

<title>Curing process</title>
<p>A problem encountered in the coating process for the polymer with low molecular weight is its low viscosity, which presented difficulties in obtaining quality coatings, particularly at high temperatures. One solution to this might be to use polymer with a higher molecular weight. By incorporation BCB moieties, the molecular weight of the linear copolymer can be further increased by pre-crosslinking and the reaction rate can be slowed down, thus the molecular weight and viscosity of the polymer could be controlled.</p>
<p>The comparison between FT-IR spectra of linear copolymer and cured copolymer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954008311430554">Figure 5</xref>) shows an almost complete disappearance of the adsorption band at 1454 cm<sup>−1</sup>, indicating an almost complete reaction of BCB. The ring-opening reaction procedure of poly (4-DMVSBCB) was suggested as forming dibenzocyclooctadiene structures during curing. In the case of copolymers, the mechanism should be similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0954008311430554">Scheme 2</xref>), no matter how much 4-DMVSBCB units the copolymers have.</p>

<p>However, the curing dynamic was significantly affected by the DMVSBCB incorporation ratio, which was investigated by DSC analysis. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0954008311430554">Figure 6</xref> showed the heat flow as a function of temperature. First of all, the initial ring-opening temperatures of BCB are found to be 188, 198 and 204°C for CP-55, CP-45 and CP-35, respectively. The ring-opening of benzocyclobutene took place at a lower temperature when a greater percentage of 4-DMVSBCB was incorporated, as a consequence of the enhanced collision and reaction probability. This means that relatively high temperature was required for the curing of copolymer with low 4-DMVSBCB content. Additionally, one can see that the ring opening reaction of all of the copolymers displayed two stages from the DSC curves. This phenomenon can also be found in the homopolymer of 4-DMVSBCB. The transition may be at the gel point of the copolymers. At this point, the increase in crosslinking density of polymer may lead to the generation of an initial polymeric network and a transformation from sol to gel. As a result, polymer can not be melted even under high temperature and the steric hindrance significantly increased. It seems that CP-35, CP-45 and CP-55 showed different transition points, and in addition, CP-55 with the highest 4-DMVSBCB content presented the lowest transition temperature, as a result of the highest reaction rate. Furthermore, with the increasing DMVSBCB incorporation ratio, the cross-linking degree was improved. This conclusion can be supported by the apparently stronger exothermic phenomenon for CP-55 in contrast to CP-35 and CP-45 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0954008311430554">Figure 6</xref>).</p>

<p>DSC analysis indicated that the copolymers of three incorporation percentages of 4-DMVSBCB display the similar <italic>T</italic>

<title>Surface hardness</title>
<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0954008311430554">Table 2</xref>, the surface hardness of the cross-linked films was decreased and this was accompanied with the decrease of 4-DMVSBCB contents. Clearly, it was due to reduction of the degree of crosslinking. The results further showed that the incorporation ratio of 4-DMVSBCB in copolymers, which was at least 35 mol.%, was capable of enabling hardness of cured films higher than 6H.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0954008311430554">
<title>Flatness of films</title>
<p>The flatness of the film was characterized by AFM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0954008311430554">Figure 8</xref>). The films obtained from pre-crosslinked and crosslinked CP-<bold>55</bold> are very flat and smooth, and the maximum height difference of crosslinked CP-55 is 4 nm. This value may be slightly higher than that of hompolymer films (only 1–1.5 nm).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954008311430554">2</xref>
</sup> The decrease in the degree of crosslinking may be responsible for the increase, as it could lead to an increase in the polymer chain motion and then the fluctuation of surface polymer layer. In the cross-section spectrum of cured film (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0954008311430554">Figure 8</xref>(c)), one can see that peaks and troughs randomly dispersed in the film, reflecting a slight fluctuation of surface polymer layer. Fortunately, this slight increase in roughness does not affect the useful properties of the films.</p>

</fig>
<p>The curing of film that yielded highly cross-linked polymer resulted in a slight increase in roughness, indicating the enhanced fluctuation of the surface polymer layer. This shows that the curing accompanied with increased thermal energy certainly causes the stronger chain motion and oxidation reaction within the surface polymer. The fluctuation eventually led to the formation of thickening domains which could be clearly identified within the mother phase in AFM height images.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The anionic copolymerization of 4-DMVSBCB with DMVSPh was conducted to give rise to a series of new polymers with controllable monomers ratio. In contrast to the homopolymer of 4-DMVSBCB, such copolymers displayed lower curing rate, which was caused by the lower contents of crosslinkable 4-DMVSBCB units, and had lower cost. As expected, the copolymers possess good thermal stability and a smooth and flat film surface. They show potential for extractive applications in the microelectronic insulation.</p>
