<abstract>
<p>The effects of a literacy intervention matching student skill level with academic performance demands were examined through a multiple baseline across participants design. The dual dependent variables were problem behavior and academic engagement. Four students in Grades 2 or 3 who exhibited low academic performance and problem behavior during reading instruction participated. Functional behavioral assessment and oral reading fluency assessment indicated that each of the students (a) was at risk for reading difficulties and read at the frustration level in text used for reading instruction and (b) had escape-maintained problem behavior during instruction sessions. A nonconcurrent multiple baseline design across students was used to assess the effects of matching reading instructional level (e.g., reducing the aversive level of instruction) on academic engagement and problem behavior. Matching the reading instructional level to the skill level of the students was associated with academic engagement increases and problem behavior decreases for three of the students. The fourth student demonstrated improvement during baseline that made effects of the intervention difficult to assess. Conceptual implications and suggestions for integrating behavioral and academic supports are explored.</p>

<p>A growing body of research suggests that students who experience achievement difficulties are more likely to also experience behavior difficulties and vice versa (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1098300712449868">Algozzine, Putnam, &amp; Horner, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1098300712449868">Hinshaw, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1098300712449868">Lane et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1098300712449868">McIntosh, Horner, Chard, Boland, &amp; Good, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1098300712449868">McIntosh, Horner, Chard, Dickey, &amp; Braun, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1098300712449868">Trzesniewski, Moffitt, Caspi, Taylor, &amp; Maughan, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1098300712449868">Vanderstaay, 2006</xref>). With well-established evidence that achievement and behavior problems are pervasive with far-reaching social and academic consequences (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1098300712449868">Krezmien &amp; Mulcahy, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1098300712449868">National Assessment of Educational Progress, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1098300712449868">Walker, Ramsey, &amp; Gresham, 2004</xref>), it behooves educators to better understand the ways academic and behavior problems are linked and how effective intervention may prevent future difficulties.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1098300712449868">McIntosh, Horner, and colleagues (2008)</xref> proposed a conceptual logic for the link between reading difficulties and the development of problem behavior modeled after <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1098300712449868">Patterson’s (1982)</xref> investigation of unproductive parent–child interactions. In a “coercive cycle of behavioral and educational failure,” they proposed that engaging in problem behavior serves a negative reinforcing function. From this perspective, avoiding aversive academic tasks with inappropriate behavior increases the likelihood that students will engage in problem behavior in the future and reduces their access to instruction, thereby creating and sustaining a failing pattern of interactions that is predictive and difficult to overcome. As the cycle repeats, students fall further behind due to lack of instruction, and their likelihood of problem behavior increases. This hypothesized relationship was supported by their findings that poor performance on oral reading fluency (ORF) measures was related to escape-maintained problem behavior for fourth- through sixth-grade students with challenging behavior.</p>
<p>To reduce the occurrence of problem behavior and address achievement in a more efficient and proactive manner, schools have implemented school-wide positive behavioral interventions and supports (SWPBIS) and functional behavioral assessment (FBA). SWPBIS systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1098300712449868">Horner &amp; Sugai, 2000</xref>) promote prevention and early effective intervention for academic and social problems. They are often conceptualized as providing three tiers of support according to student need. Primary prevention is designed to prevent the development of academic and social problems through proactively teaching, practicing, and reinforcing behavior expectations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1098300712449868">Horner &amp; Sugai, 2000</xref>). School-wide data identify students who need additional support, and secondary intervention is implemented before problem behaviors become severe with the goal of reducing problem behavior through efficient and effective interventions. Tertiary intervention provides the most substantial support, which may come in the form of interventions designed based on FBAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1098300712449868">Horner &amp; Sugai, 2000</xref>). SWPBIS shares much with Response-to-Intervention systems focused on improving academic performance and may be particularly important in preventing the development of academic and behavior problems because the coercive cycle of failure is interrupted by effective instruction and behavior supports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1098300712449868">Algozzine, Daunic, &amp; Smith, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1098300712449868">Simmons et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1098300712449868">Sugai &amp; Horner, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>FBA is a process for creating a function-based behavior support plan comprising practices that match hypothesized variables controlling the problem behavior, and the contextual capacity of implementers in the setting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1098300712449868">Crone &amp; Horner, 2003</xref>). A growing body of research indicates (a) the increased effectiveness of matching function-based interventions in comparison with non-function-based interventions (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1098300712449868">Burke, Hagen-Burke, &amp; Sugai, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1098300712449868">Ingram, Lewis-Palmer, &amp; Sugai, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1098300712449868">Newcomer &amp; Lewis, 2005</xref>) and (b) the positive impact of academically focused interventions for students with problem behavior (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1098300712449868">Lane et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1098300712449868">McKenna, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1098300712449868">Preciado, Horner, &amp; Baker, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1098300712449868">Preciado et al. (2009)</xref> studied the impact of a reading intervention for bilingual students engaging in escape-maintained problem behaviors during reading instruction. The authors employed bilingual introduction of reading material coupled with vocabulary supports to match instructional difficulty to learner skill level within a multiple baseline design across students. Results indicated that the modified instruction was associated with reduced problem behaviors and increased academic engagement. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1098300712449868">Lee, Sugai, and Horner (1999)</xref> similarly demonstrated that modifying instructional procedures to reduce task difficulty during math instruction was associated with reduced problem behavior and increased percentage of correct answers for students exhibiting escape-maintained problem behavior during math tasks.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1098300712449868">Filter and Horner (2009)</xref> documented the value of modifying instructional variables for students with escape-maintained problem behavior during academic tasks. Their results demonstrated the value of assessing the behavioral function of problem behavior performed during instruction. Problem behaviors maintained by attention (teacher or peer) may be addressed with traditional classroom support practices. Problem behaviors maintained by escape from aversive features of instruction, however, required modification of instructional variables as part of the behavior support plan. Together these studies suggest a relationship between task difficulty and (a) academic performance (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1098300712449868">Lee et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1098300712449868">Preciado et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1098300712449868">Tremptow, Burns, &amp; McComas, 2007</xref>) and (b) problem behaviors (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1098300712449868">Filter &amp; Horner, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1098300712449868">Lee et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1098300712449868">McKenna, 2006</xref>) indicating the importance of considering task difficulty in behavioral interventions.</p>
<p>In summary, existing literature documents that (a) problem behaviors and academic difficulties may be related, (b) function-based interventions are more effective than non-function-based interventions, (c) task difficulty can be functionally related to problem behavior, and (d) changing task difficulty can have positive effects on behavior and academic outcomes. The purpose of this study is to replicate findings that instructional interventions can have a positive impact on problem behavior and academic engagement, and to further clarify which variables may be modified to support students with escape-maintained problem behavior during reading. Specifically, the authors investigated the relationship between placement in reading curriculum, and students’ academic engagement and problem behavior.</p>
<p>In this study, we implemented literacy instruction that matched task demands with student skill level in an attempt to reduce an aversive stimulus hypothesized to produce problem behavior. We addressed the following question: For students who display escape-maintained problem behavior during reading instruction, is there a functional relationship between instruction matched to students’ skill level, and (a) reduction in problem behavior and (b) increased academic engagement? In addition, descriptive assessment of student reading performance was monitored to assess if improved academic engagement was associated with academic gains.</p>

<title>Participants and Setting</title>
<p>Participants in this study were four Caucasian second- and third-grade students attending three elementary schools (kindergarten–fifth grade) in a moderate-sized urban school district in the Pacific Northwest (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1098300712449868">Table 1</xref>). Schools’ enrollment ranged from 413 to 436 students, and 52% of students received free or reduced lunch services. The four participants in the study received small group reading instruction (1–6 students) for 20 to 60 min/day. Schools employed a district-wide primary prevention model of SWPBIS, whereby three core behavioral expectations were taught (be safe, be respectful, and be responsible) and posted throughout the school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1098300712449868">Sugai, Horner, &amp; Gresham, 2002</xref>). Furthermore, all schools used the Dynamic Indicators of Basic Early Literacy Skills (DIBELS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1098300712449868">Good &amp; Kaminski, 2002</xref>) to conduct screening assessments three times per year to identify students in need of additional instructional support in reading.</p>

<title>Procedure</title>
<p>Teachers and principals within the three schools nominated four students who exhibited reading deficits and problem behavior during reading instruction. The four students were provided reading instruction by three educational assistants (one educational assistant worked with two students in the same reading group, Jeff and Hayla). Following principal and teacher nomination of the students, parental-informed consent and then student assent were obtained for student participants and their instructors.</p>
<sec id="section4-1098300712449868">
<title>Participant selection criteria</title>
<p>After consent and assent were obtained, nominations were confirmed by direct observation of students’ problem behavior during reading instruction in addition to the assessment of the students’ reading performance. If students (a) engaged in problem behavior during reading instruction (i.e., a minimum of 15% of 10-s intervals) that their teachers reported as problematic, (b) displayed reading skills that placed them in the <italic>at-risk</italic> category according to DIBELS Benchmarks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1098300712449868">Good, Simmons, Kame’enui, Kaminski, &amp; Wallin, 2002</xref>), and (c) were reading at the frustration level during reading instruction or below 90% accuracy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1098300712449868">Shapiro, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1098300712449868">Tremptow et al., 2007</xref>), researchers completed a FBA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1098300712449868">Crone &amp; Horner, 2003</xref>). The FBA for each student indicated that his or her problem behavior during instruction was escape maintained.</p>

<sec id="section5-1098300712449868">
<title>DIBELS</title>
<p>DIBELS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1098300712449868">Good &amp; Kaminski, 2002</xref>) are brief, repeatable 1-min measures of students’ early and preliteracy skills. Student records were obtained to identify performance on previous winter district-wide reading benchmark assessments using DIBELS ORF, which was collected by a trained team of retired teachers and confirmed by graduate research assistants. DIBELS ORF passages measure accuracy and fluency in text and are scored as the number of correct words read in 1 min. ORF has a test–retest reliability of .92 to .97. DIBELS nonsense word fluency (NWF) is a 1-min measure of students’ alphabetic understanding. The score is the number of sounds students read correctly in 1 min, and test–retest reliability for NWF is .83. Data for winter DIBELS benchmarks were unavailable for Jeff, so his performance on NWF was assessed by a graduate research assistant because his reading skills were not sufficiently developed to be measured accurately by a DIBELS ORF probe.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1098300712449868">
<title>Performance in curriculum</title>
<p>Adapted procedures for assessing instructional placement from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1098300712449868">Shapiro (2004)</xref> were used to test students’ placement in their curriculum. Three passages from the students’ current and next lessons in their curriculum were selected to test at what level of accuracy and fluency students read in their curriculum. For example, if the student had just completed Lesson 27 in his or her material, Lessons 27, 28, and 29 were used. Passages were typed into 150 to 200 word probes, and examiners used the ORF procedures to determine rate and percentage accuracy of the students’ reading. The median of the three scores was used to establish students’ placement in their curriculum. See <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1098300712449868">Table 2</xref> for student accuracy rates during Phase A, prior to intervention. All four students read at the frustration level, or less than 90% of words accurately (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1098300712449868">Tremptow et al., 2007</xref>).</p>

<p>The Functional Assessment Checklist for Teachers and Staff (FACTS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1098300712449868">March et al., 2000</xref>) was used as a structured interview to complete steps (a), (b), and (d) above and generate a testable hypothesis statement about the antecedents and consequences that occasion and maintain the problem behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1098300712449868">McIntosh, Borgmier, Anderson, Horner, Rodriguez, &amp; Tobin, 2008</xref>). One of the two methods was used to confirm the hypothesis statements generated: observations using the Functional Assessment Observation Form (FAOF; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1098300712449868">O’Neill et al., 1997</xref>) or functional analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1098300712449868">Iwata, Dorsey, Slifer, Bauman, &amp; Richman, 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>The FAOF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1098300712449868">O’Neill et al., 1997</xref>) was used as an observation tool to confirm the hypothesis statements generated by the FACTS for Jeff and Hayla due to lack of time in the school year to complete a functional analysis. The FAOF provides a structure for recording problem behavior and the antecedents that immediately preceded the problem behavior and the consequences and perceived consequences that followed the behavior.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1098300712449868">
<title>Functional analysis</title>
<p>Functional analysis is a procedure by which the antecedents and consequences are experimentally manipulated to test a hypothesis statement from the FACTS interview. By altering the antecedents and consequences, the function of the behavior is empirically confirmed. The procedures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1098300712449868">Iwata et al. (1994)</xref> established for conducting a functional analysis were used to test the hypothesis statements for Elliott and Jon. Three conditions were presented to students: escape, attention, and control (described below).</p>
<p>Graduate students and the primary investigator observed functional analysis trials. Functional analyses were completed in sessions of 12 to 15 one-min trials, with 4 to 5 trials in each condition. Problem behavior was recorded on a 1-min partial interval scale. Trial order was randomly assigned to avoid ordering effects. Students participated in a minimum of 2 sessions, for a total of 8 to 15 trials in each condition. In the escape condition, students were asked to read text taken from the next day’s reading lesson. If students engaged in problem behavior, the task was removed and the trial was terminated. If students completed the task without exhibiting problem behavior, they were provided praise. In the attention condition, students were asked to read below grade-level reading material. If the student engaged in problem behavior, he or she was told to keep working. This prompt was repeated as many times as the student engaged in problem behavior in the 1-min trial. The student was provided praise at the end of 1 min. In the control condition, the experimenter read to the student and ignored any problem behavior and kept reading. Sufficient trials were completed to document a functional relationship among antecedents, consequences, and problem behavior.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1098300712449868">
<title>Treatment</title>
<p>Treatment consisted of placement in the curriculum at the instruction-level (i.e., appropriate levels of accuracy and fluency as defined below) placement using a research-validated instructional program, Reading Mastery. Because the function of the problem behavior was escape from a difficult reading task, adjusting the instructional difficulty was an antecedent intervention aimed to address the function of the behavior. Although instructors, instructional procedures, and behavior consequences did not vary across phases, placement in the curriculum varied to ensure students were reading at appropriate instructional rather than inappropriate frustration levels during reading instruction. Reading Mastery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1098300712449868">Science Research Associates, 2002</xref>) was used because of its use of effective design and delivery elements, and documented effectiveness with at-risk populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1098300712449868">C. L. Watkins &amp; Slocum, 2004</xref>). All interventionists were trained in implementation of the Reading Mastery program for a minimum of 1 hr/day for 2 weeks. Jon and Elliott’s instructors received coaching from the primary investigator on implementation of the program. The primary investigator, a trained coach and trainer in Reading Mastery, taught Jeff and Hayla’s group during frustration- and instructional-level phases.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1098300712449868">
<title>Instrumentation</title>
<p>Graduate students in special education and school psychology completed direct observation of student behavior 3 to 5 times/week during the students’ regularly scheduled reading instruction on two behavior variables: academic engagement and problem behavior. All behaviors were recorded using a 15-to-20-min observation with a 10-s interval scale. There was an 8-s watch period and a 2-s record period within each 10-s interval.</p>
<sec id="section11-1098300712449868">
<title>Academic engagement</title>
<p>Academic engagement was recorded using a whole-interval scale and defined as orienting toward board/overhead/teacher/speaker who is discussing relevant topic; engaged physically or verbally with materials/objects/tasks; writing or reading assigned task; contributing to assigned cooperative activities; and engaged in appropriate activities approved by the teacher. The student could look away from work for 2 s within the interval and still be counted as “academically engaged” for that interval.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1098300712449868">
<title>Problem behavior</title>
<p>Problem behavior was defined as engaging in problem behaviors while not academically engaged. For example, if a student was pulling at his hair but reading a book at the same time, it would be rated as <italic>no problem behavior</italic>, whereas if a student was pulling at his hair and staring at his hair (i.e., not reading his book or doing work), it would be rated as <italic>problem behavior</italic>. It was measured using a partial interval scale and defined individually for each student through the FACTS. Jeff’s problem behaviors included (a) talking out, (b) out of seat, and (c) playing with objects not related to the task. For Hayla, problem behaviors included (a) talking out (b) out of seat, (c) noncompliance or defiance, and (d) playing with objects not related to the task. For Elliott, problem behaviors included (a) talking out, (b) out of seat, (c) noncompliance or defiance, and (d) playing with objects not related to the task, including hair and clothes. For Jon, problem behaviors included (a) talking out, (b) noncompliance or defiance, (c) playing with objects not related to the task, and (e) hair pulling (self).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1098300712449868">
<title>Interobserver agreement (IOA)</title>
<p>A second observer scored student behavior in 30% of the observation sessions to document IOA. IOA was calculated using Cohen’s Kappa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1098300712449868">M. W. Watkins &amp; Pacheco, 2000</xref>). Cohen’s Kappa is calculated using the following formula: (<italic>P</italic><sub><italic>o</italic></sub> + <italic>P</italic><sub><italic>c</italic></sub>) / (1 – <italic>P</italic><sub><italic>c</italic></sub>), where <italic>P</italic><sub><italic>o</italic></sub> is the proportion of observed agreement and <italic>P</italic><sub><italic>c</italic></sub> is the proportion of chance agreement. Agreement greater than .75 is considered excellent agreement, .6 to .75 is considered good agreement, .4 to .6 is considered fair agreement, and below.4 is considered poor agreement. Observers were trained using video of classroom settings until they obtained κ &gt; .75 on three consecutive observation sessions. In the classroom, observers were trained until they reached Kappa of at least .60 on three consecutive sessions. Observers were retrained when Kappa fell below .4 on any session. Mean Kappa across participants was .70 for academic engagement with participant averages of .63 (Jeff), .62 (Hayla), .80 (Elliott), and .67 (Jon). Mean Kappa for problem behavior was .64 with participant averages of .61 (Jeff), .64 (Hayla), .79 (Elliott), and .46 (Jon).</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1098300712449868">
<title>Implementation Fidelity</title>
<p>Fidelity of implementation was addressed by (a) documenting that correct lessons were delivered, (b) informally observing delivery of the curriculum, and (c) examining student accuracy rates before and after the intervention was implemented. Lesson completion was monitored at least twice weekly by the primary investigator of the study and confirmed by research assistants who observed student behavior during instruction. Agreement between observer report and documentation was 100%.</p>
<p>Students’ performance in their text was monitored to document they were placed in the correct level of text during each phase of intervention. To place students at the instruction level, the authors adapted a test-back procedure described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1098300712449868">Shapiro (2004)</xref>. Three 1-min reading probes were created using three consecutive passages from approximately 1 year behind the students’ current placement. If students were at the instructional level in that placement, three passages were selected from a half year forward. If students were not at instructional placement, students were tested a half year back. Passages were administered until the tester identified, within 20 lessons, the highest instruction-level placement.</p>
<p>To confirm that students’ placement in the curriculum was at the appropriate instruction level during the treatment condition, students were provided probes of the lesson just delivered and the next day’s lesson. If students were taught to mastery in the program, they were expected to read at the independent level or greater than 94% accuracy and fluency appropriate for their grade level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1098300712449868">Shapiro, 2004</xref>) on the lesson just taught. It would have been expected that the next day’s lesson would be at the instructional level, which would be between 90% and 94% accuracy and appropriate fluency for their grade level. Data were collected on student accuracy and fluency in their current and next lesson at three points in time for each student (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1098300712449868">Table 2</xref>). All students read between 80% and 89% accuracy during Phase A, which fell in the range of frustration-level placement (i.e., below 90% accuracy). The primary change in Phase B was altering students’ placement in their curriculum such that they read at or above the instruction level (in terms of fluency and accuracy) during the next day’s lesson and attained mastery (i.e., independent level) in their current day’s lesson. Three of four students read between 91% and 94% accuracy on the next day’s lesson (instruction-level placement is 90%–94% accurate), and one student, Jon, read at 98% accuracy on his next day’s lesson, more than the instruction-level placement for accuracy. He was, however, at instructional-level placement for fluency per recommendations in the curriculum and DIBELS benchmarks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1098300712449868">Good &amp; Kaminski, 2002</xref>). In addition, students read between 97% and 100% accuracy in the lesson just taught, which qualified as independent placement (i.e., reading more than 94% accuracy), as expected.</p>

<sec id="section15-1098300712449868">
<title>Research Design and Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>This study employed a nonconcurrent multiple baseline across participants’ design with two phases: frustration-level placement and instructional-level placement. A nonconcurrent multiple baseline design was used to allow the process of assessment and intervention to follow the typical rhythm of behavior support protocols within the school. Specifically, participants were nominated at different points in time because problem behaviors and reading difficulties were identified by the teachers at different points in time. It was necessary to implement a nonconcurrent multiple baseline to ensure no student was held in baseline for too long a time period after a teacher requested support for the student. Jon participated in the study from February 10 to April 11 (intervention began March 13); Elliott from March 2 to May 17 (intervention began April 14); and Jeff and Hayla from April 10 to June 6 (intervention began May 9).</p>
<sec id="section16-1098300712449868">
<title>Frustration-level placement (Phase A)</title>
<p>Frustration-level placement was defined as reading below 90% accuracy or with fluency below grade-level benchmarks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1098300712449868">Good &amp; Kaminski, 2002</xref>). Some features of frustration-level placement were uniform for all participants (i.e., accuracy in reading material), whereas other features differed across participants (e.g., curriculum and training of instructor). The instructor did not vary across frustration-level and instruction-level placement for any students. Students’ current classroom curriculum was used during Phase A. Science Research Associates Reading Mastery was the existing curriculum for Elliott (Level III) and Hayla and Jeff (Level II); whereas a basal third-grade reader was being used for Jon (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1098300712449868">Table 2</xref>). Reading Mastery instructors had prior training in the curriculum, whereas Jon’s instructor received training prior to implementing it in Phase B.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-1098300712449868">
<title>Instruction-level placement (Phase B)</title>
<p>Instruction-level placement supplanted frustration-level placement during the intervention phase and was defined as the highest level in the curriculum within which students could read the material with greater than 90% accuracy and with appropriate fluency for the grade-level placement (i.e., up to 40–60 correct words per minute [CWPM] at the first grade, 44–90 CWPM at the second grade, and 70–110 CWPM at the third grade; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1098300712449868">Good et al., 2002</xref>). Students were placed at the highest level in the curriculum where they performed at sufficient rates of accuracy and fluency to be in the instruction-level placement (See <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1098300712449868">Table 2</xref> for precise placements for each student in their reading curriculum during the frustration- and instructional-level phases.). Jon was placed in Reading Mastery II Lesson 143 because he read at a rate of 79 CWPM with 98% accuracy at that placement. Although his accuracy rate was in the independent range, his fluency rate warranted placement at that level based on the above recommendations and curriculum placement recommendations.</p>
<p>Performance on functional behavior assessment interviews and observations were reported and compared with classroom observation data to validate hypothesized functions of problem behavior. Experimental phase data were analyzed using traditional single-case design procedures, including visual inspection of level, trend, variability, overlap, and immediacy of effect. Furthermore, mean and slope changes as well as Cohen’s percentage non-overlapping data (CPND; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1098300712449868">Parker &amp; Hagan-Burke, 2007</xref>) were used to examine intervention outcomes.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<sec id="section19-1098300712449868">
<title>Functional Behavioral Assessment</title>
<p>The FACTS interview was conducted with Jeff, Hayla, and Jon’s regular classroom teachers and the educational assistants who taught Jeff, Hayla, and Elliott’s reading groups. Each hypothesis statement indicated that the students engaged in problem behavior to avoid difficult reading tasks. Interviewees rated their confidence that the statements were accurate with scores ranging from 4 to 6 on a scale of 1 to 6 (1 = <italic>not very confident</italic> and 6 = <italic>very confident</italic>). To confirm whether the hypothesis statements generated by Jeff and Hayla’s teachers were accurate, Jeff and Hayla’s behaviors were observed during regular reading instruction using the FAOF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1098300712449868">O’Neill et al., 1997</xref>). The perceived function of problem behavior was to escape difficult reading tasks in a majority of problem behaviors observed for Jeff and Hayla. Further validation of the FACTS hypothesis statement was conducted as a part of the experimental phase of the study.</p>
<p>Functional analyses were used to document the hypothesized function of problem behavior for Jon and Elliott. Jon and Elliott’s functional analyses documented that Jon engaged in problem behavior in 8/8 trials during the escape condition in comparison with 2/8 trials during the attention condition and 0/8 trials during control. Elliott engaged in problem behavior in 6/15 trials during the escape condition in comparison with 0/15 trials during the attention condition and 2/15 trials in control. Results were consistent with the hypothesized function that Jon and Elliott’s problem behaviors were maintained by escape from difficult reading tasks.</p>

<title>Effects of Instruction-Level Reading Placement on Problem Behavior</title>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1098300712449868">Figure 1</xref> provides the results of the effects of the intervention on problem behavior and academic engagement. The average percentage of intervals with problem behavior in Phase A was 27%, with participant averages of 27% (Jeff), 26% (Hayla), 35% (Elliott), and 19% (Jon). In contrast, in Phase B, the average was 11%, with participant averages of 11% (Jeff), 8% (Hayla), 15% (Elliott), and 9% (Jon). This represents an average decrease in problem behavior by 10% to 20% points, reductions in level of problem behavior of more than one half for all participants.</p>

<p>Trends were neutral to increasing (−0.5 to 6.1) for Hayla, Elliott, and Jon in Phase A; whereas, Phase B trends showed reductions in slope, shifting slopes to decreasing or neutral for Hayla, Elliott, and Jon (−1.1 to 0.4). The CPND for Hayla (100%), Elliott (85%), and Jon (83%) showed strong effects, whereas for Jeff (42%) it was difficult to determine an effect due to the pattern of improvement during Phase A. It is interesting to note, however, that the intervention resulted in lower levels of problem behavior over the course of the intervention and appeared to decrease problem behavior for Hayla, Elliott, and Jon.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section21-1098300712449868">
<title>The Effects of Instruction-Level Reading Placement on Academic Engagement</title>
<p>Average percentage of intervals with academic engagement in Phase A was 69%, with participant averages of 70% (Jeff), 73% (Hayla), 58% (Elliott), and 76% (Jon), which was deemed problematic as reported by the reading instructors. In contrast, during Phase B, the average percentage of intervals with academic engagement was 84% with participant averages of 85% (Jeff), 88% (Hayla), 75% (Elliott), and 86% (Jon), representing a mean of 15% increase in the level of academic engagement following implementation of instruction-level reading placement. The CPND for Hayla (100%), Elliott (70%), and Jon (72%) demonstrated good effects, whereas Jeff demonstrated minimal effects (25%) for academic engagement. It is important to note that a single data point during baseline may have accounted for the much lower CPND for Jeff, which is a limitation of using CPND to determine effect.</p>
<p>Three participants, Halya, Elliott, and Jon, showed neutral to positive change in slope from Phase A to Phase B (range = 0.2–2.4 increase in slope across phases). This increase in level and slope of academic engagement for three students at three points in time indicates that the instruction-level reading placement likely had an effect on academic engagement, although the effects are not as pronounced as the effects on reduction in problem behavior. In contrast, Jeff displayed an increasing trend of academic engagement in Phase A, primarily due to a very low level of academic engagement in the first session; therefore, his slope decreased from Phase A to Phase B, failing to demonstrate an effect of the intervention. In addition, it is important to note that the intervention showed positive effects, as Jeff’s academic engagement was higher during Phase B than in Phase A. Hayla, Elliott, and Jon demonstrated increased academic engagement following implementation of the intervention.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section22-1098300712449868">
<title>Changes in Reading Performance</title>
<p>Participant reading performance was monitored in two ways. First, performance in the reading curriculum was monitored showing an increase in ORF performance within the curriculum (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1098300712449868">Table 2</xref>). Specifically, when transitioned from frustration-level placement to instruction-level placement, Jeff improved his reading rate from 25 to 34 CWPM (+11) on the next lesson and 88 CWPM (+61 CWPM) on the current lesson. Hayla improved +17 CWPM on the next lesson and +33 on the current lesson. Elliott improved +17 CWPM on the next lesson and +9 CWPM on the current lesson. Jon improved +29 CWPM on the next lesson and +51 CWPM on the next lesson. Performance on NWF and ORF was also monitored to determine whether there was a positive change in reading performance on general outcome measures. Although analysis of reading growth rates was not possible due to the relatively short time period (just 4–6 weeks in any single phase of the study), student performance indicated a range of growth on each of these measures across both phases of the study. Specifically, at pretest, Jeff had a NWF score of 25 sounds correct per minute (scpm) in contrast to a mean of 49 scpm during the intervention phase. Hayla had a NWF score of 42 scpm at pretest in contrast to 43 scpm during the intervention phase. Elliott had an ORF score of 53 CWPM at pretest in contrast to a mean of 54.5 during the intervention phase. Finally, Jon had a score of 48 CWPM at pretest in contrast to 63.3 during the intervention phase. It is notable that the students’ performance began in the at-risk range and stayed in the at-risk range even with this intervention. Some students (Jeff and Jon) showed fairly substantial growth, whereas Hayla and Elliott showed much lower growth rates.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This investigation documented that changing the difficulty of the reading task from frustration level to instruction level resulted in reduction in problem behavior for students who struggled with reading and engaged in escape-maintained problem behavior during reading instruction. The study built on the hypothesis that academic failure and problem behavior are linked through the negative reinforcement for some students and illustrated that task difficulty is a powerful predictor of academic and behavior outcomes for some students (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1098300712449868">Algozzine, Putnam, et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1098300712449868">McIntosh, Horner, et al., 2008</xref>). In addition, the study used a function-based antecedent intervention, consistent with other studies implementing academic interventions (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1098300712449868">Filter &amp; Horner, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1098300712449868">McKenna, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1098300712449868">Preciado et al., 2009</xref>) providing further documentation that proactive instructional interventions reduce problem behavior for some students. The use of an antecedent-only intervention is particularly noteworthy because it may be easier for schools to implement on a wider scale than a more comprehensive approach to behavior support planning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1098300712449868">Crone &amp; Horner, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1098300712449868">Horner &amp; Sugai, 2000</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section24-1098300712449868">
<title>Limitations and Future Directions for Research</title>
<p>As with all research, this study has some limitations that are important to consider in interpreting the findings. First, as the intervention was conducted with only four students, it is important to replicate the findings to generalize the results to other students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1098300712449868">Horner et al., 2005</xref>). In this study, the students’ escape-maintained problem behaviors were relatively of low intensity. It is possible that more severe problem behavior would not be so easily remediated with an antecedent-only intervention. Second, participants were selected using highly specified procedures (i.e., they all engaged in escape-maintained problem behavior during reading instruction and displayed significant reading problems). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1098300712449868">McIntosh et al.’s (2008)</xref> findings suggest that students with higher reading performance may have systematically different functions of problem behavior. A student with attention-maintained problem behavior who is reading at grade level is likely to require a different kind of behavioral support because of the different function of behavior. Third, the intervention procedures were highly specified. This intervention used Direct Instruction, which uses systematic program design and explicit instructional delivery (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1098300712449868">Watkins &amp; Slocum, 2004</xref>). Using a less systematic or explicit program may not achieve the same behavioral change. Fourth, there was no demonstration of the effect for one of the students in the study, Jeff. He had a decreasing trend of problem behavior and increasing trend of academic engagement in the first phase that did not support changing the intervention. Because of this, it is difficult to know whether mean reductions in problem behavior and increases in academic engagement were due to the intervention. Shorter time in the baseline condition may have contributed to the lack of demonstration of effect. Further investigation should be completed with a wider range of students before drawing more concrete conclusions.</p>
<p>An additional important consideration regarding the intervention is determining what level of instructional intensity and time in intervention would allow the students to catch up to their peers academically. The premise of this study was that placement in frustration-level text was an antecedent to problem behavior for these students who read significantly below grade level. Thus, placing students at their instruction level in the reading curriculum was an effective antecedent change to address the escape-maintained problem behavior. Although instruction was effective at reducing problem behavior during reading instruction, to eliminate the aversive antecedent across contexts, it would be important to catch students up to their grade-level peers in reading. In this study, reading instruction was adjusted to match students’ instructional level, but the intensity of instruction (specifically, amount of time allocated to instruction and the length of time in terms of number of weeks spent in intervention) was not sufficient for students to catch up to grade-level peers during the 12-week period of observation. Although all students improved their academic performance within the curriculum, only Jeff’s (NWF) and Jon’s (ORF) DIBELS scores increased substantially during the intervention phase. In future studies, it would be important to explore what intensity of instruction is needed to catch students up. Future research on intensifying the interventions by substantially increasing instructional time would be critical because these students received reading instruction for 20 to 60 min/day in contrast to the 90+ min recommended for daily reading instruction for students in kindergarten through third grade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1098300712449868">Simmons et al., 2002</xref>). Furthermore, future research should implement and assess treatment for longer periods to determine not only how much intensity in terms of daily instructional minutes but also for how many weeks it is necessary to participate in interventions to show improved academic performance. Even with these limitations, the study contributes to our understanding of the role that function-based academic supports serve to improve students’ problem behavior and academic engagement.</p>

<sec id="section25-1098300712449868">
<title>Implications for Practice</title>
<p>Findings from this study support the use of academic interventions for students with escape-maintained problem behavior that occurs during instruction. This study supports the use of the following practices for effective implementation of academically focused interventions to reduce challenging behavior: (a) systematic screening of students for academic difficulties to identify students early who are in need of additional academic support, (b) delivery of instruction at appropriate levels that align current levels of functioning with effective teaching, (c) use of FBAs to support more effective intervention planning for students who need substantial behavior support, and (d) consideration of academic variables in planning for behavior supports when indicated. Implementation of these practices may help to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of services and assist in preventing achievement and behavior problems.</p>
