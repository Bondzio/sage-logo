<abstract>
<p>This prospective, multinational study was conducted in 20 homes in eight cities or regions in different countries to determine the level of microbiological contamination of common surfaces and items, and investigate the attitudes and perceptions of householders towards cleaning and hygiene. Environmental Health Practitioners took eight standardised swabs in each home. The swabs were cultured for a range of micro-organisms. Householders (<italic>n</italic>=160) were also interviewed regarding their cleaning habits and perceptions of hygiene. Overall, 28% of surfaces or items tested in the study had ‘moderate bacterial growth’ or ‘heavy bacterial growth’. Kitchen cloths were the most contaminated items, with 86% having moderate bacterial growth or heavy bacterial growth; kitchen taps were the second most contaminated items, with 52% having moderate bacterial growth or heavy bacterial growth. High proportions (&gt;50%) of kitchen cloths contained coliforms, Enterobacteriaceae and <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> spp. The visual appearance of surfaces and items frequently (30%) did not correspond to their level of contamination with micro-organisms. The majority of householders (65%) cleaned to make the house ‘look clean, smell nice and remove germs’; however, householders’ perceptions of the cleanliness of their homes frequently did not correspond to microbiological reality. In conclusion, further research and education are needed regarding hygiene in the home.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>It is widely accepted that poor hygiene in the home can lead to a range of illnesses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1757177413483346">Scott, 2000</xref>). The kitchen and the bathroom carry particularly high levels of microbiological contamination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1757177413483346">Scott, 2000</xref>). In particular, areas around the sink and kitchen cloths/sponges have high bacterial counts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1757177413483346">Speirs et al, 1995</xref>). Kitchen cloths/sponges are regarded as one of the primary routes for cross-contamination of these areas and the dissemination of bacteria throughout the home (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1757177413483346">Redmond and Griffin, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Common bacteria in the home environment are not removed by some frequently used household cleaners. In a laboratory-based study, the regular application of washing-up liquid/liquid cleaner to household sponges had little effect on the levels of a number of bacterial species, including <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1757177413483346">Erdogrul and Erbilir, 2005</xref>). Other studies have shown that the casual or spontaneous use of disinfectants does not effectively reduce bacteria numbers in the kitchen; whereas a prescribed, regular cleaning and disinfection routine is effective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1757177413483346">Josephson et al, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1757177413483346">Medrano-Félix et al, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Knowledge about appropriate hygiene practices for food safety is relatively high, but practice rarely matches knowledge. For example, although 98.6% of Spanish university students recognised the importance of hand washing before and during food preparation, only 24.4% of them affirmed that they regularly washed their hands with soap and water (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1757177413483346">Garayoa et al, 2005</xref>). Hygiene education is required to help reduce the prevalence of behaviours associated with infection, to increase the public’s awareness of risks, and to motivate them to change unsafe behaviours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1757177413483346">Redmond and Griffin, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>However, to effectively target this education, a greater understanding of the public’s attitudes towards hygiene, as well as an understanding of their actual behaviour is required (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1757177413483346">Redmond and Griffin, 2009</xref>). There are few data regarding which surfaces in homes are contaminated with potentially pathogenic bacteria. There is also little information on how the general public’s attitudes towards household hygiene vary internationally, and whether differences in social attitudes between countries affect the hygiene levels achieved.</p>
<p>This study aimed to investigate the level of microbiological contamination and cleanliness of common surfaces and items in homes in eight cities or regions in different countries, and to investigate the knowledge, attitudes and perceptions of householders towards cleaning and hygiene. The findings would be used to guide householder education efforts as well as further research into cleanliness in the home.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section3-1757177413483346">
<title>Study design</title>
<p>This was a prospective, multinational study conducted in eight cities or populous metropolitan regions in different countries (Australia, Germany, India, Malaysia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, the UK and the USA) in 2009. The study comprised two parts: 1) a detailed microbiological contamination analysis of commonly touched household surfaces, including observations of the cleanliness of each surface or item; and 2) a householder questionnaire, in which information was gathered about the cleaning habits and hygiene awareness of each respondent.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1757177413483346">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>Participants were identified and recruited by a market research agency (Harrison Interactive, Brentford, UK). To ensure the findings of the study were readily applicable to families with children, selected households had to include at least two children under the age of 10 years, with one child under the age of 2 years. Families, as far as possible, were to represent a cross-section of socioeconomic backgrounds, including both lower and higher income families. Participants were selected from major populous areas within the study countries: Sydney (Australia); Düsseldorf (Germany); Delhi (India); Kuala Lumpur (Malaysia); Jeddah (Saudi Arabia); Johannesburg (South Africa); Greater London (UK); and New York/New Jersey (USA). Participants signed a consent form agreeing to the use of the data as well as anonymity, and were compensated with an appropriate amount according to the local cost of living for their participation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1757177413483346">
<title>Sampling procedure</title>
<p>Five experienced, chartered environmental health practitioners (EHPs; from Hygiene Audit Systems, London, UK) attended a practical training session with a study coordinator. The small number of EHPs ensured that each received a personalised briefing from the study coordinator, ensuring consistent training across the group. The training from the study coordinator aimed to ensure consistency in the swabbing techniques, the areas and items swabbed, the labelling of swabs and record-keeping, the safe transfer of swabs to the laboratory, and confidentiality. It also aimed to reduce inter-individual variability between the EHPs.</p>
<p>Eight predefined and consistent sites were swabbed in each home: toilet flush handle or chain, inside bathroom/restroom door handle, kitchen sponge or cloth, kitchen tap/faucet handle, chopping board or kitchen slab, telephone, TV remote control, and highchair or place where children eat. A 10 cm x 10 cm area was measured using a sterile template and then swabbed using a sterile sponge swab pre-moistened with maximum recovery medium containing peptic digest of animal tissue and sodium chloride. When it was not possible to swab a total area of 10 cm x 10 cm, an approximation of the area swabbed was made using a flexible ruler so that a bacterial count per cm<sup>2</sup> or per 100 cm<sup>2</sup> could be obtained. Aseptic technique was used throughout the sampling process. Swabs were stored in a transportable car refrigerator containing a calibrated temperature logger (Comark Instruments, Norwich, UK) for transfer to the testing laboratory.</p>
<p>In addition to microbiological swabbing, a visual inspection of the cleanliness of each swabbed surface was made by the EHP. Each surface was graded as ‘good/new’, ‘visibly clean’, ‘grimy/greasy’, or ‘visibly dirty’ according to guidelines on the grading of items provided by the study coordinator. The guidelines aimed to reduce inter-individual variability between the EHPs.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1757177413483346">
<title>Bacteriological analysis</title>
<p>Swabs were stored at 2–5 °C in an approved laboratory at the end of each study day or within 24 h. The laboratory analysed the data from the temperature logger and confirmed that the carriage temperature had been satisfactory before accepting the swabs. Samples were kept at 2–5°C at the laboratory and tested within 24 h of receipt.</p>
<p>Each swab was cultured for the following indicator organisms: total viable count (TVC), coliform bacteria, <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, Enterobacteriaceae, <italic>Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas</italic> spp. (including <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>).</p>
<p>The media and culture conditions for each indicator organism were identified according to standard laboratory procedures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1757177413483346">Versalovic et al, 2011</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1757177413483346">
<title>Cleaning habits and hygiene perception questionnaire</title>
<p>While the EHP was swabbing the home, the occupants were interviewed by a local representative in local language on their cleaning habits and perceptions regarding hygiene using a specially designed questionnaire. The questionnaire comprised 24 questions and covered: the amount of time spent cleaning each week; whether domestic help was employed; the occupants’ reasons for cleaning their home; the products used (including local brands); whether the occupant believed that too much cleaning was bad for health; how clean the occupant believed their home was; what the occupant believed the effects of poor hygiene were; the frequency and methods used to clean the sample sites; and which site the occupant thought would harbour the most bacteria.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1757177413483346">
<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>No formal sample size calculation was performed; a convenience sample of 20 households per city or region was chosen to provide adequate data on the trends in each city or region. Bacterial counts per 100 cm<sup>2</sup> were calculated and classified as having ‘no bacterial growth’, ‘low bacterial growth’, ‘moderate bacterial growth’ and ‘heavy bacterial growth’, based on the criteria shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1757177413483346">Table 1</xref>. The cut-off values were set based on extensive study of the scientific literature as well as the past experiences of the study coordinators regarding the level of bacterial contamination in home environments.</p>

<p>Twenty households in each city or region were included, resulting in a total of 160 households in the study. The householders interviewed were predominantly female (94%). The targeted selection process ensured that householders covered a range of ethnic backgrounds and socioeconomic status. Demographic data were collected for each household; however, questions were asked and reported differently in each country and, therefore, the demographic information collected was not directly comparable.

<title>Knowledge, attitudes and perceptions towards household cleanliness</title>
<p>Householders said they spent the most time cleaning in Jeddah, Johannesburg and Greater London, with 95%, 60% and 55%, respectively, saying they spent more than 5 h cleaning per week. Householders in Delhi said that they cleaned for the least time each week compared with other cities, with 80% saying they cleaned for less than 2 h a week. Domestic help was most frequently used in households in Delhi and Jeddah, with 45% and 40%, respectively, employing a cleaner. Households in Sydney employed the least external domestic help (10%).</p>
<p>The majority of respondents (65%) said they cleaned their house to make it ‘look clean, smell nice and remove germs’; however, 28% reported that their priority was to make it ‘look clean and/or smell nice’.</p>
<p>Antibacterial cleaners were used by all households in New York/New Jersey and 95% of households in Jeddah; whereas, just 20% of households in Kuala Lumpur used these cleaners. Cream cleaner was frequently used in Düsseldorf (85%), and many households in Jeddah, New York/New Jersey and Kuala Lumpur reported using washing-up liquid/liquid cleanser to clean the home (100%, 90% and 85%, respectively).</p>
<p>Overall, 43% of respondents did not believe that too much cleaning was bad for health; however, 25% of respondents firmly believed this and a further 24% of respondents thought there may be some truth in it. Respondents from Düsseldorf were most likely to believe the statement, with 75% saying they firmly believed it. Respondents from Delhi and Jeddah were least convinced, with 30% and 40% believing that too much cleaning was bad for health, respectively; no householder in New York/New Jersey or Delhi firmly believed in the theory. Overall, 84% of respondents in the study thought that you could reduce illness by practising good hygiene in the home. In Düsseldorf, only 65% of respondents believed this statement.</p>
<p>When asked to rate the cleanliness of their homes, 15% of householders from Jeddah and 10% of householders from Johannesburg rated their homes as ‘spotless’. No householders from Delhi or Kuala Lumpur rated their home as ‘spotless’, but 90% and 75%, respectively, rated it as ‘satisfactory’. No householders rated their home as heavily contaminated, but 25% of respondents from Kuala Lumpur and New York/New Jersey rated their home as unsatisfactory.</p>
<p>Focusing on the kitchen cloths/sponges, 84% of respondents said they did not use the same cloth/sponge in different rooms of the house; whereas, 10% of respondents said they always did this. This practice was particularly prevalent in Johannesburg, where 35% used the same cloth/sponge throughout the house. All respondents said they cleaned their kitchen cloth/sponge. The most frequently cited method of cleaning the cloth/sponge was rinsing it with washing-up liquid/liquid cleaner, which was cited by 43% of respondents overall, and 85%, 65% and 60% of respondents from Jeddah, Kuala Lumpur, and Delhi and Johannesburg, respectively. Most respondents from Sydney (80%), Greater London (60%) and Düsseldorf (55%) replaced dirty cloths/sponges with new ones. Many householders from Greater London (50%) and Düsseldorf (30%) said they cleaned their cloths in a washing machine; whereas, 30% of respondents from Delhi and Johannesburg said they disinfected their cloths/sponges. Overall, cloths/sponges were changed or cleaned once a week in most cases (37%), or when they looked dirty (28%).</p>
<p>Respondents thought that the toilet flush was likely to harbour the most bacteria of the items sampled, with 52% of respondents identifying this surface; the kitchen cloth/sponge was identified second most often (24%). Many householders from Delhi (85%) and Jeddah (80%) thought the toilet flush was likely to be the dirtiest place. Householders from Düsseldorf most often identified the kitchen cloth/sponge as the dirtiest item of those sampled (55%), while only one respondent from Jeddah (5%) suggested this item.</p>
<p>The kitchen tap was identified as the second most contaminated surface in this study, and the majority of respondents overall (53%) said they cleaned and disinfected it every day; however, 29% of respondents stated that they only cleaned it once a week or less frequently. Most respondents cleaned their chopping board every time it was used (90%); and most respondents said they rinsed it with washing-up liquid/liquid cleaner (61%).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This prospective study, conducted in 160 homes across eight cities in different countries, provides some novel information on the bacteriological cleanliness of surfaces in the home, as well as exploring householders’ knowledge, attitudes and perceptions towards cleanliness and hygiene. The findings may be used to guide further research into cleanliness in the home as well as educational efforts.</p>
<p>Kitchen cloths/sponges were the most contaminated item in the home, with 86% having moderate bacterial growth or heavy bacterial growth. It has been reported previously that the moist, nutrient-rich environment of a kitchen cloth/sponge is ideal for bacterial growth and that they are among the most highly contaminated places in the house (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1757177413483346">Speirs et al, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1757177413483346">Redmond and Griffin, 2009</xref>); however, it has rarely been shown how heavily contaminated kitchen cloths/sponges are in everyday homes. In this study, 31% of cloths/sponges were contaminated with <italic>E. coli</italic> and 21% were contaminated with <italic>S. aureus</italic>, both potentially pathogenic micro-organisms. A contaminated kitchen cloth/sponge will spread bacteria around the kitchen and from there into the rest of the house (especially if it is used throughout the house); therefore, it is important to raise awareness about the hygiene risks of kitchen cloths/sponges and methods to improve their cleanliness. These include increasing the frequency with which they are replaced, ensuring that they are washed at an appropriately high temperature (≥60°C/140°F) or with the addition of an appropriate laundry disinfectant if washing them at a lower temperature. Rinsing a cloth/sponge in washing-up liquid/liquid cleaner does not effectively reduce the number of contaminating bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1757177413483346">Erdogrul and Erbilir, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Kitchen taps/faucets were the second most contaminated surfaces; this could be related to the use of dirty cloths/sponges to clean them as well as contamination by touch. The taps/faucets are likely to be used by many members of the household, and if they are dirty, may re-contaminate hands following hand washing.</p>
<p>Apart from the kitchen cloths/sponges and taps/faucets, the other surfaces tested in this study generally had low bacterial growth. It was surprising that toilet flushes and bathroom/restroom door handles were not frequently contaminated, but this could suggest that messages regarding hand hygiene and cleanliness in the bathroom have been put into practice. This finding is supported by previous studies, which have shown that the kitchen is more heavily contaminated than the bathroom, and that toilets were less contaminated than might be expected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1757177413483346">Rusin et al, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1757177413483346">Ojima et al, 2002</xref>). The relatively low contamination of toilet flushes and door handles may be because they tend to remain dry and not that they are cleaned regularly; in comparison, kitchen cloths/sponges and taps/faucets are likely to be moist for much of the time, encouraging bacterial growth.</p>
<p>Chopping boards also generally had low bacterial growth. This may be related to the materials modern chopping boards are made from, as the majority of respondents used only washing-up liquid/liquid cleaner to clean their boards, which would not be effective against many of the micro-organisms tested for.</p>
<p>The greatest numbers of sites that had moderate bacterial growth or heavy bacterial growth were found in Delhi and Kuala Lumpur, and the lowest in Jeddah and Greater London. This could reflect a number of parameters: the natural level of micro-organisms in the environment and the ability of these micro-organisms to grow; the attitude of the householders to hygiene; and the overall level of hygiene and sanitation within a country. The EHPs found a different level of general hygiene and sanitation in Delhi and Kuala Lumpur compared with the other countries. The water quality was thought to be unsatisfactory in some of the houses tested. Many houses in these cities had just one tap/faucet to serve the whole house, and in some houses, the toilets were holes in the ground with hosepipes or a jug of water for flushing. Given these differences, it is not appropriate to compare the cities/regions too closely.</p>
<p>A striking finding of this study was that a number of surfaces rated as visibly clean or new had heavy bacterial growth, indicating that visual cleanliness cannot be used as a correlate for a lack of bacteriological contamination. As many householders cited one of their reasons for cleaning was to make the house ‘look clean’, there is a need for education that appearances can be deceptive. The fact that many householders rated their house as spotless or satisfactory when it was shown not to be the case microbiologically also supports the need for further education.</p>
<p>The knowledge, attitudes and perceptions questionnaire produced some interesting findings, particularly when these were correlated to the bacteriological results. The relatively high prevalence of external domestic help correlated to low levels of contamination in Jeddah, but not in Delhi. This may be linked to the water quality and general microbiological contamination levels in Delhi. The stated aim of cleaning by the majority of respondents from Delhi was to make sure all germs were removed; the microbiological results suggest this aim is not being successfully achieved. Clearly, householders in this city need assistance to improve hygiene in their homes, be it education on cleaning techniques or greater access to products that kill bacteria. Overall, nearly half of the respondents believed to a certain extent, or firmly, that too much cleaning could be bad for health, and this was especially supported in Düsseldorf. In contrast, most respondents in Delhi believed that good hygiene could help prevent illness, which was reassuring. This was not the case in Düsseldorf, where 35% were not convinced that good hygiene could prevent illness.</p>
<p>This study has a number of limitations. The families were selected to fulfil certain criteria and were not randomly chosen; however, an effort was made to select families from a broad social spectrum and income range. Demographic data were collected and reported differently in each city/region and therefore are not directly comparable. The sample size was limited to 20 households per city or region for practical reasons; this makes statistical analysis between and within cities/regions unfeasible. Furthermore, it was predetermined and standardised as to which surfaces should be tested. Although this allows comparisons between households and cities/regions, these surfaces were chosen because it was thought they might be highly contaminated. Finally, it is not appropriate to compare standards of hygiene in newly industrialised countries and developed countries. This has been avoided as far as possible. However, this study has clearly demonstrated that attitudes towards hygiene vary between the cities and regions studied.</p>
<p>In conclusion, this survey conducted in eight cities or regions in different countries has demonstrated that kitchen cloths/sponges and taps are the most contaminated of the surfaces tested; that the visual appearance of cleanliness does not correspond to an absence of microbiological contamination; and that householders’ perceptions of their cleaning regimes and their ability to keep a clean house does not always correspond to microbiological findings. This highlights the need for further research into effective ways of keeping kitchen cloths/sponges and taps clean, as well as further education promoting the importance of hygiene in relation to these items.</p>
