   <body>
      <p>After more than 30 years of teaching the psychology of women, one might think that nothing students say or do would surprise me. Yet I continue to be amazed about how little students know, or understand, about women’s reproductive health. It is clear that they have had little access to reliable information, and much of what they “know” comes from popular culture and is based on stereotypes. For example, most of my students are unfamiliar with the terms <italic>menarche</italic> and <italic>dysmenorrhea</italic>, do not realize that premenstrual changes are not synonymous with premenstrual syndrome (PMS), do not know the difference between PMS and menstrual cramps, say “during my menstrual cycle” rather than “during menstruation” because they do not understand that the cycle is continuous, claim never to have heard of follicle stimulating hormone or luteinizing hormone, have no idea that 20% of pregnancies result in miscarriage, assume that women need medical supervision during the menopausal transition, are ignorant about the process of giving birth, and utilize terminology popularized by the Right-to-Life Movement rather than scientific terms (e.g., <italic>unborn </italic>or <italic>pre-born baby</italic> rather than <italic>fetus</italic>) because they do not even realize the difference. A male student once astounded me (and the rest of the class) by insisting that the peak of women’s fertility is during menstruation, which is why people so rarely engage in sexual intercourse at that time.</p>
      <p>Why do my otherwise intelligent and sophisticated students, who know so much more than I did at their age about careers and about the world, display so much ignorance about women’s bodies? Perhaps the clearest explanation is that menstruation and other reproductive processes are stigmatized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0361684312471326">Chrisler, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0361684312471326">Johnston-Robledo &amp; Chrisler, in press</xref>). The menses are generally considered disgusting, and any contact with (or even sight of) someone else’s menstrual blood is something to be avoided. Women who are premenstrual, menstruating, pregnant, in labor, lactating, or perimenopausal carry a mark that sets them apart from others (especially from men) and spoils their social identity (especially in the eyes of men, who do not find them desirable sexual partners). People prefer to avoid stigmatized others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0361684312471326">Goffman, 1963</xref>), as well as discussion of stigmatized marks. Recent research shows that even being seen with products (e.g., tampons) associated with stigmatized marks or talking openly about one’s research interests in stigmatized matters can transfer from the products or the topic to the individual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0361684312471326">Chrisler, Gorman, et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0361684312471326">Chrisler, Johnston-Robledo, &amp; Gorman, 2011</xref>). Given both instructors’ and students’ discomfort with the issues, and given political and economic pressures that have caused many schools to drop or “dumb-down” their health and sex education courses, it seems that fewer and fewer people are willing to teach about these taboo topics.</p>
      <p>The purpose of this article is (a) to consider reasons why women’s reproductive processes receive so little attention in psychology courses and (b) to make an argument for why more attention is needed. Too many women are ashamed of and embarrassed by reproductive and other aspects of their bodies. Too many men and women absorb negative attitudes toward menstruation and menopause from popular culture, and those negative attitudes can affect broader attitudes toward women. Instructors of courses on the psychology of women are in a good position to try to change that.</p>
      <sec id="section1-0361684312471326">
         <title>Inattention to Menstruation and Menopause</title>
         <p>Older textbooks on the psychology of women (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0361684312471326">Frieze, Parsons, Johnson, Ruble, &amp; Zellman, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0361684312471326">Sherman, 1971</xref>) contained much more coverage, even an entire chapter, on the menstrual cycle, including menopause. These books were written at a time when feminist psychology had a large focus on rediscovering old works, pointing out sexism in classic theories, and adding missing information about women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0361684312471326">Torrey, 1987</xref>). Women were missing from almost any course that students took in those days, and textbook authors realized the importance of providing information on all aspects of women’s experience because they could not assume that students knew anything. Thus, the books explain the basic physiology of the menstrual cycle, including all of the four major hormones involved, before going on to address psychological aspects (e.g., attitudes, affect, disorders). Today that basic physiological information is often missing, and coverage of psychological aspects is spread out among various chapters (e.g., menarche in a chapter on childhood and adolescence, menopause in a chapter on aging, premenstrual dysphoric disorder in a chapter on mental health). Editorial decisions about what to cover and where to place it are driven by a number of factors, including publishers’ page limits, the rapidly expanding research base available to cover, and the authors’ own interests and expertise. However, syllabi are typically constructed to match textbooks’ tables of contents, and, without information in the textbook to guide them, some instructors may overlook the importance of addressing the menstrual cycle in a way that provides the biological and psychological context necessary to address related topics when they appear in scattered chapters.</p>
         <p>College professors, like middle-school and high school teachers, might limit coverage of menstruation and menopause because of their own, and their students’, discomfort with the topics. I have noticed that my male students’ absenteeism is higher than average during the week I discuss the menstrual cycle, and some of the women and men who are present seem to be embarrassed during certain points of the discussion (e.g., the actual content of the menses [only 50–75% is blood; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0361684312471326">Maddux, 1975</xref>], the amount of a typical menstrual flow [less than one quarter cup; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0361684312471326">Gersh &amp; Gersh, 1981</xref>]). When students giggle, look bored or embarrassed, leave the room, or do not show up for class, it is understandable that instructors would want to change the subject, but doing so reinforces the stigma. Instructors may be concerned that their own lack of knowledge makes them ill-equipped to cover these topics, or they may think that the topics belong in a biology or women’s health class. However, most students will never take a women’s health class or a biology class that puts the menstrual cycle and menopause in a biopsychosocial context, and basic information is available to help prepare an accurate and interesting lecture (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0361684312471326">Chrisler, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0361684312471326">Golub, 1992</xref>).</p>
         <p>Another reason why some instructors may not spend much time on the menstrual cycle is that they believe that menstruation and menopause are no longer taboo topics. There has certainly been an increase in the number of mentions of menstruation, menopause, and PMS in popular culture; menstrual hygiene products and treatments for menstrual cramps and symptoms of perimenopause are advertised and discussed on television; and menstrual activists have created blogs and zines (electronic public discussion and information sites) that address menstruation along with other body-related topics. For example, a columnist for Salon.com (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0361684312471326">Fortini, 2009</xref>) proclaimed no further need for menstrual education and activism because the taboo no longer exists. However, the evidence does not support an end to the stigma attached to women’s reproductive processes. The majority of mentions of menstruation and menopause in popular culture are negative and often serve as a way to mock women for comedic effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0361684312471326">Kissling, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0361684312471326">Rosenware, 2012</xref>). Joan Rivers, a popular comedian, was recently censored when she mentioned the word “period” (a common euphemism for menstruation) on an afternoon television talk show (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0361684312471326">Chrisler, 2011</xref>). Advertisements for menstrual hygiene products continue to use avoidance of stigma as a selling point, and the term “feminine hygiene,” which is often used by both manufacturers and retailers to describe tampons and sanitary napkins, suggests that there is something “dirty” about women’s bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0361684312471326">Chrisler, 2011</xref>). Thus, it is unlikely that students will hear serious discussions of the menstrual cycle outside a feminist classroom or a gynecologist’s office; in the latter case, the topic is likely to be medicalized and discussed only in relation to “problem periods.”</p>
         <sec id="section2-0361684312471326">
            <title>Paying Attention to Menstruation and Menopause</title>
            <p>The menstrual cycle is a perfect example of a biopsychosocial process; it is a normal aspect of physiology that both affects and is affected by behavior. Our cyclic, menarcheal, and menopausal experiences occur, our beliefs about them are learned, and our attitudes toward them are formed within a cultural context. Therefore, although almost every woman around the world shares the same processes of menstruation and menopause, we experience them differently, and those differences are caused, for the most part, by sociocultural effects on our beliefs, attitudes, and behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0361684312471326">Chrisler, 2008</xref>). Teaching basic facts about the menstrual cycle is a chance to fill in the blanks in what our students know about their bodies, correct myths and misinformation they have learned, and also show the power of culture and social cognition on something as basic as a physiological process.</p>
            <p>The medicalization of women’s bodies is an important topic in the psychology of women. It is often discussed in regard to pregnancy, birthing, and menopause, which are now regarded by most people as requiring medical attention and supervision. The menstrual cycle itself has become medicalized. Pop cultural references and articles and discussions about the menstrual cycle in the media (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0361684312471326">Chrisler &amp; Levy, 1990</xref>) often seem to suggest that women are ill during the premenstrual and menstrual phases of their cycles—that is, one half of every month. Although it is easy for young people to see that their mothers, professors, bosses, coaches, and other adult women they know rarely lay down, slow down, or otherwise change their usual activities during the premenstrual and menstrual phases of their cycles, my students are always surprised to hear that women have won Olympic medals, given award-winning performances, and even flown on the space shuttle while menstruating. It is important for students to learn that menstrual cramps and premenstrual changes in affect, water retention, acne, and other experiences are normative—unless they are severe. Students are so used to the term “PMS” that many do not even realize that the S stands for “syndrome” and means a medical disorder. It is not good for a woman’s psychology to refer to herself as ill or disordered when she is actually normal and healthy. Advertisements for continuous oral contraceptives that suppress menstrual cycles, and media reports about them, suggest that it is healthier for women not to menstruate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0361684312471326">Johnston-Robledo, Barnack, &amp; Wares, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0361684312471326">Mamo &amp; Fosket, 2009</xref>). Those ads do not acknowledge the lack of long-term studies of the biomedical effects of menstrual suppression or its social, psychological, developmental, and cultural implications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0361684312471326">Society for Menstrual Cycle Research, 2007</xref>). Students could be asked to discuss whether (and how) stigma affects women’s decision to use continuous oral contraceptives and whether, as fewer women menstruate regularly because more women are using these drugs, the stigma attached to menstruation will be stronger or weaker.</p>
            <p>Gender stereotypes are another important topic in any psychology of women course. We know that there are meta-stereotypes that are applied to women in general, as well as stereotypes about particular subgroups of women (e.g., lesbians, Black women, career women, homemakers; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0361684312471326">Cuddy, Fiske, &amp; Glick, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0361684312471326">Eckes, 1994</xref>). Images of menstruating and premenstrual women in popular culture both contribute to and reflect stereotypes of women. For example, menstrual and premenstrual women are shown in popular culture as tearful, tense, weak, miserable, physically ill, mentally unstable, easily enraged, out of control, and potentially violent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0361684312471326">Chrisler, 2002</xref>); indeed, the word “hormonal” seems now to be used to describe any emotional reaction that observers find to be excessive. A study of stereotypes of women in different hormonal conditions showed that menstruating women were viewed as less sexy, more impure, and more irritable than women in general (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0361684312471326">Forbes, Adams-Curtis, White, &amp; Holmgren, 2003</xref>). Both menstruating and premenstrual women have been described as experiencing negative affect (sad, frustrated), inactivity (tired, weak), annoyance (desperate, whining), instability (unpredictable, moody), physical symptoms (cramp-y, bloated), and limitations (incapable, unlovable). In that same study, menopausal women were described by participants with adjectives that convey contempt (old, incomplete), disease (aching, fatigued), and negative affect (depressed, frustrated), as well as with some positive adjectives (admirable, experienced; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0361684312471326">Marván, Islas, Vela, Chrisler, &amp; Warren, 2008</xref>). Another study showed that women described as undergoing menopause were seen as less active, experiencing more negative affect, engaging in more negative health behaviors, and holding fewer social roles than midlife men and midlife women who were not perimenopausal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0361684312471326">Marcus-Newhall, Thompson, &amp; Thomas, 2001</xref>). It is interesting to ask students to consider how stereotypes of premenstrual and menstruating women contradict meta-stereotypes that women are kind, gentle, and nurturing. Does violation of the expectations for feminine behavior encourage dividing women into “good” and “bad” subtypes? How has medicalization affected the stereotype of perimenopausal women? Does the menopausal transition make women seem older than men of the same age? Do students believe that those stereotypes describe themselves and women they know? If not, why do people continue to believe in them?</p>
            <p>Stereotypes contribute to prejudice, and sexism and ageism appear to be related to stereotypes of menstrual, premenstrual, and menopausal women. As Barbara <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0361684312471326">Sommer (1983</xref>, p. 53) noted, the menstrual cycle is such a clear dividing line between the sexes that “its correlates, concomitants, accompaniments, ramifications, and implications have become intrinsically bound up with issues of gender equality.” Students might consider how the stereotypes about “hormonal” women might lead to prejudice and discrimination. For example, hostile sexism may be associated with beliefs that menstruating, premenstrual, and/or menopausal women are unapproachable, unstable, or aggressive, and benevolent sexism may be associated with beliefs that those women are ill, weak, or fatigued (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0361684312471326">Chrisler, Gorman, Marván, &amp; Johnston-Robledo, in press</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0361684312471326">Forbes et al., 2003</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0361684312471326">Tavris (1992</xref>, p. 133) once joked that “the only thing worse for women than menstruating is not menstruating.” Students could be asked to consider what she meant by that remark. In a youth-oriented culture such as the United States, menopause may serve as a dividing line between midlife women—who may still be considered youthful, attractive, and sexy—and older women who are no longer sexually attractive to men. If women’s social importance derives primarily from their ability to bear children, then menopausal women have lost their value. That can explain why participants in the studies above described them as incomplete, depressed, frustrated, inactive, and holding fewer social roles. Do students see their mothers and grandmothers as inactive and lacking importance?</p>
            <p>Stereotypes, stigma, and misunderstandings of menstruation and menopause can affect the psychology of women in many ways. For example, concerns about leaks or hot flashes that reveal the secret about women’s reproductive phase can lead to excessively vigilant self-consciousness and self-monitoring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0361684312471326">Johnston-Robledo &amp; Chrisler, in press</xref>), which interferes with social functioning. Beliefs in stereotypes about limitations in women’s capabilities at certain times of the month or during the menopausal transition can produce self-fulfilling prophecies that cause women to miss out on career and leisure opportunities. Stigma is also related to the sex taboo (avoidance of sexual intercourse during menstruation) and the communication taboo (menstruation and menopause are not fit topics for conversation); the former can diminish women’s well-being and relationship satisfaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0361684312471326">Johnston-Robledo &amp; Chrisler, in press</xref>), and the latter contributes to the lack of accurate information women have about their reproductive processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0361684312471326">Kissling, 1996</xref>) and worries about whether their own experience is normal. Negative attitudes toward menstruation and menopause are influenced by stigma and stereotypes, and they contribute to body dissatisfaction and shame about these and other reproductive processes (e.g., breastfeeding; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0361684312471326">Johnston-Robledo, Sheffield, Voigt, &amp; Wilcox-Constantine, 2007</xref>). Women who self-objectify tend to have particularly negative attitudes toward menstruation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0361684312471326">Johnston-Robledo et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0361684312471326">Roberts, 2004</xref>), and the lowered self-esteem and reproductive shame they feel have mental health implications and may lead them to make decisions (e.g., menstrual suppression, elective cesarean sections, high-risk sexual behavior) that could harm their physical health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0361684312471326">Andrist, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0361684312471326">Johnston-Robledo et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0361684312471326">Schooler, Ward, Merriwether, &amp; Caruthers, 2005</xref>). Students could be engaged in a discussion of how they might take action to reduce stigma and challenge stereotypes that are harmful to women and girls. In what ways, if any, would they be willing to resist stigma and violate taboos? (See <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0361684312471326">Johnston-Robledo &amp; Chrisler, in press</xref>, for some suggestions.)</p>

         <title>Conclusion</title>
         <p>Menstruation, menopause, and other reproductive events are important to the psychology of women. Reproductive processes make possible a social role that all women respect and most women hope to embody: mother. Yet, too many women and girls are ashamed of and embarrassed by these and other aspects of their bodies. Instructors of psychology of women courses are in a position to make a difference in their students’ lives by breaking the communication taboo to discuss these topics openly, correcting misinformation, challenging stereotypes, and encouraging students to resist stigmatized messages about women’s bodies. I hope that the suggestions in this article and the supporting materials (including more assignments and activities) available online (and described at the end of this article) will encourage each of my readers to do just that. Besides, teaching taboo topics can be fun. It is never too late to join the resistance!</p>
