<abstract>
<p>Latent class analysis was conducted on the psychosocial problems experienced by truant youths. Data were obtained from baseline interviews completed on 131 youths and their parents/guardians involved in a NIDA-funded, Brief Intervention Project. Results identified two classes of youths: Class 1(n=9) - youths with low levels of delinquency, mental health and substance abuse issues; and Class 2(n=37) - youths with high levels of these problems. Comparison of these two classes on their urine analysis test results and parent/guardian reports of traumatic events found significant (p&lt;.05) differences between them that were consistent with their problem group classification. Our results have important implications for research and practice.</p>

<body>
<p>School truancy, or unexcused absences from school, particularly in primary and secondary schools, has increasingly been identified as an issue deserving attention in communities across the nation. According to Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (OJJDP, 2001), hundreds of thousands of youths are truant each day. Many youths in America neither attend school regularly nor graduate from high school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1063426610396221">Arnette, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1063426610396221">Baker, Sigmon, &amp; Nugent, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1063426610396221">Center for Labor Market Studies, 2009</xref>). There is a critical, continuing need to develop and test innovative strategies and programs to improve the delivery of services to truant youths. It is likely that many fall through the cracks of the service delivery system.</p>
<p>Truant youth represent a challenging yet very promising group of at-risk youth to study. In addition to having problems in school, they frequently experience troubled family situations, failing grades, and psychosocial difficulties including drug use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1063426610396221">Dembo &amp; Turner, 1994</xref>). Truancy is usefully conceived as midpoint along a continuum that begins with absenteeism and recurrent tardiness and ends with suspension or expulsion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1063426610396221">National School Safety Center, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>School officials have critical roles to play in identifying truant youth and determining the psychosocial problems they are experiencing that impede their participation in school and in other important areas of their functioning. Unfortunately, because of limited resources, schools tend to have an episodic concern about truant youth. Policy makers are often torn between providing services to truant and other at-risk youth and their families and responding to youth misbehavior with harsher sanctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1063426610396221">Steinhart, 1996</xref>). Truant youths are most often treated as management and disciplinary problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1063426610396221">DeKalb, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1063426610396221">Diebolt &amp; Herlache, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1063426610396221">Dougherty, 1999</xref>). Resources are focused on identifying, locating, and transitioning truant youth back into their respective schools with appropriate sanctions and/or citations. Often, these efforts include formal adjudication, police involvement, and suspension or remedial programs, which have not been shown to be effective in resolving the issues fostering truancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1063426610396221">Byer &amp; Kuhn, 2003</xref>). Serious attention to the underlying causes of truancy is usually given after the youth’s absence from school becomes frequent or chronic. At that point, the youth has often developed far more serious difficulties in school and other areas of psychosocial functioning in addition to not attending classes.</p>
<p>As well, many communities lack screening or assessment and intervention services for truant youth in spite of the psychosocial problems these youth often present. A more effective response to truancy requires identifying and addressing the problems that these youth and their families are experiencing through effective truancy intervention programs. However, reviews of the literature have identified relatively few studies of interventions that have been put in place to decrease truancy rates by remediating the problems causing this behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1063426610396221">Dembo &amp; Gulledge, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1063426610396221">Doll &amp; Hess, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Some communities, such as Hillsborough County, Florida, have established truancy centers, which conduct intake, assessment, service referral, and intervention activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1063426610396221">Dembo &amp; Gulledge, 2009</xref>). Established in 1993, the Truancy Intake Center is a crime-prevention tool designed to get students back into the mainstream of school by reducing student dropout (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1063426610396221">Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office, 1997</xref>). Students who are not in school can be taken into custody by various law enforcement agencies located throughout Hillsborough County and transported to the center.</p>
<p>With regard to psychosocial issues, the limited number of available studies involving selected samples of truant youths indicate truant youths are often experiencing serious interrelated problems in regard to a stressed family life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1063426610396221">Baker et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1063426610396221">Kearney &amp; Silverman, 1995</xref>), alcohol and other drug use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1063426610396221">Baker et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1063426610396221">Dembo &amp; Turner, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1063426610396221">Diebolt &amp; Herlache, 1991</xref>), emotional or psychological functioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1063426610396221">Diebolt &amp; Herlache, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1063426610396221">Egger, Costello, &amp; Angold, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1063426610396221">Kearney &amp; Silverman, 1995</xref>), and educational functioning (e.g., low grades, high rates of being retained in grade or placed in remedial or special programs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1063426610396221">Dembo &amp; Turner, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1063426610396221">Garry, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1063426610396221">Ingersoll &amp; LeBoeuf, 1997</xref>). Research also suggests that truant youths are at considerable risk of continuing their troubled behavior in school and entering the juvenile justice system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1063426610396221">Garry, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1063426610396221">Ingersoll &amp; LeBoeuf, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1063426610396221">Loeber &amp; Farrington, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1063426610396221">Puzzanchera, Stahl, Finnegan, Tierney, &amp; Snyder, 2003</xref>; also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1063426610396221">Henry, Thornberry, &amp; Huizinga, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>These interrelated problem behaviors among truant youth support the concept of problem behavior syndrome (PBS). According to this view, youth who engage in a specific form of deviant behavior (e.g., drug use) are significantly more likely to report engaging in other deviant behaviors (e.g., delinquency; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1063426610396221">LeBlanc &amp; Bouthillier, 2003</xref>). These behaviors are seen to reflect a general disposition toward deviant behavior. Engaging in a particular form of deviant behavior is seen as a symptom of the larger “general syndrome” of deviance, commonly referred to as PBS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1063426610396221">Jessor &amp; Jessor, 1977</xref>).</p>
<p>Reaching truant youths before they become more seriously involved in drug use and other delinquent behavior provides an excellent opportunity to reduce the likelihood they will move into the juvenile justice system. Unfortunately, with few exceptions (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1063426610396221">Henry &amp; Huizinga, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1063426610396221">McCluskey, Bynum, &amp; Patchin, 2004</xref>), truancy has not received significant attention by criminologists.</p>
<p>Identification of these youths’ problems and responding to them by placing them as early as possible into effective intervention services would benefit them, their families, and society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1063426610396221">Hawkins et al., 2000</xref>). The success of this service placement effort would be increased by identifying subgroups of truant youths who differ in psychosocial problems they present. As well, such knowledge could inform the development of needed services and improve the allocation of existing treatment resources. Accordingly, there is a need (a) to develop a more comprehensive understanding of the multiple problems truant youths may be experiencing and (b) to identify subgroups of truant youths who differ in their psychosocial problems. These were the objectives of the study we report in the present article. We report preliminary findings from a study of baseline data collected on 131 youths and their parents or guardians in an ongoing, National Institute on Drug Abuse–funded truancy Brief Intervention (BI) project. Results identified a sizable subgroup of multiproblem truant youths. Collateral data supported the usefulness of this classification. Following presentation and discussion of our results, we review their implications for intervention services.</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>A main place of recruitment into the BI project occurred at the Hillsborough County Juvenile Assessment Center, Truancy Intake Center (TIC). Eligible youths met the following criteria: (a) aged 11 to 15, (b) had no official record of delinquency or up to two misdemeanor arrests, (c) had some indication of alcohol or other drug use, as determined, for example, by a screening instrument (<italic>Personal Experience Screening Questionnaire</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1063426610396221">Winters, 1992</xref>) or as reported by a Hillsborough County School District (HCSD) social worker located at the TIC, and (d) lived within a 25-mile radius of the TIC. In addition, any HCSD social worker or guidance counselor can make referrals to the BI project. A second place of recruitment into the BI project was at a community diversion program. Case managers also refer youths with a current truancy record who meet project criteria for BI services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1063426610396221">Winters &amp; Leitten, 2007</xref>) to project staff for enrollment. Detailed information on the BI sessions can be found in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1063426610396221">Winters and Leitten (2007)</xref> and Dembo, Gulledge, and Briones (in press).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1063426610396221">
<title>Key Measures</title>
<p>The main data collection instruments used in the study were the <italic>Adolescent Diagnostic Interview</italic> (ADI; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1063426610396221">Winters &amp; Henly, 1993</xref>) and the <italic>Parent/Guardian ADI</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1063426610396221">Winters &amp; Stinchfield, 2003</xref>). All study procedures were approved and monitored by the local institutional review board.</p>
<sec id="section4-1063426610396221">
<title>Delinquency</title>
<p>Based on the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1063426610396221">Elliott, Ageton, Huizinga, Knowles, and Canter (1983)</xref>, we measured the youths’ delinquent behavior in the 12 months prior to their baseline interviews by asking how many times they engaged in each of 23 delinquent behaviors. Youths reporting an act 10 or more times were asked to indicate how often they participated in this behavior (i.e., <italic>once a month, once every two or three weeks, once a week, two to three times a week, once a day</italic>, or <italic>two to three times a day</italic>). Furthermore, youths were asked to indicate their age when they first committed each delinquent behavior. Similar to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1063426610396221">Elliott et al. (1983)</xref>, we developed five summary measures of delinquent involvement: general theft (e.g., petit theft, vehicle theft or joyriding, and burglary), crimes against persons (e.g., aggravated assault, fighting, and robbery), index crimes (similar to Uniform Crime Report (UCR) Index Part I offenses), drug sales, and total delinquency (i.e., the sum of the 23 delinquent activities).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1063426610396221">
<title>Problem substance use</title>
<p>Two sources of information were used to assess youths’ substance use involvement: (a) a question on the ADI asking if the youth <italic>ever had a problem with drug or alcohol abuse</italic> and (b) for youths reporting alcohol, marijuana, or other drug use, detailed questions for each drug used five or more times in their lives were asked regarding the extent, experiences, and consequences of use. For each drug, the responses were keyed to criteria of the <italic>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</italic> (<italic>DSM-IV</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1063426610396221">American Psychiatric Association, 1994</xref>) for a substance use disorder, leading to a classification of each youth as having no diagnosis, a diagnosis of being an abuser, or a diagnosis of being dependent on the drug. Finally, the diagnostic results for the three categories of drugs (alcohol, marijuana, and other drugs) were combined into an overall measure, based on their most serious diagnostic classification on any of the three mutually exclusive drug categories: 0 = <italic>no diagnosis on any of the three categories of drugs</italic>, 1 = <italic>abuse disorder on any of the drug categories and no dependence disorder on all categories</italic>, and 2 = <italic>dependence disorder on any of the three categories of drugs</italic>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1063426610396221">
<title>Urinalysis</title>
<p>Urine specimens were collected to assess recent drug use. The use of four substances was probed using the <italic>Onsite CupKit</italic>® urine screen procedure (positive threshold levels are noted in parentheses): (a) methamphetamines (1,000 nanograms per milliliter [ng/ml] of urine), (b) opiates (300 ng/ml of urine), (c) cocaine (300 ng/ml of urine), and (d) marijuana (50 ng/ml of urine). No urine testing was done for alcohol use. Following are the surveillance windows for the four drugs: methamphetamines and opiates = 48 hours, cocaine = 72 hours, marijuana moderate users = 5 days, marijuana heavy users = 10 days, marijuana chronic users = 20 days.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1063426610396221">
<title>Emotional or psychological problems</title>
<p>The youths’ experience of emotional or psychological problems was probed in two ways: First, the youths were asked if they ever received services for an emotional or behavioral problem. Second, ADHD was assessed by four questions on the ADI mental health section keyed to <italic>DSM-IV</italic> criteria for this troubled behavior: (a) “Do you often get complaints from parents/teachers that you don’t listen to instructions or directions?” (b) “Do you frequently tend to act before thinking?” (c) “Do you often have difficulty waiting for your turn during games or when doing things with other people your age?” and (d) “Do you often fidget and find it difficult to sit?”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1063426610396221">
<title>Parent reports of traumatic events experienced by youth or other family member</title>
<p>The youths’ parents or guardians were asked to indicate if the youths or their family ever experienced various traumatic events. Following are the nine items: (a) unemployment of parent, (b) divorce of parents, (c) death of loved one, (d) serious illness, (e) victim of a violent crime, (f) eviction from house or apartment, (g) legal problem resulting in jail time or detention, (h) accidental injury requiring hospitalization, and (i) other traumatic event.</p>

<title>Sample Characteristics</title>
<p>Most of the youths in the study (<italic>N</italic> = 131) were male (65%). The youths averaged 14.68 years in age (<italic>SD</italic> = 1.22). Of the youths, 39% were Caucasian, 24% were African American, 28% were Hispanic, 2% were Asian, and 7% were from other, mainly multiethnic backgrounds. Relatively few youths (14%) lived with both of their biological parents. On the other hand, a majority of the youths were living either with their biological mother alone (35%) or with their mother and another adult (34%). The youths tended to live in modest socioeconomic circumstances. Of the caretakers, 10% reported an annual income of more than $75,000, whereas 40% reported an annual incomes of $25,000 or less. Median family income was $25,000 to $40,000.</p>

<title>Psychosocial Description</title>
<p>The youths reported significant problems experienced by their families (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1063426610396221">Table 1</xref>). More specifically, of the youths in the sample, 57% reported a family member ever had a substance abuse problem, and nearly a quarter indicated a family member had received substance abuse treatment. In addition, 34% of the youths reported a family history of mental health problems.</p>

As <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1063426610396221">Table 1</xref> shows, large percentages of the youths, ranging from 31% to 73%, reported ever experiencing one or more of these issues.</p>

<title>Confirmatory Factor Analysis of the ADHD Items</title>
<p>Confirmatory factor analysis was used to assess how well a one factor model, involving each of the four ADHD items, fit the data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1063426610396221">Muthén &amp; Muthén, 1998–2010</xref>, Version 6.0). Two fit indices, the comparative fit index (CFI) and the Tucker-Lewis index (TLI), were used to evaluate model fit. The typical range for both CFI and TLI is between 0 and 1, although the TLI may achieve values slightly greater than 1, with values greater than .90 indicating acceptable fit and values greater that .95 indicating good fit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1063426610396221">Hu &amp; Bentler, 1999</xref>). Two additional indices were used to evaluate the model fit to the data: (a) the root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA; RMSEA values of .05 or less indicate close model fit, and values between .05 and .08 indicate adequate fit; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1063426610396221">Brown &amp; Cudeck, 1993</xref>) and (b) the weighted root mean square residual (WRMR) for categorical variables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1063426610396221">Yu &amp; Muthén, 2001</xref>, suggest WRMR &lt; .90 indicate good models). Results indicated a very good fit for the single factor model (χ<sup>2</sup> = 0.97[2], <italic>p</italic> = .62; CFI = 1.000, TLI = 1.038, RMSEA = .000, WRMR = .234), with respectable standardized loadings (ADHD1 = .52, ADHD2 = .63, ADHD3 = .85, ADHD4 = .74; see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1063426610396221">Table 1</xref> for the four items).</p>

<sec id="section13-1063426610396221">
<title>Youth Substance Use</title>
<p>A majority of the youths (64%) reported ever using alcohol to the point of feeling a buzz or intoxicated, and 36% indicated they had this experience five or more times in their lives. Almost all the youths indicated that they had ever used marijuana (92%), and nearly two thirds reported having used marijuana five of more times in their lives. In response to questions about their use of other drugs, 12% of the youths reported that they had ever used barbiturates, and 11% indicated they used this drug five or more times in their lives.</p>
<p>Urine test results were available for 91% of the youths. Results indicated 51% of the youths were positive for marijuana. No youth was drug positive for opiates; one youth was cocaine positive, and eight youths were positive for amphetamines (many of these youths were taking amphetamine-based ADHD medications).</p>
<p>For each drug that a youth reported using five or more times in their lives, detailed lifetime <italic>DSM-IV</italic>-based questions pertaining to substance use disorders were asked. The data indicate these diagnostic criteria were met: 16% alcohol abuse, 5% alcohol dependence, 36% cannabis abuse, 21% cannabis dependence, 6% abuse of another substance, and 2% dependence on another substance. Across the various drug types, 39% of the youths did not meet diagnostic criteria of abuse or dependence, 38% met criteria of abuse for at least one substance, and nearly a quarter of them (23%) met criteria of dependence.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1063426610396221">
<title>Self-Reported Delinquency</title>
<p>The youths’ responses to questions probing their involvement in delinquent behavior in the 12 months before their baseline interviews were used to assess their involvement in delinquent behavior. High prevalence rates were found for their involvement in index offenses (48%), crimes against persons (76%), general theft offenses (74%), and drug sales—mainly marijuana (34%). In addition, more than 9 out of 10 youths reported engaging in one or more of the 23 delinquent acts (see <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1063426610396221">Note 1</xref>).</p>
<p>The range of responses to the items composing the self-reported delinquency indices was large, ranging from no activity to hundreds (and, in a few cases, thousands). Because of non-normality, analysis of the frequency data as an interval scale was not appropriate as a measure of delinquent involvement. Instead, a log (base 10) transformation was employed so that equal intervals on the transformed scale would represent equal differences in involvement (with a raw score of −1 assigned to youths reporting 0 offenses). This evaluates the difference between no offense and one offense as equal in importance as the difference between 1 offense and 10, 10 offenses and 100, or 100 offenses and 1,000.</p>
<p>The correlation between the log transformed measure of total delinquency and the other delinquency measures was sizable and statistically significant (mean correlation = .62). Importantly, the skewness and kurtosis of the log transformed measure of total delinquency were dramatically lower than those of the untransformed measure (untransformed [skewness = 5.93, kurtosis = 41.84], transformed [skewness = −0.59, kurtosis = 0.74]). Hence, we decided to use the log transformed measure of total delinquency in our analyses.</p>

<sec id="section15-1063426610396221">
<title>Traumatic Events</title>
<p>The youths’ parents or guardians were asked to indicate if the youths or their family ever experienced various traumatic events. Large percentages of the youths and families had these experiences, with unemployment of parent (52%), divorce of parents (43%), death of a loved one (63%), serious illness (35%), victim of a violent crime (21%), eviction from house or apartment (18%), and legal problem resulting in jail or detention (27%) being noteworthy. In addition, 47% of the caretakers reported other traumatic experiences (e.g., youth being placed in foster care, not having a relationship with their father, fighting with brothers and sisters, losing the opportunity to obtain a driver’s license, separation from their mother). Overall, an average of 3.14 (<italic>SD</italic> = 1.72) traumatic events were reported. For each youth, we calculated the total number of traumatic events he or she or another family member experienced. This measure was used in our analysis.</p>

<title>Analysis Strategy</title>
<p>This study involved a latent class analysis (LCA) using Mplus Version 6.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1063426610396221">Muthén &amp; Muthén, 1998–2010</xref>). Useful in a wide range of substantive areas, LCA seeks to identify an underlying classification of entities (e.g., individuals) that are related to manifest indicators in probabilistic terms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1063426610396221">Dayton, 1998</xref>). LCA is particularly useful when studying heterogeneous populations, that is, populations “consisting of several unidentified groups that behave differently regarding the problems at hand” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1063426610396221">Hagenaars &amp; McCutcheon, 2002</xref>, p. xii). Using LCA, one can identify mutually exclusive latent classes, which account for the distributions of the observable measures within the sample (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1063426610396221">Clogg, 1981</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1063426610396221">1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1063426610396221">Hagenaars &amp; McCutcheon, 2002</xref>). The latent classes are related to manifest indicators in probabilistic terms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1063426610396221">Dayton, 1998</xref>). Our use of LCA was exploratory in nature, that is, without specification of hypotheses relating to the values of the conditional or latent class probabilities.</p>
<p>The issue of class enumeration, determining the appropriate number of latent classes for a study population, in mixture modeling remains unresolved; therefore, experts recommend using multiple criteria to aid in class enumeration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1063426610396221">Nylund, Asparouhov, &amp; Muthén, 2007</xref>). The statistical criteria used to assess the number of classes were (a) the classification table based on class probabilities for the most likely latent class membership by latent class, (b) the entropy score, (c) the Akaike information criterion (AIC), (d) the Bayesian information criterion (BIC), (e) the sample-size-adjusted BIC (saBIC), (f) the Vuong–Lo–Mendell–Rubin likelihood ratio test (LRT), (g) Lo–Mendell–Rubin adjusted likelihood ratio test (aLRT), (h) the bootstrap likelihood ratio test statistics (bLRT; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1063426610396221">Lo, Mendell, &amp; Rubin, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1063426610396221">Nylund et al., 2007</xref>), and (i) the model fit to the univariate and bivariate frequency tables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1063426610396221">Akaike, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1063426610396221">Bozdogan, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1063426610396221">Lubke &amp; Neale, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1063426610396221">Ramaswamy, DeSarbo, Reibstein, &amp; Robinson, 1993</xref>). For the classification table, high diagonal values and low off-diagonal values indicate good classification quality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1063426610396221">Muthén &amp; Muthén, 1998–2001</xref>, p. 372). Entropy values may range from 0 to 1, with values closer to 1 indicating clearer classifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1063426610396221">Muthén &amp; Muthén, 1998–2001</xref>, p. 372). For AIC, BIC, and saBIC, lower scores, those closest to zero, indicate a better fit of the model. For aLRT, a significant <italic>p</italic> value indicates that the specified model (with <italic>k</italic> classes) fits significantly better than a model enumerating one less class (<italic>k</italic>-1). The bLRT is similar to the aLRT except the distribution is estimated based on bootstrap samples. For the fit of the model to the univariate and bivariate frequency tables, smaller standardized residuals between the observed and estimated (expected) probabilities indicate a better fit. In addition, along with statistical criteria, the substantive meaningfulness of the selected latent class model is also important in deciding on the number of classes.</p>
<p>The following observed variables composed the manifest indicators that were used in the latent class analyses: continuous: (a) youth total self-reported delinquency in the prior to baseline interview (log transformed), (b) youth ADHD factor score, and (c) caretaker reported number of traumatic events experienced by the youth or family; categorical: (d) youth reported experiencing a substance abuse problem (0 = <italic>no</italic>, 1 = <italic>yes</italic>), (e) youth reported receiving services for emotional or behavioral problems (0 = <italic>no</italic>, 1 = <italic>yes</italic>), and (f) combined youth alcohol, marijuana, other drug <italic>DSM-IV</italic> substance use disorder diagnosis (0 = <italic>none</italic>, 1 = <italic>abuse only</italic>, 2 = <italic>dependence for at least one substance</italic>).</p>

<p>Bivariate model fit results also supported a two-class solution and indicated zero standardized residuals between the observed and estimated (expected) probabilities for the categorical variables in the model. Furthermore, low, and all nonsignificant, standardized residuals were found for the bivariate model fit information involving cell comparisons (not shown) for the categorical variables, indicating a respectable fit of the two-class model. In addition, the nonsignificance of the bivariate standardized residuals supports the assumption of local independence for the categorical indicators in the latent class model. Local independence is a critical assumption of the model when trying to enumerate the correct class model, as the existence of local dependencies will artifactually increase the optimum number of classes extracted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1063426610396221">Reboussin, Ip, &amp; Wolfson, 2008</xref>). For the continuous variables, the local independence assumption was tested by introducing the observed variables as a latent factor in the LCA analysis and comparing the obtained BIC from this model with the BIC from the selected two-class model. A smaller BIC for the selected two-class model was obtained, supporting the local independence of the indicators.</p>

<title>LCA Results</title>
<p>The LCA results are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1063426610396221">Table 4</xref>. The two classes identified in the data, which differ in important ways across the six variables included in the analyses, were termed (a) High Risk youths (<italic>n</italic> = 37) and (b) Lower Risk youths (<italic>n</italic> = 94). Compared to Lower Risk youths, High Risk youths report more delinquency, have higher rates of exposure to stressful or traumatic events as reported by caretakers, are more likely to report ever having a substance problem and ever receiving services for emotional or behavioral problems, and more likely to have a <italic>DSM-IV</italic> substance use diagnosis of abuse or dependence. The classification table based on an individual’s model-estimated (posterior) probabilities for most likely latent class membership indicates high main diagonal and relatively low off-diagonal values, suggesting that the model produces relatively unambiguous classifications. Importantly, an entropy value of .720, which represents a quantification of the classification uncertainty, was obtained. Furthermore, the latent class means differ significantly.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Even though our study involved a relatively small number of cases, the results were rather clear in terms of the psychosocial risk profiles of the truant youths we studied. This study was directed to (a) developing a more comprehensive understanding of the multiple problems truant youths may be experiencing and (b) identifying subgroups of truant youths who may differ in problem domains so that intervention programs can be more effectively implemented.</p>
<p>In regard to the first study objective, our data document the many psychosocial issues the study youths and their families are experiencing. In particular, sizable percentages of youths report their families have experienced substance abuse and mental health problems; and large percentages of youths report significant involvement in delinquency and substance use, and many experience symptoms of ADHD.</p>
<p>In terms of our second study objective, specific subgroups of truant youths were identified in our data, reflecting different levels of delinquency, mental health, and substance use or abuse issues. The two identified subgroups differ in important ways across the six variables included in the LCA: (a) High Risk youths (<italic>n</italic> = 37) and (b) Lower Risk youths (<italic>n</italic> = 94). Compared to Lower Risk youths, High Risk youths report more delinquency, have higher rates of exposure to stressful or traumatic events as reported by parents or guardians, and are more likely to report ever having a substance use problem, ever receiving services for emotional or behavioral problems, and having a <italic>DSM-IV</italic> substance use diagnosis of abuse or dependence. These results underscore the interrelationships among the youths’ mental health, substance use, delinquency, and stress or trauma experiences in understanding their psychosocial risk.</p>
<p>Comparisons of these two groups of youths on a variety of covariates, including their urine test results for marijuana and parent or guardian reports of their psychosocial problems, found significant differences between them that were consistent with their problem group classification. Specifically, compared to Lower Risk youth, High Risk youth were significantly more likely to be urine positive for marijuana and for their parent or guardian to report they received services for personal problems and medication for attention, behavioral, learning, or emotional problems. The association of parent or guardian reported youth or family stress or trauma experiences with the truant youths’ other risk-level factors highlights the need to incorporate routine assessment of these stressful events to obtain a more comprehensive picture of the youths’ psychosocial profile and service needs.</p>
<p>The interrelated problems uncovered among the High Risk youths in our study are consistent with the PBS concept, discussed in the introduction section. It would be important to replicate our study among comparable samples of truant youth to assess the external validity of our findings.</p>
<p>Our results also point to a number of intervention and service delivery needs among the youths we studied. First, there appear to be emotional and environmental consequences for the overwhelming majority of these youths residing in the absence of at least one biological parent. Adapting to the absence of that parent, whatever the degree or cause, may influence ego strength, character, and general outlook on life. Environmental consequences of this indicator may include financial and residential instability. Access to physical and mental health care, dependable provision of food and clothing, and resiliency from setbacks in general may be impeded. Furthermore, 57% of the truant youth indicated that a family member ever had a substance abuse problem, and 34% reported a family history of mental health problems. Our results suggest that these troubling family situations should be addressed and remediated in comprehensive intervention services.</p>
<p>Our study has provided an informed understanding of truant youths and their families. Although at first blush the in-depth assessments we completed might seem more appropriate for more seriously troubled, delinquent youths, sound assessment is indispensable for truant youth to best allocate intervention services based on their psychosocial needs.</p>
<p>Our findings also suggest that much remains to be done to strengthen school truancy efforts. In this vein, the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1063426610396221">Colorado Foundation for Families and Children’s (2007)</xref> review of promising truancy reduction programs is instructive. They reported several critical elements necessary for effective programming: (a) parent or guardian involvement; (b) a continuum of services, to include meaningful incentives, consequences, and support; (c) collaboration with community resources, including law enforcement, mental health services, mentoring, and social services; (d) school administrative support and commitment to keeping youth in the educational mainstream; and (e) ongoing evaluation. Few of the many programs reviewed by the foundation met these criteria. Of particular concern was the general, serious lack of detailed information on program implementation and system issues experienced by truancy reduction programs as well as process and outcome evaluations that could inform the field. Most evaluations of truancy programs were found to be based on aggregate data, often lacked meaningful comparison groups, and focused on short-term benefits (e.g., reduction in unexcused absences; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1063426610396221">Mueller, Giacomazzi, &amp; Stoddard, 2006</xref>), which do not provide meaningful information on changes in individual’s school attendance or academic school performance (OJJDP, 2001). This situation needs to improve if the field is to move forward.</p>
<p>The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1063426610396221">National Center for School Engagement (2007)</xref> completed an evaluation of seven OJJDP-funded truancy demonstration projects. Several lessons learned in its program evaluation work are instructive: (a) there is a need for truancy services to become part of existing student support services, which fosters greater acceptance and impact; (b) early intervention pays off, especially if it involves home visits and outreach to parents of children with few unexcused absences; and (c) there is an importance for community organizations to join schools to improve school attendance. Community-based mental health providers could establish effective, collaborative relationships with schools in helping identify the psychosocial issues experienced by truanty youth and involving such youth in needed intervention services.</p>
<p>Our analysis strategy involved a rather novel use of LCA. The use of LCA to identify subgroups of youths involved in various community service programs, who reflect different constellations of psychosocial problems, can be useful to program administrative and clinical staff. First, such analyses can provide some evidence that the agency or program is serving its intended target population. Second, subgroups of youths reflecting different constellations of psychosocial problems can lead to more informed referrals or treatment placement. For example, youths who exhibit lower risk will likely not require intensive mental health or substance abuse services, as will be the case for high risk youths. Related research indicates that providing intensive intervention services to low-risk persons may, in fact, increase problem behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1063426610396221">Lovins, Lowenkamp, &amp; Latessa, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1063426610396221">Lowenkamp, Latessa, &amp; Holsinger, 2006</xref>). (It is appreciated that the youth subgroups identified by LCA are statistical constructs, rather than actual youths. Hence, the results of LCA should be interpreted with this understanding.)</p>
<p>There are several limitations to our study. First, the study involved a relatively small number of cases. This situation, together with the distribution of cases across the levels of the categorical variables in the data we analyzed, precluded illumination of additional subgroups that might exist. We plan to replicate these analyses with a larger number of cases in this ongoing study to address this issue. Second, there is a need to replicate our findings with truant youth in other jurisdictions, who differ in their sociodemographic characteristics. Third, our results are based on cross-sectional information collected from baseline interviews, which prevent discussion of the longitudinal relationships among the youths’ psychosocial problems. We are planning to conduct and report the results of such longitudinal analyses in future manuscripts produced from this ongoing, prospective study.</p>
<p>Truancy represents a growing epidemic in academic settings across the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1063426610396221">Fantuzzo, Grim, &amp; Hazan, 2005</xref>). Unfortunately, efforts to address truant behavior are all too often sanction and procedure oriented, with truant youths being treated as disciplinary and management problems. Interventions that do not target the root causes of such behavior fail to address the problems that can lead many seriously truant youth to move into the juvenile justice system. However, as described earlier, some truancy programs have started to move away from one-dimensional strategies and, instead, involve more collaborative and holistic approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1063426610396221">Dembo &amp; Gulledge, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>At the same time, the thrust of our findings is clear. An urgent need exists to direct resources to strengthen service delivery to truant youth and their families. Intervention services are necessary to reduce the flow of truant youth reflecting these problems into the justice system. Directing resources to truant youth is far less costly and has greater potential for redirecting troubled lives in more prosocial directions than having these youths develop more serious, troubled behavior problems with their resulting, adverse consequences.</p>
