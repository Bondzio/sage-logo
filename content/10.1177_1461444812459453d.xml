<p>In China, the transformation from a planned economy to a market-driven economic system has led to the emergence of Internet-made information, content, products and services as they are increasingly available and affordable to most Chinese consumers who now enjoy a greater disposable income. All of this facilitates China’s creative industry, which is increasingly crucial to economic growth in a digital age. Lucy Montgomery’s <italic>China’s Creative Industries</italic> is dedicated to exploring the challenges and opportunities encountered by China’s cultural industry in a digital era, and how and why value is created in three typical creative industries: film, music and fashion. She does this by analyzing the Chinese cultural industry’s dynamic contexts, the state’s power, intellectual property, entrepreneurial consumers, and business models from many social, cultural, political and economic perspectives. Montgomery aims to paint a clear and comprehensive picture for China’s creative industry.</p>
<p>The first chapter gives an outline of the creative industry in China. Montgomery analyzes the relationship and interaction among the state, consumers and commercial actors in China’s creative sector to explore changes in governance in the industry as it relates to the state and to entrepreneurial consumers. Simultaneously, Montgomery discusses a rapid extension of unauthorized distribution networks in China and the role of intellectual property. The second chapter introduces the development of intellectual property laws in China. In a digital age, in order to participate in global trade and encourage foreign investment and technical innovation, China has had to adopt stricter copyright laws that meet international standards. However, with transformative technological advancement and the spread of mass reproduction skills, copyright is almost impossible to protect in China. This causes a complex social context for the creative industry. In general, the creative industry in China has not only characteristics common to other nations’ creative industries, such as the dynamics of the creative industries and diverse sources, but also many distinctive features, such as an environment with a great deal of unauthorized production and distribution networks, cultural policies, and economic goals. Three different creative industries are concretely explored in the subsequent chapters.</p>
<p>Chapter 3 focuses on China’s film industry, which has been commercialized and reformed since the early 1990s. Private investment has been encouraged to operate in a market-driven system, and this spurs development. Despite this, Montgomery argues that the Chinese government is still authoritarian and refers to films as pedagogical and ideological tools to encourage and propagandize the political sphere, morality and patriotism. However, due to the strict Chinese Censorship, pirate DVDs and online cinema that adhere to commercial imperatives can be widely distributed. In addition, with technological growth, an increasing number of non-professional Chinese can become entrepreneurial and engage in film-making and distribution. Finally, in terms of intellectual property, China’s film copyright is neglected under communism (p. 54). This contradicts the state’s cultural policies, which state that individuals or businesses have a right to produce or distribute films. Chapter 4 probes into the growth of China’s music industry, which has a higher level of autonomy and freedom in terms of its content and circulation than the film industry. For all that, China’s government still restricts the content of heterodox music, which makes it difficult to publish foreign music and limits foreign investments but, to a certain extent, these cultural policies create an advantageous environment for the domestic music industry. With the proliferation of digital technologies, the dissemination of music via virtual distribution networks has exceeded that of traditional media. Weak preservation in intellectual property causes record labels great economic losses. In order to address this, a lucrative market has been created, which results in two telecommunication operators controlling the mass distribution channels of music, and mobile networks have a main source of revenue in the music industry. Chapter 5 shows how there has been a considerable transformation in China’s fashion industry in the last 30 years. Montgomery argues that compared to film and music, the state provides the fashion industry with a positive environment, and more freedom of creativity for industrialized fashion systems. Moreover, Montgomery also indicates trademarks instead of copyright play an essential role in assisting entrepreneurial consumers who are eager to enhance their own social goals, identity and status, which flourish in the contemporary world of fashion in China.</p>
<p>In the sixth chapter, Montgomery strikes a counter-intuitive note, as she describes how intellectual property preservation cannot be considered as a prerequisite for the advance of creative industries in China, and even a weak copyright enforcement benefits China’s creative industries. Indeed, intellectual property protection allows investors to recoup their costs, but overemphasis on copyright might cause intellectual monopoly. Finally, the last chapter applies the evolutionary economist Eric Beinhocker’s theory (p. 110) to conclude that the cause of the flourishing of China’s creative industries is that such growth has interacted with the development of hard technologies, and the evolution of social technologies and transformation of business models.</p>
<p>This book systemically explores the growth of China’s cultural industries. Montgomery analyzes some transformations in the creative industry in a digital age, such as business models, censorship and intellectual property, drawing on interviews with Chinese professionals in the creative industry. Although consumer demand for creative products is also discussed, the methodology has its weaknesses: the attitudes of ordinary Chinese towards copyright and culture as well as their impacts on cultural policies are ignored. In addition, Chapters 6 and 7 explore the significance and influence of intellectual property on the creative industry in economic terms, but other perspectives (legal, social, moral, humanist) are almost neglected, though they are exceedingly important to understand comprehensively the relationship between China’s creative industry and copyright. All in all, the book brings thought-provoking insights into the economics, innovation, techniques and markets of China’s cultural industry by probing into new technologies, globalization and higher levels of interplay between producers and consumers as they greatly contribute to the studies of China’ digital culture and provides a detailed background to study China’s creative industries with different views. The insightful book is a worthy read for those who study cultural sociology, cultural consumption, intellectual property, business models, digital media and those who are interested in China’s creative industry.</p>
