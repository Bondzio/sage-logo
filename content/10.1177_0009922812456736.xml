<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Fever is common in neutropenic children and is often a sign of infection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0009922812456736">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0009922812456736">2</xref></sup> Although the spectrum of pathogens is large, it is crucial to consider a bacterial etiology because of associated morbidity and mortality.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0009922812456736">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0009922812456736">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0009922812456736">4</xref></sup> Thus, empirical broad-spectrum antibiotics initiated at the onset of fever have been shown to improve patient survival dramatically. Routine blood cultures for bacterial and fungal pathogens result in a microbiological diagnosis in 10% to 30% of children with febrile neutropenia. However, the most common diagnosis among these patients is fever of unknown origin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0009922812456736">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0009922812456736">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0009922812456736"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0009922812456736">6</xref></sup> Management of neutropenic children with this diagnosis becomes a challenge when the fever persists despite the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics because of the concern for an underlying infection that may be resistant to the empirical antimicrobial choice.</p>
<p>Respiratory viruses are frequent causes of febrile illnesses in healthy children yet are not routinely considered as a potential source of fever in hospitalized neutropenic patients, particularly in the absence of obvious respiratory symptoms. Yet up to a quarter of children with cancer develop respiratory virus infections while in treatment,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0009922812456736">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0009922812456736"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0009922812456736"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0009922812456736">10</xref></sup> and respiratory viruses are detected in one third of adult bone marrow transplant patients hospitalized with a febrile illness.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0009922812456736">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0009922812456736">11</xref></sup> Using conventional virus detection methods, a respiratory virus can be identified in only 11% to 25% of children with febrile neutropenia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0009922812456736">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0009922812456736">13</xref></sup> With the development of multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and related, more sensitive nucleic acid–based viral diagnostic tests, virus detection is more straightforward. We present here the results of a 3-year prospective study aimed at determining the frequency with which respiratory viruses can be detected in children hospitalized with febrile neutropenia, using a nucleic acid amplification assay (xTAG RVP panel, Luminex Corp, Austin, TX) with the capacity to detect 16 independent respiratory viruses.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>Children younger than 19 years of age who were hospitalized with febrile neutropenia at Golisano Children’s Hospital in Syracuse, New York, between October 2008 and October 2011 were eligible for enrollment in this study. Neutropenia was defined as an absolute neutrophil count less than 500/mm<sup>3</sup>. Fever was defined as oral temperature &gt;38.3°C (101°F), or a sustained temperature &gt;38°C (100.4°F) for more than 1 hour. Signed informed consent was obtained. If not performed by the primary clinical team, a nasopharyngeal swab specimen was collected by the research team for respiratory viral diagnostic evaluation. The institutional review board (IRB) approved this study (IRB 263481-1).</p>
<p>Demographic and clinical data were collected from hospital records, including information on age, gender, underlying medical condition, clinical symptoms, physical exam findings, diagnostic culture results, prophylactic antibiotic regimen, empirical antibiotic therapy, length of antibiotic therapy, and length of hospital stay. Patients with a documented bacterial infection were excluded from this study.</p>
<p>Nasopharyngeal swab specimens were evaluated using the PCR-based xTAG RVP panel (Luminex Corp) that is designed to detect 16 respiratory viruses, including respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) A and B; influenza A and B; parainfluenza 1, 2, 3, and 4; human metapneumovirus; rhinovirus/enterovirus; adenovirus; and coronaviruses NL63, 229E, OC43, and HKU1. All nasopharyngeal specimens collected by the research team were stored at −80°C and evaluated together after enrollment was completed. If there were skin or oral lesions present, an independent PCR analysis for the detection of herpes simplex virus was also performed.</p>
<p>As regards statistical analyses, clinical characteristics were compared using the Student’s <italic>t</italic> test and Fisher’s exact tests.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>There were a total of 50 febrile neutropenic episodes among 42 patients included in this study. The median age at enrollment was 6 years; 28 (67%) were boys. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0009922812456736">Table 1</xref> describes the demographics of the patient population enrolled. The etiology of the neutropenia included both oncological (treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukemia [ALL], acute myeloid leukemia, Ewing’s sarcoma, lymphoma, osteosarcoma, medulloblastoma, primitive neurectodermal tumor, Wilm’s tumor, and neuroblastoma) and hematological diagnoses (aplastic anemia, dyskeratosis congenita, and Fanconi anemia).</p>

<p>In all, 45 (90%) of the patients enrolled were receiving prophylactic antimicrobials prior to hospitalization for febrile neutropenia: 35 (70%) were taking sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, 8 (16%) pentamadine, 2 (4%) ciprofloxacin, and 4 (8%) voriconazole. Piperacillin/tazobactam was the most common antibiotic administered at the time of hospitalization (42 episodes, 84%). Three patients (6%) received a carbapenem, whereas 4 patients (8%) received an advanced-generation cephalosporin. Vancomycin was added to the initial empirical antibiotic regimen in 12 (24%) episodes. The average duration of antibiotic use during hospitalization was 4.6 days. The average length of hospital stay was 6.1 days.</p>
<p>Viral nucleic acids were detected in 26 (52%) febrile episodes, including 23 of the 46 episodes in oncology patients and 3 of the 4 episodes in patients with primary hematological diagnoses. The virus detected most frequently was rhinovirus/enterovirus. Multiple viruses were detected in 4 (8%) of the febrile neutropenic episodes (2 instances in which 2 viruses were detected, 1 with 3 viruses, and 1 with 4 viruses). Herpes simplex virus was detected by an independent PCR assay in an oral lesion of 1 patient. Of note, 15 patients had repeat respiratory virus testing at subsequent hospitalizations for new febrile neutropenic episodes. None of these patients had the same virus detected from repeat diagnostic evaluations, a finding consistent with the notion that virus detected in the nasopharynx is present de novo rather than as persistent shedding in an immunocompromised patient.</p>
<p>There were 25 febrile neutropenic patients who presented with respiratory symptoms, including rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, and cough. Of these patients, 18 had a respiratory virus detected on diagnostic evaluation. Of the 29 febrile neutropenic episodes in patients without respiratory symptoms, only 8 had respiratory virus detected. Thus, patients with respiratory symptoms were more likely to have a virus detected on diagnostic evaluation than those without respiratory symptoms (<italic>P</italic> = .008).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we detected viruses in nasopharyngeal samples from 52% of children hospitalized with febrile neutropenia with negative bacterial cultures, with the most common virus being rhinovirus/enterovirus. Detection of more than 1 virus from the same patient sample occurred in 8%. Patients with respiratory symptoms, such as rhinorrhea and cough, were more likely to have a virus detected on evaluation, and virus detection had no impact on length of hospital stay or antibiotic use.</p>
<p>Most studies investigating the etiology of febrile neutropenia in children focus on bacterial organisms. There are, however, reports describing the contribution of respiratory viruses to these illnesses. Mottonen and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0009922812456736">9</xref></sup> showed that children with ALL had more viral infections than healthy controls but that these patients ultimately recovered from infection. Likewise, El-Mahallawy and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0009922812456736">11</xref></sup> found that 13 of 30 cancer patients with lower–respiratory tract symptoms had serological evidence of a respiratory virus infection. In a retrospective chart review over a 15-year period, Mendoza-Sanchez and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0009922812456736">8</xref></sup> showed that 12% of febrile children receiving anticancer therapy had a documented infection with a respiratory virus. Using virus antigen detection and virus culture, Arola and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0009922812456736">7</xref></sup> prospectively identified a respiratory virus in 37% of febrile cancer patients, whereas Koskenvuo and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0009922812456736">14</xref></sup> presented data showing that 44% of patients in a similar cohort had evidence of a respiratory virus infection.</p>
<p>With the development of PCR technology, the frequency of virus detection has increased. Lindblom and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0009922812456736">12</xref></sup> prospectively compared the use of conventional virus diagnostics and PCR targeting nasopharyngeal aspirates from children with febrile neutropenia. The virus detection rate from these aspirates increased from 11% to 33% of all enrolled patients. If one excludes patients with documented bacterial infection, 43% of febrile neutropenic children had a respiratory virus identified, results that are similar to the rate of virus detection shown in this study.</p>
<p>Similar to the aforementioned studies, we found that human rhinovirus/enterovirus were the most commonly identified respiratory viruses from the nasopharynx of febrile neutropenic children.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0009922812456736">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0009922812456736">14</xref></sup> Although immunocompromised patients are at risk for severe viral infections, as has been seen with influenza, RSV, and human metapneumovirus,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0009922812456736">15</xref></sup> the patients in our study recovered effectively without complications.</p>
<p>One limitation of this and any study that uses nucleic acid–based methods is that detection of virus by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) provides an association and does not definitively identify the virus as the cause of the current febrile neutropenic episode. Immunocompromised patients are known to have prolonged shedding of infectious virus, particularly with rhinovirus/enterovirus, RSV, and influenza A.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0009922812456736">12</xref></sup> However, the clinical symptoms of the patients in this study were consistent with infections caused by the specific viruses detected by the PCR-based method, and as noted in the Results section, no patient was found to have the same virus during subsequent hospitalizations, suggesting that they represent acute infections. Another limitation of this work is the exclusion of febrile neutropenic children with diagnosed bacterial infections; as such, we cannot comment on the frequency of bacteria virus codetection.</p>
<p>In summary, we have detected respiratory viruses in nasopharyngeal samples from more than half of febrile neutropenic children with negative bacterial cultures, admitted to Golisano Children’s Hospital in Syracuse, New York, over a 3-year period, using sensitive RT-PCR diagnostic methods. Although detection of a respiratory virus in a febrile neutropenic child cannot influence empirical antimicrobial therapy at this point in time, studies such as these provide impetus to examine the causal relationship between virus infection and the etiology of the febrile response. Ultimately, findings such as these may provide for more selective use and/or earlier discontinuation of antimicrobials.</p>
