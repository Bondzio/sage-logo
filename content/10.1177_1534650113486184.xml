<abstract>
<p>Eating disorders have proved resistant to therapy with high relapse rates. Enhanced cognitive behavior therapy (CBT-E) is the favored treatment of choice but has been criticized for placing a similar emphasis on controlling eating behavior as the psychopathology it seeks to counter. In contrast, narrative therapy focuses on the development of an anti-eating disorder lifestyle and values. Evidence for this approach primarily consists of informal case study material. This case study describes a 28-year-old woman with a recurring history of anorexia nervosa, who self-referred to a university psychology clinic, due to fears of imminent relapse. The client received 10 sessions of narrative therapy and made significant progress in externalizing her eating disorder, in lessening her adherence to the ascetic values underpinning it, and in developing/expressing her non-eating disorder character and values. This case study provides evidence of the potential effectiveness of narrative therapy and contains valuable learning for clinicians regarding its implementation.</p>

<title>1 Theoretical and Research Basis for Treatment</title>
<p>The <italic>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</italic> (4th ed., text rev.; <italic>DSM-IV-TR</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1534650113486184">American Psychiatric Association [APA], 2000</xref>) lists two specific diagnoses of eating disorder: anorexia nervosa (AN) and bulimia nervosa (BN). <italic>DSM-IV-TR</italic> also includes a residual diagnosis of eating disorders not otherwise specified (EDNOS) to capture those individuals who meet most but not all of the criteria for a specific AN or BN diagnosis. Examples include individuals who meet all the criteria for AN other than sufficiently low weight or, in postmenarcheal females, the cessation of menses; individuals who satisfy the criteria for BN but with lower than the required frequencies; and individuals with binge-eating disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1534650113486184">APA, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Eating disorders are predominantly associated with women in Western industrialized countries, where there is a strong cultural emphasis on thinness as the feminine ideal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1534650113486184">Nasser &amp; Katzman, 2003</xref>). At least 9 out of 10 patients presenting with AN and BN are females. Even in these populations, lifetime prevalence rates are low: <italic>DSM-IV-TR</italic> reports current rates of approximately 0.5% for AN and 1% to 3% for BN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1534650113486184">APA, 2000</xref>). However, it is estimated that as many as 50% to 60% of adult eating disorder outpatients fall into the EDNOS category (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1534650113486184">Fairburn, 2008</xref>). Substantially greater prevalence rates have been reported among certain specialized populations. Among female college students, estimates of current prevalence for all forms of eating disorder range from 8% to 17% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1534650113486184">Eisenberg, Nicklett, Roeder, &amp; Kirz, 2011</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1534650113486184">Eisenberg et al. (2011)</xref> themselves found that in a random sample of women students, 14% of undergraduates and 9% of graduates recorded positive screens for an eating disorder using the SCOFF screening instrument developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1534650113486184">J. F. Morgan, Reid, and Lacey (1999)</xref>. It consists of five questions, which provide the basis of the SCOFF acronym. Questions are about making oneself <bold>S</bold>ick due to feeling uncomfortably full, the loss of <bold>C</bold>ontrol over eating, the loss of more than <bold>O</bold>ne stone over a 3-month period, believing one is <bold>F</bold>at despite other’s contrary statements, and feeling that <bold>F</bold>ood dominates one’s life.</p>
<p>Currently, the prognosis for eating disorders is quite poor. In some cases of AN, particularly those associated with early onset, a single episode is followed by a full recovery. In most instances, however, the course of these disorders is either chronic or follows a fluctuating pattern between (partial) remission and relapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1534650113486184">APA, 2000</xref>). AN carries a mortality rate of at least 10%, which is one of the highest of all mental disorders. Between a quarter and a third of these deaths are attributable to suicide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1534650113486184">Harris &amp; Barraclough, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1534650113486184">Maj, Halmi, Lopez-Ibor, &amp; Sartorius, 2003</xref>), whereas the rest are due to the physical consequences of starvation and malnutrition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1534650113486184">Keel et al., 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>The evidence base for eating disorder treatments in adults is somewhat lacking, being primarily related to the use of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) to treat BN. CBT is more effective than antidepressant medication, nonspecific psychotherapy, and pure behavior therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1534650113486184">Wilson &amp; Fairburn, 2007</xref>). Interpersonal therapy (IPT) has been found to be equally effective over the long term but CBT remains the treatment of choice because it is faster acting and has a wider evidence base (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1534650113486184">Wilson &amp; Fairburn, 2007</xref>). For adults with AN, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1534650113486184">Wilson and Fairburn (2007)</xref> argue that the research is inadequate to support an evidence-based recommendation. Nevertheless, they report that arguments for there being a common pathology transcending all eating disorders have led to CBT being regarded as the adult treatment of choice. Research into the treatment of patients with EDNOS has focused almost exclusively on that subset of patients with binge-eating disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1534650113486184">Wilson &amp; Fairburn, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>More recently, an enhanced and more flexible form of the treatment (enhanced cognitive behavior therapy [CBT-E]) has been developed. CBT-E operates through the construction of a personalized formulation that identifies those factors responsible for the development and maintenance of the eating disorder. While the core CBT-based treatment is designed to address common eating disorder pathology, a variety of optional modules exist to treat other mechanisms (such as perfectionism), which help sustain the disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1534650113486184">Fairburn, Cooper, Shafran, Bohn, &amp; Hawker, 2008</xref>). In addition to improved results in treating BN, CBT-E has also been shown to be effective in treating patients with EDNOS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1534650113486184">Fairburn et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Even with these favored treatments, outcomes are at best moderate. For example, with CBT and IPT, only approximately 40% of BN patients have ceased binge eating and purging 12 months after treatment cessation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1534650113486184">Wilson &amp; Fairburn, 2007</xref>). Twelve years post treatment, approximately 33% of patients with BN and 21% to 27% of patients with AN still qualify for an eating disorder diagnosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1534650113486184">Berkman, Lohr, &amp; Bulik, 2007</xref>). Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1534650113486184">Von Holle et al. (2008)</xref> found that, 10 years post treatment, only 10% to 11% of AN and BN patients were completely symptom-free. One criticism of treatments for eating disorders is that the majority place a similar emphasis on the importance of weight and of controlling eating behavior as the psychopathology they are designed to counter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1534650113486184">Maisel, Epston, &amp; Borden, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>In contrast, narrative therapy focuses on externalizing the eating disorder and exposing its tactics, while encouraging the development of an anti-eating disorder lifestyle and values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1534650113486184">Maisel et al., 2004</xref>). Externalization involves viewing the eating disorder as an entity whose existence is quite distinct from the sufferer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1534650113486184">A. Morgan, 2000</xref>). “The problem becomes the problem, not the person” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1534650113486184">White, 2007</xref>, p. 9). Therapy then focuses on deconstructing the dominant narrative that is maintaining the eating disorder’s hold on the individual: the goal being to replace this story with a richer alternate or preferred narrative based on those values and ambitions that have been subjugated by the eating disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1534650113486184">A. Morgan, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Evidence in support of this approach is primarily limited to informal case study material in which clients describe changes in attitude toward their eating disorder, and in their ability to resist its influence (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1534650113486184">Epston, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1534650113486184">Maisel et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1534650113486184">Nylund, 2002</xref>). However, a recent small-scale study on the use of narrative therapy in a group context, with women who identified themselves as having long-term problems with eating disorders (between 5 and 23 years) and comorbid depression, demonstrated reductions in levels of depression and eating disorder risk as measured by the Eating Disorder Inventory–3 (EDI-3; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1534650113486184">Weber, Davis, &amp; McPhie, 2006</xref>).</p>

<title>2 Case Introduction</title>
<p>The client, “Victoria” (all identifying details have been removed), was a 28-year-old Caucasian female who self-referred to a rural university psychology clinic for treatment due to concern regarding her ability to manage her thoughts and behaviors concerning eating. Victoria was short in stature, dressed conservatively, and spoke somewhat timidly of her problems. She admitted to having experienced several quite severe episodes of AN in the past. She said that while she now knew what was required to eat healthily, she was again finding eating extremely difficult and feared another relapse was imminent. She was particularly concerned that her difficulties in eating made it hard for her to concentrate on her work, where, as a child care worker, she had children in her care who were dependent on her. Victoria also reported experiencing a high degree of work stress, having employment with a number of child care organizations, while also pursuing her studies for a master’s degree in social work. She lived with her partner, who worked in accounting.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1534650113486184">
<title>3 Presenting Complaints</title>
<p>Victoria directly connected her current difficulties with eating with a series of distressing events at work, in which she had been publicly criticized by her employers. “I fall out of the routine of eating when I get distressed—when life feels out of control.” At such times, eating became physically difficult: “My stomach doesn’t feel hungry and if I try to eat, I feel nauseous. Just the texture of some foods becomes impossible to stomach.” Meanwhile, her internal eating disorder voice would question her need for food: “My thoughts are that I don’t need this, that my work should take priority and I can eat later.” Despite recognizing that eating regularly was essential to maintain concentration at work, Victoria reported that she had started to skip meals, which she recognized as a particularly dangerous sign for her relapsing.</p>
<p>Victoria’s body mass index (BMI; weight in kg / [height in meters]<sup>2</sup>) on presentation was calculated as falling between 21.5 and 22.5, confirming she was in the healthy weight category (BMI between 20 and 25). Victoria was acutely conscious that this weight was well above anorexic levels, which by general consensus are taken as a BMI of below 17.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1534650113486184">Wilson &amp; Fairburn, 2007</xref>), and was concerned that her condition would not be viewed as serious. She, herself, however, recognized that eating was becoming more and more effortful, and was weary of the extent to which thoughts about eating dominated her attention and intruded on her work and social life: “I feel shut off from what’s going on; my head is full of worries about food.”</p>
<p>At the same time, Victoria admitted to being fearful of what life would be like without her eating disorder. She spoke of the loss of her eating disorder as leaving a “void” that she doubted her ability to fill. In particular, she was afraid of being unable to cope with distress without her eating disorder being there to comfort her and restore her sense of control.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1534650113486184">
<title>4 History</title>
<p>Victoria reported having been born with hydrocephalus: a build up of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) inside the brain that leads to brain swelling. She subsequently had a shunt placed in her brain to re-route the flow of CSF to the stomach where it can be absorbed. On occasion, further surgeries are required to unblock or replace the shunt.</p>
<p>Hydrocephalus is commonly associated with intellectual, physical and neurological difficulties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1534650113486184">NINDS, 2008</xref>). The advice given to Victoria’s parents by the treating healthcare professionals is unknown, but Victoria’s perception was that her parents had always assumed her to be permanently incapable of looking after herself. Her experience was that, despite all her achievements, her parents still viewed and treated her as “a retard.” She reported that, as a child she was taught “to expect little for myself” and encouraged “to aim lower.” She felt that her parents were constantly trying to undermine her achievements and her abilities. As such, she came to learn to keep a low profile, as being noticed only produced painful criticism. Further, Victoria came to believe that she was “less deserving than other people,” a feeling that she still found great difficulty combating.</p>
<p>Victoria reported that her problems with eating became apparent between 16 and 17 years of age. She reported that she had been losing weight gradually when major surgery to replace her shunt resulted in a further loss of 5kg in 5 days. She continued to lose weight until the cessation of menses and her losing consciousness after a blood test brought her eating problems to the attention of her general practitioner (GP). Her weight was then 34kg (her height is 152.5cm, meaning her BMI was approximately 14.5).</p>
<p>Despite her weight loss, Victoria said she did not regard herself as having AN, because she was not concerned about her body image. “I felt I knew what anorexia was and it didn’t fit me.” However, she reported becoming “fascinated with the feeling of her bones and the angles of her body.” She found comfort in the idea of taking up less space, which not only equated with being less likely to be noticed but also with her perception of herself as being less deserving. In addition, eating was one of the few areas in which Victoria was permitted a degree of autonomy. Not eating was a rare opportunity to exercise control and prove her self-efficacy.</p>
<p>Following the initial diagnosis of AN, Victoria reported she was referred to a nutritionist and for a period she became equally obsessive about eating healthily. Once she had moved into college when starting to attend university (at age 17), she admitted that she again cut back on her eating with the result that she collapsed at an intercollege swimming carnival. She reported that on that occasion, her friends facilitated her recovery by closely monitoring her eating. Victoria further reported that, since that time, her weight had dropped alarmingly on a number of occasions. Usually she had managed to redress this problem by reminding herself of the importance of regular and healthy achievements to maintaining concentration on study and work. However, on occasions, she admitted she had relied on the encouragement and support of friends to ensure she ate healthily. She ascribed the most recent onset to stress connected with her work in child care.</p>

<title>5 Assessment</title>
<p>The EDI-3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1534650113486184">Garner, 2004</xref>) was used as an adjunct to the information gained at the assessment clinical interview. Results are detailed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1534650113486184">Table 1</xref>. Victoria’s score on the primary Eating Disorder Risk Scale incorporating Drive for Thinness, Bulimia, and Body Dissatisfaction subscales was in the low clinical range, placing her at the 11th percentile against international norms for women with EDNOS. Scores in this range can indicate an “atypical eating disorder” which is not driven by cultural ideals of body shape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1534650113486184">Garner, 2004</xref>, p. 54). In Victoria’s case, her low score on the Drive for Thinness subscale (21st percentile) was also viewed as confirmation that her eating disorder had not yet resumed control of her thoughts and actions.</p>

</table-wrap-foot>
</table-wrap>
<p>However, the EDI-3 also produces scores on five psychological composite scales strongly related to eating disorders. Victoria’s score on the Overcontrol composite was in the elevated clinical range, placing her at the 90th percentile of the EDNOS sample. The Overcontrol composite consists of items evaluating Perfectionism (72nd percentile) and Asceticism (96th percentile). Asceticism involves spiritual ideals such as self-sacrifice, self-denial, and self-restraint, whereby thinness is associated with virtue, and restricting food intake represents penance and purification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1534650113486184">Garner, 2004</xref>). Victoria’s scores on all other psychological composites were relatively low, the most elevated being Interpersonal Insecurity (31-st percentile) and Low Self-Esteem (25th percentile: see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1534650113486184">Table 1</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1534650113486184">
<title>6 Case Conceptualization</title>
<p>Victoria’s case was particularly interesting in that her desire for thinness was not related to cultural ideals concerning the female body. Rather it derived from her parents’ invalidating behavior and messages in childhood, which had led her to equate being noticed with criticism and pain, and instilled an engrained sense of being less deserving than others.</p>
<p>Victoria’s difficulty in overcoming this idea that she was less deserving occurred in sharp contrast to her rejection of her parents’ beliefs and values in other areas. She spoke of them with quite a degree of resentment and contempt, describing them as “sad, unhappy people who lean on me for emotional support while trying to undermine everything I’ve got.” In particular, Victoria was driven by a strong determination to prove to herself that her parents were wrong in their dismissal of her abilities: “I’ve always pushed myself to be the best because no one expected it of me.” Victoria’s difficulties were conceptualized as emanating from the conflict inherent in the demand for achievements that demonstrated she could overcome her “disability,” while fearing to be noticed or thought to be valuing herself too highly.</p>
<p>Evidence for this conceptualization was provided by Victoria’s chosen career as a carer, which enabled achievements to be portrayed as directed toward the service of others. Also revealing was a conversation during treatment in which Victoria’s desire to be the best she could be was explicitly paired with the desire to be invisible. Victoria said she liked to think of herself as a stagehand, making things work behind the scenes: “praise makes me feel out of place: it’s really uncomfortable.”</p>
<p>This conflict provided extremely fertile ground for the development of an eating disorder. As detailed above, loss of weight provided considerable comfort to Victoria, as being thinner was not only equated with being less likely to attract attention but also with occupying less space, which had come to symbolize her acceptance of deserving less.</p>
<p>In addition, Victoria revealed that both her parents were considerably overweight and that she found it hard not to regard such lack of self-control with a degree of disgust, as expressed in the following extract from a poem, shared with us during therapy:
<disp-quote>
<p>Tear the flesh, drain the blood</p>
<p>The heart,</p>
<p>Everything that needs too much,</p>
<p>It’s all a stupid game</p>
<p>Of greed</p>
<p>And want.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Restricting eating was an area in which Victoria could escape her parents’ control and express her autonomy in achieving something which they could not: exposing their double standards and demonstrating that in this area at least she could claim superiority. To Victoria’s frustration, her parents failed to recognize this as a conscious effort: “They refuse to accept I have an eating disorder, they just think I forget to eat.”</p>
<p>When things were going well, Victoria could accept the importance of eating regularly to maintaining the concentration and focus necessary to look after the children in her care. However, her desire to rise above her “disability” left her acutely sensitive to any form of criticism. When things went wrong, her eating disorder voice was quick to chide her for getting above herself. “He sees all the bad in any situation. Anything less than perfection he tells me is weakness.” Moreover, the tone of such criticism could be vicious, as revealed in another of Victoria’s poems:
<disp-quote>
<p>Today you tore</p>
<p>Me apart;</p>
<p>Your nails, the sharpness</p>
<p>Of your voice; Your anger,</p>
<p>Hatred of who</p>
<p>I am.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>At these times, Victoria craved the security that feelings of hunger brought her. The voice would also insist that her work had to take precedence over eating and that she neither needed nor deserved food. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1534650113486184">Figure 1</xref> shows another extract from Victoria’s poems, which expresses how essential hunger and her eating disorder’s presence had become to her coping mechanisms. The case formulation of Victoria’s eating disorder is detailed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1534650113486184">Figure 2</xref>.</p>

</fig>
<p>Victoria’s body weight meant that she no longer qualified for an AN diagnosis. In addition, the extent to which Victoria satisfied the third AN criteria was questionable. She evidenced no disturbance in perception of body shape and did not deny the seriousness of a low body weight. Moreover, thinness and abstention did not so much enhance her perceptions of self-worth, but rather lessened her fears of being noticed and criticized. However, Victoria’s difficulties in maintaining healthy eating behaviors, the constant intrusion of thoughts about eating, and her fear of what life might be like without her eating disorder to self-medicate stress, all supported an EDNOS diagnosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1534650113486184">APA, 2000</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section7-1534650113486184">
<title>Treatment Plan</title>
<p>CBT-E and narrative therapy were considered as options for treating Victoria. CBT-E was the more evidence-based therapy and Victoria’s previous success in overcoming past episodes of AN had effectively employed a CBT-style approach. On the negative side, however, Victoria continued to relapse at times of stress and CBT-E risked further reinforcing her rigidly controlled approach to eating. In contrast, narrative therapy possessed persuasive informal evidence. Dr. Patterson-Kane, as one of the clinical supervisors, had trained with Michael White and David Epston in the application of narrative therapy in the treatment of eating disorders. She suggested that the presence of such a strong narrative component in the case conceptualization might make Victoria particularly receptive to this approach. Moreover, the client’s situation was not urgent (her BMI, as noted above, was within the healthy range). The merits of both approaches were discussed with Victoria and she opted to try narrative therapy.</p>
<p>The key objectives of this approach were externalization of the eating disorder, deconstructing the dominant narrative on which the eating disorder’s hold on the client was based, identifying occasions (“unique outcomes”) when Victoria had been able to escape the influence of that narrative, and the development and enrichment of an alternative narrative that nurtured anti-eating disorder values and behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1534650113486184">A. Morgan, 2000</xref>). The following sections explain the approach taken in more detail.</p>

<title>7 Course of Treatment and Assessment of Progress</title>
<sec id="section9-1534650113486184">
<title>Summary of Sessions</title>
<p>After the initial assessment session, a total of 10 (1 hr) treatment sessions were conducted lasting 12 weeks in total. The initial 2 sessions concentrated on externalizing the eating disorder. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1534650113486184">Maisel et al. (2004)</xref> argued that externalization is particularly essential in the treatment of eating disorders because of their capacity to subjugate the sufferer’s original personality under an all-pervading belief in their lack of self-worth. Externalization allowed Victoria to distance herself from “A-Rex” and thereby examine the tactics he employed to gain her compliance with his demands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1534650113486184">A. Morgan, 2000</xref>). Perhaps even more importantly, externalization gave Victoria the space to explore and articulate to herself what she valued in her life and what A-Rex’s influence was denying her (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1534650113486184">Maisel et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>The following three sessions focused on further exploring A-Rex’s persona, adopting the investigative reporter stance recommended by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1534650113486184">White (2007)</xref> to expose his character and values. This process enabled a comparison with Victoria’s own values, in particular, the qualities and behaviors she possessed as a child care worker. These sessions also commenced a process of deconstruction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1534650113486184">A. Morgan, 2000</xref>), helping Victoria gain awareness of the beliefs that were assisting A-Rex’s hold on her, and identifying their genesis in those teachings of her parents, which, in other contexts, she strongly rejected.</p>
<p>The remaining sessions not only continued to reinforce these themes but also began to work on the development of an alternate story (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1534650113486184">A. Morgan, 2000</xref>), aimed at rebuilding Victoria’s sense of self. The emphasis of this alternate narrative was deliberately extended beyond the eating disorder so as to avoid being directly confrontational (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1534650113486184">White, 2011</xref>). In particular, we sought to address Victoria’s deeply engrained fears of being noticed. The search for “unique outcomes” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1534650113486184">A. Morgan, 2000</xref>, p. 52) therefore focused on realms in the client’s life where she felt able to express herself and was not afraid to be seen. These included poetry, dance, and soccer. Exploration of her feelings, in particular her sense of being present and fully alive in these activities formed the basis of “scaffolding conversations” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1534650113486184">White, 2007</xref>, p. 265), which allowed Victoria to name her alternate story as “escaping from the cell her eating disorder had imprisoned her in.” Living for and being present in the moment, together with acting spontaneously and being willing to take risks, cited by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1534650113486184">Maisel et al. (2004)</xref> as examples of possible anti-eating disorder lifestyles, were identified with Victoria as key to this “escape.” Victoria was then encouraged to extend these approaches into other areas of her life, including eating.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1534650113486184">
<title>Progress in Therapy</title>
<p>By the third treatment session, Victoria had become adept at externalizing her eating disorder and distinguishing the thoughts and values of A-Rex from her own. Initially her comments about A-Rex’s behavior were spoken quietly and submissively, as if she feared upsetting him. She described A-Rex as large, strong, and aggressive (not unlike a huge dinosaur), whereas she saw herself, by contrast, as a small mouse-like animal, easily dominated. Reflecting on this difference allowed Victoria to realize that she would not be able to outfight A-Rex but rather had to use her intellect to outwit him. This realization was empowering: her voice gradually became firmer and more audible and she spoke more critically about his tactics and values. She began to recognize him as a “parasite,” who was “like the Wizard of Oz” in hiding his true nature behind a powerful façade.</p>
<p>In addition, scaffolding conversations that contrasted A-Rex’s treatment of her with the standards she set herself as a carer allowed Victoria to challenge the part of her dominant story that insisted she was less entitled: “Caring for others should take precedence over caring for myself.” By the sixth session, this was replaced by “I want to care for myself just as much as I care for others and A-Rex cannot stop me!”</p>
<p>From the fourth session until the end of treatment, Victoria was encouraged to begin expressing her values, beliefs, hopes, and fears through creative writing. Initially, she chose to focus purely on her relationship with A-Rex but in her later poems she began to address her own emergence once her eating disorder was “gone.” This was a particularly important step in allowing Victoria to challenge her fear that without A-Rex she would be left with “an empty void.” <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1534650113486184">Figure 3</xref> provides an example of such a poem. Note the reference to leaving the “cage,” which came to form the basis of the alternate narrative and also the repeated reference to her voice being/growing “stronger.”</p>

</fig>
<p>Toward the end of treatment, Victoria also began to express herself more in other areas of her life, particularly the workplace. She became more assertive in resisting unreasonable demands and in taking initiatives. Initially, this caused some difficulty (see “Complicating Factors” section) but Victoria persisted and in the final session reported that she had been working particularly successfully with a rather timid child in her care, using a shared approach to risk-taking to their mutual benefit. Most important, Victoria was beginning to sense a future where she could relax with friends and just be herself, free of A-Rex’s nagging voice concerning food and of his persistent warnings of criticism and pain. To her surprise, she was discovering that not only did she have a voice but also that that voice was capable of standing up for itself. In her online journal (also shared with us), Victoria spoke of realizing that “appetite is about more than food. I’m finding that I’m hungry for life.”</p>
<p>Throughout the period of treatment, Victoria continued to struggle with her eating, finding the maintenance of healthy portions particularly challenging. However, she reported that she was no longer missing meals. Moreover, there was no significant weight loss, and toward the end of therapy, she began to report occasionally eating indulgent foods that would previously not have been entertained.</p>
<p>Following the 10th session, Victoria once again completed the EDI-3. These results can also be found in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1534650113486184">Table 1</xref>. Most important, Victoria’s score on the Overcontrol composite went from the elevated clinical to the typical clinical range (from the 90th to the 61st percentile of the International EDNOS sample). This was entirely due to a change on the Asceticism subscale, moving Victoria from the elevated clinical to the low clinical range (from the 96th to the 23rd percentile), demonstrating how well therapy had succeeded in challenging some of the engrained childhood beliefs that led to the development of her eating disorder. This was reinforced by Victoria’s assertion in the final session that she felt she was beginning to absorb the lessons of therapy and particularly “learning to treat myself the way I would treat others.”</p>
<p>However, Victoria’s score on the Perfectionism subscale remained in the elevated clinical range, indicating that Victoria’s expectations and demands of herself remain highly psychopathological. Such beliefs constitute fertile ground to sustain disordered eating behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1534650113486184">Garner, 2004</xref>) and indicate that further therapy is needed to help Victoria develop greater acceptance of her own self-worth, while continuing to encourage a more spontaneous approach to eating and life in general.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1534650113486184">
<title>8 Complicating Factors</title>
<p>The main complicating factor was Victoria’s heavy workload and the associated stress. She reported that her manager at her primary workplace was insensitive and unreasonable in the demands he made of his staff (particularly in relation to hours worked). He also responded critically to initiatives made without his prior approval, jeopardizing Victoria’s efforts to incorporate more spontaneity/risk-taking to her workplace behavior. In addition, Victoria reported that her partner, who had been diagnosed with depression, was also highly stressed concerning his work, and hence often not as supportive as he might be. Because of this, and because Victoria seemed very comfortable with the one-on-one therapeutic relationship that was developing, it was not judged necessary to involve him in therapy at this stage.</p>
<p>The conditions described provided a fertile environment for Victoria’s eating disorder to overwhelm her and a pattern quickly became apparent. In session, A-Rex would remain silent; between sessions Victoria reported that he became more abusive and threatening than ever: seizing on any and every opportunity to criticize her and threatening that when her attempts to defeat him failed, as they inevitably would, he would make her pay. Victoria’s fear that A-Rex was invincible and that her original persona was beyond reach were evident in her poetry:
<disp-quote>
<p> . . . my soul flaked away</p>
<p>Ashes</p>
<p>They would never rise again</p>
<p>Who I was before</p>
<p>You buried</p>
<p>Long ago.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Despite her best intentions, this made it particularly hard for Victoria to implement changes out of therapy. However, Victoria was encouraged to view this assault as a sign of her eating disorder’s increasing desperation, and a sign of impending success, not failure. In addition, Victoria was encouraged to try a different method to combat A-Rex’s criticism. Rather than trying to “shut the voice out,” Victoria was encouraged to focus on what A-Rex was saying, but from the standpoint of a neutral observer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1534650113486184">Maisel et al., 2004</xref>). She was encouraged to analyze A-Rex’s tactics and consider how she, in the role of Victoria’s carer, might help counter this assault. Although Victoria initially found this approach difficult to maintain, it played an important role in the realizations described above concerning A-Rex’s true nature and how his influence might be countered.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1534650113486184">
<title>9 Access and Barriers to Care</title>
<p>Victoria reported the initial decision to seek treatment as having been particularly difficult. She reported past experiences of counselors having refused to treat her eating disorder symptoms. Moreover, her eating disorder voice was insistent that not only was she undeserving of therapy but also that no one would be interested in treating her. Demonstrating belief in her worth and a commitment to helping her overcome her eating disorder were therefore particularly crucial to her fully engaging in therapy.</p>
<p>Problems were also experienced initially with Victoria canceling sessions at the last minute. Her second appointment was canceled on three successive weeks due to additional work commitments. Victoria’s engrained belief that her value lay in serving others meant such occurrences constituted a major threat to her therapeutic progress. Victoria also admitted that A-Rex was repeatedly telling her that the therapist was not remotely interested in her and had much more important clients to see. Accordingly, the therapist requested that the agreed session be one time each week when Victoria would prioritize her own needs above the demands of her workplace, while also stressing his interest and commitment to her recovery. From this point on, Victoria attended all scheduled sessions. Although this agreement carried some risk of the therapist setting himself up as another domineering authority in her life, the approach was made in such a manner as to minimize this risk, and judged necessary lest Victoria’s resolve to address her eating problems diminish before any progress could be made.</p>

<sec id="section13-1534650113486184">
<title>10 Follow-Up</title>
<p>Victoria is keen to continue with her treatment and, as the provisional psychologist has completed his placement, will continue to be seen by one of the supervising clinical psychologists (L.P.-K.) when the clinic reopens. Future treatment needs to continue to nurture Victoria’s emerging sense of self and willingness to express herself. There may also be value in teaching Victoria improved self-assertiveness skills and in helping her generate more adaptive thoughts to deal with her anxiety and others’ negative responses to her initiatives.</p>
<p>In addition, there is scope for the development of a new theme or chapter within the development of Victoria’s alternate story, focusing on her growing recognition that while A-Rex cannot be outfought, he can be outwitted. This will include finding examples in her past of times when she has succeeded in thwarting A-Rex’s designs and also assisting her to develop strategies to deal with those situations that A-Rex seeks to exploit. The goal here will not just be to improve her eating behavior but also to make her outwitting A-Rex the dominant story in her consciousness, replacing the current narrative of his ability to overpower her.</p>

<title>11 Treatment Implications of the Case</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1534650113486184">Fairburn, Cooper, Shafran, Bohn, Hawker, Murphy, et al. (2008)</xref> note the importance of first restoring the patient to a healthy weight (and in so doing relieving the affects of starvation on the patient’s cognitive capacity) before attempting to address the underlying issues sustaining eating disorders. This applies as much to the techniques of CBT-E as it does narrative therapy. A key issue in eating disorder treatment, however, is the high rate of relapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1534650113486184">Berkman et al., 2007</xref>), and the continued hold of eating disorder thinking on sufferers, who like Victoria, have developed a clear picture of what constitutes healthy eating but are unable to sustain it. This case highlights the potential value of narrative therapy in preventing such relapse, through the development of alternative stories that change the individual’s beliefs about their self-worth and help them reengage with their non-eating disorder values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1534650113486184">Maisel et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>The case particularly highlights the importance of externalizing the eating disorder in this process. In this instance, separating Victoria from her eating disorder was crucial, not only in allowing her to recognize the conflict in values and character between the eating disorder and her own deeply held beliefs, but more fundamentally in recognizing and giving voice to the personality that her eating disorder was holding captive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1534650113486184">Maisel et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>The case also demonstrates the importance of utilizing clinical interviews and psychological measures to obtain a comprehensive case formulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1534650113486184">Fairburn, Cooper, Shafran, Bohn, Hawker, Murphy, et al., 2008</xref>) of the factors sustaining the client’s eating disorder. This is particularly crucial with clients such as Victoria, whose eating disorders are atypical and not connected with prevailing cultural ideals regarding the female body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1534650113486184">Garner, 2004</xref>). In particular, it is important to look at the broader context of the current beliefs or narrative that is sustaining problem behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1534650113486184">A. Morgan, 2000</xref>). In this instance, it was recognizing Victoria’s belief that being noticed brought pain that proved crucial in identifying the unique outcomes that formed the basis of alternative story development.</p>
<p>Victoria’s case also highlights the potential value of creative writing in reaching and liberating the personality that has been subjugated by the eating disorder. Inevitably, initial offerings can be expected to focus on the relationship with the eating disorder itself, which can be helpful in exposing the client’s fears and the eating disorder’s tactics. However, encouraging the client to progress beyond this stage is important in allowing them to reconnect with the hopes and dreams they once held. In Victoria’s case, her fear of the void that would follow her eating disorder’s departure was gradually replaced by a new hunger for the vision of liberation she had generated.</p>
<p>Finally, there is considerable value in describing alternative treatment options to clients and exploring their preferences, based on past treatment experiences and their current relationship with/feelings about their disorder. In Victoria’s case, not only did this enhance her buy-in and commitment to the treatment approach but it also sent an important message regarding her self-worth and status as an expert in her own life. As such, it was, in itself, a first step in rebuilding her sense of personal agency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1534650113486184">White, 2007</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section15-1534650113486184">
<title>12 Recommendations to Clinicians and Students</title>
<p>When using narrative therapy to treat eating disorders, the clinician should be prepared for the eating disorder initially increasing the client’s level of distress before it starts to get better. Clinicians also need to forewarn clients regarding this so they do not feel that the treatment is not working and drop out of therapy. Ideally, this means that initial sessions should be closely spaced (at least weekly) so that progress can be maintained and monitored. In addition, this reaction can be used positively in serving to demonstrate the eating disorder’s values and “bullying” nature, and by projecting this reaction as a sign of its concern about loss of control. As treatment progresses, the encouragement of self-expression in the client also has to be handled with care: Taking risks and self-assertion are crucial building blocks in developing the alternate story, but the skills needed to do this successfully are often underdeveloped in clients with eating disorders. A slow, nurturing approach is therefore required when treating clients with EDNOS using narrative therapy, which while still encouraging spontaneity, focuses on smaller steps, in less challenging environments.</p>
<p>The narrative therapist should also not be afraid to move away from the territory of eating during the development of the alternate story. Naturally, care has to be taken that the client’s eating behaviors do not lead to further health deterioration during this phase. However, removing the focus from eating makes it less challenging for the client to explore and reconnect with the things they value. Removing the focus from eating also allows for a fuller exploration of the issues that have led to the development of the eating disorder.</p>
