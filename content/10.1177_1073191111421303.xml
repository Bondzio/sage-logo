<abstract>
<p>This article describes the development and validation of the Multidimensional State Boredom Scale (MSBS)—the first and only full-scale measure of state boredom. It was developed based on a theoretically and empirically grounded definition of boredom. A five-factor structure of the scale (Disengagement, High Arousal, Low Arousal, Inattention, and Time Perception) was supported by exploratory factor analyses and confirmatory factor analyses of two independent samples. Furthermore, all subscales were significantly related to a single, second-order factor. The MSBS factor structure was shown to be invariant across gender. MSBS scores were significantly correlated with measures of trait boredom, depression, anxiety, anger, inattention, impulsivity, neuroticism, life satisfaction, and purpose in life. Finally, MSBS scores distinguished between participants who were experimentally manipulated into a state of boredom and those who were not, above and beyond measures of trait boredom, negative affect, and depression.</p>

<p>Boredom is the experience of being disengaged from the world and stuck in a seemingly endless and dissatisfying present—when bored, our surroundings wither and become barren. Although not all boredom is excruciating, one should not underestimate the potential pain and destruction it can cause. Consider the following:
<disp-quote>
<p>I feel like I’m not alive in this moment in time, as if I am a spectator to life and to myself. I feel detached from others around me. I feel I lack a sense of purpose, and completeness. Most of all, I feel extremely bored. Bored of everything—work, friends, hobbies, relationships, music, reading, movies, bored all the time . . . No matter what the activity it leaves me feeling unfulfilled. I’m bored of thinking, of talking, of feeling bored with being bored. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1073191111421303">Maltsberger, 2000</xref>, p. 84)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This man’s emotional pain was so great he tried to kill himself twice. According to his psychiatrist, he did not meet the diagnostic criteria for a mental disorder such as depression but rather suffered from severe and chronic boredom.</p>
<p>Empirical research has demonstrated the detrimental impact of boredom, connecting it to various mental health conditions, such as traumatic head injury (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1073191111421303">Seel &amp; Kreutzer, 2003</xref>), depression and anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1073191111421303">Farmer &amp; Sundberg, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1073191111421303">Sommers &amp; Vodanovich, 2000</xref>), apathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1073191111421303">Ahmed, 1990</xref>), negative affect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1073191111421303">Gordon, Wilkinson, McGown, &amp; Jovanoska, 1997</xref>), hostility and anger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1073191111421303">Rupp &amp; Vodanovich, 1997</xref>), alexithymia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1073191111421303">Eastwood, Cavaliere, Fahlman, &amp; Eastwood, 2007</xref>), somatization complaints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1073191111421303">Sommers &amp; Vodanovich, 2000</xref>), overeating and binge eating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1073191111421303">Abramson &amp; Stinson, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1073191111421303">Ganley, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1073191111421303">Stickney &amp; Miltenberger, 1999</xref>), pathological gambling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1073191111421303">Blaszczynski, McConaghy, &amp; Frankova, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1073191111421303">Mercer &amp; Eastwood, 2010</xref>), marijuana use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1073191111421303">Lee, Neighbors, &amp; Woods, 2007</xref>), alcohol abuse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-1073191111421303">Wiesbeck et al., 1996</xref>), job dissatisfaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1073191111421303">Kass, Vodanovich, &amp; Callender, 2001</xref>), and low achievement in school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1073191111421303">Jarvis &amp; Seifert, 2002</xref>). Boredom has also been associated with lowered levels of life meaning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1073191111421303">Fahlman, Mercer, Gaskovski, Eastwood, &amp; Eastwood, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-1073191111421303">Weinstein, Xie, &amp; Cleanthous, 1995</xref>), assertiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-1073191111421303">Tolor, 1989</xref>), self-actualization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1073191111421303">McLeod &amp; Vodanovich, 1991</xref>), and life satisfaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1073191111421303">Farmer &amp; Sundberg, 1986</xref>). Taken together, boredom is associated with significant social, psychological and physical health difficulties. Surprisingly, there is no comprehensive measure of the state of boredom. Furthermore, there is no comprehensive and theoretically grounded definition of boredom on which such a measure could be based.</p>

<title>Theories of Boredom</title>
<p>Theories of boredom can be divided into four distinct groups: psychodynamic, arousal, attention, and existential theories. Each theory proposes a somewhat different explanation for why the bored individual is unable to achieve satisfying engagement with the world. <italic>Psychodynamic theories</italic> argue that boredom is caused by an inability to consciously determine what is desired because the desire is threatening and therefore repressed. As a result, the bored individual looks to the external world to find satisfaction but inevitably feels deprived and frustrated when the external world does not resolve the problem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1073191111421303">Fenichel, 1953</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1073191111421303">Greenson, 1953</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-1073191111421303">Wangh, 1975</xref>). <italic>Arousal theories</italic> propose that boredom is caused by nonoptimal arousal that ensues when there is a mismatch between an individual’s need for arousal and the availability of environmental stimulation (i.e., its degree of challenge, complexity, intensity, and variety; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1073191111421303">Berlyne, 1960</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1073191111421303">Csikszentmihalyi, 1975/2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1073191111421303">1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1073191111421303">De Chenne, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1073191111421303">Hebb, 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1073191111421303">Klapp, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-1073191111421303">Zuckerman, 1979</xref>). <italic>Attentional theories</italic> propose that boredom is caused by a failure of attentional processes resulting in an inability to focus or engage attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1073191111421303">Fisher, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1073191111421303">Hamilton, 1981</xref>). Finally, <italic>existential theories</italic> argue that boredom is caused by a lack of life meaning or purpose; boredom ensues when an individual gives up on or fails to articulate and participate in activities that are consistent with his or her values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1073191111421303">Bargdill, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1073191111421303">Fahlman et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1073191111421303">Frankl, 1959</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1073191111421303">1962</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1073191111421303">1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1073191111421303">Maddi, 1967</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1073191111421303">1970</xref>).</p>
<p>Although the various theories propose different explanations of boredom, they exhibit overlap in terms of the key defining elements that constitute the experience of boredom. Below we will summarize these common elements to propose a transtheoretical definition of “boredom.”</p>

<sec id="section2-1073191111421303">
<title>Definition of Boredom</title>
<p>All theories suggest that the central defining feature of boredom is the aversive experience of wanting, but being unable, to engage in stimulating and satisfying activity (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1073191111421303">Berlyne, 1960</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1073191111421303">Csikszentmihalyi, 1975/2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1073191111421303">De Chenne, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1073191111421303">Fenichel, 1953</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1073191111421303">Fiske &amp; Maddi, 1961</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1073191111421303">Greenson, 1953</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1073191111421303">Hebb, 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1073191111421303">Mikulas &amp; Vodanovich, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1073191111421303">O’Hanlon, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-1073191111421303">Sundberg, Latkin, Farmer, &amp; Saoud, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-1073191111421303">Todman, 2003</xref>). However, there are a number of additional associated features that give boredom its distinct cognitive, emotional, and behavioral profile.</p>
<p>Boredom is often conceptualized as an aversive state of underarousal that occurs when “information” or environmental “stimulation” is redundant, monotonous, of low intensity, or meaningless (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1073191111421303">Berlyne, 1960</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1073191111421303">Fiske &amp; Maddi, 1961</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1073191111421303">Geiwitz, 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1073191111421303">Hebb, 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1073191111421303">Mikulas &amp; Vodanovich, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1073191111421303">Posner, Russell, &amp; Peterson, 2005</xref>). Yet boredom is also frequently characterized by high arousal states such as restlessness, agitation, and frustration (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1073191111421303">Berlyne, 1960</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1073191111421303">Fisher, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1073191111421303">Harris, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1073191111421303">Hill &amp; Perkins, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1073191111421303">Klapp, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1073191111421303">London, Schubert, &amp; Wasburn, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1073191111421303">Martin, Sadlo, &amp; Stew, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1073191111421303">O’Hanlon, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1073191111421303">Pattyn, Neyt, Henderickx, &amp; Soetens, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1073191111421303">Smith, 1981</xref>). In fact, some theorists have highlighted the contrasting experiences of agitation and restlessness versus lethargy and tiredness as being key to the definition of boredom (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1073191111421303">Berlyne, 1960</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1073191111421303">Bernstein, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1073191111421303">Fenichel, 1953</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1073191111421303">Fiske &amp; Maddi, 1961</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1073191111421303">Greenson, 1951</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1073191111421303">Fiske and Maddi (1961)</xref>, for example, noted that “lethargic feelings and overt reactions of irritability and restlessness” accompany boredom (p. 110). Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1073191111421303">Bernstein (1975)</xref> stated that either restlessness or apathy can “dominate the picture of one person’s boredom while the other may dominate the next, or their dominance may alternate within one person, but restlessness and apathy are always present together to some degree in boredom” (p. 516).</p>
<p>As discussed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1073191111421303">Hamilton (1981)</xref>, these defining elements of high and low arousal are not necessarily inconsistent if the high arousal seen in boredom is viewed as a compensatory attempt to self-stimulate (a similar argument is made by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1073191111421303">O’Hanlon, 1981</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1073191111421303">Smith, 1981</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-1073191111421303">Thackray (1981)</xref> suggests that high arousal boredom may occur when an individual is required to maintain mental alertness and high performance in the context of a monotonous task. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1073191111421303">Hamilton (1981)</xref> makes a similar argument regarding the role of forced attention in high arousal boredom, but also notes that it can occur in response to an <italic>overload</italic> of information. She states,
<disp-quote>
<p>A high “cortical” arousal type of boredom might indeed be expected with information overload (such as memorizing the phone book or meaningless acronyms); when one is constrained from opting out of the situation, then the overload may be experienced as worthless and boring as well as frustrating, anxiety provoking, and arousing. (p. 287)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Theorists also converge on the notion that cognitive processes are changed in boredom. For instance, a commonly described feature is distorted time perception such that time is perceived to move more slowly during the experience of boredom (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1073191111421303">Conrad, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1073191111421303">Fenichel, 1953</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1073191111421303">Greenson, 1953</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1073191111421303">Hartocollis, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1073191111421303">O’Connor, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-1073191111421303">Wangh, 1975</xref>). In addition, theories of boredom emphasize that bored individuals suffer from poor concentration and are forced to control their attention with effort (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1073191111421303">Bernstein, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1073191111421303">Fisher, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1073191111421303">Harris, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1073191111421303">Hartocollis, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1073191111421303">Leary, Rogers, Canfield, &amp; Coe, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1073191111421303">Martin et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-1073191111421303">Todman, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>In summary, a synthetic review of the literature suggests the following transtheoretical definition of boredom: Boredom is the aversive experience of having an unfulfilled desire to be engaged in satisfying activity. In terms of arousal, the bored individual experiences either agitated, high arousal and/or lethargic, low arousal. Cognitively, the bored individual experiences a slow passage of time and an inability to focus his or her attention. Thus, boredom includes (a) lack of engagement, (b) low arousal negative affect, (c) high arousal negative affect,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1073191111421303">1</xref></sup> (d) the experience of a slow passage of time, and (e) difficulty focusing attention.</p>

<title>Existing Measures of Boredom</title>
<p>There are a number of self-report scales used to measure boredom, including the Boredom Susceptibility Scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-1073191111421303">Zuckerman, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-1073191111421303">Zuckerman, Eysenck, &amp; Eysenck, 1978</xref>), Job Boredom Scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1073191111421303">Lee, 1986</xref>), Boredom Coping Scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1073191111421303">Hamilton, Haier, &amp; Buchsbaum, 1984</xref>), Leisure Boredom Scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1073191111421303">Iso-Ahola &amp; Weissinger, 1990</xref>), Free Time Boredom Scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1073191111421303">Ragheb &amp; Merydith, 2001</xref>), and the Sexual Boredom Scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-1073191111421303">Watt &amp; Ewing, 1996</xref>). However, all of these tools lack utility as they are either subfactors of scales measuring other constructs or they are very narrow in scope (i.e., only look at boredom in one particular context such as leisure time or sexual relationships). Furthermore, with the exception of the Boredom Susceptibility Scale —a subfactor of the Sensation Seeking Scale—these boredom scales have received little empirical attention.</p>
<p>The only full-scale measure of boredom that has been used extensively in empirical research is the Boredom Proneness Scale (BPS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1073191111421303">Farmer &amp; Sundberg, 1986</xref>). The BPS measures trait boredom—the general propensity to experience boredom across a wide variety of situations. More specifically, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1073191111421303">Farmer and Sundberg (1986)</xref> defined boredom as the degree of “connectedness with one’s environment on many situational dimensions, as well as the ability to access adaptive resources and realize competencies” (p. 10). The original BPS consisted of 28 true–false items, had an internal consistency alpha of .79, and a 1-week test–retest reliability of .83 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1073191111421303">Farmer &amp; Sundberg, 1986</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-1073191111421303">Vodanovich and Kass (1990b)</xref> converted the BPS into a 7-point Likert-type format in order to increase its sensitivity. The internal consistency of this version has been reported to range from .79 to .83 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1073191111421303">Ahmed, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1073191111421303">McLeod &amp; Vodanovich, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-1073191111421303">Vodanovich &amp; Kass, 1990b</xref>), with a 1-week test–retest reliability of .79 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1073191111421303">Polly, Vodanovich, Watt, &amp; Blanchard, 1993</xref>).</p>
<p>Although <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1073191111421303">Farmer and Sundberg (1986)</xref> originally developed the BPS to measure a unitary construct, several studies have examined possible factor structures of the scale (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1073191111421303">Melton &amp; Schulenberg, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-1073191111421303">Vodanovich, Wallace, &amp; Kass, 2005</xref>). Yet no clear conclusion regarding the factor structure of the BPS has been reached, perhaps in part because of notable variability in statistical standards and methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1073191111421303">Melton &amp; Schulenberg, 2009</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-1073191111421303">Vodanovich et al. (2005)</xref> attempted to evaluate previously proposed factor structures, and they concluded that two factors labeled Internal and External Stimulation fit the data best. Furthermore, they proposed a shortened 12-item version of the BPS that resulted in a better two-factor solution and was invariant across gender. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1073191111421303">Melton and Schulenberg (2009)</xref>, however, failed to find evidence for these two factors of the short version of the scale. In summary, a clear factor structure for the BPS has yet to be established, but taken as a whole, the literature is most consistent with a two-factor solution as proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-1073191111421303">Vodanovich et al. (2005)</xref>.</p>

<title>State Versus Trait Boredom</title>
<p>Notably, the BPS measures one’s tendency to become bored (trait boredom) and does not assess the actual experience of boredom in a given moment (state boredom). The lack of a measure of state boredom is a critical limitation. Investigators have argued that the trait of boredom proneness may be psychologically different from the state of boredom (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1073191111421303">Neu, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-1073191111421303">Todman, 2003</xref>)—most simply, the trait may be more strongly determined by internal psychological characteristics, whereas the state may be more strongly determined by external situational factors. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1073191111421303">Neu (1998)</xref>, for example, has discussed this issue in terms of <italic>endogenous</italic> boredom (i.e., boredom from within) versus <italic>reactive</italic> boredom (i.e., boredom in response to the environment). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-1073191111421303">Todman (2003)</xref> has made a similar distinction between situation-independent boredom and situation-dependent boredom.</p>

<sec id="section5-1073191111421303">
<title>Rationale for a New Measure of Boredom</title>
<p>In light of the growing relevance of and interest in studying boredom, the measurement of boredom must be improved. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-1073191111421303">Vodanovich (2003)</xref> concluded in his review of extant boredom measures:
<disp-quote>
<p>It would be beneficial for future researchers to focus on the development of additional measures of boredom, particularly those that are both multidimensional and full-scale in nature. Ideally, the construction of such measures would be guided by an integrated theory and definition of boredom. . . . In addition, it would be useful for researchers to differentiate between (and assess) state and trait boredom. (pp. 588-589)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In the present article, we describe the development of the Multidimensional State Boredom Scale (MSBS), which was designed to address these recommendations and improve the measurement of boredom.</p>

<sec id="section6-1073191111421303">
<title>Study 1a: Qualitative Analysis and Item Creation</title>
<p>After completing a synthetic review of the theoretical literature, which resulted in the definition of boredom described above, we began the empirical component of our scale development by completing a qualitative analysis of the experience of boredom. The purpose of Study 1a was to (a) empirically confirm our definition of boredom and (b) develop an initial pool of items. We chose to generate items based on a qualitative analysis to ensure that the items had ecological validity and incorporated the language that is used by individuals when they describe their experience of boredom.</p>
<sec id="section7-1073191111421303">
<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section8-1073191111421303">
<title>Participants and procedure</title>
<p>One hundred and ninety-nine undergraduate students (81% female, 19% male) were recruited from introductory psychology courses. Participants’ mean age was 20.7 years (<italic>SD</italic> = 5.0, range 17-53). Participants were asked to provide written responses to two open-ended questions: (a) “Describe what the experience of boredom means to you” and (b) “What is the experience of boredom like for you? Please describe what you think/feel/experience while you are bored.”</p>
<p>A modified grounded theory analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1073191111421303">Strauss &amp; Corbin, 1998</xref>) was conducted on written responses. For each question, the analysis was completed in three stages: (a) open coding, (b) axial coding, and (c) selective coding. However, because participants only provided short sentences or phrases to each question, the data did not support valid selective coding; thus, the final axial coding categories and illustrative quotes were taken as the final results.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<sec id="section10-1073191111421303">
<title>Definition of boredom</title>
<p>Analyses indicated that to be bored is to perceive one’s environment as inadequately providing for one’s need for engagement in satisfying activities. Boredom was most commonly referred to as a lack of activity (including not knowing what it is that one wants to do) or the presence of activity that one does not desire. Whereas some participants described a desire for activities that were interesting, exciting, or entertaining, others emphasized the desire for activities with some form of meaning, purpose, or personal significance. In sum, boredom was predominantly described as feeling disengaged from interesting or meaningful activity.</p>
<p>In addition to the core component of “doing nothing,” participants described negative affective states associated with high or low levels of arousal. Specifically, participants described high arousal states such as anxiety, irritability, agitation, and restlessness, and low arousal states such as dysphoria, emptiness, and fatigue. Cognitive changes were also described, including distractibility and problems in concentrating, as well as the perception that time is passing slowly.</p>
<p>In summary, the grounded theory analysis resulted in a total of six final themes—namely, (a) a disconnection or struggle to engage in one’s surrounding environment, (b) boredom as a negative or undesirable experience, (c) emotional and cognitive experiences that accompany boredom, (d) changes in time perception, (e) coping with boredom, and (f) not being bored. Theme 5 (i.e., what people did to cope with boredom) and Theme 6 (i.e., statements to the effect “I don’t get bored because I am too busy”) were not related to the definition of boredom per se. The remaining themes were judged to be consistent with, and thus empirically confirmed, our theoretically derived definition of boredom. Our definition is repeated below and its overlap with results from the qualitative study is indicated:
<disp-quote>
<p>Boredom is the aversive experience (Theme 2) of having an unfulfilled desire to be engaged in satisfying activity (Theme 1). In terms of arousal, the bored individual experiences either agitated, high arousal and/or lethargic, low arousal (Theme 3). Cognitively, the bored individual experiences a slow passage of time and an inability to focus his or her attention (Themes 3 and 4).</p>

<title>Item construction</title>
<p>The first author created 68 items that were verbatim copies of descriptions provided by participants from the qualitative study and that were also consistent with the theoretically derived definition of boredom. The 68 items were reviewed and revised in a group meeting. The group was composed of a professor and four graduate students who were knowledgeable about the boredom literature and actively studying boredom. At the time of review, the group generated an additional 8 items. After revisions, all 76 items were judged to be coherent, readable, representative of the qualitative study, and also representative of all components of boredom contained in the theoretically derived definition. At this stage, some redundancy of item content was permitted. Each of the final 76 items was constructed with a 7-point Likert-type format to maximize the sensitivity of the scale. All items were worded in the same direction (i.e., the answer “agree” always reflected higher boredom) to avoid confusing participants and to avoid artificially creating a factor structure based on direction of wording (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1073191111421303">DeVellis, 2003</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section14-1073191111421303">
<title>Participants and procedure</title>
<p>The 76 items were administered to 1,028 undergraduate participants from two large universities in Ontario, Canada. Data from 16 participants were eliminated because of extreme responding (i.e., choosing only 1s or 7s), resulting in a final sample size of 1,012. Seventy-two percent of participants in the final sample were female (<italic>n</italic> = 731), and the mean age was 19.6 years (<italic>SD</italic> = 3.1, range 16-46). Information on participants’ ethnic background was available for <italic>n</italic> = 705 (70%): 50% identified as White/Caucasian, 13% as South Asian, 11% Chinese, 6% Arab/West Asian, 6% Black, 4% biracial, 3% Latin Canadian, 2% West Indian, 2% Filipino, 2% Korean, 2% Southeast Asian, 1% Aboriginal/First Nations, 1% Japanese, and 1% “Other.”</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-1073191111421303">
<title>Results</title>
<p>Initially, 32 items were eliminated because of extreme skewness (i.e., skewness &gt;.9) or poor item–total correlations (e.g., &lt;.30).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1073191111421303">2</xref></sup> This elimination resulted in 44 remaining items. These items retained content validity in that they captured the dimensions and themes that emerged from the qualitative analysis and theoretical definition.</p>
<p>Next, exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was used to suggest a possible factor structure for the pool of 44 items and further eliminate poor items. Because the initial items were designed to represent the five components of state boredom contained in our definition, we anticipated that the MSBS would likely contain multiple factors. One third of the data set from Study 1b (<italic>n</italic> = 315) was randomly chosen for EFA. All items had a 7-point scale format and lacked excess skewness and kurtosis and thus were considered suitable for factoring methods for continuous distributions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1073191111421303">Finney &amp; DiStefano, 2006</xref>). Principal axis factoring with a quartimin rotation was performed on the 44 items. The number of factors was determined by examining the scree plot, total variance accounted for, and the root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) statistic. Additionally, multiple factor models were estimated, requesting both greater and fewer factors than the number suggested by the scree plot (as recommended by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1073191111421303">Costello &amp; Osborne, 2005</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1073191111421303">Fabrigar, Wegener, MacCallum, &amp; Strahan, 1999</xref>). In total, four models were estimated, requesting three, four, five, and six factors.</p>
<p>The three-, four-, five-, and six-factor models accounted for 48.0%, 51.4%, 54.3%, and 57.1% of total variance, with RMSEA values (and 90% confidence intervals) of .072 (.069, .076), .068 (.064, .072), .058 (.053, .062), and .053 (.049, .058), respectively. Although the six-factor model had the lowest RMSEA value, the sixth factor was uninterpretable; thus, the five-factor model was chosen for the final solution.</p>
<p>An item was considered salient for a given factor if it loaded on that factor at .35 or higher and &lt;.30 on other factors. We used these arguably liberal criteria in the exploratory scale development phase so that we could evaluate a larger number of candidate items for a given factor in subsequent analyses. Importantly, our follow-up confirmatory analyses gave us the opportunity to remove items that did not show a robust relationship to a given factor. These criteria resulted in the removal of 18 items. Two items did not meet these criteria but were retained at this stage of the analysis pending the results of subsequent analyses because it was felt that removing them would reduce the content validity of the scale in light of theory and our qualitative study. After removing items without salient loadings, 26 items formed a new shortened set of items (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1073191111421303">Table 1</xref>). The five factors were named as follows: (a) Disengagement (DIS; 9 items), (b) High Arousal (HA; 6 items), (c) Low Arousal (LA; 5 items), (d) Inattention (IN; 4 items), and (e) Time Perception (TP; 2 items). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1073191111421303">Table 2</xref> contains the factor correlations, which ranged from .26 to .58. These five factors were consistent with our theoretically derived definition of boredom suggesting that the shortened set of items retained content validity. The summed scores of items loading on each factor had internal consistency coefficient alpha values of .87, .86, .88, .83, and .73, respectively.</p>

<p>Next, to verify the five-factor structure found with EFA, a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was conducted on the remaining two thirds (<italic>n</italic> = 697) of the Study 1b data set. We predicted that a five-factor model would provide a better fit to the data than a four-factor model (representing a combined high and low arousal factor—the two most highly intercorrelated factors) or a one-factor model (representing a unidimensional conceptualization of boredom). In addition, because the five factors were intended to be subcomponents of boredom, we predicted that a second-order model, with five first-order factors and one second-order factor, “General Boredom,” would also fit the data well.</p>
<p>In all, 26 participants had missing data and were excluded from the CFA, resulting in a final sample size of <italic>n</italic> = 671. CFA models were then fitted to the 26-item version of the MSBS using maximum likelihood estimation. Model fit was evaluated with the chi-square (χ<sup>2</sup>) test, Tucker–Lewis index (TLI), comparative fit index (CFI), and RMSEA along with its 90% confidence interval.</p>

<title>Second-order model</title>
<p>Because the five factors were intended to represent specific, correlated aspects of boredom, a model with a single, second-order factor was also estimated. The fit of this model was good, χ<sup>2</sup>(294) = 900.48, TLI = .98, CFI = .98, RMSEA = .055. First-order standardized loadings were virtually identical to the previous five-factor model, again ranging from .54 to .82 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1073191111421303">Table 4</xref>). With respect to the second-order loadings, the DIS factor had the strongest relationship with the second-order factor (.97), and the loadings for HA, LA, IN, and TP were also strong (.81, .88, .71, and .70, respectively). These results indicate that <italic>the total score of the MSBS is meaningful.</italic> That is, because the second-order factor provides a theoretically guided and statistically parsimonious explanation for the correlations among the first-order factors, the first-order factors can be thought of as specific components of a single, general construct of boredom rather than separate constructs that are simply correlated with one another. Therefore, although the first- and second-order models both had very good fit, the second-order model was theoretically and statistically preferred and was chosen as the final structural model for the MSBS.</p>

<sec id="section17-1073191111421303">
<title>Study 2</title>
<p>The purpose of Study 2 was to increase the number of items on two of the factors, to replace a potentially problematic item, and to cross-validate the revised scale with a new set of participants. To this end, 5 items were added to the MSBS. Four of these items increased the number of items on the DIS<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1073191111421303">3</xref></sup> and TP factors, and a fifth item, “I feel down,” was intended to replace the item “I feel depressed” to move away from content explicitly associated with clinical depression. This new MSBS subsequently contained 31 items.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section19-1073191111421303">
<title>Participants and procedure</title>
<p>The 31-item MSBS was administered to a new sample of undergraduate student participants (<italic>N</italic> = 209). Demographic information was available for 193 (92%) participants: 76% (<italic>n</italic> = 147) were female, and the mean age was 19.7 years (<italic>SD</italic> = 3.1, range 17-44). Information on ethnic background was available for 156 (75%) participants: 51% identified as White/Caucasian, 14% as South Asian, 11% Chinese, 7% Black, 5% Arab/West Asian, 4% Latin Canadian, 3% Filipino, 3% Korean, 1% Southeast Asian, and 1% Japanese.</p>
</sec>

<sec id="section20-1073191111421303">
<title>Results</title>
<p>Original items were examined first. The item “I feel tense” was the only item whose deletion would increase the full-scale coefficient alpha; it was thus eliminated. The five new items had strong item–total correlations (<italic>r</italic> = .49-.67), and the deletion of any of them would decrease the full-scale coefficient alpha. Thus, the new items were retained, and the original “I feel depressed” item was replaced by “I feel down.”</p>
<p>In sum, two items (“I feel tense” and “I feel depressed”) were deleted from the 31-item version, resulting in the 29-item final version of the MSBS (see the <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-1073191111421303">appendix</xref>). The coefficient alpha values for the 29-item final version were .88 for DIS, .84 for HA, .86 for LA, .80 for IN, .92 for TP, and .95 for the full scale.</p>

<title>Study 3</title>
<p>Studies 3 and 4 represent the validation of the final, 29-item MSBS. In Study 3, the dimensionality, measurement invariance by gender, and convergent validity of the MSBS were assessed. First, the fit of the second-order model previously identified was examined via CFA. Next, measurement invariance was examined across gender in light of findings suggesting that there are gender differences in the propensity to experience boredom (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-1073191111421303">Vodanovich et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-1073191111421303">Vodanovich &amp; Kass, 1990a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-1073191111421303">Watt &amp; Vodanovich, 1992</xref>). Finally, the MSBS was correlated with hypothetically related constructs to assess its convergent validity. Hypothesized correlations were predicted based on theory and past research. We expected MSBS total scores to be positively correlated with a measure of trait boredom and with measures of anxiety, depression, anger, inattention, neuroticism, and impulsivity. We also expected MSBS scores to correlate negatively with measures of purpose in life and life satisfaction. Finally, to establish that MSBS responses are not unduly biased by social desirability, we explored the correlation between the MSBS and a measure of social desirability.</p>
<sec id="section22-1073191111421303">
<title>Participants and Procedure</title>
<p>The final version of the MSBS was administered to 576 undergraduate participants. The sample was 55% female (<italic>n</italic> = 318), with a mean age of 20.0 years (<italic>SD</italic> = 4.1, range 17-56). The sample was ethnically diverse: 41% identified as White/Caucasian, 15% as South Asian, 10% Arab/West Asian, 9% Chinese, 6% biracial, 5% Black, 4% Southeast Asian, 3% West Indian, 3% Korean, 2% Filipino, 2% Latin Canadian, 1% Aboriginal/First Nations, 1% Japanese, and 1% “Other.”</p>
<p>All participants completed the measures of boredom (BPS, MSBS). To reduce the burden on participants, Subsample 1 (<italic>n</italic> = 243) completed one set of measures (State-Trait Personality Inventory [STPI], Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale [CESD], Adult ADHD Self-Rating Scale–Inattention Subscale [ASRS-IN], and Balanced Inventory of Desirable Responding [BIDR]; see below), and Subsample 2 (<italic>n</italic> = 333) completed a different set of measures (Big Five Inventory–Neuroticism Subscale [BFI-N], Barratt Impulsivity Scale [BIS-11], Purpose in Life Test [PIL], and Satisfaction With Life Scale [SWLS]; see below).</p>

<p>In the present study, MSBS coefficient alphas were .87 for DIS, .85 for HA, .86 for LA, .80 for IN, .88 for TP, and .94 for the full scale.</p>

<sec id="section37-1073191111421303">
<title>Measurement invariance</title>
<p>Measurement invariance of the MSBS across gender was examined with a series of nested multiple-group CFA models. In Model 1, the second-order model was used as a baseline model to assess configural invariance. The variance of the second-order “General Boredom” factor was constrained to 1.00, and all other parameters were freely estimated. This simultaneous analysis indicated that the second-order model had good fit for both females and males, χ<sup>2</sup>(744) = 1731.00, CFI = .97, RMSEA = .068.</p>
<p>Although nested model comparisons using multiple-group CFA have often relied on the χ<sup>2</sup> difference test, recent methodological research (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1073191111421303">Cheung &amp; Rensvold, 2002</xref>) suggests that examining alternative fit indices is preferable for this purpose because the χ<sup>2</sup> statistic is overly sensitive to sample size and ignores model parsimony. Thus, following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1073191111421303">Cheung and Rensvold (2002)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1073191111421303">Chen (2007)</xref>, in the current analyses two models were considered to have equivalent fit if the decrease in CFI (ΔCFI) was .01 or less and if the increase in RMSEA (ΔRMSEA) was not greater than .01.</p>
<p>In Models 2 and 3, partial invariance of the MSBS was tested to examine whether first- and second-order factor loadings were invariant across gender. Specifically, in Model 2, all first-order loadings were constrained. Model 2 did not have significantly different fit from Model 1, the baseline model (ΔCFI = .00, ΔRMSEA = −.01), indicating that the first-order factor loadings are invariant across females and males. Model 3 tested the invariance of the second-order loadings over and above the constrained first-order loadings. This model did not have significantly different fit from Model 2 (ΔCFI = .00, ΔRMSEA = .00), indicating that second-order factor loadings are also invariant across gender.</p>
<p>Finally, given that partial invariance was established with Models 2 and 3, strict invariance was assessed by examining equivalence of the error variances of observed variables. Thus, Model 4 was identical to Model 3, with the exception of all error variances of observed variables constrained to be equal across gender. Model 4 did not fit significantly differently from Model 3 (ΔCFI = .00, ΔRMSEA = .00).</p>
<p>In sum, these analyses suggest that the measurement of boredom and its five lower-order factors using the MSBS is strictly equivalent across gender. That is, the relationships between the observed item responses and the lower order factors do not differ across gender nor do the relationships between the lower order factors and the second-order General Boredom factor.</p>

<title>MSBS Convergent Validity</title>
<p>Several outliers (i.e., greater than three standard deviations above or below the mean) were detected on the validation measures, one each on BPS, CESD, ASRS-IN, SDE, and BIS, two on IM and PIL, and five on S-Ang These scores were deleted. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-1073191111421303">Tables 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table8-1073191111421303">8</xref> contain the correlations among MSBS scores and the validation measures. As predicted, MSBS total score and subscale scores were significantly correlated with an existing measure of trait boredom, BPS (<italic>r</italic> = .44-.62 in Subsample 1 and <italic>r</italic> = .39-.63 in Subsample 2). MSBS total scores were also significantly correlated with measures of depression, anxiety, anger, inattention, neuroticism, and impulsivity (<italic>r</italic> = .30-.68), and they were significantly negatively correlated with purpose in life (<italic>r</italic> = −.52) and life satisfaction (<italic>r</italic> = −.45). Neither MSBS total scores nor subscale scores were positively correlated with the measure of impression management (<italic>r</italic> = −.03 to −.15). Taken together, these results provide support for the convergent validity of the MSBS.</p>

<title>Study 4</title>
<p>The purpose of Study 4 was to establish the construct and incremental validity of the MSBS by investigating its sensitivity to experimentally manipulated variations in state boredom. The MSBS was first compared with an existing measure of trait boredom (BPS) for its ability to distinguish between individuals who were induced into a state of boredom and those who were not (i.e., construct validity). Second, the MSBS was compared with measures of trait boredom, negative affect, and depression for its ability to predict group membership (i.e., incremental validity). The incremental validity analysis assessed whether MSBS predicted state boredom better than measures of trait boredom and negative mood in general.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section41-1073191111421303">
<title>Participants and Procedure</title>
<p>A total of 75 undergraduate students participated in Study 4. The sample was 84% female (<italic>n</italic> = 63), with a mean age of 21.2 years (<italic>SD</italic> = 6.9, range 17-53). Participants reported identification with the following ethnic groups: 41% White/Caucasian, 15% South Asian, 13% Black, 8% Chinese, 7% Arab/West Asian, 4% West Indian, 4% “Other,” 3% Korean, 1% Aboriginal/First Nations, and 1% Latin Canadian.</p>
<p>Sessions were conducted individually for approximately 60 to 90 minutes. Participants were randomly assigned to one of three experimental conditions (25 to each): overstimulating boredom (OSB), understimulating boredom (USB), or a nonboredom (NB) control condition. All participants watched a video clip that varied across experimental conditions. Specifically, participants in the OSB condition watched a 25-minute clip on advanced computer graphics and modeling techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1073191111421303">Rose &amp; McDermott, 1998</xref>), which was perceived as highly overstimulating, in both its content difficulty and visual stimulation. With an abundance of incomprehensible, “noisy” information, participants were expected to disengage and become bored (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1073191111421303">Klapp, 1986</xref>). Participants in the USB condition watched a 25-minute clip on learning English as a second language (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-1073191111421303">Video Tutor, 1995</xref>). This clip was seen as monotonous, well below participants’ skill level, and therefore highly understimulating. In contrast, participants in the NB condition watched a 25-minute clip of the action movie <italic>Speed</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1073191111421303">de Bont, 1994</xref>), taken from the middle of the film and chosen for its high-action content.</p>
<p>To maximize the effects of the manipulation, participants’ perception of volition and experience of time were also manipulated. Participants in both boredom conditions were led to believe that they had no choice in which video they would watch. They were told that other participants were being asked to choose between two videos for the task, but because of technical difficulties, they had no choice. The perceived lack of choice was thought to maximize the desired effect of the manipulation by making participants feel forced into a boring situation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1073191111421303">London &amp; Monello, 1974</xref>). Participants in the boredom conditions were also told that the video would be stopped after exactly 20 minutes. However, the videos were actually stopped after 25 minutes, creating the feeling of a slow passage of time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-1073191111421303">Troutwine &amp; O’Neal, 1981</xref>).</p>
<p>Conversely, participants in the NB condition were falsely led to believe that they <italic>did</italic> have choice in which video they would watch. Each participant was given descriptions of two possible video clips, but in actuality they were different descriptions of the same film. Thus, regardless of which option was chosen, all participants in the NB condition watched the same clip. The illusion of choice was used to make participants feel personally responsible for their decision and, thus, more engaged in what they were doing. Participants in the NB condition were also told that the clip was 30 minutes in length; however, the video was stopped after 25 minutes, creating the feeling that time had passed quickly.</p>

<title>Measures</title>
<p>Immediately after the manipulation, participants completed measures of trait boredom (BPS), state boredom (MSBS), negative affect (Positive and Negative Affect Schedule–Negative Affect Subscale [PANAS-NA]), and depression (CESD). The psychometric properties of BPS and CESD have been described above. Broken down by experimental condition, MSBS coefficient alphas for the full scale and the DIS, HA, LA, IN, and TP subscales, in order, were .96, .90, .85, .82, .93, and .75 for the USB condition; .97, .92, .93, .81, .86, and .97 for the OSB condition; and .94, .83, .84, .78, .75, and .79 for the NB condition.</p>
<sec id="section43-1073191111421303">
<title>Positive and Negative Affect Schedule–Negative Affect subscale</title>
<p>The PANAS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-1073191111421303">Watson, Clark, &amp; Tellegen, 1988</xref>) is a brief measure of positive and negative affect. Only the Negative Affect (NA) subscale was used in the present analysis. NA is defined as “a general dimension of subjective distress and unpleasurable engagement that subsumes a variety of aversive mood states, including anger, contempt, disgust, guilt, fear, and nervousness” (Watson et al., p. 1063). The PANAS consists of a list of 20 adjectives (10 per subscale) rated on a 5-point scale using the time instructions desired by the researcher. Present moment instructions were used in the present study. The reliability for the present moment instructions for the NA subscale is reported to be .85 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-1073191111421303">Watson et al., 1988</xref>).</p>

<title>Construct Validity of the MSBS</title>
<p>Separate one-way analyses of variance were conducted with the two boredom measures (BPS, MSBS) as the dependent variable. One outlier greater than three standard deviations above the mean was detected on each of PANAS-NA and BPS; these total scores were deleted.</p>
<p>The three conditions were not significantly different on the BPS, <italic>F</italic>(2, 71) = 0.18, <italic>p</italic> = .84, η<sup>2</sup> = .01 (USB <italic>M</italic> = 98.00, <italic>SD</italic> = 15.95; OSB <italic>M</italic> = 95.25, <italic>SD</italic> = 17.04; NB <italic>M</italic> = 97.24, <italic>SD</italic> = 16.57). However, there were significant differences between the groups on the MSBS, <italic>F</italic>(2, 72) = 5.13, <italic>p</italic> = .01, η<sup>2</sup> = .13. Specifically, post hoc comparisons (Tukey’s honestly significant difference) indicated that participants in the USB condition (<italic>M</italic> = 115.36, <italic>SD</italic> = 34.90) and OSB condition (<italic>M</italic> = 111.16, <italic>SD</italic> = 39.97) had significantly higher state boredom scores than those in the NB condition (<italic>M</italic> = 86.56, <italic>SD</italic> = 26.88), <italic>p</italic> = .01 and <italic>p</italic> = .04, respectively. The USB and OSB conditions were not significantly different from one another on MSBS.</p>
<p>These results indicate that although the BPS is not sensitive to detecting differences in state boredom, the MSBS is able to detect such differences.</p>

<sec id="section47-1073191111421303">
<title>Incremental Validity of the MSBS</title>
<p>Using experimental condition as the dependent variable, hierarchical logistic regression was used to investigate whether MSBS scores could predict group membership (bored vs. not bored)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1073191111421303">4</xref></sup> over and above trait boredom, negative affect, and depression. BPS, PANAS-NA, and CESD were entered in Step 1, and MSBS was entered in Step 2. Results indicated that BPS, PANAS-NA, and CESD, together, did not significantly predict membership in the bored condition (χ<sup>2</sup> = 0.62, degrees of freedom [<italic>df</italic>] = 3, <italic>p</italic> = .893, Nagelkerke <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = .01). However, when MSBS was added to the model, the set of predictors did significantly predict membership in the bored condition (χ<sup>2</sup> = 18.93, <italic>df</italic> = 4, <italic>p</italic> = .001, Nagelkerke <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = .32). In particular, the logistic regression coefficient for the MSBS was significant, <italic>b</italic> = 0.06, odds ratio = 1.06, Wald = 10.89, <italic>p</italic> = .001, indicating that higher MSBS scores were associated with a greater likelihood of membership in the boredom condition. Thus, the MSBS clearly has predictive utility over and above measures of trait boredom, negative affect, and depression.</p>

<title>General Discussion</title>
<p>Although historically boredom has received relatively little consideration in the psychological literature compared with other types of negative experience, there is growing interest in studying boredom. Perhaps more crucially, there is growing awareness of the need to understand this common and often detrimental experience. Thus, the new pan-theoretical definition of boredom, the development of the MSBS, and the conceptual clarity achieved through the present work all represent valuable contributions to this area of study. Indeed, we have proposed a definition of the state of “boredom” that is comprehensive and grounded in empirical observation and existing theory. We have also described the development of the MSBS—the first and only full-scale measure of state boredom—which was demonstrated to have good reliability and validity. It is our belief that this scale will have many fruitful applications in the study of boredom.</p>
<sec id="section49-1073191111421303">
<title>Integrating Our Definition of Boredom Within Broader Theoretical Models</title>
<p>Defining boredom as we have as <italic>the aversive experience of having an unfulfilled desire to be engaged in satisfying activity</italic> integrates the experience of boredom within broader psychological models such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-1073191111421303">White’s (1959)</xref> theory of <italic>effectance motivation</italic> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1073191111421303">Nakamura and Csikszentmihalyi’s (2003)</xref> concept of <italic>vital engagement</italic>, which emphasize “engagement” as an important type of motivation or drive. Such integration further confirms the utility of our definition, illustrates that boredom is related to foundationally important human drives, and allows boredom to be researched in a larger psychological context.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-1073191111421303">White (1959)</xref> created his theory of effectance motivation as a solution to the inability of existing drive theories of motivation to account for exploratory behavior and needs for novelty and mastery. Based on a synthesis of trends in animal psychology, psychoanalytic ego psychology, developmental psychology, and personality psychology, White constructed the concept of <italic>competence</italic>, which he defines as “an organism’s capacity to interact effectively with its environment” (p. 297). He argues that competence is pursued because of <italic>effectance motivation</italic>, which is not a deficit motive but a process-oriented motive that “aims for <italic>the feeling of efficacy</italic>, not for the vitally important learnings that come as its consequence” (p. 323). Thus, effectance motivation involves intentional, persistent action that is initiated “for the sole reward of engaging in it” (p. 323, italics added). The concepts of competence and effectance motivation emphasize humans’ desire for satisfying interactions with their environment. As such, they are highly related to the concept of disengagement in boredom.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1073191111421303">Nakamura and Csikszentmihalyi’s (2003)</xref> <italic>vital engagement</italic> is also consistent with the definition of boredom as disengagement from satisfying activity. Within the context of the study of optimal development, they construe vital engagement as a type of relationship to the world involving “a strong felt connection” or a “completeness of involvement or participation” with an object or activity in work, love, or play (p. 87). The engagement is considered “vital” in the sense that the relationship is felt to be meaningful or important and in that an individual experiences in-the-moment vitality during a successful interaction. In other words, the sense of connection and involvement leads to enjoyment and absorption, otherwise known as <italic>flow</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1073191111421303">Csikszentmihalyi, 1975/2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1073191111421303">1997</xref>). Thus, a vitally engaged relationship “is characterized <italic>both</italic> by experiences of flow (enjoyed absorption) <italic>and</italic> by meaning (subjective significance)” (Nakamura &amp; Csikszentmihalyi, p. 87, italics added). This relationship endures over a long period of time: Such individuals do not simply have separate flow experiences but participate in “a flow activity with which they have become heavily identified and to which they have sustained a long commitment” (p. 89). In other words, given that flow can occur “in virtually <italic>any</italic> interaction, even the most trivial” (p. 90, italics added), it is imperative that the flow activity be valued by the individual, provide a sense of meaning, or serve a larger purpose.</p>

<title>Utility of the MSBS</title>
<p>Given the growing body of literature linking boredom with a variety of psychological, medical, and social problems (see introductory paragraphs), the immediate potential applications of a measure of state boredom are readily apparent. However, up until this point, researchers have resorted to creating provisional measures of state boredom (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1073191111421303">Cherrier, Small, Komo, &amp; La Rue, 1997</xref>), resulting in a lack of standardization across studies as well as the use of scales that are typically not grounded in theory and have unknown psychometric properties. Furthermore, many theories on the causes and consequences of boredom specifically pertain to state boredom, and yet in the absence of a measure of state boredom, researchers have employed cross-sectional studies with the BPS, a trait measure. The trait of boredom, however, may not be a good proxy for the state of boredom. Thus, a measure of state boredom will better allow for experimental investigations into the potential causes and consequences of boredom. These are vitally important steps forward for the study of boredom that were not possible prior to a well-grounded and psychometrically sound measure of state boredom.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section51-1073191111421303">
<title>The Relation Between Trait and State Boredom</title>
<p>State boredom is a concrete experience that is situated in time. That is, we feel bored now or we felt bored yesterday during the lecture. In contrast, the propensity to experience boredom is an abstraction that never actually occurs: It is a retrospective summary of past concrete, situated experiences. When a person declares herself to be prone to boredom, she is claiming that she <italic>frequently</italic> experiences boredom or that she <italic>possesses the qualities that predispose</italic> her to experience boredom <italic>given the right circumstances</italic>. In either case, such claims are predicated on the ability to identify discrete, concrete experiences of boredom. That is, we cannot say whether or not someone is prone to boredom without first being able to say if someone is bored. If the propensity to boredom means frequently experiencing boredom, then we need to be able to measure and count instances of boredom. If the propensity to boredom means possessing the qualities that put one at risk for experiencing boredom, then we need to determine what psychological characteristics correlate with instances of boredom.</p>
<p>In short, we feel it is premature to develop the concept of boredom propensity in the absence of a clear definition and way to measure the actual boredom experience. Thus, we argue that the MSBS is a potentially foundational tool for the study of both state boredom and boredom proneness. Armed with a clear, universally applicable definition of the experience of boredom and a reliable, well-validated measure of boredom, it is now possible to more fully articulate and understand the concept of boredom proneness. For example, to the best of our knowledge, no study has systematically investigated how boredom-prone individuals are affected by situations that are liable to trigger acute episodes of boredom. Perhaps personality and the situation interact alternatively; perhaps each contributes independent effects to the experience of boredom. Such fundamental questions can now be explored with a measure of state boredom.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section52-1073191111421303">
<title>Limitations and Future Research</title>
<p>There are a few limitations of the MSBS that should be noted. First, some researchers may find 29 items somewhat long for their specific research purposes. The necessity of a longer scale was dictated by the multidimensionality of the construct; however, future research could investigate the possibility of a valid short form of the MSBS. Second, the MSBS items are all positively keyed. This was done to avoid confusing participants and to avoid artificially creating a factor structure based on direction of wording (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1073191111421303">DeVellis, 2003</xref>); however, a scale with all positively keyed items is vulnerable to acquiescence bias. Another limitation is that the conceptualization of boredom, development of the scale, and the ensuing scale validation studies were all conducted with a young, fairly educated adult sample. Thus, researchers should be cautious when using the MSBS in populations with different demographic characteristics. Future research could examine the validity of the MSBS in different samples, including clinical populations.</p>
<p>In light of the growing interest in studying boredom, the present research represents a valuable contribution to the field. Not only is our definition and conceptualization of boredom both comprehensive and well-grounded in theory and empirical observation, but the subsequent development of the boredom instrument improves on existing measures. Thus, as a well-validated, multidimensional measure of state boredom, we hope that the MSBS will give rise to many useful applications in psychological research.</p>

<p>We recognize that some theorists would prefer to define boredom as always and only including low arousal. In our view, however, this would not capture the full, dynamic quality of boredom. Furthermore, our reading of the literature suggests that the majority of theorists would claim that boredom includes both high and low arousal. Finally, by developing a multidimensional state boredom scale, the issue of high and low arousal can be experimentally investigated, and if they so desire, researchers can choose to omit the high arousal factor.</p>
