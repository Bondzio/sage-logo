These studies suggest that video-cases can help students become more reflective and can help bridge the gap between theory and practice. With a myriad of school music rehearsals posted online in places such as YouTube, it seems advantageous to use this free and easily accessible content to stimulate thought and discussion in undergraduate music education classes. This article first discusses the process of reflective thinking and its importance to preservice teacher education. Next are implications for using video-cases to help preservice music teachers critically examine their beliefs and shift their focus from themselves to their students.

<title>Reflective Thinking</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1057083712437041">Dewey (1933/1991)</xref> described reflective thinking as “active, persistent and careful consideration of any belief or supposed form of knowledge in light of the grounds that support it and further conclusions to which it tends” (p. 9). The process of considering these previously formed assumptions in the context of a newly encountered situation involves what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1057083712437041">Schön (1987)</xref> calls, <italic>reflection-in-action</italic>. This process involves building new understandings to inform our actions as the situation is unfolding. When an old way of doing something does not work in a given situation, the reflective practitioner reflects-in-action to apply a new way of thinking to the problem and adjust the approach in the moment. This process is informed by the “real-time” questioning of our tacit knowledge to reexamine the foundational beliefs on which our actions are based. Similar to reflection-in-action is what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1057083712437041">Schön (1983)</xref> calls reflection-on-action—that is, reflecting on an experience afterward and challenging previously held assumptions that the experience might have called into question. “We reflect <italic>on</italic> action, by thinking back on what we have done in order to discover how our knowing-in-action may have contributed to an unexpected outcome” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1057083712437041">Schön, 1983</xref>, p. 26).</p>

<title>Importance of Reflective Thinking to Music Teacher Education</title>
<p>As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1057083712437041">Smith (2005)</xref> points out, students do not come to teacher education programs as blank slates willing to unquestioningly accept “facts” and dispositions from teacher educators. By the time students enter their teacher education programs, they have already been influenced by years of what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1057083712437041">Lortie (1975)</xref> termed <italic>apprenticeship of observation</italic>. During this time they have observed their teachers and begun to develop their own understandings of the teaching and learning process. The literature shows that preservice teachers enter teacher education programs with specific preconceived ideas about the profession (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1057083712437041">Hutchinson, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1057083712437041">Sweeney, 1984</xref>), and that these preconceptions influence their future actions in the classroom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1057083712437041">Marks, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1057083712437041">Sweeney, 1984</xref>). These preconceptions about the profession and the student’s role as a teacher are largely formed as a result of prior experiences as a student (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1057083712437041">Asam, 1999</xref>). This often affects whether they choose to accept or reject future teacher education experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1057083712437041">Steen, 1985</xref>). One way in which music teacher educators can help students critically examine these preconceptions is through the use of case studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1057083712437041">Abrahams &amp; Head, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1057083712437041">Atterbury &amp; Richardson, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1057083712437041">Bailey, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1057083712437041">Brinson, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1057083712437041">Conway, 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1057083712437041">1999a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1057083712437041">1999b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1057083712437041">Hourigan, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1057083712437041">Lind, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1057083712437041">Richardson, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1057083712437041">Thaller et al., 1993</xref>).</p>
<p>Case studies<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1057083712437041">1</xref></sup> have been used in teacher education as a guided opportunity for preservice teachers to explore and reflect on critical issues encountered in classroom scenarios. This usually involves preservice teachers reading material that illustrates various teaching situations on which they are then asked to reflect and discuss critically. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1057083712437041">Richardson (1997)</xref> contends that the most compelling reason for including case studies in the undergraduate teacher education courses is the discussions that may result (pp. 20-21). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1057083712437041">Conway (1999a)</xref> points out that researchers in music teacher education often support using case studies for teaching since they may help students develop critical analysis and problem-solving skills. Additionally, she notes that case studies can encourage these young teachers to become more reflective, analyze complex situations, and develop a community of learners (p. 20).</p>
<p>Through the use of case studies, teacher educators can present situations to students for which they have no prior context. Such situations can perplex the student and cause the student to think reflectively. This can be enhanced in a group situation where a variety of student experiences can be invoked to provide fodder for conversation and lead to further reflective thinking. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1057083712437041">Younker (2002)</xref> explains,
<disp-quote>
<p>Inseparably tied to the individuality of reflective thinking is the concept of funding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1057083712437041">Dewey, 1991</xref>). One person, because of previous experiences, may encounter a situation in which no element of doubt is found, while another may encounter the situation, and because of lack of relevant experiences from which to draw, experience a doubt or perplexity. A person who is experiencing doubt or perplexity will think reflectively in an attempt to arrive at a solution. (p. 163)</p>

<p>Case studies used in education contexts have traditionally been presented in written form. More recently, educational researchers have begun to explore the use of video to present such cases and to promote reflection in preservice teachers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1057083712437041">Abell et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1057083712437041">Barrett &amp; Rasmussen, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1057083712437041">Boling, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1057083712437041">Kale, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1057083712437041">Liedtka, 2001</xref>; Nagarajan, 2007; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1057083712437041">Ralston, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1057083712437041">Smith, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1057083712437041">Stockero, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1057083712437041">Yadav, 2006</xref>). When describing the advantages of their own video-case design, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1057083712437041">Barrett and Rasmussen (1996)</xref> found that the simultaneous and multiple dimensions of sound, image, speech, and action captured through video afford students a much richer experience than could be had through narrative only (p. 79).</p>

<title>Critical Examination of Beliefs</title>
<p>Teacher education researchers suggest video-cases can give teacher educators a tool with which to challenge student assumptions and help students critically examine their beliefs and values about teaching and learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1057083712437041">Abell et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1057083712437041">Bailey, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1057083712437041">Boling, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1057083712437041">Yadav, 2006</xref>). By examining our foundational beliefs through conversation with our peers in the context that video-case studies can provide, students learn, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1057083712437041">Paul (1993)</xref> suggests, not just <italic>what</italic> to think but also <italic>how</italic> and <italic>why</italic> to think.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1057083712437041">Abell et al. (1998)</xref> found that video-cases helped uncover inconsistencies in students’ thinking and concluded that case studies caused students to question previously held assumptions and theories (p. 505). Such a finding supports <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1057083712437041">Younker’s (2002)</xref> writing on the value of funded experience in a group setting to inspire reflective thinking. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1057083712437041">Boling (2007)</xref> indicated that viewing and discussing video-cases encouraged students to reflect on their prior experiences and examine their assumptions and beliefs. By viewing instances of teaching that differed from their own personal experiences, students began to consider alternative points of view and problematize previously unquestioned beliefs. Through helping students to reflect and examine critically how their actions affect student learning, teacher educators can use video-cases to help <italic>educate</italic> reflective practitioners who learn and grow throughout their careers, rather than <italic>train</italic> workers who risk repeating their first year multiple times.</p>

<title>Shifting Focus From Teacher to Learner</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1057083712437041">Barrett and Rasmussen (1996)</xref> led preservice teachers through a general music activity and asked them to indicate what they learned from that activity. The students then watched a video-case of a veteran music teacher conducting the same activity with his elementary music class. Finally, the students observed the same music teacher talking aloud as he watched a video-case of another music teacher conducting the same lesson.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>This hall of mirrors offered the students multiple representations of the same lesson sequence and musical content while shifting the participants’ frame of reference. We hoped that the shift would reveal longstanding but unquestioned assumptions about teaching and learning, assumptions that could be addressed, confronted, and contemplated by others. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1057083712437041">Barrett &amp; Rasmussen, 1996</xref>, p. 79)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The researchers found that this process helped the preservice teachers shift their focus from teacher knowledge, skills, and content to characteristics of the learners. Similar to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1057083712437041">Barrett and Rasmussen (1996)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1057083712437041">Stockero’s (2006)</xref> results suggested that math-methods students who were taught using video-cases showed a greater focus on students, a greater ability to analyze teaching in terms of how it affects student thinking, and a greater tendency to ground their analyses in evidence.</p>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1057083712437041">Fuller’s (1969)</xref> model of teacher development, preservice teachers initially focus on their delivery, gradually shift their attention to content, and ultimately to student learning. Researchers exploring the use of video-case studies in teacher education have found that video-cases may be useful in helping preservice teachers direct their attention from their teaching to their students’ learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1057083712437041">Abell et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1057083712437041">Barrett &amp; Rasmussen, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1057083712437041">Stockero, 2006</xref>). Through video-cases, teachers can help students begin to analyze teaching in terms of how it affects student understanding. While this would not necessarily create a change in the students’ focus, it might allow the students to better understand what the learners are experiencing, which may be a preliminary step in transitioning one’s focus from delivery to learning.</p>

<sec id="section5-1057083712437041">
<title>Effectively Structuring Video-Case Experiences</title>
<p>In studying the use of video-cases in the development of reflective thinking skills, some researchers have examined the effect of <italic>structure</italic> on those experiences. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1057083712437041">Bailey (2000)</xref> found that the most effective cases for inspiring reflective judgment (a) were based on real classroom situations, (b) contained material that was dissonant with students’ beliefs and assumptions about teaching and learning, and (c) required resolution of potential problems found in music classrooms. The finding that the most effective cases for inspiring reflective thinking were based on non-fictional classroom situations runs contrary to claims made by past researchers who have suggested that effective case studies may be fictional (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1057083712437041">Leglar &amp; Collay, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1057083712437041">Merriam, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1057083712437041">Richardson, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>Regarding scaffolding, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1057083712437041">Ralston (2003)</xref> found that students sharpen their reflective thinking skills more effectively in a highly structured experience of video-cases where they are required to (a) characterize the issues that define the case, (b) discuss the varied perspectives within the case, (c) analyze critically the multiple sources of knowledge within the case, (d) consider a variety of actions to address the issues at hand, and (e) discuss the consequences and broader social outcomes of the decisions and actions taken.</p>
<p>More precisely, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1057083712437041">Nagarajan (2006)</xref> suggested that using cognitive questions to scaffold students’ understanding of the cases promotes declarative knowledge about the situation being observed, whereas using metacognitive questioning sharpens students’ case interpretation skills. It is contingent on the teacher educator to assess whether the need at the moment is one of comprehension or of synthesis.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Research seems to suggest that case studies are effective tools for helping preservice teachers sharpen their reflective skills, critically examine their previous beliefs, and shift their focus from teacher to learner. However, we should keep these findings in perspective. While case studies can play a part in helping students to become reflective and critical, the inherent weakness in studies that purport such findings is that they all involve some level of self-study. It is often difficult to obtain high-quality data when that process involves the assessment of one’s own work. The situation is further complicated when the participants are also the researcher’s students. The danger in such research is that the researcher will subconsciously find what she or he is looking for, and that the students will filter their responses.</p>
<p>In addition to the way some researchers in this area have collected data, one should also be cautious of the validity of many of the research designs. Such designs sometimes only assess the interaction between case study engagement and preservice teachers’ perceptions, rather than the effect of case study use on inservice teachers’ actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1057083712437041">Leglar &amp; Collay, 2002</xref>). They point out that there is limited research on the relationship between the use of case-based instruction in the teacher education program and the performance of program graduates in the classroom (p. 863). The field needs more studies that examine the relationship between case study and teacher action.</p>
<p>Teacher educators who choose to use case studies as part of their instructional techniques need to ensure that the students understand the purpose of engaging with the case and that the activity does not spiral downward into a dualistic assessment of <italic>right way versus wrong way</italic>, which could prevent students from seeing the complexities of the classroom. While case studies can be a powerful tool, they can also “bore students to tears, entertain without educating, and become a source of unintentional comic relief to students and frustration to faculty” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1057083712437041">Liedtka, 2001</xref>, p. 419). It is incumbent on the teacher educator to present and guide such activities in a way that compels healthy reflection and examination.</p>
<p>Concluding that there is merit in using case studies to affect preservice teacher reflection, one must then ponder the use of <italic>video-</italic>cases over the more traditional written narrative. Technology is a tool to be used in education only if it enhances student understanding; otherwise it is simply a novelty. Many would argue that video-cases involve more human senses than does written narrative, and thus increases the level of personal engagement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1057083712437041">Barrett &amp; Rasmussen, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1057083712437041">Liedtka, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1057083712437041">Smith, 2005</xref>). Perhaps the words of a preservice teacher put it best:
<disp-quote>
<p>In our class we watched different video-cases, and we discussed them. We were not just reading the textbook. We had an actual real-life student struggling with something and working with her has made the most difference for me. Being able to have examples of various students with various problems and seeing how that is handled and then discussing it, is so much more than just reading a book about it. You can actually talk about it and there is a visual and there is concrete evidence, not just an example on a piece of paper.

<p>Based on the findings from the literature and the conclusions in this article, I recommend several actions for those interested in using video-cases in the undergraduate music education classroom: (a) use sites such as YouTube to find music rehearsals by professional music teachers and student music teachers; (b) with permission of all involved, view recordings of student teachers from other institutions; and (c) access sources such as Skype to watch live music rehearsals. For those interested in researching the use of video-cases within teacher education, I recommend structuring studies in ways that explore not just the impact of video-cases on students’ perceptions but also, and perhaps more important, the impact on students’ future actions. Finally, missing from the literature on video-cases are studies that explore the use of real-time music teaching where music education students could interact and dialogue with the teacher and student participants.</p>

<p>The term <italic>case</italic> can refer to both a form of research design (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1057083712437041">Merriam, 2009</xref>) and an illustrative narrative designed for educational problem solving and critical reflection practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1057083712437041">Conway, 1999a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1057083712437041">Richardson, 1997</xref>). For the purposes of this article, the terms <italic>case study</italic> and <italic>video-case</italic> will be used as they apply to educational use—that is, both fictional and nonfictional narratives (written and otherwise) that describe a moment or situation for educational purposes.</p>
