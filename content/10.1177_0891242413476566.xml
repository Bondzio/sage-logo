<p>Since the mortgage meltdown, the dysfunctions of the financial sector have become a topic of much discussion in the public sphere. But the discourse has largely framed the problems of banking as something that occurs at a moment of crisis in history to be hastily resolved. However, certain segments of the population, such as poor and working-class persons, experience the dysfunctions of the financial sector as something chronic, a long-term daily condition. More specifically, the problem of exclusion from mainstream services relegates the poor and inner-city residents to more costly and lower quality fringe banking services.</p>
<p>Grounded in institutional theories and community- and poverty-based theories, Jerry Buckland’s <italic>Hard Choices: Financial Exclusion, Fringe Banks, and Poverty in Urban Canada</italic> (2012, University of Toronto Press, 270 pp.) argues that financial exclusion is not the result of any one particular factor, but rather a confluence of three phenomena: consumer choice, banking practices, and government policy. In Canada, this occurs within a broader context of rising income inequality and debt-driven economic growth, which places finance in the awkward position of being a leading sector that is not labor intensive and does not itself produce goods.</p>
<p>These phenomena will seem familiar to readers outside of Canada; in fact, Canada’s financial trends look relatively mild compared with that of the United States and some European nations. And compared with other countries, Canada is financially inclusive (only 3% of its adults are unbanked). Still Buckland makes a persuasive argument that Canada’s banking system is in dire need of reform, and the lessons he draws from the data are applicable not only to Canada but also to many of its peer nations.</p>
<p>One of the most appealing aspects of <italic>Hard Choices</italic> is that Buckland analyzes both the supply- and demand-sides of financial exclusion. On the supply side, commercial banks have pulled out of inner cities because of asymmetric information and because the size of transactions is so small it is not seen as profitable. Meanwhile, fringe banks and other financial institutions—including payday lenders, check-cashing agencies, and pawn shops—have grown exponentially to fill the void left by mainstream banks.</p>
<p>On the demand side, a survey of low-income residents of three inner-city neighborhoods—Toronto’s Parkdale, Vancouver’s Downtown Eastside, and Winnipeg’s inner city—finds them to be skillful financial managers: at least in the short term, which is what their circumstances confine them to.</p>
<p>When seeking financial institutions to facilitate that management of finances, inner-city residents take into consideration access, fees, product design, services, and staff culture. Not all of these factors are surprising, but Buckland does not simply take them for granted. Instead, he explores each factor carefully to ascertain its less obvious implications. For example, regarding access, Buckland explains that inner-city residents’ problems of getting into banks is not only a spatial phenomenon (a fact that has been well documented in other studies) but also a temporal one, as many inner-city residents’ work schedules do not allow for bank visits during traditional banking hours; hence, the extended hours of fringe banks are attractive.</p>
<p>Regarding fees, Buckland explains that the labor-intensive nature of fringe banks and the small size of transactions (as well as the inability to defray those costs with deposits) result in high interest rates. Fringe bank customers are aware of the fact that they are paying more, but that they find those costs outweighed by the benefits of fringe banking. Furthermore, some fringe bank customers feel that although the costs are higher, those costs are at least transparent and easy to anticipate, as opposed to mainstream banks’ “hidden fees.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, mainstream banks’ product designs are problematic because they require forms of identification that some low-income persons do not possess. Furthermore, mainstream processing times are slower than those of fringe banks—a very important factor for persons often living on the margins of subsistence. Finally, secret shopper studies of mainstream banks corroborate low-income persons’ allegations of disrespect and discrimination from mainstream staff.</p>
<p>These findings show that inner-city residents’ patronage of fringe banks is not irrational; it simply reflects the limitations of their choices. This is not to say that fringe banks are highly esteemed; in fact, when asked to rate the overall quality of various institutions, Buckland’s respondents put fringe banks at the bottom (credit unions and community banks ranked highest). Thus, there is not a strong sentiment of customer loyalty for fringe banks, and Buckland’s respondents are quick to switch over to mainstream services when they better serve their needs. In fact, many persons rely on both mainstream and fringe services at the same time.</p>
<p>Having addressed these three issues, Buckland pinpoints the “ethically troublesome” nature of this two-tier banking system, where low-income people are paying higher prices for lower quality services than do middle-income persons at mainstream banks. Buckland does not shy away from calling this exploitation, but he persuasively argues that such exploitation “has more to do with the lack of general support from social and economic institutions” than predation from fringe banks. Thus, the problem is not simply solved by regulating or sanctioning fringe banks; a more fundamental and pervasive (and more difficult) change is necessary. This brief but essential discussion is one of the book’s most important contributions, and it is the logical basis for an in-depth discussion of what his findings mean for policy and practice.</p>
<p>Buckland begins this discussion with an overview of the full spectrum of options available: radical change, reform, or maintain the status quo. The first has its merits but is politically unrealistic. Buckland thoroughly debunks the status quo argument, insisting that a Panglossian perspective is inimical not only to the interests of the poor but also to society at large. Thus, we are left with one option: reform.</p>
<p>Buckland reviews three categories of reform policies: banking regulations, consumer protection, and government services. For example, he asserts that current requirements are inadequate and enforcement is too weak. Meanwhile, there needs to be more citizen education about people’s rights as financial customers.</p>
<p>Clearly the measures mentioned so far would require more government involvement. But Buckland also sees a proactive role for banks to play, rather than just waiting for the government to change them. But doing so might still require government involvement—in the form of incentives, such as a financial exclusion fund, which itself would be financed from a tax on bank revenue and would be used to foster outreach into inner-city areas.</p>
<p>Buckland also sees a role for civil society, advocating for low-income bankers. He also calls for partnerships between community organizations and credit unions or commercial banks to improve outreach to the inner city.</p>
<p>Overall, <italic>Hard Choices</italic> is a well-written, important contribution to our understanding of how financial exclusion happens and its implications. There are just two concerns with the book that, although not negating the value of its contributions, call attention to the need for further research on this topic. The first of these concerns is the paucity of data available. Buckland himself notes the dearth of quantitative data on financial exclusion at the national level. He tries to fill in gaps with his own fieldwork, but the small sample size of his survey leaves questions regarding generalizability, and inhibits the possibilities of studying subsegments of the population within the inner city. And when Buckland offers empirical evidence of solutions being enacted to address financial exclusion, we only get four brief case studies and anecdotal mentions of other programs around the world. This probably speaks to the lack of solutions being enacted at this time, but the merit of these efforts would be more convincing if we had more in-depth information about their impact.</p>
<p>Another concern is the basic assumption of the book, which is that financial inclusion is beneficial. Improving financial inclusion of the poor also means increasing their exposure to risk. Such risk might be manageable for persons at higher levels of income, but it is potentially disastrous for low-income persons. At the same time, Buckland asserts that banking to the poor can be profitable but provides little evidence of such. In fact, the case studies he discusses in Chapter 5 are dependent on grants and donations. Evidence from microfinance institutions shows that banking to the poor can indeed be profitable but that it often comes at a very high price to the poor, who must pay interest rates even higher than the ones Buckland currently finds in Canada’s inner cities.</p>
<p>These concerns give us cause for more research on the finer details of financial exclusion and the merits of programs that seek to address it. Meanwhile, Buckland has provided us with valuable insights regarding the supply and demand factors of exclusion, as well as important ideas for discussion on how to counteract exclusion.</p>
