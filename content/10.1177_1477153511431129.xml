<abstract>
<p>This paper focuses on the development of an energy-efficient street lighting remote management system making use of low-rate wireless personal area networks and the digital addressable lighting interface (DALI) protocol to get the bidirectional communication necessary for checking lamp parameters like lamp status, current level, etc. Because of the fact that two-thirds of the installed street lighting systems use old and inefficient technologies, there exists a huge potential to renew street lighting and save energy consumption. The proposed system uses the DALI protocol in street lighting, increasing the maximum number of ballasts that can be controlled with DALI – originally it can only drive up to 64 ballasts. Some aspects of the wireless communication system and experimental measurements are presented and discussed.</p>

<p>Smart Grid is a term referring to the next generation power grid in which the electricity distribution and management are upgraded by incorporating advanced communications and capabilities for improved control, efficiency, reliability and safety. The Smart Grid is expected to affect all areas of the electric power system, from generation to transmission, distribution and end-user consumers and citizens and their electric vehicles, street lighting services and other household devices. Among all the fields covered by the Smart Grid (renewable energies, smart metering, electric vehicles, etc.), street lighting is one of the aspects which is still using very old and inefficient technologies. The energy consumption of street lighting can be greatly decreased by applying the new information and communication technologies.</p>
<p>A lighting installation is an important energy consumption source that is affected by factors such as regulation and maintenance. The International Energy Agency (IEA) has estimated that the potential energy savings by influencing the use and the technology of lighting are at approximately 133–212 TWh/year globally. The corresponding reduction of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions is about 86–137 MT/year for IEA countries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1477153511431129">1</xref></sup> Consumption can be reduced by 15–20% and more (in the service sector alone) with existing technology. A recent study carried out for the European Commission<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1477153511431129">2</xref></sup> has shown that between 30% and 50% of electricity used for lighting could be saved by investing in energy-efficient lighting systems. Not only is the investment profitable, but it can also improve lighting quality.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1477153511431129">3</xref></sup> Streetlights and other forms of outdoor lighting are recommended to be made more efficient to reduce CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, including cleaner options for electricity generation. A broad scenario that would bring together more energy-efficient buildings where smart electric meters are combined with smart appliances could shift electricity use from peak to off-peak periods.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1477153511431129">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Two-thirds of the currently installed street lighting systems still use antiquated and wasteful technologies, that is, there exists a huge potential to renew existing street lighting and save energy consumption.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1477153511431129">5</xref></sup> It is estimated that nearly 5% of the energy used in lighting applications is consumed by street lighting, being the most important component of energy use in a city.</p>
<p>New industrial approaches have been recently developed to achieve efficient lighting, which can be summarized as improvements in lamp technology and electronic ballasts, soft start systems, noiseless performance and lighting automation. The minimum acceptable or legal requirements for lighting controls are different for industry, office, streets or road lighting, but the concept is the same; to deal with the need for a fixed lighting intensity with energy efficiency and at minimum cost in power consumption and in the expected life of the lamp. Consequently, by having an understanding of the lamps, ballasts, luminaires and control options available today as well as the techniques used to develop efficient lighting, lighting can be produced that is energy efficient, cost effective and yielding a better quality.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1477153511431129">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>A lighting system’s cost can be broken down into initial investment, energy cost and maintenance cost. We will analyse the strategies used for optimizing energy cost and their role as data vectors for maintenance work. Initial investment is intended to be treated in depth in future work, by analysing the most relevant aspects of all technologies and protocols existing plus those proposed in this paper.</p>
<p>Traditional energy saving techniques include total or partial shutdown, but these techniques involve a reduction in lighting uniformity and have a very strong impact on lamp life expectancy. There are some recommended measures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1477153511431129">7</xref></sup> for decreasing electrical energy consumption relevant to public lighting. One of these measures involves controlling the duration of the lighting. The light duration control can be achieved using photocell relays or astronomical time relays.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1477153511431129">8</xref></sup> Photocell relays are switched on and off according to the ambient light level; the main drawback is their low sensitivity to twilight and the presence of clouds, which can cause the relay to turn on earlier. On the other hand, astronomical time relays use a program that is able to follow the sunrise and sunset times. As this time is easily reckoned in every time zone, this kind of relay offers a more accurate timing. A second measure is the reduction of the light output (dimming) for the hours with reduced traffic through a decrease of the voltage applied to the lamp, resulting in a decrease in the electrical energy consumption. Another proposed measure is a street classification compliant with international standards and the establishment of the light technical parameters based on this classification, such as the utilization of high-performance lamps and lighting devices. Another proposal consists of adopting a special price for the electricity consumed by public lighting at night. The last measure is the installation of smart dimmable electronic ballasts which should be able to auto-detect lamp and electrical failures, measure and send data, such as lamp status, lamp level, power consumption, voltage, current and power factor, and able to receive switch and dimming commands from a streetlight segment controller.</p>
<p>Owing to the fact that it is necessary to keep the lighting uniform, the control systems are reduced to two possibilities: lamp posts with two lamps or a single lamp that is fully controllable. In the first case, one lamp can be switched off during the late night and early morning hours. In the second, the single lamp needs to be attached to a dimming system. This last method has two practical options: step dimming ballasts and centralized control systems like line voltage regulators. There also exist remote management systems that allow the user to control and monitor every single lamp. By making use of these systems, the operator can monitor the main parameters of any light point from a central or mobile unit. The obtained data are ready for processing, allowing the reckoning of statistical consumption, lamp status, voltages, anomalies, etc., thereby decreasing the mean time to repair. Another interesting parameter could be the arc voltage level, which can mean the change of a corrective or preventive maintenance to a predictive one, saving money in the maintenance cost.</p>
<p>In order to have optimum control, the remote management system should allow bidirectional communication (full duplex or half duplex) between the user and the ballast; otherwise, we could not know the lighting status. The management system is implemented using a communication system and a lighting control protocol. The communication system can be wired, such as Ethernet, optical fibre and power line carrier or wireless. Among the last group, we have GSM/GPRS, RF, Wi-Fi™, WiMAX™, IEEE 802.15.4™ and ZigBee™, among others. Both IEEE 802.15.4 and ZigBee have brought about the boom of wireless sensor networks (WSNs).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1477153511431129">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1477153511431129">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>A WSN consists of tiny sensor nodes, sink nodes, an information transport network and personal computers (PCs). Usually, WSN architecture consists of three layers: the physical layer, the medium access control (MAC) layer and the application layer. The IEEE 802.15.4 standard deals with low-rate wireless personal area networks (WPANs); its aim is to standardize the two lower layers of the open systems interconnection protocol stack, i.e. physical and MAC layers. It only considers star and peer-to-peer network topologies. On the other hand, ZigBee defines the upper layers, network and application layers; its main contribution is to provide the ability of forming cluster, tree and mesh network topologies to IEEE 802.15.4 applications.</p>
<p>As for the lighting control protocol, it can be chosen between an open protocol, like TCP/IP, BACNet™, DMX 512™, LONWorks™, X-10™, 0-10 V or DALI™, or proprietary. DALI stands for digital addressable lighting interface; it was defined by annex E.4 of IEC 60929 as a digital signal controller for control interface ballasts of tubular fluorescent lamps and modified by IEC 62386, which also integrates other applications for DALI apart from lighting and extends the kind of lamp to high-intensity discharge (HID), halogens, incandescent, LEDs, etc.</p>
<p>This paper focuses on developing a street lighting management system by making use of WSNs and DALI ballasts. Materials used in the system are described and results of tests and measurements are presented.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-1477153511431129"><title>2. Background</title>
<p>Several scientific approaches have been carried out in order to take WSN’s advantages to the street lighting systems, for example, the development of a wireless control system based on ZigBee.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1477153511431129">11</xref></sup> The aim is to overcome the drawbacks of a group-based control scheme, designing a street lighting control system which is able to perform an individual light control. They take into consideration the use of power line communication (PLC) or ZigBee as the communication system, describing and comparing their characteristics and finally choosing ZigBee due to PLC’s disadvantages, like the price of remote controllers and the lack of a communication way when a short-circuit problem appears. Their system allows the user to control and monitor the state of the lighting, but they do not focus on the energy efficiency, just the maintenance and the removal of wires in public areas for saving people from electrical shocks.</p>
<p>Another more complex example of WSN applied to street lighting is the development of a system that consists of sensor nodes placed in streetlight poles and a sink node in a transformer station which controls every sensor node placed in a pole that belongs to that transformer station. The information of any sink node is sent to the control centre via GPRS. The system also has individual or bank dimming up to 60% in order to save energy consumption. A good advance of the proposed system is the combined use of individual node identification addresses along with a geographic information system (GIS). GIS allows the graphical display of any individual node position, making it possible to know about the position and status of any lamp.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1477153511431129">12</xref></sup> In a later work, a simple but effective routing protocol has been proposed, in which it is not necessary to take into consideration the network topology formation and this is suitable for street lighting network characteristics.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1477153511431129">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>Another proposal sets out the main features of a WSN to be used as a street lighting control system. These are the ability to handle common street lighting operations like on/off or dimming and the network functions, like neighbour discovery, pairing and forming the network. They use 6LoWPAN™ instead of ZigBee due to routing protocol drawbacks of ZigBee (high end-to-end delay, low packet delivery ratio) and the ease of adapting 6LoWPAN, which does not define routing protocols, to any specific system.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1477153511431129">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>Other approaches have been made to use the DALI protocol in street lighting and integrate it with WSNs. In fact, the DALI protocol was introduced in the project NumeLiTe<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1477153511431129">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1477153511431129">16</xref></sup> for urban lighting applications, but it was not adopted by other manufacturers and it was left to indoor applications, forgetting about its use in public lighting. As regards the use of the DALI protocol with wireless networks, an electronic ballast based on DALI with a ZigBee module for sending commands via radio has been developed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1477153511431129">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>Our contribution is the proposal of applying DALI ballasts controlled with a WSN which expands the number of ballasts that a DALI controller can address. This system also provides a feedback of the lamp and ballast and it has the ability of perform real digital dimming from 60% to 100% (in case of high-pressure sodium (HPS) lamps) in 20 steps.</p>

<sec id="sec4-1477153511431129"><title>3.1. Radio modules</title>
<p>Application in an urban area requires not only a long range, but also the ability to overcome obstacles such as buildings and, more importantly, take into consideration that the node will be probably placed inside a lamp post, where we could find a Faraday cage effect; so, we need a strong RF penetration. This characteristic may rule out normal 2.4 GHz, ISM band 802.15.4 transceivers and makes it a good idea to consider the sub-GHz band, 868 MHz (Europe) or 910 MHz (USA and Canada). Among the commercial modules, the Digi XBee-Pro® 868 RF module<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1477153511431129">18</xref></sup> stands out covering distances of up to 80 km in a line of sight and 550 m in urban areas. In the development of the wireless lighting system, we used the Digi XBee-Pro® 868 RF with an Arduino microcontroller board.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1477153511431129"><title>3.2. Dimmable ballast with DALI interface</title>
<p>The most common lamps used in street lighting are HPS lamps, whose control device’s particular requirements, like any kind of HID lamp, are defined by the IEC 62386-203 standard. In our experiment, we chose HID lamp ballasts with a DALI interface, allowing the desired half duplex communication (a bidirectional communication channel where data can flow in both ways but not simultaneously) to obtain some lamp parameters and so check the status of the lighting system. The ballasts used were the OSRAM Powertronic® PTo DALI 70/220-240 3DIM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1477153511431129">19</xref></sup> with Philips SON 70 W/220 I E27 1CT.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1477153511431129">20</xref></sup> The ballasts are dimmable from 60% to 100% of the lamp input power.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-1477153511431129"><title>3.3. The developed system</title>
<p>DALI is based upon the master–slave principle; the master sends messages (frames) to any slave device in the system. Those messages contain an address and a command. Only the addressed ballast (in the case of individual addressing) will react to the message. A frame sent by the master is called a forward frame; it consists of 19 bits at 1200 bps using a bi-phase encoding (Manchester differential). The first bit is a start bit, the next 8 bits are the slave address and the next eight are the command. There are other 2 bits (stop bits) which are not in the Manchester code. Some commands (query commands) will make the slave react and send a backward frame to the master; this is an 11-bit frame with the same characteristics as the forward frame, one start bit, 8 bits with the response (lamp status, actual dimming level, etc.) and two stop bits. In the address byte of the forward frame, only 6 bits are used for individual addressing. The address byte has the following structure: YAAAAAAS, where Y takes the value ‘0’ when a short address is used and ‘1’ for a group address or broadcast; A is the significant address bit and S is ‘0’ when the command is a direct arc power level command (dimming) or ‘1’ when it is an indirect arc power level, configuration or query command. A master can only have 64 slaves as it can only address 64 directions (six A bits), so DALI is not considered appropriate for street lighting purposes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1477153511431129">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>Our approach consists of connecting the DALI ballast interface to the digital inputs and outputs of the node microcontroller. That way, we have the DALI ballasts as slaves and the nodes as masters, controlled by the PAN coordinator attached to a PC host. The coordinator accesses any DALI ballast using the node MAC (8 bytes) or network (2 bytes) addresses instead of the DALI slave device short address, enhancing the number of connected devices. When the coordinator message reaches the addressed node, the frame is sent from the node to the ballast. One node is only connected to one ballast; so, the address byte of the forward frame can be left in broadcast mode (1111111S), allowing us to forget about DALI addresses and to overcome the 64-device constraint.</p>
<p>A DALI control interface voltage level must consider a voltage between 9.5 V and 22.5 V, a digital high signal, whereas a voltage in the ±6.5 V interval is taken as a digital low signal. As the microcontroller digital outputs are CMOS (0–3.3 V), it is necessary to design an adapting level circuit to take the 3.3 V to the corresponding interval of a high signal. Manufacturers and researchers have developed some kinds of microcontroller–DALI interfaces.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1477153511431129">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1477153511431129"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1477153511431129">23</xref></sup> Our intention is to make a circuit as small and cheap as possible; so, we only use 12 V to supply the DALI ballast control interface. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1477153511431129">Figure 1</xref> shows the adapting level circuit.
<fig id="fig1-1477153511431129" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Adapting level circuit from microcontroller to DALI</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1477153511431129-fig1.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p>Optocoupler U1 deals with the transmission from the node to the ballast, whereas U2 is left in charge of receiving the backward frame when a query message has been sent. To transmit a high signal level, DO1 is put in high, so the LED in U1 is not biased and its phototransistor is open, giving a high level. When DO1 is giving a low level, the LED is biased and the transistor is closed. After receiving a query frame, the ballast enters into active mode and responds with the backward frame; this time, a high signal level in DALI turns into a low level in the microcontroller digital input DI1. The microcontroller program is responsible of inverting this value when reckoning the ballast answer. The microcontroller is also in charge of converting to/from Manchester differential code.</p>
<p>From the individual node point of view, there are only three kinds of DALI frames, according to the way they are sent and whether they require a response or not. That way, an arc power control command is sent only once, whereas a configuration command must be sent twice with a pause between them of less than 100 ms. When a query frame is sent, the node should be ready to receive the backward frame unless the response is ‘No’, where there is not a response.</p>
<p>The RF module only supports point-to-point and point-to-multipoint communications, so the only network topology allowed is the star configuration. In a street lighting system, it is essential that the PAN coordinator can reach any node; this requirement makes the star topology completely useless and so it was required that we modify the network layer a bit to ensure a tree topology. The network layer created is very simple; it consists of storing two tables in the coordinator and in any node of the network. The coordinator’s table contains information on any node and is stored in the PC host memory. This table contains the MAC address of the node and every router that is in the way of the node. The table size is predefined by the total length (maximum depth) of the network. Another field of this table is the child number that the node represents for its father. The table stored in any node contains only the MAC addresses of its children in an order given by the coordinator. This way of creating the network allows the coordinator to use a source routing packet transmission in which the coordinator puts in the packet the addresses of the nodes where the message must pass, but instead of the full address, we use only the number of the child; so, it can be used by the nodes as an index to select the next hop.</p>
<p>The node reacts depending on whether the received message is a DALI message (taking into consideration the kind of DALI message received) or network message according to the flowchart showed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1477153511431129">Figure 2</xref>.

<sec id="sec7-1477153511431129"><title>4. Results</title>
<p>In order to test the network and obtain the following results a Java<sup>©</sup> based supervisory control and data acquisition interface was implemented. The user can send commands to the PAN coordinator using this interface; the coordinator will send the selected command to the chosen node (each node is a light point). The interface has only the basic arc power level commands and also the main query commands, allowing the user to switch on and off the lamps, dim and check some lamp parameters like the dimming level, lamp status, control gear or lamp failures, etc.</p>
<p>The developed WSN with DALI ballast system was able to fully communicate with the user in every aspect gathered in the IEC 62386 standard. The number of DALI ballasts under control was significantly increased; not only could we have a single DALI ballast with any sensor node, but a node that could also control up to 64 DALI ballasts by making use of its MAC or network address and the DALI ballast addresses. The system is suitable for both street and building lighting. The circuit and nodes are small enough to be easily included in a lamp post; the idea is to supply the nodes with a small AC/DC converter taking the node power supply from the grid.</p>
<p>The modification in the network layer allowed us to create a tree topology with 868 MHz devices; range tests performed in indoor/urban environments confirm that the devices could communicate properly with a separation between them of more than 200 m with obstacles. The tests have been performed inside our buildings deploying sets of ballasts and nodes in different laboratories. In this environment, we have the presence of important interference sources like Wi-Fi networks and also transformers with a power of 1.60 kVA. The implemented routing mechanism was able to have several nodes in the network and it was very easy to reconfigure and rebuild the tree network.</p>
<p>Saving energy in street lighting is achieved by dimming; the ballast used could only dim to 60%. As the DALI dimming curve is logarithmic, this only left 20 dimming steps, from 59.5% to 100%. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1477153511431129">Figure 3</xref> shows the dimming level and the measured input power versus the step number for the full set of ballast and HPS lamp. Note that the dimming level is the variation of the lamp arc power level, not the light intensity level. Both dimming level and input power percentages are always almost the same (the input power is most of the time above due to the ballast energy consumption); this way a significant saving in street lighting can be done leaving the lights at a low dimming level when the activity in the streets and roads is very low. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1477153511431129">Figure 4</xref> shows the arc power level of the HPS lamp at different dimming steps from 59.5% to 100%; it is very easy to see where a step-up level has occurred.

</fig></p>
<p>To examine the response time, another measure was made by checking the time that the ballast takes to react to any command. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1477153511431129">Figure 5</xref> shows the ballast input current and the DALI signal; a maximum level command is sent when the actual level is the minimum (60%) at about 200 ms. It can be observed from the figure as to how the current starts increasing at 980 ms; that is, the response time is below 800 ms, and it takes only 100 ms to reach the maximum level.

<p>A new remote management system for street lighting has been presented in this paper. In this study, we have used WSNs along with the DALI protocol to expand the DALI initial constraint of 64 devices to a number big enough to be used in a remote street lighting management system.</p>
<p>One of the Smart Grid requirements is the use of a two-way communication protocol. The use of a DALI ballast with a WSN allows a half-duplex communication which can provide many parameters about the lighting and lamp status. This is very useful for saving energy and maintenance purposes, as it can detect any single lamp fault, allowing predictive maintenance and group replacement in the area of the failing lamp.</p>
<p>The tree network topology developed along with the long-range modules is able to cover a wide area and, more importantly, have success in something overlooked in a street lighting application with WSN in many studies like the emplacement of the nodes inside lamp posts. In case of a node fault, the network is easily reconfigurable so that it would be very hard to leave single orphan nodes and any lamp will be available.</p>
<p>Future work will be oriented to determine an economic study of the proposed technology versus others in use nowadays, and to integrate this wirelessly remote functionality into other lighting control protocols.</p>
