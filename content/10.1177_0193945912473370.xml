<abstract>
<p>The rising incidence of diabetes complications among African Americans is a major health concern. Few studies have addressed gender differences in diabetes self-management in this population. The purpose of this study was to determine whether gender differences in facilitators and barriers to self-management exist among African American adults with type 2 diabetes. Thirty-eight participants were recruited from community agencies and each participated in one of seven audio-recorded focus group sessions. Regular health care visits, positive outlook, prioritization of health, and independence facilitated self-management behaviors in men, whereas acceptance of diabetes was a facilitator for women. Lack of time at work, lack of family support, and lack of knowledge were barriers for men, whereas lack of finances, embarrassment, negative outlook, perceived lack of disease control, and adverse effects of medications were barriers for women. Further research is necessary to design and test gender-specific tailored interventions to improve diabetes self-management in this population.</p>

<body>
<p>An estimated 25.8 million persons in the United States have diabetes mellitus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0193945912473370">American Diabetes Association, 2012a</xref>) and 90% to 95% of them have type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0193945912473370">National Institute of Diabetes, Digestive, and Kidney Diseases, 2012</xref>). T2DM is associated with insulin resistance and/or relative insulin deficiency rather than a total deficit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0193945912473370">Chlebowy &amp; Wagner, 2005</xref>). African Americans are disproportionately affected by diabetes and are 1.8 times more likely to develop diabetes than non-Hispanic Whites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0193945912473370">American Diabetes Association, 2012b</xref>). They also experience higher rates of diabetes-related complications such as kidney disease, blindness, amputations, nerve damage, heart disease, and stroke than other racial groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0193945912473370">American Diabetes Association, 2012b</xref>). Moreover, there is increasing concern in the health care system about the rising incidence of diabetes-related complications among African Americans. Higher rates of diabetes-related complications among African Americans may be due to factors such as heredity, inadequate health care, or financial barriers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0193945912473370">Chlebowy &amp; Garvin, 2006</xref>). There is an ongoing need to better understand the underlying mechanisms for the existing health disparity among this population.</p>
<p>T2DM self-management often presents challenges for persons as they strive to adhere to the prescribed regimens, including (a) following a diet, (b) self-administering oral diabetes medications and/or insulin, (c) engaging in physical activity, (d) performing blood glucose monitoring, and (e) managing daily stressors. African Americans are significantly less adherent to diabetes self-management recommendations than non-Hispanic Whites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0193945912473370">Shenolikar, Balkrishnan, Camacho, Whitmire, &amp; Anderson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0193945912473370">Trinacty et al., 2007</xref>). Support from family, peers, and health care providers positively influence diabetes self-management by providing cues to action, direct assistance, reinforcement, and knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0193945912473370">Chlebowy, Hood, &amp; LaJoie, 2010</xref>). Family support was the most important factor related to self-management in African Americans with T2DM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0193945912473370">Chlebowy et al., 2010</xref>). In another study, African Americans’ belief in God was a major source of strength for adhering to diabetes self-management recommendations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0193945912473370">Devlin, Roberts, Okaya, &amp; Xiong, 2006</xref>). Similarly, knowledge, psychosocial support, and religious practices were identified as facilitators to diabetes self-management among African Americans living in a rural community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0193945912473370">Utz et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Several studies identified the barriers to self-management of T2DM among African American adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0193945912473370">Egede &amp; Bonadonna, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0193945912473370">El-Kebbi et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0193945912473370">Kieffer et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0193945912473370">Maillet, Melkus, &amp; Spollett, 1996</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0193945912473370">Chlebowy et al. (2010)</xref> found that internal (self-related) factors were primarily described as barriers to self-management behaviors among African Americans with T2DM. A lack of self-control over dietary habits and often forgetting to take medications or monitor glucose levels were common barriers to diabetes self-management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0193945912473370">Chlebowy et al., 2010</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0193945912473370">Blanchard, Rose, Taylor, McEntree, and Latchaw (1999)</xref> found that African Americans identified a fear of diabetes-related complications and a sense of personal powerlessness when discussing T2DM self-management with their health care providers.</p>
<p>A few studies have addressed gender differences in self-management among adults with T2DM. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0193945912473370">Unden et al. (2008)</xref> found that women had worse mental well-being than men; men reported fewer diabetes-related worries and greater ability to cope than women. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0193945912473370">Misra and Lager (2007)</xref> reported that women with T2DM had greater restriction in their social interactions, greater perceived burden, and a less positive outlook than men. Fatalism was found to be associated with women’s nonadherence to T2DM self-management recommendations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0193945912473370">Egede &amp; Bonadonna, 2003</xref>). Women with T2DM also had more depressive symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0193945912473370">Gucciardi, Wang, DeMelo, Amaral, &amp; Stewart, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0193945912473370">Ponzo et al., 2006</xref>) and greater perceived barriers than men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0193945912473370">Ponzo et al., 2006</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0193945912473370">Decoster and Cummings (2005)</xref> found that males used less emotion-focused and more problem-focused methods for diabetes self-management than women. Although men cope better with T2DM, they have lower utilization of the health care system than women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0193945912473370">Shalev, Chodick, Heymann, &amp; Kokia, 2005</xref>). Men with T2DM were more likely to engage in physical activity as part of their disease management than women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0193945912473370">Navuluri, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Few published studies have examined potential gender differences in facilitators and barriers to self-management among African American adults with T2DM. Knowledge about gender differences will assist health care providers in the design of gender-specific tailored interventions to improve self-management of T2DM among African American adults. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0193945912473370">Legato et al. (2006)</xref> suggested that gender-specific care of persons with diabetes should be based on evidence-based recommendations. Tailoring interventions specific to gender and racial/ethnic groups is essential in planning care of adults with diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0193945912473370">Chou et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0193945912473370">Correa-de-Araujo, McDermott, &amp; Moy, 2006</xref>).</p>

<title>Purpose</title>
<p>This study is a secondary analysis of data obtained from a mixed-methods study which examined the facilitators and barriers to T2DM self-management among African American adults living in an urban community in the southeastern United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0193945912473370">Chlebowy et al., 2010</xref>). The purpose of this study was to determine whether gender differences in facilitators and barriers to T2DM self-management exist among the study population. Facilitators were conceptually defined as those personal or situational factors that enable the participant to adhere to the diabetes health behavior regimen. Barriers were factors that act as an obstacle or cause difficulty in adhering to the diabetes health behavior regimen. Data were collected between August 2008 and March 2009. The study was approved by the appropriate institutional review boards.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section3-0193945912473370">
<title>Recruitment</title>
<p>Research team members recruited participants at three community health care agencies through face-to-face contact. Inclusion criteria for participation were as follows: (a) African American, (b) 18 years of age or older, (c) self-reported diagnosis of T2DM, and (d) English speaking. All prospective participants were provided with information about the study and its voluntary nature was discussed. Informed written consent was obtained from all participants prior to their involvement in the study. If the participant demonstrated low literacy such as by appearing to have trouble with the language of the form, the consent form and demographic survey were read to the participant. As the research team members had no prior contact with the participants and they were not the participants’ health care providers, the potential for coercion was limited. Upon completion of the study, each participant was compensated with a US$25 gift card to a local retailer.</p>

<sec id="section4-0193945912473370">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>The sample consisted of 38 participants, 27 women and 11 men, who received care at one of three community health care agencies in a midsized city in the southeastern United States. The mean age of the sample was 66 years (<italic>SD</italic> = 11.61); mean age of men 68 years (<italic>SD</italic> = 10.14), women 65.19 years (<italic>SD</italic> = 12.06). Men ranged in age from 56 to 89 years and women 37 to 87 years. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0193945912473370">Table 1</xref> depicts other demographic and medical history information for the total sample and by gender.</p>

<p>The lead author, an experienced focus group facilitator, led the discussions in private conference rooms at each of the agencies. A total of seven focus groups were conducted to obtain qualitative data for the study; each focus group comprised between three and six participants. Three men-only focus groups and four women-only focus groups were conducted. Focus groups were kept homogeneous by gender to limit cross-gender contamination of responses. Each focus group was audio-recorded and lasted between 60 and 90 min. A trained observer was present at each of the focus group discussions to take detailed written field notes during the focus group sessions; characteristics such as participants’ facial expressions, tone of language, and body posturing were noted. The audio-recordings were transcribed verbatim into text format by trained study personnel. Unique identifier codes were assigned in place of names to ensure participant anonymity.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0193945912473370">
<title>Data Analyses</title>
<p>Quantitative data obtained from the demographic survey were analyzed using descriptive statistics and reported as means (±<italic>SD</italic>) for continuous variables; the proportion and frequency was reported for categorical variables. To analyze continuous data, <italic>t</italic> tests were used, and chi-square analyses were used to analyze categorical data.</p>
<p>For the qualitative data analysis, focus group transcripts were downloaded into <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0193945912473370">Atlas Ti</xref><sup>®</sup> Version 6, a computer-based qualitative data analysis program. Inductive content analysis was performed to identify themes in the transcribed text (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0193945912473370">Elo &amp; Kyngäs, 2007</xref>). Codes were assigned to each text passage using an open-coding approach, where lists of key concepts were generated while transcripts were read. Similar concepts were then collapsed to create codes and super codes, which represented subcategories and main categories for analysis. It is important to note that this process was done independently for men and women.</p>
<p>Barriers to medication adherence were identified in the transcripts by conducting a simultaneous search for the codes “barrier,” “adherence,” and “medication.” In addition, the codes “barrier” and “adherence” were simultaneously entered in separate searches with the “diet/nutrition” and “physical activity” codes to assess perceived barriers to nutrition and physical activity recommendations. Similarly, facilitators to the self-management behaviors of medication-taking, diet/nutrition, and physical activity were entered in separate searches with the “facilitator” and “adherence codes,” to locate text which discussed facilitators to adherence to medication, diet, and physical activity recommendations. Variables identified as barriers and facilitators to adherence were then categorized as being “external factors” or “internal factors” indicating the degree to which participants expressed having volitional control over the variable. External factors were defined as variables that were external to the participant and beyond their control, while internal factors were variables that were directly associated with the participant and are largely within their control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0193945912473370">Surgenor, Horn, Hudson, Lunt, &amp; Tennent, 2000</xref>). Analyses were done to examine the effects of gender on perception of T2DM facilitators and barriers. During the coding process, conflicts between coders were resolved by discussion to achieve interrater agreement.</p>

<title>Regular Health Care Visits</title>
<p>Men emphasized the importance of attending regularly scheduled appointments with their physicians for managing T2DM. They also indicated that attending appointments on a monthly basis increased their awareness about their T2DM status. One participant said, “You know my doctor, he uh, takes blood once a month.” Another participant indicated that his physician drew blood monthly to monitor his glucose levels and commented, “Well I see the doctor on a regular basis; I keep a check on it . . . I see the doctor once a month.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0193945912473370">
<title>Positive Outlook</title>
<p>Men regularly endorsed the need to have a positive outlook as important for managing T2DM and indicated that their attitudes greatly influenced their experiences with diabetes. Participants indicated that maintaining a positive outlook seemed to increase their perceived control over the disease:<disp-quote>
<p>Sometimes it’s the way you think too, you know, you’ve got to think positive. The way the man thinks, I believe, it’s the man. I never think about being unable to do anything, I always think that I might heal. That one day the diabetes will be gone and uh but I don’t think negative about anything, not myself that’s for sure. If you think that you are sick, if you think that something is wrong with you, pretty soon you’ll find something wrong with you and I don’t think that way.</p>
<p>I’ve been a diabetic over 20 years, man, I don’t think negative though, I think positive at all times. I think that one day I can overcome it and I believe that even with diabetes I still can maintain a normal life where I can be happy just with, it’s just the way you think you’ve got to get the thinking right first.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0193945912473370">
<title>Prioritization of Health</title>
<p>Men indicated that making their health a priority in the midst of other daily activities facilitated adherence to T2DM management recommendations. They emphasized that time should be allocated to caring for T2DM. Specifically, participants commented that a lifestyle change was necessary to prioritize their health and effectively manage T2DM: “Church and volunteering—that takes a lot of time, and you have to sometimes, sometimes you have to allocate time to different activities to include your own health,” and “I’ve got more time freed up, uh, being retired, to exercise now . . . you really have to change your lifestyle.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0193945912473370">
<title>Independence</title>
<p>Several men reported that it was very important for them to maintain their independence in managing their T2DM. They often discussed how they were motivated to adhere to T2DM recommendations because they did not want to be dependent on the help or assistance of others. Men also emphasized that independently managing their T2DM helped them to become better managers of their disease:<disp-quote>
<p>The thing about it, I don’t look for anybody to do it for me if I’m able to do it myself. I’m very independent. I don’t like nobody doing anything for me I know I could do myself. The more I do it myself, the more easy it becomes.</p>
<p>As far as I’m concerned I don’t need nobody to help me with what I need to do to take care of myself, I do it myself. I know that if I need to take my medicine I do that, if I know there is a certain thing I shouldn’t eat I just don’t eat it.</p>

<sec id="section13-0193945912473370">
<title>Facilitators for Women</title>
<p>Women reported fewer facilitators to adherence than males. In particular, female participants described acceptance of one’s diabetes diagnosis as the primary facilitator to adherence behaviors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0193945912473370">Figure 2</xref>.).</p>

<title>Acceptance of Diabetes</title>
<p>Women only acknowledged one facilitator to T2DM. Specifically, coping strategies facilitated T2DM adherence behaviors in women. For example, in contrast to denial, acceptance of one’s diagnosis of T2DM facilitated adherence to management recommendations. One participant said, “I think you when you’re diabetic, you just have to learn to accept it. Once you accept it, you can deal with it,” and another commented, “You try to deal with it, but you deal with it in reason, because nobody is perfect and you try to do the best that you can.”</p>

<sec id="section15-0193945912473370">
<title>Barriers for Men</title>
<p>Men identified several barriers to T2DM adherence. Barriers emphasized by men included a lack of knowledge about how to manage T2DM and lack of family support. Work was described as barrier to adherence in men, where limited time was allotted during work hours for caring for their T2DM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0193945912473370">Figure 3</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section16-0193945912473370">
<title>Lack of Personal Time at Work</title>
<p>Male participants described work as a barrier to T2DM management behaviors such as regularly eating and monitoring blood glucose levels. They commented that they often experienced difficulty allocating time to their diabetes management while on the job: “It’s very hard for you to have a little time even within your job to uh make sure that all your personal things that you should be taking care of are um taken care of or satisfied,” and “When I was working, that is when it was really really most difficult because you know they expect you to give them a 10 hour day.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-0193945912473370">
<title>Lack of Family Support</title>
<p>Lack of family support was a barrier for some men, especially as it related to food preparation. Men whose family did not support their dietary needs indicated that they were unable to adhere to T2DM nutrition recommendations. One participant said,<disp-quote>
<p>I’m in it by myself, and my wife, I love her to death just like you love your wife, but she’s just not the kind of person to cook special for me . . . she is like, that’s your problem—not mine.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-0193945912473370">
<title>Lack of Knowledge</title>
<p>Men indicated that they had difficulty adhering to T2DM management guidelines when they had a lack of knowledge about how to manage the disease. This was primarily described as being problematic during the initial diagnostic phase of the disease. Having a lack of knowledge about what to eat and how to take medications caused difficulty and frustration for men. Participants said, “When you are first told that, you begin . . . you worry about it but you have no knowledge of how to treat it or take care of it, you see, and that was the hardest part,” and “My tough time was when I didn’t have knowledge of it. I didn’t know that much about diabetes and that was my toughest time.”</p>
</sec></sec>
<sec id="section19-0193945912473370">
<title>Barriers for Women</title>
<p>Women reported several barriers to T2DM self-management (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0193945912473370">Figure 4</xref>). This finding was associated with the observation that women noted T2DM to be intrusive in their daily lives. According to the women, barriers to self-management were related to emotion-focused coping behaviors. Specifically, embarrassment was described as a barrier to T2DM adherence. Women emphasized the financial burden of diabetes management as a barrier to glucose monitoring and medication adherence. They also described the uncomfortable experience of side effects as a barrier to medication adherence.</p>

<sec id="section20-0193945912473370">
<title>Lack of Finances</title>
<p>Lack of financial ability to pay for T2DM self-management supplies was a barrier for women. Women primarily indicated that the cost of T2DM glucose testing supplies often contributed to infrequent glucose monitoring. Participants commented,<disp-quote>
<p>Maybe if I could go to the doctor with some accurate numbers, then the next 3 months I go, then maybe they could do more for my conditions . . . but I lack that and financially I won’t buy those strips.</p>
<p>I really resent having to pay so much for the strips, it’s like they give you the machine but the strips cost an arm and a leg . . . I’ve had the best insurance you can possibly have, but I’ve also been where I don’t have any insurance at all and it is hard to manage diabetes—it is a very expensive disease.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section21-0193945912473370">
<title>Embarrassment</title>
<p>Females identified embarrassment as a barrier to taking their insulin and performing blood glucose monitoring. This response was especially applicable in the context of social settings. One participant said,<disp-quote>
<p>I have to take mine before I eat. So embarrassing. When I go to work I go in the bathroom, and lock the door. I don’t want no one to see me stick myself with a needle. Then you have to test it after you eat, and I thought this is driving me crazy.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>A few participants identified concerns that their T2DM supplies would be mistaken for drug paraphernalia. One participant expressed concern that the scars left from glucose monitoring made her look like she had been using intravenous drugs and commented, “My arms make me look like I’m doing tracks. You know cause that’s what it looks like . . . So I’m not sticking.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section22-0193945912473370">
<title>Negative Outlook</title>
<p>Having a negative outlook was also associated with decreased adherence behaviors in women. Women indicated that their efforts to manage T2DM had minimal effect on their health outcomes due to the consuming, intrusive nature of the disease. One participant said,<disp-quote>
<p>I had great-grandparents who had diabetes, you know. They lived to be 90 something you know, and they were able to do whatever needed to be done, but I mean I’m just I guess I’m just a big punk when it comes to it. I’m not handling it well.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Another participant commented, “Diabetes is like there is something out there to get you, and you basically feel like that all the time, at least I do feel like that all the time. I just do’s the best that I can.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section23-0193945912473370">
<title>Perceived Lack of Disease Control</title>
<p>Closely linked to women’s negative outlook with regard to T2DM management was the acknowledgment of the disease as a control over their lives. The controlling nature of T2DM often led them to speak fatalistically about their ability to manage the disease. One participant said, “It never lets you forget that it’s in control, that’s for sure. You know I mean you might have it under control but it’s still in control of you,” and another commented,<disp-quote>
<p>It has a way of taking over and it affects every area . . . You have more off days than good days. If you take too little (medicine), you got a problem. If you don’t eat enough, you got a problem. It gets to be consuming.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section24-0193945912473370">
<title>Fear of Adverse Effects of Medications</title>
<p>Females expressed concerns about the adverse effects of the medications. Despite stating the evidence and knowledge that medication was necessary, female participants feared taking medications because it made them feel sick. They also feared becoming hypoglycemic as a result of administering too much insulin. One participant said, “My concern is the pills make me sick . . . me and my medicine, we have issues with each other, but I’m trying,” and another commented, “I don’t like the roller-coaster ride of dropping and coming back up and dropping and coming back up, that concerns me.”</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The emotional, physical, and financial toll that diabetes places on a person is significant. In the focus groups, participants easily identified the facilitators and barriers of T2DM self-management. The analysis of their words suggests that men and women differed considerably in how diabetes management affects them. For men, T2DM represented a problem to be managed but not something that consumed them as individuals. Contrary to the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0193945912473370">Shalev et al. (2005)</xref>, the men in this study reported being more proactive in their care; they more regularly visited their doctors, and sought out information regarding T2DM in an attempt to maintain control over their disease. The women, however, were more pessimistic and burdened by diabetes, which is consistent with findings of previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0193945912473370">Gucciardi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0193945912473370">Misra &amp; Lager, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0193945912473370">Ponzo et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0193945912473370">Unden et al., 2008</xref>). Women, in contrast to the men, expressed the stigma associated with having diabetes. Embarrassment was a common theme in the women; for example, they expressed concern over the scars they had from needle sticks, the shame they felt regarding their disease, and the need to be very private when attending to their blood glucose levels. Similar expressions of embarrassment were not found in the transcripts of the men’s focus groups.</p>
<p>Similar to the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0193945912473370">Decoster and Cummings (2005)</xref>, women used more emotion-focused and less problem-focused methods for diabetes self-management. Although the last focus group question was not thoroughly addressed during the sessions, the resulting themes suggest that coping and acceptance should be facilitated during the initial diagnosis phase for African Americans with T2DM. In addition, findings suggest that during the initial diagnosis phase, it is important to provide African Americans with knowledge to manage T2DM. Women, but not men, expressed concern regarding the financial burden of managing T2DM which is consistent with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0193945912473370">El-Kebbi et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0193945912473370">Kieffer et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>The men in this study needed support with daily activities such as food purchasing and preparation. Some men stated that their spouses were resistant to the dietary changes diabetes demands. The interpretation of the transcriptions suggests that some men could not depend on the help of others; in fact, for some, it seemed as if they had to fight interference from others to take the steps needed to control their disease. For instance, in the workplace, both men and women perceived their employers to be unsympathetic to their health condition and unwilling to make the necessary accommodations for their disease management. Women were more likely to try to hide their health condition at work rather than ask for time and space to check their blood glucose levels.</p>
<p>Fatalism is negatively associated with diabetes self-management among African Americans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0193945912473370">Egede &amp; Bonadonna, 2003</xref>). Women felt that T2DM was uncontrollable and an inevitable fate. The statements of women reflect perceptions that their health condition resulted from poor dietary choices and lack of exercise and that they themselves were to blame for developing this chronic health condition. For men, the lack of understanding of nutrition and insufficient culinary skills forces dependence on others. Women expressed concern that they had to continuously fight against the condition and the stigma associated with the disease.</p>
<p>As the prevalence of diabetes increases, there is a pressing need to better understand the implications of the disease. Self-management concerns are not well understood; this is particularly true with regard to understanding gender and cultural influences on health and disease management. This study strengthens the diabetes literature by providing a focused examination of the effects of gender on T2DM self-management among low-income African Americans.</p>
<p>The main limitation of the study is the small sample size. In particular, the size and number of focus groups may have compromised data saturation, especially given the fact that the groups were stratified by gender. In addition, despite considerable efforts to recruit a diverse sample, these findings are limited to the life experiences of 38 participants. The sample was older, had a high number of persons who were widowed or unmarried, had an unbalanced female to male ratio, and significant variability in the duration of disease experiences. Given the characteristics of the sample and the small sample size, caution is suggested when generalizing and transferring these findings to the broader African American community. However, the findings provide valuable information for consideration in the future design of gender-specific tailored interventions for this population.</p>
<p>Another potential limitation of this study relates to the study design in which men were sampled with other men and women were interviewed with other women. The possibility exists that the men were less likely to wish to appear weak or dependent in front of other men. This might explain why the men generated more ideas of being self-reliant and optimistic. The women, however, may have found comfort in their fellow women to express the fears, doubts, and concerns they had. The homogeneity of the focus groups, while certainly recommended in the guidelines of conducting qualitative research, may have led the discussions in different directions for the men and women. Confirming whether the comments made by both groups were related to the group characteristics or if they reflect real gender differences will be confirmed in future studies.</p>
<p>T2DM is a chronic, incurable health condition. For the men and women in this study, the expressed challenges of self-managing their T2DM has the potential to be physically and emotionally exhausting. For the growing numbers of persons with diabetes, there is a great need for better support systems, more acceptance and accommodation by employers, and a systematic campaign that targets the stigma associated with diabetes. Low income and lack of medical knowledge presents additional challenges. For example, some respondents acknowledged that they did not perform blood glucose monitoring because of the costs of the monitoring strips. Others indicated that needle sticks made them look like intravenous drug users. The health care provider should help persons with T2DM to access low-cost medications and equipment. The health care provider can direct persons with T2DM to validated medical information sources that are empowering in an effort to help persons feel more in control of their chronic illness. The struggle of managing diabetes should not be compounded by external factors like stigma and prejudice. It is the role of the health care provider to help persons overcome these feelings.</p>
<p>In this study, men and women expressed different facilitators and barriers to T2DM self-management. Gender-specific targeted interventions are necessary to improve the lives of African American adults living with T2DM. As suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0193945912473370">Kacerovsky-Bielesz et al. (2009)</xref>, women may benefit from individualized care with social support interventions and men may benefit from knowledge-based interventions. Further research is necessary to design and test gender-specific tailored interventions to assist African Americans to overcome the barriers to T2DM self-management.</p>
