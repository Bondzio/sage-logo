<abstract>
<p>The patient-centered medical home is an important innovation in health care delivery. There is a need to assess the scope and substance of published research on medical homes. This article reviews published evaluations of medical home care for the period 2007 to 2010. Chief findings from these evaluations as a whole include associations between the provision of medical home care and improved quality, in addition to decreased utilization associated with medical home care in high-cost areas such as emergency department use. However, fewer associations were found across evaluations between medical home care and enhanced patient or family experiences. The early medical home research appears to reflect both the wide variation in how medical homes are being designed and implemented in practice and in how researchers are choosing to evaluate patient-centered medical home design and implementation. While some aspects of medical home care show promise, continued evolution of medical home evaluative research is needed.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The patient-centered medical home (PCMH) model of care has been touted as a key intervention to improving U.S. primary care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1077558712447688">Rittenhouse, Shortell, &amp; Fisher, 2009</xref>). The model is an important component of health care transformation in this country (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1077558712447688">Davis, Abrams, &amp; Stremikis, 2011</xref>). The Affordable Care Act has provisions in it that support and promote the medical home concept related to, for example, financially incenting state Medicaid programs to shift select patients into medical home–type care, funding the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to test new models of care such as the PCMH, and supporting the information technology infrastructure investments the PCMH model requires to be effective. In addition to federal support, many states are looking to the PCMH as a means to improve their primary care systems while lowering health system costs in the process. For example, in its recent Medicaid reform effort New York State has emphasized PCMH care as a key intervention to lower Medicaid costs and enhance the value of this public insurance program. Other states are doing the same (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1077558712447688">National Academy of State Health Policy, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>The PCMH model is composed of general principles that ideally complement one another and feed into a comprehensive vision of appropriate primary care delivery. These principles, that is, having a personal physician, a whole person orientation, physician-directed medical practice, coordinated care, emphasis on quality and safety, and enhanced access, are supported through appropriate payment mechanisms that reward practices that provide patient-centered care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1077558712447688">Patient-Centered Primary Care Collaborative [PCPCC], 2012b</xref>). Yet, as others have observed (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1077558712447688">Friedberg, Lai, Hussey, &amp; Schneider, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1077558712447688">Rosenthal, 2008</xref>), the PCMH principles remain abstract and general, requiring greater articulation about how they are translated into interventions and the types of specific health care outcomes that should result from their pursuit in everyday practice.</p>
<p>Currently, the PCMH model in various forms is being implemented by public and private health plans, integrated delivery systems, and by individual primary care practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1077558712447688">PCPCC, 2012a</xref>). It is arguably the most popular primary care delivery innovation in the United States and will remain so for the near future. There is an accepted “gold standard” measurement tool for practices calling themselves medical homes; a standard put forth by the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) that is process and infrastructure focused and which contains multiple “levels” of PCMH certification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1077558712447688">NCQA, 2012</xref>). Thus, there is much early momentum for acceptance of the PCMH model within the health care industry.</p>
<p>However, as others have noted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1077558712447688">Barr, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1077558712447688">Berenson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1077558712447688">Hoff, 2010</xref>), as both an innovation and comprehensive model of care delivery the PCMH model of care remains much less understood. One reason for this reality is that many medical home demonstrations are still in their formative implementation stages, and a sizable portion of these demonstrations are not set up to evaluate systematically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1077558712447688">Bitton, Martin, &amp; Landon, 2010</xref>). A second reason is the variation that may exist around how different primary care settings think about and implement their version of “medical home” care. These observations have led some to raise meaningful concerns around (a) whether or not there should be greater clarity, beyond the NCQA medical home measurement, regarding what specific practice-level interventions constitute a PCMH; (b) identifying the specific outcomes that should be the target of PCMH care; and (c) whether or not different types of primary care practice settings, possessing different resources and constraints, should have similar PCMH interventions and outcome goals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1077558712447688">Berenson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1077558712447688">Friedberg et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1077558712447688">Hoff, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1077558712447688">Sidorov, 2008</xref>).</p>

<title>Conceptual Framework</title>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1077558712447688">Figure 1</xref> represents a heuristic for how to ground the more abstract conceptualization of PCMH care, articulated through the general principles, within the everyday world of primary care delivery. It is adapted from prior discussions regarding how the PCMH concept should be thought about and implemented (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1077558712447688">Carrier, Gourevitch, &amp; Shah, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1077558712447688">Friedberg et al., 2009</xref>) and from an understanding of the demonstrated linkages between PCMH-type interventions and specific health care outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1077558712447688">Rosenthal, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1077558712447688">Starfield, 2004</xref>). For example, the PCMH principle of “coordinated or integrated care” may be pursued in everyday practice through specific interventions such as the use of standardized protocols that allow for systematic test and referral tracking, formal policies and workflows that allow the primary care practice to coordinate care transitions for patients with facilities such as hospitals, and the use of health information technology as a facilitator.</p>

<p>Such facilitation may include using health information technology to assist in tracking the location of patients within the health care system at a given time, compiling and analyzing test results efficiently, and receiving patient information from specialists and hospitals in a timely manner. If these specific PCMH “care coordination” interventions work in the intended manner, then expected outcomes would include improved quality of care, lower utilization of high-cost services, enhanced patient experiences with their care, and lower system costs resulting from the delivery of more appropriate care for the patient (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1077558712447688">Rosenthal, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Most agree, given the joint PCMH principles put forth and agreed upon nationally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1077558712447688">PCPCC, 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1077558712447688">Figure 1</xref>), that the PCMH is meant as a <italic>comprehensive</italic> model of primary care delivery (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1077558712447688">Carrier et al., 2009</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1077558712447688">Friedberg et al., 2009</xref>). As a result, unless everyday primary care settings implement multiple interventions that include a combination of the general principles listed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1077558712447688">Figure 1</xref> the care model defining that practice setting falls short of true medical home care.</p>
<p>An earlier, small-scale review focused primarily on the interventions and outcomes associated with several large initiatives calling themselves “medical homes,” even before the adult-focused definition of PCMH care was made public in 2007 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1077558712447688">Friedberg et al., 2009</xref>). This assessment found the following: (a) some interventions within these “medical homes” were only weakly related to the general PCMH principles outlined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1077558712447688">Figure 1</xref> and (b) there was significant variation across initiatives in the interventions, health care outcomes, and practice settings focused on, undermining the ability to compare results across projects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1077558712447688">Friedberg et al., 2009</xref>). Compilations of medical home demonstration projects and their outcomes have been done by PCMH advocates such as the PCPCC and may be found online. However, they represent general inventories that summarize individual demonstrations and select outcomes of those demonstrations rather than systematic reviews of the medical home literature that present synthesized findings and use a set of decision rules to identify and review pertinent studies. These general inventories also arguably do not assess the comparative rigor or differentiation among projects that call themselves “medical homes” nor analyze the potential variety inherent in the research that studies PCMH effects.</p>
<sec id="section3-1077558712447688">
<title>New Contribution</title>
<p>Given the continued importance of PCMH care as a health care innovation, there is a need to understand the current state of published literature that identifies itself as PCMH evaluation focused. Important questions can be informed such as how the field of health services research is thinking about the definition, implementation, and expected outcomes of PCMH care; how PCMH care is being conducted in everyday practice; and the organizational sources and data used for PCMH evaluations. In addition, a systematic review of published PCMH research can inform the variation issue that remains at the heart of much published dialogue regarding medical home care, and briefly outlined here. Finally, but no less important, as a collection of several important care principles; a model requiring fundamental shifts in how providers practice and patients participate in care; and as a set of activities requiring significant upfront resource investment to gain traction within practices, systematic evaluation determining whether or not this model is associated with favorable outcomes aids in determining how much policy attention and fiscal investment this innovation should receive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1077558712447688">Bitton, Martin, &amp; Landon, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1077558712447688">Sidorov, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>The present literature review addresses these issues. It adds value by incorporating an in-depth examination of PCMH implementation- and evaluation-related variation in addition to exploring the effectiveness of different versions of PCMH care on outcomes such as care quality, service use, access, costs of care, patient and provider experiences, and patient involvement with their care. One goal of the review is to describe and assess the various methodological approaches used to demonstrate linkages between PCMH-type interventions and health care outcomes. To our knowledge, there has not been a systematic assessment done of the methodological or design content of published research that examines medical home care.</p>

<title>Study Data and Method</title>
<p>The present review examines evaluations of PCMH interventions published in peer-reviewed journals and other scholarly writings during the years 2007 to 2010. This defined time period was selected on the basis of the fact that the adult-oriented PCMH definition began only in 2007 with publication of the Joint Principles of a Patient-Centered Medical Home and beginnings of NCQA PCMH recognition. Thus, this time period may be viewed as the formative stage of PCMH research. It is also the time period when researchers were provided with this new adult-focused PCMH definition, and thus began thinking about medical home evaluation in ways consistent with operationalizing this specific definition. Prior to 2007, the medical home concept was defined much more narrowly to focus on children with special health needs rather than the all-inclusive, family medicine definition established in 2007.</p>
<p>We conducted a quick check of a sample published research literature prior to 2007 that specifically called itself “medical home” focused. First, there was little of this research found. Second, it was characterized by a much narrower patient population focus on adolescents and, more specifically, children with special health care needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1077558712447688">Homer et al. 2008</xref>). We decided that it would be more valid to examine published PCMH literature beginning when the revised, more expansive PCMH definition became normative among practitioners and researchers alike.</p>
<sec id="section5-1077558712447688">
<title>Data Sources and Searches</title>
<p>We used the PubMed searchable database to conduct our review. For this review, we identified 645 articles in our initial search in PubMed using the term <italic>patient-centered medical home</italic> coupled with 21 separate terms that reflected a particular health care outcome. Examples of these outcome terms include <italic>quality of care, care coordination, efficiency, patient satisfaction, patient access</italic>, and <italic>utilization</italic> (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1077558712447688">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Selection of Studies</title>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1077558712447688">Figure 2</xref> outlines the steps in determining the final sample of PCMH studies included in the review. The first step in screening articles involved identifying articles that were empirical, that is, involved original research to answer one or more specific research questions or hypotheses. In this first step, it did not matter whether or not the research was medical home specific. We wanted to ensure at this early step that we did not miss any empirical articles that might contain PCMH evaluation of some kind. Screening was done through review of the article title, abstract, and, in select cases, the entire article. The next step was to select articles from the empirical sample obtained that could be classified as “patient-centered medical home research.”</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1077558712447688-fig2.tif"/></fig>
<p>To qualify as PCMH research, the study had to examine one or more acknowledged principles or components of a PCMH model of care as outlined in the Joint Principles of a Patient-Centered Medical Home endorsed widely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1077558712447688">PCPCC, 2012b</xref>). Articles were excluded in this step if they exclusively focused only on a more general intervention such as the use of electronic medical records or the use of clinical teams, without any specific linkage of that intervention in the study to a specific PCMH principle (such as the provision of care management or creating greater patient access; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1077558712447688">Figure 1</xref>). In short, there had to be linkages observed between the care interventions and one or more medical home principles. This review process involved some degree of subjective judgment by the coauthors. However, at least two of the three coauthor(s) had to agree on excluding an article or it remained in the review at this stage. As <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1077558712447688">Figure 2</xref> notes, non-PCMH research articles were discarded during two separate review stages, that is, after review of title and abstract and after full article review (the <italic>n</italic> = 114 and <italic>n</italic> = 23 boxes in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1077558712447688">Figure 2</xref>). In addition, as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1077558712447688">Figure 2</xref> notes, during the review process duplicate articles were identified (the <italic>n</italic> = 120 box in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1077558712447688">Figure 2</xref>). A “duplicate” is defined as the same article turning up in more than one of the searches done for the review (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1077558712447688">Table 1</xref>). The discard process was done to ensure that only a single copy of a given article was included in the review process.</p>
<p>In all, 36 articles were identified through PubMed that were preliminarily classified as PCMH research, published during the time period 2007 to 2010, and thus eligible for full article review. We also reviewed the websites of the Patient-Centered Primary Care Collaborative, Commonwealth Fund, and Agency for Healthcare Quality and Research, all of which contained bibliographies of what they classified as “medical home research.” From these websites we identified an additional eight published PCMH research studies (using the criteria described above) eligible for the full review that did not turn up in the PubMed search. From this group of 44 articles, we then only selected articles for the final review if they met these criteria: (a) empirical research, (b) research testing one or more accepted PCMH components as an intervention or independent variable (the “linkage” criterion explained above), and (c) articles published in peer-reviewed journals or systematic issue briefs or reports from well-known organizations such as RAND and The Commonwealth Foundation. We conducted a full review on each of the 44 articles to assess these criteria. This review resulted in 21 articles that qualified for inclusion in this study.</p>

<sec id="section7-1077558712447688">
<title>Data Extraction and Synthesis</title>
<p>A standardized data abstraction form was developed by the coauthors to use for the studies identified in this review.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1077558712447688">1</xref></sup> This abstract form was used throughout the entire review to classify the characteristics of and findings within each of the 21 studies.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1077558712447688">2</xref></sup> Final completed abstract forms for each of the 21 studies were summarized into an Excel database. This database was analyzed descriptively for frequencies and aggregate patterns across the studies relative to the different abstract elements. These frequencies and patterns were reviewed by the first two coauthors to identify collective findings of interest related particularly to (a) empirical evidence supporting medical home intervention effectiveness and (b) the manner in which the 21 medical home-focused studies were designed and conducted. These collective findings are presented in this review.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1077558712447688">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>The review has several important limitations worth noting. First, we did not include in the review evaluations of medical home interventions that may have been published before 2007. However, as noted above a brief perusal of pre-2007 published medical home research literature conducted by the coauthors as part of this review reveals a heavy focus on children with special health care needs and pediatric populations as the intervention groups. In short, because the adult-oriented PCMH definition was made public in 2007, many of the medical home interventions and outcomes examined in these earlier studies tend to be meaningfully different from those examined in the 2007 to 2010 published literature.</p>
<p>A second important limitation involves medical home evaluations that we may have missed. There likely are additional medical home evaluations conducted by industry stakeholders, government, and interested third parties that have not shown up in the published peer-reviewed literature. By examining several websites of key organizations such as Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality to identify additional PCMH evaluations that may not have been published in peer-reviewed journals, we attempted to identify some additional evaluations that a focus solely on peer-reviewed publications would have missed.</p>
<p>We decided that it was important for this review to focus primarily on those evaluations that had met a minimum standard of rigor such as that characterizing a peer-reviewed publication process, even though the final sample does include several studies from well-known research organizations where the peer-review process employed is unknown. This assures some consistent level of quality for the final sample of studies reviewed, especially given the prior finding that many medical home demonstrations are not set up for appropriate evaluation. However, we acknowledge that there may be additional medical home evaluations not included in the present review that offer value in assessing the effectiveness of PCMH care.</p>
<p>A third limitation is that since the review covers the nascent stage of medical home development and implementation in the United States, it is only one snapshot of the early adopters of medical home care; early adopters who are implementing medical home care in ways that may suffer from a lack of prior knowledge of what works. In short, the present review encompasses more of the experiments around PCMH care that could have higher levels of failure than the PCMH demonstrations coming after them. Given this reality, however, it becomes even more critical to examine this early empirical literature to understand and apply the knowledge gained from these early demonstrations.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1077558712447688">Table 2</xref> summarizes key design and methodological aspects of studies included in the review. The majority of research settings examined in the 21 studies consisted of multiple primary care practice sites. However, in 7 of the 21 studies, the specific medical home research site examined in the study could not be determined from a review of the article. Fifteen of the 21 studies used no discernible theoretical framework or concepts in testing their research questions or hypotheses related to why particular medical home interventions might shape health care outcomes. The three studies that used theory extensively applied the health belief model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1077558712447688">Rosenstock, 1966</xref>) and Andersen’s behavioral model of health services utilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1077558712447688">Andersen, 1995</xref>).</p>

<p>With respect to the types of research designs employed across the 21 studies, 7 studies used a more rigorous quasi-experimental design, which meant including in the analysis comparison practices or settings not receiving medical home care. Only one of these seven studies, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1077558712447688">Leff et al. (2009)</xref>, employed a design that included randomized assignment of patients to either medical home or nonmedical home practices. The most often used research design in the review sample consisted of cross-sectional data analysis, which was the design of choice in 9 of the 21 medical home studies. Eighteen of the 21 research studies in the overall sample used secondary data analysis in whole or part to examine the linkages between the presence of medical home care and health care outcomes, with data collected for another purpose reconfigured and analyzed to address medical home–related research questions. Examples of secondary data used in studies included the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, National Survey of Children with Special Health Care Needs, National Survey of Children’s Health, and claims or billing databases internal to specific organizations. Twenty of the 21 studies were quantitative in the methodology employed. Only one of the 21 studies was a purely qualitative analysis.</p>
<p>Eighteen of the 21 studies analyzed PCMH variables centrally, that is, the main purpose of the study was to examine the linkages between PCMH interventions or presence and select health care outcomes. In terms of how the concept “patient-centered medical home” was operationalized, there was little consistency across the 21 studies. Most of the 21 studies that met our definition and criteria of PCMH research operationalized a “patient-centered medical home” in confusing and often vague ways that included the presence of a limited number of accepted PCHM principles combined together in unspecified ways. In this sense, while a good number of the studies had independent variables which appeared to be “composites” of different types of PCMH principles (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1077558712447688">Figure 1</xref>); in fewer of these studies was the precise mix and intensity of such principles in practice clarified.</p>
<p>Other studies operationalized PCMH care in narrow and incomplete ways. For example, the study authored by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1077558712447688">Dorr, Wilcox, Brunker, Burdon, and Donnelly (2008)</xref> operationalized PCMH care through the use of nurse case managers and expanded health information technology in everyday primary care practice. A second study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1077558712447688">Ferrante, Cohen, and Crosson (2010)</xref> examined the presence of a single “patient navigator” within a practice setting as the primary PCMH intervention to evaluate. On the other hand, several studies used multiple dimensions consistent with the different Joint Principles of a Patient-Centered Medical Home put forth in determining the presence of a medical home. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1077558712447688">Gilfillan et al. (2010)</xref> used 18 different indicators, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1077558712447688">Reid et al. (2009)</xref> used 30 indicators, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1077558712447688">Jaen et al. (2010)</xref> used 39 indicators. However, these few latter studies were the exceptions. The typical approach to operationalizing “medical home” across the 21 studies involved on average only a few indicators and in some cases just one or two indicators. In some of the cases, it was difficult to map the indicator used within a study for “medical home care” onto any specific PCMH principle. Equally important, none of the 21 studies operationalized their independent variable of “medical home” in the same manner, with many studies examining the effects of medical home interventions and care models that were fundamentally different from each other.</p>
<p>One striking finding was that the majority (12) of the 21 studies used either patient, family, individual clinician, or practice self-reporting (sometimes in combination) as the central basis for establishing the extent to which one or more medical home principles existed within the research setting rather than using a more objective standard of clinical practice that could be clearly observed or documented. The means of self-reporting varied across studies, with primary or secondary surveys of different stakeholder groups the primary data collection tool used. Five of the 12 studies that used self-reporting to operationalize medical home care used secondary data to do so. Examples of the secondary data used included practice responses to the National Committee for Quality Assurance Physician Practice Connections recognition tool, and patient responses to surveys such as the National Survey of Children with Special Health Care Needs and National Survey of Children’s Health. Other studies using self-reported data used primary data collection within individual practices and among patients and clinicians in those practices.</p>
<p>The self-reported information was used in four studies to create composite “medical home indexes” that attempted to quantify the level of intensity by which a practice site exhibited one or more general medical home principles such as “holistic care.” In five studies that used self-reported information, a binary “yes/no” independent variable was constructed from the data that stated whether or not the patient was exposed to medical home–type care. However, the definition of medical home care varied across each of the five studies given that different questions were asked in each study of the patients (if using primary data) or because different secondary data were used. The majority of studies that used self-reported data to operationalize the level of medical home care present constructed proxy variables that were largely subjective and based on how much a clinician, practice, or patient felt that they were engaged in medical home–type care, and not necessarily whether there were actual medical home activities going on within those particular delivery settings.</p>
<p>We grouped study outcomes into eight categories based on the specific outcomes in the reviewed studies (e.g., emergency department utilization) as well as those commonly cited as potential outcomes of PCMHs (e.g., access to care; see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1077558712447688">Table 3</xref>). An additional “other” category was included to capture study outcomes that did not fall explicitly into any of the eight other categories (e.g., mortality, missed school or work days). The eight outcomes used for grouping the review’s findings are those commonly referred to in the medical home literature as potentially related to and benefitting from medical home–type care (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1077558712447688">Figure 1</xref>). We recognize that others may categorize these outcomes somewhat differently. For example, although utilization can be used to measure access to care, in this review we elected to separately report utilization of certain services and access to care. Access to care as an outcome in this review refers to the PCMH dimension of enhanced practice or provider access (e.g., ability of patients to schedule same-day visits), which may not be captured by simply measuring use of certain services or service locations.</p>

<p>The number and types of health care outcomes examined in relation to medical home care within specific studies also varied greatly. Nine of the 21 studies focused on only one primary outcome such as quality of care, six studies examined two to three outcomes, and six studies examined four or more outcomes. Some studies included more than one type of measure for a given outcome category (e.g., quality of care) or measured the same outcome at multiple points during the study period.</p>
<p>The most common outcome examined across studies was emergency department (ED) utilization (11 out of 21 studies). Quality of care, hospital utilization, “other utilization” (e.g., primary care visits), and patient/family experience were each examined in 7 of the 21 studies, either separately or in combination. Although medical homes are often recognized as a way to potentially lower health care costs and improve provider satisfaction, relatively few studies included cost and/or provider experience as an outcome (five and three studies, respectively). The five studies that included cost as an outcome primarily based their estimates on service utilization, although studies varied in the types of services included in their cost estimates. Several studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1077558712447688">Leff et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1077558712447688">Reid et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1077558712447688">Reid et al., 2010</xref>) also included PCMH costs in their estimates. For example, both studies by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1077558712447688">Reid et al. (2009)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1077558712447688">Reid et al. (2010)</xref> allocated PCMH implementation costs to patients receiving care through the PCMH clinic.</p>
<p>None of the 21 studies examined access to care as an outcome, as we defined it. Only two of seven studies including a quality of care outcome in the analysis also examined an additional outcome such as utilization. Thus, the 21 studies as a whole tended to avoid examining quality of care and utilization together, limiting the ability to examine the potential trade-offs of medical home care. Six studies examined outcome measures that were classified as “other” because they did not fit neatly into one of the aforementioned outcome categories. Many of these other outcomes reflected specific subpopulations included in the studies. For example, the study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1077558712447688">Rankin, Cooper, Sanabria, Binns, and Onufer (2009)</xref> focused on children with special health care needs and included missed school and parent workdays in addition to more traditional outcomes, such as emergency department utilization.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1077558712447688">Table 3</xref> presents the statistical relationships found between medical home care components and particular outcomes examined across the 21 studies. Although the studies varied in the specific outcome measures examined and how they operationalized medical home care, certain patterns emerged. Notably, different aspects of medical home care were associated with significant improvement in quality of care in each of the seven studies that included quality of care as an outcome examined. These studies tended to define quality of care in narrow ways, for example, as receipt of preventive care (e.g., cancer screening) and/or chronic disease management (e.g., A1C testing for diabetics). For example, both the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1077558712447688">Reid et al. (2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1077558712447688">2010)</xref> studies, which examined similar medical home interventions at two different points in time, aggregated 22 Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set indicators assessing screening, chronic illness care, and medication management into composite quality of care measures to evaluate the Group Health Cooperative’s ongoing medical home pilot project.</p>
<p>Other studies reported results for a much more limited set of preventive care or chronic illness measures such as cholesterol screening, blood pressure checks, and cancer screening. The study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1077558712447688">Scobie, MacKinnon, Higgins, Etchegary, and Church (2009)</xref> was the only one reviewed that did not include prevention or chronic care measures in its quality of care outcome. Rather, it assessed quality of care using self-reported measures of medical errors and medication mistakes and aspects of care coordination (e.g., coordination between hospital and community-based care).</p>
<p>Different aspects of medical home care were also associated with significantly lower ED utilization in 7 of the 11 studies with ED utilization as an outcome. Unfortunately, because of how medical home care was operationalized in many of these studies, it was difficult to conclude precisely what specific aspect(s) of medical home care may have affected ED utilization. Three studies found no significant differences in ED utilization between patients receiving or not receiving medical home care, and in one study the results were mixed. The one study with mixed results, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1077558712447688">Dorr, Wilcox, Brunker, Burdon, and Donnelly (2008)</xref>, found no significant difference in the number of ED visits between chronically ill seniors enrolled in a multidisease care management program and those not enrolled after Year 1 and significantly more ED visits in the intervention group in Year 2.</p>
<p>Only 3 of 21 studies examined provider experience as an outcome. Two of these studies found that medical home providers had significantly lower levels of burnout compared with providers not engaged in medical home care. Both these studies were similar evaluations of Group Health Cooperative’s medical home pilot project at two different time points. The results of the only other study that examined provider experience, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1077558712447688">Ferrante, Cohen, and Crosson (2010)</xref>, were mixed and limited by an extremely small provider sample size of only four physicians.</p>
<p>Associations between aspects of medical home care and the other outcome categories were less consistent across studies. For example, among the seven studies that included hospital utilization as an outcome, three found significantly lower use among patients exposed to medical home care while four found no significant differences. In each of the three studies, the implementation of some form of care management appeared linked to lower hospital use for patients. Three of the seven studies examining patient/family experiences with aspects of medical home care found significantly positive associations between patient/family experience and medical home care. Yet, four of the seven studies found no relationship between patient/family experiences and medical home care.</p>
<p>The five studies that included costs or spending as an outcome also produced mixed results, although direct comparisons across studies are difficult because of variations in the way costs were measured. While one study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1077558712447688">Dorr et al. (2008)</xref>, did find significant estimated savings associated with aspects of medical home care, another study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1077558712447688">Domino, Humble, Lawrence, and Wegner (2009)</xref>, found a significant cost increase associated with medical home care. Other studies found either no significant differences in costs or spending, such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1077558712447688">Gilfillan et al. (2010)</xref>, or the results were mixed as seen in both Reid et al. studies. Although <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1077558712447688">Reid et al. (2009)</xref> found that primary care costs were significantly higher among patients at Group Health’s pilot PCMH clinic compared with control clinics 1 year after implementation, significantly lower ED costs among medical home patients resulted in no significant differences in total costs between the two groups. A follow-up study of outcomes at 21 months after implementation had similar findings.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Several important points from the review’s findings help us make sense of the early published PCMH research. These points speak to (a) the variation we should expect with how the PCMH is implemented and studied, (b) the effectiveness of PCMH care, and (c) the continued evolution of the PCMH model and how it is evaluated. Regarding variety, this review demonstrates how differently both practitioners and researchers conceptualize PCMH care at present, the kinds of outcomes PCMH care should affect, and how PCMH success can be evaluated. This general finding is consistent with previous ones from earlier reviews of medical home–type care (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1077558712447688">Homer et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1077558712447688">Friedberg et al., 2009</xref>). Some of this variety is expected and advantageous, particularly for a concept whose latest manifestation has existed only since 2007. However, other variation threatens our ability to assess PCMH care delivery, compare PCMH care across settings, and promote a comprehensive, consistent operational definition of PCMH care.</p>
<p>The review reveals important information regarding the effectiveness of different aspects of PCMH care. First, PCMH interventions are associated favorably with select health care outcomes. However, the type and range of outcomes linked to PCMH care vary across studies. Perhaps the most compelling finding is that medical home care is associated consistently with improvements in specific aspects of quality of care, notably enhanced prevention and chronic disease management. The findings looking at how medical home interventions affect utilization are more underwhelming. For a majority of studies that examined it, emergency department use decreased when aspects of medical home care were present. However, the findings for hospital utilization were mixed at best.</p>
<p>Only a few studies examined provider experiences as outcomes of medical home interventions. These studies suggest that some aspects of medical home care may enhance the primary care physician’s everyday work experience, particularly in relation to psychological attributes such as feelings of burnout. The findings regarding patient and family experiences with medical home interventions are mixed, with the majority of the seven studies examining this outcome finding that medical home care makes no difference in the patient or family experience. This is a meaningful finding. If many patients ultimately do not recognize the positive differences conveyed to them within a medical home care environment, then the model will have failed in at least part of its intent. The lack of patient value ascribed to the receipt of medical home care may also doom the model to a short-lived future.</p>
<p>Finally, it is surprising that greater or more effective access to care, defined primarily as an enhanced ability for patients to visit and communicate with their primary care doctor and practice, was not included as an examined outcome in any of the 21 studies. Enhanced patient access is an outcome associated with several PCMH care dimensions (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1077558712447688">Figure 1</xref>), and particularly with specific PCMH interventions such as the use of electronic medical records and open access scheduling. Not including it in PCMH evaluations that employed these types of interventions leaves a knowledge gap that future PCMH research must fill. In addition, cost of care was an examined outcome in only 5 of the 21 studies, although it is a relevant outcome influenced by several different PCMH dimensions. The mixed results of these studies make it difficult to draw a definitive conclusion about the effect of medical home care on costs or spending within a practice setting or organization. This is also an important finding that needs additional study. More must be known about the overall expense of providing medical home care, particularly with respect to costly interventions such as greater use of team-based care, health information technology, and care management protocols.</p>
<sec id="section12-1077558712447688">
<title>Implications of Medical Home Study Variety</title>
<p>The variety of outcomes examined across the 21 studies raises two key questions: (a) what outcomes normally should be examined in relation to PCMH care and (b) how many different outcomes should be included in a given evaluation? <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1077558712447688">Figure 1</xref> suggests that at least two or three specific outcomes should be included in every PCMH evaluation, since each care dimension of the overall model is linked to multiple outcomes, and to be considered a true medical home most settings should be implementing multiple care dimensions simultaneously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1077558712447688">Carrier et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1077558712447688">Friedberg et al., 2009</xref>). A majority of the studies included in this review examined only one or two outcomes. This limits the conclusions we can draw regarding the full value of and trade offs inherent in medical home interventions at the present time.</p>
<p>Greater examination of multiple outcomes simultaneously would shed light on the overall trade offs associated with PCMH care. For example, it makes sense to try and examine quality of care, cost, and utilization simultaneously when implementing the coordinated or integrated care dimension of the PCMH model, given that greater care coordination relies on interventions that may shift utilization patterns (e.g., from specialty to primary care; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1077558712447688">Reid et al., 2009</xref>), require additional staff (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1077558712447688">Gilfillan et al., 2010</xref>), and force investments in health information technology. Continuing this example, only by knowing how care coordination reshapes utilization and cost patterns within practices at the same time it improves quality can we understand the net added value and unintended consequences of PCMH care.</p>
<p>Other variety observed through the review is worth considering for its implications related to PCMH implementation and evaluation. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1077558712447688">Table 4</xref> summarizes this variety. For example, the term <italic>patient-centered medical home</italic> is defined and operationalized very differently across the 21 studies in this review, with most of the studies calling only one or a few of the kinds of interventions listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1077558712447688">Table 1</xref> indicative of medical home care. This finding was also noted in earlier examinations of a few select medical home demonstration projects (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1077558712447688">Friedberg et al., 2009</xref>). A majority of the studies also used subjective assessments by patient and providers to determine whether or not aspects of medical home care were present in the setting. The emphasis on using self-reporting as the primary means to determine whether or not medical home care is present in a setting is problematic. In many cases it is the result of researchers using secondary data created for other reasons retrospectively to concoct proxies for the presence and intensity of medical home care.</p>

</table-wrap-foot></table-wrap>
<p>While using secondary data to construct PCMH variables offers advantages in terms of greater timeliness and lower cost for the research, the presence of medical home care in a practice setting should ideally be established through some form of objective verification, that is, it can be shown that the practice is conducting specific activities and has specific infrastructure and cultural elements in place and working appropriately that meet the standard for the different medical home principles. In addition, relying primarily on stakeholder self-reporting to gauge the extent of medical home care threatens to represent medical homes as subjective or “felt” phenomena. This could undermine the concept itself, reducing it to something that exists more in the eye of the beholder rather than in any objective sense.</p>
<p>Regarding the designs used across the 21 studies, only a third of the 21 studies used any type of quasi-experimental design that ideally offers the ability to compare situations where medical home care is and is not present. Most of the studies were cross-sectional in nature and used secondary data of some kind. Again, some level of diversity in PCMH evaluative designs is both expected and appropriate, especially in the formative stages of the concept’s implementation. It facilitates timely research. It also may enable more PCMH evaluative findings across a wider range of practice settings, particularly smaller ones that may only have limited performance data to share or analyze. However, the existence of too much PCMH research that cannot elucidate causality will produce a lower quality and less informative evaluative body of work over time.</p>
<p>Given the large costs in terms of time, energy, and money associated with medical home implementation in even the smallest of primary care practice settings, it behooves the field to produce more research that can show clearly whether or not it is PCMH care that shapes specific outcomes and not something else. One practical suggestion would be to develop a PCMH research database, similar to that seen in the Cochrane Reviews or Community Guide published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which sorts and grades published research in terms of various aspects of design and methodological quality. This would at least make it clear how PCMH evaluations differ from each other and provide greater transparency for assessing the completeness of evaluations.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1077558712447688">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Doing timely PCMH evaluative research is important given the rapid adoption of medical home care models nationally and the financial investments being made. There is an urgent need to understand how PCMH interventions of the types listed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1077558712447688">Figure 1</xref> work, and there is a case to be made that at this early point it may be better to sacrifice some degree of specificity for a wider array of results. In addition, it may be unrealistic to expect too much uniformity in how PCMH research is conducted. For example, to examine outcomes such as access, patient and provider experiences, patient involvement, and costs of care may require extensive primary data collection (e.g., surveys, collecting cost and access data at the practice level), which requires time, money, and cooperation from practice staff and patients.</p>
<p>It may be more realistic to expect that the comprehensive PCMH evaluations will tend to come from large, integrated primary care practices such as Group Health or Kaiser Permanente that have the resources, infrastructure, and culture to conduct them. These may also be the types of practice settings that achieve a more complete implementation of comprehensive PCMH care, perhaps leading to a tiered system of PCMH care models across the country. For other primary care practice settings, especially the more typical ones that are smaller and with fewer resources, the best we may be able to do is to use their existing performance measurement infrastructure, geared mainly toward producing information for various accrediting bodies such as NCQA, to also assess PCMH care effectiveness. In some cases, that infrastructure will be sufficient to generate good data to evaluate PCMH care, and in other cases it will not. These will also tend to be the settings in which a less comprehensive PCMH definition is put into practice, with fewer interventions of the kind listed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1077558712447688">Figure 1</xref>.</p>
<p>However, given that a “patient-centered medical home” is defined in theory to be multifaceted in terms of interventions, each with its own specific efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1077558712447688">Friedberg et al., 2009</xref>; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1077558712447688">Figure 1</xref>), it can be concluded that almost all the studies included in this review, with the exception of the few that include a larger number of dimensions in their medical home measures, examine incomplete versions of <italic>comprehensive</italic> medical home care. While each may tell us something useful about some aspect of medical home care, larger evaluative statements on overall model efficacy remain elusive. Perhaps more important, policy makers and managers may be tempted to draw definitive conclusions about the worth of a comprehensive PCMH care delivery model based on PCMH implementation descriptions or evaluation results that reflect at best partial versions of that comprehensive model.</p>
<p>Patient-centered medical home care is still in its infancy. The results of this review show that different aspects of medical home care may have value. Yet, the early body of research raises more questions than it answers. From a policy standpoint, we will require more valid and reliable information to determine the future level of investment and attention that this care innovation warrants. From a research standpoint, the field requires greater standardization and integrity of evaluative designs and data so that the empirical work grows more comparable. The early PCMH research appears to reflect both the wide variation in how medical homes are being designed and implemented in practice and in how researchers are choosing to evaluate PCMH design and implementation. While it is reasonable to expect these issues to sort themselves out as the PCMH model of care spreads, it should not be seen as a given that they will. As such, this review raises red flags that suggest asking harder questions about what “patient-centered medical home care” really consists of in practice, and what the minimum quality and procedural standards should be in terms of judging its effectiveness.</p>
