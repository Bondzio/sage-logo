<abstract>
<p>To perform a retrospective survey of the clinical features and clinical courses of diabetic foot patients with amputations hospitalized in the Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University from 2007 to 2011.According to the database from the medical records department in our hospital 36 cases of diabetic patients were selected out of 805 cases of amputees. The clinical information was recorded in detail. With the contact information provided in the medical record, telephone interviews were conducted for each patient and their family to complete the record for the current disease progression and the patient’s treatment process. Among all of the patients with hospitalized amputations, 36/805(4.47%) were diabetic foot patients with amputations, accounting for 36/273(13.19%) of non-traumatic amputations. The average age of the diabetic patients with first-time amputations was 62 years, the average BMI was greater than 24.5kg/m2, and the waist-to-hip ratio was greater than 0.92. Among the 22 patients who completed the follow-up interviews, 17 had only small amputations. Diabetic amputation has become a common clinical problem. The patients were mainly elderly, overweight or obese. Amputations at the toe level still accounted for a large proportion of the patients. Overall, the follow-up interviews indicated that the patients lacked good understanding of and concern for their own disease, with unclear control of blood sugar and no standardized control method. Helping the patients to understand the disease and paying attention to health education may play a role in the prevention and treatment of diabetes and diabetic foot disease.</p>

<body>
<p>With the improved standard of living in China, the diabetes morbidity rate is increasing annually, from 2.5% in 1994 to 5.5% in 2003,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1534734612457030">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1534734612457030"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1534734612457030">3</xref></sup> causing diabetes to become a major public health problem in China. A recent survey found that these data were likely underestimated; according to the double-standard diagnostic of fasting plasma glucose levels and 2-hour plasma glucose levels from oral glucose tolerance tests with a large sample size in multiple centers around the country, the current morbidity rate of diabetes for adults in China is 9.7%; in 60.7% of these cases, the adults had not been previously diagnosed with diabetes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1534734612457030">4</xref></sup> A serious complication of long-term diabetes is diabetic foot disease. In China, diabetic foot disease is the reason for an initial visit to the doctor for many patients. Unfortunately amputations is the final step in the clinical treatment of diabetic foot disease, and it seriously affects the patient’s quality of life. Some reports have indicated that approximately 15% of diabetic patients have lower extremity ulcers in their lifetime, and 7% to 20% of patients with foot ulcers were eventually forced to have amputations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1534734612457030">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1534734612457030">6</xref></sup> Although the Asian population has a lower amputation rate compared to that of Caucasians,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1534734612457030">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1534734612457030">7</xref></sup> its importance should not be ignored. To gain a more detailed understanding of the occurrence and development process of this disease and the quality of life, habits, and attitudes toward the medical care of diabetic foot patients with amputations, this investigation selected diabetic foot patients with amputations who were hospitalized in the Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University from 2007 to 2011 as the participant sample, retrospectively surveyed their cases in each hospitalization, and followed up their current disease statuses by telephone interviews.</p>
<sec id="section1-1534734612457030" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods and Data Collection</title>
<p>This study involved 1 retrospective survey in a single center. All the amputation patients hospitalized in the Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University from January 1, 2007, to May 31, 2011, were screened for this survey. The demographic information and general medical history of the patients were recorded, and the cases with amputations resulting from diabetic foot disease were selected. According to the relevant information and all the available medical records of each hospitalization for the corresponding patients, both the treatment processes while hospitalized and the data from related examinations were recorded. Based on the contact information provided by the patients, follow-up telephone interviews were conducted to determine the patients’ current disease status with a follow-up period of up to 5 years starting from the first diabetic amputation in our hospital. The contents of the follow-up interview for a patient included routine lifestyle, medical care habits, treatments for diabetes, the current situation of the limb, whether the contralateral limb showed lesions, and the treatment process outside of the hospital.</p>
<p>During the follow-up telephone interview, 4 indicators measured for each patient were recorded: height, weight, and waist and hip circumferences. Generally, these data were completed with the assistance of the patients’ family members. The measurement method needed to be elucidated, so that the accuracy of each measurement was ensured as much as possible. The following instructions were given for waist and hip measurements. To obtain the waist measurement, in a natural quiet breathing state, remove the waist covering, stand relaxed and with both hands drooping naturally; at the end of a breath, use a measuring tape to circle around the abdomen through the level of the midpoint between the anterior superior iliac spine and the lower edges of the twelfth ribs. To obtain a hip measurement, standing with both legs close together and both hands drooping naturally, use a tape measure to circle around the levels of the symphysis pubis and gluteus maximus to measure the largest circumference. Taking into account their level of expertise, the patients’ family members were typically asked to measure the waist circumference using the tape measure around the waist band horizontally and measure the hip circumference with the tape measure around the most protruding parts horizontally.</p>

<title>Results of the Survey Data</title>
<p>From 2007 to 2011, a total of 805 cases of hospitalized amputations occurred in the Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University. All the hospitalized amputations could be classified as belonging to the traumatic amputation group or the nontraumatic amputation group. Diabetic amputations can be seen as part of nontraumatic amputation. Data are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1534734612457030">Figure 1</xref>. In the telephone interviews, 6 patients explicitly rejected follow-up, 8 could not be contacted because of disconnection of the telephone service or other reasons, and 22 were successfully followed up; the success rate for a completed follow-up was 61.11% (22/36). Among the patients with completed follow-up, 4 people died.</p>

<title>Statistical Results of Data From the Medical Records</title>
<p>Among the 36 diabetic foot patients with hospitalized amputations in our hospital, 8 patients were illiterate, 14 had elementary school as their highest level of education, 10 had junior high school as their highest level of education, 3 had high school as their highest level of education, and 1 had a college degree or higher education. According to the medical records, the mean age of the patients who had their first amputation was 62.77 ± 10.55 years, and all the amputations were associated with diabetes.

<p>Because not all the patients had their first diabetic amputation in our hospital, the average age here is the age of the patients at hospitalization. The days and cost of hospitalization were available for statistical analysis; thus, the sources for these data are different from that for the age at the first amputation.</p>

<p>According to the initial examination reports provided in the medical records, the statistical results were as follows: the average BMI of the patients was 22.92 ± 3.45 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, the mean glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) level was 10.02% ± 2.66%, and the blood glucose value for the first biochemical tests was 10.71 ± 5.16 mmol/L, which might be a little higher than the actual value because this value does not necessarily represent a fasting blood glucose value.</p>

<title>Results of Follow-up Data From the Telephone Interviews</title>
<p>The 22 patients with successful follow-up interviews included 16 male and 6 female patients. Excluding the 4 patients who had died, the average age of the 18 patients was 64.94 ± 11.52 years. The 4 deceased patients included 3 men and 1 woman whose ages at death were 75, 76, 57, and 87 years. The 57-year-old patient died in the emergency department with no available record, and the family members of this patient declined to disclose other information. Among these 22 patients, 5 patients were illiterate, 10 had elementary school as their highest level of education, 5 had junior high school as their highest level of education, and 2 had high school as their highest level of education. The follow-up periods for all the patients with successful follow-up interviews were up to 5 years after the first amputation.</p>
<p>Among these 22 patients, 8 were diagnosed as having diabetes from the first symptoms of diabetic foot disease when they came for medical treatment; 4 of these cases experienced multiple amputations and involved amputation above the metatarsophalangeal joint plane. The remaining 14 cases were diagnosed as having diabetes by routine physical examination or during the process of treatment for other diseases. For the period starting from the time diabetes was diagnosed and up to the current time (or death), the medical treatments, medication situations, insulin medications, blood sugar control measures, major complications, and lifestyles of the patients are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1534734612457030">Table 2</xref>.</p>

<p>According to the descriptions of the patients and their families, lesions of both lower limbs were noted in 6 patients, including 3 men and 3 women who were 75, 84, 56, 87, 76, and 84 years of age. Amputation was implemented for 3 of these patients, including 1 case of self-amputation. The other 3 patients only exhibited swelling, with no ulcerations of the contralateral limb after the first amputation. Imaging studies indicated vascular lesions; thus, salvage treatment was administered.</p>
<p>Of these 22 cases, 7 patients experienced 2 or 3 amputations, including 6 patients who experienced 2 amputations and 1 patient who experienced 3 amputations. Two amputations occurred within 1 year for 3 patients, 2 amputations occurred within 2 years for 2 patients, and 2 amputations occurred within 4.5 years for 1 patient. All 5 of the cases involving amputation above the metatarsophalangeal joint had histories of multiple amputations. The 7 patients with multiple amputations included 2 cases of amputation occurring on ipsilateral but different toes, 3 cases of higher amputations occurring on the base of the last amputation, and 3 cases of contralateral amputations. Among all the patients, 6 patients experienced limb salvage treatment for either of their lower limbs, including 1 case of death with no amputation in the salvaged limb; the remaining 5 patients are currently in good limb salvage condition.</p>
<p>Among all the patients, 12 people had smoking histories, and 5 of those had quit smoking for more than 5 years; 10 people had histories of alcohol consumption, and 4 of those had quit alcohol for more than 5 years; and 7 people had histories of both smoking and drinking, including 3 patients who currently continue to smoke and drink. In terms of patient complications, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1534734612457030">Figure 3</xref> gives a clear demonstration. Another patient diagnosed with uremia had dialysis treatment. However, the available phone number for this patient was no longer valid, and we could therefore not determine their current situation.</p>

<p>Neuropathic and vascular problems could be very important in the process of the lesion. We diagnose neuropathy and vascular disease based on evidence that could include clinical manifestations, physical examinations, imaging examinations, vibration perception threshold tests, and the patient’s diagnosis. All the patients had neuropathy or vascular disease or both. Only 1 patient had no sufficient evidence for neuropathy, and 4 patients had no sufficient evidence for peripheral vascular disease.</p>
<p>In our hospital, we take swabs for bacterial cultures and drug-sensitive studies only when the wound has a sign of infection. Dry gangrene with a clear edge and absence of exudation might not be a good enough reason for bacterial culture. Among the 22 patients, 17 patients were considered to have a bacterial infection, whereas for 4 of them, it was confirmed that there was no wound site infection. The other 5 patients had no bacterial culture report. It was found that 5 patients had MRSA (methycillin-resistant <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>) or <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> infection. Other bacteria such as <italic>S aureus, S epidermidis, Citrobacter, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Klebsiella</italic>, and <italic>Morganella morganii</italic> were also detected.</p>
<p>In the retrospective study, we only found 1 suspected Charcot foot case. The patient was a 58-year-old man who had a spontaneous fracture on his right foot. He had a clear history of trauma before the chronic ulcer began, and there was also sufficient evidence to diagnose neuropathy but not enough to diagnose peripheral vascular disease.</p>
<p>The current data on height, weight, and waist and hip circumferences were typically obtained with the assistance of the patients’ children or local clinics. According to results from the collected data, the average BMI of the patients was 24.18 ± 4.12 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, and the average waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) was 0.92 ± 0.053.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study was a single-center, retrospective survey. The hospital in the survey is an upper-class first-grade hospital in a central city in Zhejiang Province, and its patients are mainly from Zhejiang Province; diabetic foot patients are mainly residents of areas surrounding the city. The wound treatment center in this hospital was established in 2004 and mainly addresses refractory wounds, with a substantial proportion of those cases being caused by diabetic foot disease. Most patients with diabetic foot disease are outpatients whose treatment consists of dressing changes and limb salvage. Many small amputations can be processed in the outpatient department without any hospitalization. This survey was only for diabetic amputees with hospitalized treatment. In this survey, to understand the condition of the patients with diabetic foot disease in Zhejiang Province, the patients’ conditions were understood in detail, the clinical processes were observed, and the current statuses of the patients were followed up by telephone interviews.</p>
<p>Because most of the diabetic foot patients received treatment in the outpatient department, the number of diabetic patients with hospitalizations and amputations was not large, and their conditions were relatively severe. In the past 5 years, only 36 patients with diabetic foot disease received hospitalized treatment. They were mainly elderly people and had low levels of education: 88.89% had junior high school or below as their highest level of education. Among the 22 patients with completed follow-up interviews, 90.91% had junior high school or below as their highest level of education, which is a significantly higher percentage than the proportion of people with the same education level in China (70.14%) and Zhejiang province (72.9%), according to the most recent national census data. Most patients and their family members could not accurately and clearly describe their conditions; additionally, they were often reluctant to seek medical treatment, did not care about the disease for various reasons, or dealt with the diabetes and diabetic foot disease in ways that were appropriate in their own minds, which often resulted in delays in receiving the proper treatment. In the follow-up interview process, we determined that if the interviewee was a male family member of the patient, such as the husband or a son, the interviewee was typically reluctant to disclose more information and even refused to provide other direct contact information for the patient. The male family members of these patients often did not meet the patients by themselves, and therefore, their answers were too vague to provide accurate information for many questions; also, they were more likely to interrupt the interview for various reasons. It is interesting to note that all the interviewees who explicitly refused the follow-up interview were male relatives of the 6 patients, whereas of the 4 cases for which complete and accurate information within 2 telephone conversations could be provided, female family members of the patients, who could typically interact with the patients by themselves more frequently or were even used to taking regular care of the patients, provided the information; the remaining 1 case was a male patient himself. We can speculate that in the process of treatment, more communication with a patient’s female family member can contribute to the amount of emphasis that the patient’s family places on the patient’s condition and would also be conducive to disease control.</p>
<p>Among the patients with successful follow-ups, 8 patients sought medical treatment with diabetic foot disease as the primary symptom, and 4 other patients had diabetic amputations less than 3 years after diabetes was diagnosed, demonstrating that more than half of the patients with diabetes were diagnosed in the later stages of the disease. All the patients with a large number of amputations had diabetes that was diagnosed late. Of the 7 patients who experienced multiple amputations, 5 belonged to this group, whereas the other 2 of the 7 patients had diabetic histories of 7 and 13 years, respectively. Combining the above data, multiple or high diabetic foot amputations are more likely in patients with late-diagnosed diabetes and long disease histories, who have not paid enough attention to the diabetes itself, and who have received nonstandard treatment.</p>
<p>Considering the lifestyles of the patients, the 6 patients with no history of either smoking or drinking experienced only small amputations, and 2 of these patients presented contralateral limb lesions in imaging studies. Because of the pain or redness/swelling on the contralateral limb that was described by these 2 patients, they are currently receiving salvage treatment. However, 4 of the 7 patients with histories of both smoking and drinking experienced a number of amputations, and 2 received high amputations. Thus, patients who smoked and drank were more likely to require more serious amputations. When the patients were asked how to change their lifestyles to control diabetes, all 22 patients replied that they had to watch their diet and avoid sweets. When more dietary considerations were mentioned, the understanding levels of these aspects were uneven for different patients, and even some of the patients’ family members could not provide answers regarding other diet control methods. Regarding medication use, almost all the patients had tried oral medication for treating their diabetes in a nontraditional manner. In the follow-up interviews, 12 patients had received insulin treatment, and 8 of them had adjusted the medication dose without following the doctor’s advice; they either had not visited the doctor to adjust the dose for several years or had adjusted the dose by themselves. The patients almost always relied on a sensation of syncope or not feeling like themselves to judge the appropriateness of the amount of insulin. According to the responses of the patients and their family members in the survey, only 3 patients had made obvious lifestyle changes after diabetes was diagnosed; of these, 2 patients accepted the follow-up interviews by themselves, and the daughter of the remaining patient accepted the follow-up interview. They were all very cooperative during the interview and typically intended to talk. The patients changed their lifestyles and improved their quality of life through low-sugar diets, regular sleep, increased daily exercise, regular medication, and regular doctor visits.</p>
<p>Many surveys have revealed that patients with lower and more stable blood sugar levels are at lower risk of diabetic amputation; additionally, patients with healthy lifestyles, such as those who do not smoke and take part in regular exercise, are also at lower risk of lower-limb diabetic amputation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1534734612457030">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1534734612457030"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1534734612457030">10</xref></sup> However, the survey results demonstrated that the current glycemic control situation for diabetic patients in China is not optimistic. Problems that included a lack of frequent regular checkups, a lack of knowledge regarding drugs for blood sugar control, and a lack of good or improved lifestyles directly affected blood glucose levels and patient stability. Certain issues such as the lack of a medical treatment concept leading to a lack of a scientific understanding of the disease and a lack of timely detection by podiatry exacerbate the disease condition.</p>
<p>According to the standard recommended by the China Obesity Task Force and the Center for Disease Control in China, those with a BMI &gt;24 kg/m<sup>2</sup> are considered overweight and a BMI &gt;28 kg/m<sup>2</sup> are considered obese. Of the 14 patients with known accurate height and weight measurements, 3 patients could be diagnosed as obese; all were men between the ages of 56 and 68 years. Chinese men with WHRs greater than 0.9 and women with WHRs greater than 0.8 are generally considered centrally obese. Based on this standard, the only 9 patients with complete data were all centrally obese, and 4 of these patients had not yet reached the standard of overweight.</p>
<p>In the diabetic amputees, most had at least 1 complication, and there were many cases of diabetic nephropathy. The diabetic patients with nephropathy had higher rates of lower-extremity amputations,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1534734612457030">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1534734612457030">10</xref></sup> and their medical costs were higher than those of patients without any complications or nephropathy complications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1534734612457030">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>Diabetes is a chronic disease that requires long-term treatment and involves a heavy economic burden. For the 36 patients involved in this survey, their hospitalization costs for a single amputation were not significantly different from those for an ordinary amputation. However, diabetic patients typically need to seek diabetes treatment several times as either outpatients or inpatients. Additionally, the cost of long-term prescription medication was not included in the cost of treatment. Thus, the economic burden caused by diabetic amputations was underestimated. A recent survey revealed that Chinese diabetic patients pay only 10% of the total medical expenses, which equals the sum of 5.7 years’ wages for an ordinary Chinese citizen. Although the cost to patients is lower than the cost in the other 4 countries involved in the survey, it is still a heavy burden for a family. Additionally, the government pays 90% of the medical expenses, which is a significant expenditure for society.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1534734612457030">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>This survey has certain limitations. First, the selected institution for the survey is a central hospital in an affluent region of China. Although many of the patients came from different areas, the study could only reflect the situation of the local area instead of the overall situation of diabetic amputations in China. Furthermore, with the improvement of the outpatient wound treatment center in our hospital, more patients received treatment as outpatients, and there was thus no admission information for them. This survey did not include this part of the population, which was significantly larger than the number of patients with hospitalized amputations. Thus, only a small number of patients were included in this survey. With many personalized factors for each patient, the statistics based on a large sample size were not available; instead, many descriptive statements were made regarding the treatment procedures and the occurrence and development of disease situations for the diabetic patients who received hospitalized treatments in this hospital. Because the telephone interviews for follow-up were mostly the patients’ own evaluations of the disease and the test results were also described by the patients as summaries of multiple test results (which often missed some professionally significant data that were ignored by the patients), the given data are relatively crude and only reflect the general situations of the patients. Furthermore, because of various factors, such as the educational levels of the patients and the current doctor-patient relationships, it was difficult for the patients to adhere to medical treatments at the same hospital; some even sought medical treatment only when their amputations occurred. The patients typically did not know enough about their own condition and could not clearly state the diagnosis and treatment. Additionally, because the patients were not used to frequently requesting medical care as returning patients, many types of laboratory data were not available for inclusion in this survey.</p>
