            <p>Novice Web developers and other technical communicators need to learn not only accessibility standards but also factors that make designs usable to audiences with disabilities. One challenge of teaching accessibility to novices is creating exigency; another is emulating experiences of users with disabilities. This article tackles teaching novices to create Web sites for visually impaired audiences using a five-stage, recursive approach. Teaching best coding practices is only one stage: Instructors should create exigency by introducing real users and their experiences. They should also check for accessibility and emulate screen-reader output using tools such as WAVE and FANGS, respectively. Furthermore, novice developers should examine how different tools can be used in combination to provide a variety of feedback.</p>

      <p>Technical communication classes need strategies for introducing accessibility, or “mak[ing]. . . content more accessible to people with disabilities” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1050651912458924">World Wide Web Consortium [W3C], 2008</xref>), in succinct, concrete ways in our already content-packed classes. Web development is a good example of a relevant course: In one semester, the course may cover elements of coding (Hypertext Markup Language [HTML] and Cascading Style Sheets [CSS]), design and design process, mobile access, site architecture, information architecture, site management, publishing, copyright, and ethics. In addition to these concepts, these courses often introduce some of the tools that developers use, such as text editors, Web editors, and photo manipulation applications. Students often read about accessibility and learn strategies for making a site more accessible to users whose disabilities can range from “visual, auditory, physical, speech, cognitive, language, learning. . . to neurological” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1050651912458924">W3C, 2008</xref>), but finding ways to help students better engage with the material can be tricky. Likewise, in introductory courses, students, who are sometimes from diverse majors, must learn a wide range of concepts—from genres, to rhetorical awareness, to ethics of graphics—so a unit on accessibility must be engaging and concise. Ideally, a unit on accessibility will also imbue nondisabled students with an understanding of users’ experiences (e.g., users with visual impairments) and demonstrate the exigency of accessibility. This article presents a usability-oriented approach for classes with document-production components, including Web sites.</p>
      <p>For multiple reasons, including legal and ethical ones, students should learn about accessibility. In the 1990s and 2000s, statutes (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1050651912458924">Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1050651912458924">Americans With Disabilities Act Amendments of 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1050651912458924">Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1050651912458924">Telecommunications Act of 1996</xref>) expanded on previous law. Most notable were the amendments to the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1050651912458924">Rehabilitation Act of 1973</xref>, requiring parts of the government—Federal, but also affecting some states and educational institutions—to make their electronic and information technology accessible. For instance, the Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1998, commonly referred to as Section 508, set accessibility standards for electronic and information technology for Federal departments and agencies; their Web sites must adhere to these standards. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1050651912458924">
            <italic>The National Federation of the Blind v. Target Corporation</italic> (2006)</xref> ruling set a precedent in making businesses accountable for Web accessibility as well, one indicator that the Web is seen as a public place and thus should be made accessible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1050651912458924">Kaufman-Scarborough &amp; Childers, 2009</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1050651912458924">Theofanos and Redish (2003a</xref>) made the case for building accessible Web sites, pointing to the already-large, growing number of people with disabilities; the sound business practice of expanding a Web site’s reach; the importance of the Web for users with disability; and the usability benefits that nondisabled users receive. Most important, though, they added, “it’s morally the right thing to do” (p. 39).</p>
      <p>Technical communication work on accessibility is broad, but we can do more. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1050651912458924">Rude (2009</xref>) identified accessibility as one of the central research issues in technical communication. Accessibility research includes studies of discourse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1050651912458924">Adam &amp; Kreps, 2009</xref>), of theoretical frameworks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27a-1050651912458924">Spinuzzi, 2007</xref>), and of populations and technologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1050651912458924">O’Hara, 2004</xref>), as well as targeted usability studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1050651912458924">Leporini &amp; Paternò, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1050651912458924">Theofanos &amp; Redish, 2003a</xref>). But in 2006, Palmeri challenged teachers of technical communication to reach further and draw on disability studies to inform our pedagogy, including accessibility work related to usability. Disability theorists wrestle with issues such as social discomfort of the nondisabled, othering of the disabled, and identity, with some (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1050651912458924">Hughes, 2007</xref>) arguing strongly for disability identity. The work Palmeri called for would move away from a model born from “focus[ing] on rehabilitating people with disabilities so that they can fit into an ableist society” to examine “the social construction of disability and normalcy” (pp. 50–51). Among other things, Palmeri pointed to how we marginalize assistive technology in the classroom by perhaps having only one computer with access to the technology.</p>
      <p>One of Palmeri’s suggested approaches is for students to experience a Web site with both a conventional browser and assistive technology—such as screen readers, which, in part, read aloud the text and structure (e.g., heading and table markup)—comparing and analyzing the two experiences. This approach, which offers nondisabled students a needed contrast to their own experiences, is valuable in teaching them to understand the experiences of users with disabilities, particularly visual impairments. Testimonials indicate that computer science students who have participated in a class with a screen-reader approach valued the experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1050651912458924">Freire, Fortes, Paiva, &amp; Turine, 2007</xref>).</p>
      <p>But using assistive technology in class is not always feasible, given budget and computer lab limitations. For example, reputable assistive technologies often have a high learning curve and are expensive—the JAWS screen reader runs $895 for a standard copy for an individual user (as opposed to the professional version or multiuser version)—and free technologies, such as System Access To Go, may be limited to one operating system or be too new to be proven stable. In addition, both require lab managers to install them. Also, such restrictions limit instructors’ abilities to teach best practices for assuring that student deliverables are accessible.</p>
      <p>Part of a possible solution is using a combination of free tools available online to help students not only to check for a site’s adherence to guidelines but also to emulate, as much as possible, the experience of users with disabilities. Here I use FANGS, an add-on to Firefox that emulates a screen reader. But guidelines and developer practices change, as do tools. As a result, students need to be aware that multiple tools exist (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1050651912458924">Table 1</xref>), that tools work differently, and that tools change. Furthermore, different tools provide different information and displays and can be used in conjunction with one another. For instance, some tools check for adherence to guidelines and produce a list of problems by severity. Others are what the W3C Web Accessibility Initiative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1050651912458924">WAI, 2005</xref>) called transformation tools, “tools [that] modify the appearence [<italic>sic</italic>] of the Web sites to help identify conceptual design issues. [Such] tools may present the content of Web sites in text only, without color, or read the content aloud.”</p>

      <p>Students’ tool kits may vary, but they should include transformation tools so that students can better conceptualize problems. FANGS is one such valuable transformation tool in the classroom and for developers because it simulates—in text—a screen reader’s output for an HTML page (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1050651912458924">Figure 1</xref>). Because FANGS is a browser add-on, students can quickly install it even if they do not have permission to add software, and it can be added in both Mac and PC labs. Although FANGS has been used in accessibility research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1050651912458924">Kopackova, Michalek, &amp; Cejna, 2009</xref>), and its merits for development have been touted (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1050651912458924">Greeff &amp; Kotzé, 2009</xref>), this article differs from those accessibilities studies in that it looks at FANGS’s pedagogical value, describing how instructors can use FANGS in conjunction with video and other Internet-accessible tools in order to teach students about accessibility and help them check the accessibility of HTML-based deliverables. In doing so, it presents a model for classroom application that ties in research-based best practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1050651912458924">Leporini &amp; Paternò, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1050651912458924">Theofanos &amp; Redish, 2003a</xref>), providing a strategy that instructors can use in classes that can devote time to only a small unit on accessibility.</p>

            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1050651912458924">Palmeri (2006</xref>) contended that “usability scholars have been at the forefront of considering ways to increase access for users with disabilities” (p. 55). As defined by the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1050651912458924">International Organization for Standardization (ISO 9241, 1998</xref>), <italic>usability</italic> is “the extent to which a product can be used by specified users to achieve specified goals with effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction in a specified context of use” (p. 6). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1050651912458924">Barnum (2008</xref>) contended that technical communication shifted its focus to usability in the early 1990s. By the early 2000s, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1050651912458924">Breuch, Zachry, and Spinuzzi (2001</xref>) argued for programs adding usability as a stand-alone course or as components of other courses, describing as examples the addition of usability courses at Texas Tech (1994), the University of Minnesota (1999), and Utah State (2000). Although Breuch et al. did not explicitly discuss accessibility as part of the instruction, they noted that “past projects [at Utah State] have led to the creation of new associations between the technical writing program and groups on campus, including . . . the USU Center for Persons with Disabilities” (p. 234).</p>
         <p>Unfortunately, designers sometimes conceive of Web accessibility as technical accessibility, or complying with the standards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1050651912458924">Brajnik, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1050651912458924">Sloan, 2006</xref>, as cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1050651912458924">Petrie &amp; Kheir, 2007</xref>), such as using alternative text for images. Petrie and Kheir argued that, in contrast, we should adopt the concept of usable accessibility discussed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1050651912458924">Thatcher et al. (2003</xref>) and others, or accessibility that parallels usability. A truly accessible design not only must meet the principles core to accessibility—perceivability, operability, understandability, and robustness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1050651912458924">W3C, 2008</xref>)—it must be usable to users with disabilities (by the ISO’s definition). Ideally, a document will not only be accessible to users with disabilities, allowing them to do what they need to do or to get basic information, but it will be usable, providing them with an experience that is effective, efficient, and satisfying.</p>

            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1050651912458924">Slatin (2001</xref>), among others, argued for teaching what he called “access-first design” (p. 76), or design that focuses on accessibility first rather than as an afterthought, so all users have a robust experience. Slatin asserted “that an experience rich and meaningful for participants with disabilities is likely to be rich and meaningful for others also” (p. 74). His claim is echoed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1050651912458924">Theofanos and Redish’s  (2003a)</xref> claim that making a Web site accessible “improves usability for all users” (p. 39).

         <title>The Need for a Multifaceted Classroom Approach</title>
         <p>To better understand the experiences of users with disabilities, nondisabled students need to be engaged in similar experiences. The closely related field of human–computer interaction offers guidance for teaching accessibility. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1050651912458924">Chambel, Antunes, Duarte, Carriço, and Guimarães (2009</xref>) recommended that in addition to requiring students’ work to be accessible, instructors should “bring assistive technology to life. . . and if possible get a user of assistive technology. . . to give a demonstration of their practices” (p. 128). Readings, including those on accessibility standards, are important. But video and transformation tools put Chambel et al.’s approach within reach in the absence of guest speakers and a large budget.</p>
         <p>Textbooks and other texts are a part of teaching accessibility, of course. Understandably, many introductory technical communication texts, which introduce novices to a broad range of skills, concepts, and genres in the field, have room for only a brief treatment of accessibility, but many books on Web design and development discuss accessibility in more detail and provide guidelines for developers. These guidelines include the Section 508 standards, the legal requirements. They also often include the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 1.0 and WCAG 2.0) set by the WAI of the World Wide Web Consortium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1050651912458924">W3C, 1999</xref>, 2008b). For instance, HTML books tell designers to provide alternative descriptions of images through alt attributes (sometimes referred to as alt tags). Students reading such texts will begin to develop a sense of the standards (and I have seen student achievement of this learning goal demonstrated not only in coding assignments but in reflective and analytical ones). Also, instructors can require students to write code that adheres to relevant standards such as Section 508 or WCAG 2.0.</p>
         <p>Meeting the standards is just a start. Standards alone can foster technical accessibility. But broader accessibility “include[s] adaptive technologies, accessibility standards, the information to be made accessible, and the Web services that deliver that information.” Therefore, accessibility is a “moving target” because some of these elements change before standards can adapt, leaving developers to anticipate changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27a-1050651912458924">Spinuzzi, 2007</xref>, p. 198). A developer who considers a site accessible because it complies with Section 508 misses a valuable point: The site may not be usable by visually impaired users (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1050651912458924">Leporini &amp; Paternò, 2008</xref>). The same is true for electronic documents. In other words, a site or document may meet the letter of the law or guideline, but it may still provide a user with a disability an experience that is ineffective, unnecessarily inefficient, or unsatisfying. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1050651912458924">Petrie and Kheir’s (2007)</xref> empirical study shows, the research-based prioritizing of problems that the W3C used to create WCAG 2.0 does not necessarily reflect the priorities of users with visual impairments, so checkers that look at compliance alone are only part of a solution. This problem illustrates a “contradiction between accessibility as compliance and accessibility as user experience” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27a-1050651912458924">Spinuzzi, 2007</xref>, p. 198).</p>
         <p>How then are beginning or even experienced nondisabled developers to know whether a site is accessible to all users without having access to users with disabilities for testing? Developers have many valuable tools at their disposal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1050651912458924">W3C WAI, 2008a</xref>), and a screen-reader emulator such as FANGS should be at the top of their list. The FANGS emulator allows students to move beyond the abstract concept of accessibility to a textual emulation of what a screen-reader user would experience. In other words, with this emulator, students experience more than notes about coding problems: They see the words a screen reader would read aloud, as well as a headings list and a links list. Much to novice developers’ surprise, these words include many distractions (e.g., <italic>List of two items List end bullet This page link Prizes and Awards,</italic> of which a sighted user sees only the last three words). If students create graphic buttons for primary navigation without any textual descriptions, in the FANGS output, they see a links list with no main navigation. Used in conjunction with video and with other accessibility tools, FANGS can both enhance developers’ appreciation of other users’ experiences and help them identify problems that some checkers cannot find.</p>

         <title>Approach to Teaching a Unit on Accessibility</title>
         <p>The unit on accessibility that I discuss here can be taught to students in a beginning Web-development course—even if the students begin with a limited understanding of audience or no understanding of code—or it can be shortened and taught within a variety of classes. I applied it in four graduate Web-development sections (in 2010 and 2012) and an undergraduate Web-development course (in 2010), and I applied an excerpt of the unit in three introductory, sophomore-level courses in professional communication (in 2010, 2011, and 2012). The graduate Web-development courses included students in a Master of Technical and Professional Communication (MTPC) program, students working on other advanced degrees in English (e.g., an MA focusing on creative writing, a PhD focusing on literature), and students working on masters of education degrees in language arts. The undergraduate Web course had students whose focus of study was largely literature. With a few exceptions, most of the students entering these courses had no prior experience with HTML or with Web or print accessibility. The MTPC students came into the class with an appreciation of audience for technical and Web documents; the other graduate and undergraduate students entered the class having less explicit instruction in audience awareness. The education students largely had experience creating a site with the WYSIWYG (what-you-see-is-what-you-get) interface of Expression<sup>®</sup> Web, Microsoft’s successor to FrontPage<sup>®</sup>, but had no experience with code. A few MTPC students had basic coding experience and knew how to structure an HTML page. But as a whole, this unit addressed students new to accessibility and, for the most part, Web development.</p>
         <p>Components of this unit included video to raise awareness; the FANGS screen reader to transform pages into emulations of screen-reader outputs; other tools to demonstrate a range of tools; limited readings to introduce readers to laws, guidelines, and issues in accessibility, as well as to experiences of users with visual impairments; and application to students’ work. Then I adapted these components for three sections of an introductory professional and technical communication course designed for English majors enrolled in a professional writing and literacy studies track.</p>
         <p>Introducing students to the exigency of accessible design early in the course sets students up for an access-first (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1050651912458924">Slatin, 2001</xref>) mind-set. As students build their appreciation of user experience, develop coding skills, and attempt more technically challenging designs, such as accordions to hide content under headings, they need to determine the best approaches for implementing those designs. Thus, the visual-accessibility unit introduces these concepts in five stages, which students will likely revisit as they work:</p>

            <title>Building Appreciation of User Experience</title>
            <p>Nondisabled students may have trouble fully appreciating the accessibility issues that users with disabilities experience. If an instructor does not have access to a guest speaker who can bring a laptop with a screen reader, or if the class does not include a student who uses a screen reader and would voluntarily provide a demonstration, the next best option is video. Two particular videos can be helpful: one that introduces the range of accessibility issues and the impact of poor design and one that further and more dramatically illustrates the impact of poor design on users with visual impairments with a guided tour of a screen reader in use. Although both videos are available for QuickTime and Windows Media players, and the second video is also available for Real Media players, students might skip watching these videos if they are assigned as out-of-class viewing—students might not take the time to download a correct plug-in, or they might not have a fast Internet connection or the solitary study time appropriate for playing a video—so it is important to show these videos in class.</p>
            <p>The first video is WebAIM’s video <italic>Web Accessibility Issues: Experiences of Students with Disabilities</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1050651912458924">WebAIM, 2004</xref>). This video is less than 2-minutes long and introduces viewers to six students who need accessible sites. Of these six students in the video, four have visual impairments, one has a motor impairment, and one has an auditory impairment (deafness). The students talk in broad terms about using the Web for both pleasure and schoolwork and the difficulties they face. They mention how poorly designed Web sites are slower for them to use, leave room for misinterpretation (for Derek, the user who is deaf), or can be completely inaccessible without outside help. Jordan, the student who has a motor impairment, emphasizes the “feeling of pride” he has when he can do something himself.</p>
            <p>The second video, <italic>Introduction to the Screen Reader</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1050651912458924">Anderson &amp; Ewers, 2001</xref>) is about 6-minutes long. This video is more powerful because Neal Ewers, a user who is blind, guides viewers through his experience using a screen reader with a speech synthesizer. He demonstrates how the screen reader works on a Microsoft Word<sup>®</sup> document and a Web page, elegantly illustrating how</p>
            <list list-type="bullet">
               <list-item>
                  <p>poor document organization can cause problems (e.g., placing the instructions for filling out a form below the form so the user must read the entire form first before getting context and guidance)</p>
               </list-item>
               <list-item>
                  <p>screen readers present materials word by word—Ewers uses Gregg C. Vanderheiden’s metaphor of reading through a soda straw, and the video illustrates the metaphor by blackening all of the text except a circle (the light through the end of the straw) that moves from word to word on the page as the synthesizer reads the text</p>
               </list-item>
               <list-item>
                  <p>a screen reader initially presents a Web document to a user (e.g., “Page has 40 links. Trace Research and Development Center. Graphic: Trace Center. College of Engineering, University of Wisconsin-Madison”)</p>
               </list-item>
               <list-item>
                  <p>graphics are represented by alt attributes (e.g., “Molly, a rescued golden retriever”)</p>

               <list-item>
                  <p>links lists are used by screen-reader users</p>

               <list-item>
                  <p>a screen reader (if the page is designed for one) can make the user more independent</p>
               </list-item>
            </list>
            <p>Thus, Anderson and Ewers’s video illustrates the need for good practice not only in coding but in design as a whole.</p>
            <p>This stage is designed to be anticipatory: an early activity to engage students in the topic and evaluate their understanding of the issues. In my classes, I begin to assess how students understand accessibility by asking them these questions:</p>
            <list list-type="bullet">
               <list-item>
                  <p>What elements of Ewers’s experience did you find most surprising?</p>

               <list-item>
                  <p>What elements of his experience had you not previously considered for users with visual impairments?</p>

               </list-item>
            </list>
            <p>You may choose to lengthen this stage. After students view the video, you could ask them to analyze (in a discussion or in writing) the user’s experience or their own actions, guiding them with questions such as these:</p>
            <list list-type="bullet">
               <list-item>
                  <p>Revisit the last brief Web search you did. How long do you think it would take if you relied on assistive technology?</p>

               <list-item>
                  <p>What would you miss doing most on the Web if you became blind and found most of the sites you currently use inaccessible?</p>
               </list-item>
               <list-item>
                  <p>Think about the last document you wrote with headings—whether it was a paper for a class or a résumé for a summer job. Did it have any accessibility problems? What were they? Why were they problems?</p>
               </list-item>
            </list>
            <p>Students’ discussion in these classes indicated their engagement, appreciation of ability, and reflection on design. They expressed great surprise at the speed with which Ewers reads, a speed at which most students could not understand the spoken text. While this observation has less direct bearing on accessible design than others, it indicates student engagement. The viewing experience also gave students an appreciation that users should be noted for their abilities, not just seen in light of their disabilities: Ewers is indeed differently abled. Furthermore, such observations open the door for discussing the fact that in-class simulations of visually impaired users (e.g., putting a blindfold on a classmate) are inadequate and inappropriate: Urquhart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1050651912458924">Gilbert &amp; Urquhart, 2011</xref>), a user who is blind and who works as a university liaison for students with disabilities, explained that visually impaired users have experience accessing text, have been trained to use assistive technology, and will probably find such exercises offensive. Students also reflected on design, noting how unusable a form would be without first knowing the context for filling out the form.</p>

            <title>Introducing Best Practices for Coding</title>
            <p>Many Web-development texts address how to code accessible pages, at least to some extent. But, for a unit on accessibility, students do well by reading <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1050651912458924">WebAIM’s (n.d</xref>.) <italic>Introduction to Web Accessibility</italic>, for an overview, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1050651912458924">Theofanos and Redish’s (2003b)</xref> 
               <italic>Guidelines for Accessible and Usable Web Sites: Observing Users Who Work With Screen Readers</italic>, both of which you can assign students to read for the class following the video introduction to the unit. WebAIM’s article covers types of relevant disabilities, users’ needs, applicable laws, and principles of accessible design. The explanations on the introduction page are understandable, brief overviews that link to detailed explanations. Readers who follow the links can learn how to post a PDF that is accessible or how to create a link, hidden to sighted users, that reads “Skip navigation.” The how-to pages presume that readers know how to work with HTML but may not know accessible design and coding conventions.</p>
            <p>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1050651912458924">Theofanos and Redish’s (2003b)</xref> easy-to-read description of their study of 16 screen-reader users complements the WebAIM introduction. The researchers presented their findings as 32 guidelines for accessible design. Although Theofanos and Redish presented this work in an <italic>Interactions</italic> article, this online version contains more detail, such as a figure illustrating why a developer should “not put a form far down on the page or far to the right.” The examples and the research-study context of this piece make it a good follow-up to the videos.</p>
            <p>This stage prepares students to understand the screen-reader demonstrations that follow and for their upcoming work on their own sites. If students know they will be completing a reading response in class, they may read more carefully. After reading these materials, students were able to successfully discuss the need to engage in best practices that go beyond regulations, such as using meaningful labels for links rather than all-purpose labels such as <italic>more</italic> or <italic>click here</italic>.</p>

            <p>At this point, students have seen two short videos and, with their appetites whetted, read a couple of easy-to-digest articles on accessibility. Although <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1050651912458924">Theofanos and Redish’s (2003b)</xref> figures nicely illustrate problems, students should see problems in sites that are familiar to them. These sites can be for local eateries, cultural events, student organizations—anything that interests students. This activity allows students to</p>

               <list-item>
                  <p>see that one tool alone is not adequate: for instance, a page that appears to have no accessibility problems when checked using WAVE’s main tool—its errors, features, and alerts checker—may have main navigation that does not appear on a links list to screen-reader users.</p>
               </list-item>
            </list>
            <p>To demonstrate these page-checking tools, choose a set of three or more sites, then show the class the output of both WAVE (with icons overlaying the existing page) and FANGS (with text, a headings list, and a links list). For an efficient demonstration, you can create a page with links to these sites and to WAVE, or you can create a series of screen captures of the WAVE and FANGS outputs. At least one site in this set should be mostly accessible, so students can see what type of output indicates an accessible site, and at least one site should have problems that are visible in WAVE. If possible, at least one site should appear to be accessible in WAVE but have a headings or links problem that is visible in FANGS. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1050651912458924">Figure 2</xref> displays a fictitious example of a home page for the fabricated sorority Alpha Alpha Alpha, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1050651912458924">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1050651912458924">4</xref>, respectively, contain the page’s WAVE and FANGS outputs (all created as mock-ups in order to protect the identities of Greek organizations with inaccessible Web sites). Alpha Alpha Alpha is an example of a site that seems unproblematic to sighted users and appears to have no problems when checked with WAVE’s main tool but that has problems that are clearly exposed by FANGS.</p>

            <p>The sorority home page reflects problems that are common with inaccessible JavaScript-driven and Flash-based sites, and a number of Web sites for Greek organizations have these problems. As organizations that collect substantial dues, they often hire Web-design companies to create attractive sites, many including photo slide shows. The Alpha Alpha Alpha site in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1050651912458924">Figure 2</xref> is designed to appeal to sighted users. The initial page of WAVE output (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1050651912458924">Figure 3</xref>) tells the designer that “WAVE has detected no accessibility errors,” and novice designers might not notice or recognize the importance of the somewhat smaller text below the main message—the text stating that they must check the page further to make sure it is accessible. They might not realize that the page’s content should be displayed in the WAVE output (i.e., that the images and other Web-page content should be visible with an overlay of icons) or that in a WAVE-checked page that displays content, some of the content may be inaccessible. Even if they do not ignore the yellow alerts to possible problems, they might think that the only parts of the page that have problems are those with icons; but if they have used WAVE without disabling the styles, some of the icons might be hidden.</p>
            <p>By introducing a mostly accessible page first, the instructor acclimates students to what they should hope to see when they check the pages they create; doing so gives students a frame of reference for the rest of the demonstration. Next, the problematic page for which both WAVE and FANGS display problems acclimates students to what they should find if their Web pages have problems. The WAVE icons—all in red for accessibility errors—are obvious indicators of problems and are coupled with text indicating the number of errors (e.g., “Uh oh! WAVE has detected 7 accessibility errors”). You or a student can read part of FANGS’s screen-reader output aloud to simulate a screen reader. Perhaps you will read the output for images without alt attributes (e.g., “Graphic. Graphic. Graphic.”). Students should also see the headings list and the links list, at least one of which indicates a problem. Finally, students should see a JavaScript-driven or Flash-based site without accessibility features similar to the Alpha Alpha Alpha home page example. Such a site will often pass WAVE’s accessibility check because WAVE cannot see an image within a Flash or JavaScript portion of a page to recognize that it is inaccessible, but it will generate empty headings and links lists in FANGS (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1050651912458924">Figure 4</xref>).</p>
            <p>I follow this stage with a discussion of these familiar sites. I cannot capture here the surprised looks that students have during these demonstrations, but one student’s response made the class laugh. In this class, I had used the home pages of service-oriented social organizations to demonstrate these tools. I brought up the image of a home page, asked who was a member, and saw her hand go up. I demonstrated that her organization’s site was not accessible at all. She was noticeably embarrassed, so I reassured her that hers was not the only organization with this problem. “Yeah,” she answered, “but our service project is reading to the blind.”</p>
            <p>After this demonstration, students have asked to check other sites using both tools—sites they personally use—indicating that they are now curious about the accessibility of materials they use and keen to apply this part of the lesson.</p>

         <sec id="section8-1050651912458924">
            <title>Demonstrating Other Tools</title>
            <p>Many other accessibility-evaluation tools are available, and students should learn about them because some complement the tools discussed here and also because Web development is a profession with rapid changes that novices need to keep abreast of, such as the many new resources or the existing resources that have become outdated or turned into services for a fee (e.g., the accessibility checker Bobby). Some tools, such as WAVE, are available to use online (without installing anything on your computer); some, such as Mozilla’s Web Developer toolbar, are add-ons; and some are available within software. Students should learn about several additional options, too: validation services that check both HTML and CSS, visual checkers (transformation tools that simulate color blindness), and even Web-development tools that allow developers to mimic other browser configurations. Select the particular tools that best suit your class’s needs and learning outcomes, then demonstrate a few key features before having students apply them to their own work.</p>
            <p>The W3C Markup and CSS Validation Services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1050651912458924">World Wide Web Consortium,  n.d.a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1050651912458924">n.d.b</xref>), which are online and free, let developers check the code on the page and in the related CSS to make sure it is valid (well formed). Developers can access the same services through Dreamweaver’s<sup>®</sup> interface. Validators are great tools. Although some pages may display correctly with errors, valid coding is usually important for a browser to interpret a page correctly. Validation services also check for accessibility; however, students who use validators must be aware that an error that the validator marks on line 38, for example, may really be an error above on line 32. In addition, one error can make the validator interpret the code that follows the error as wrong, and the results may display an erroneously high number of errors (e.g., 42 errors when the code only has two mistakes). But most important for teaching accessibility, the validators only check code. They will find and mark problems with images that are missing alt attributes, but they will not find other problematic practices, such as using HTML elements instead of heading tags to embolden and enlarge headings. In such cases, the headings will look like headings to sighted readers, but without the semantic HTML code to mark them as headings, they will not show up in a screen readers’ headings list.</p>
            <p>Visual checkers and other Web-development tools are available, too. Visual checkers such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1050651912458924">Vischeck (n.d</xref>.) allow developers to check an image or Web page to see if its elements are distinguishable to users with different types of color blindness. And if students are wrestling with a color scheme, Color Scheme Designer 3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1050651912458924">Stanicek, 2010</xref>) will let them check a scheme before they apply it to a site. Other development tools, such as the Mozilla Web Developer Toolbar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1050651912458924">Pederick, 2011</xref>), allow developers to selectively and easily mimic other browser conditions. Using this add-on can temporarily disable features such as JavaScript, images, styles, and colors and display accessibility features, such as tab indexes and alt attributes. They can even examine code just for its compliance with accessibility standards and without making you wade through the bulk of other types of error messages generated by validators.</p>

         <sec id="section9-1050651912458924">
            <title>Applying Tools to Student Work</title>
            <p>The next step in teaching accessibility is guiding students to use the tools. Because students are learning code, they can invest a lot of time in creating a site, constantly making coding changes to fix both large and small display problems. Sometimes validating code and checking a site for accessibility seem like low priorities to students. Two steps will ensure that most students make time for these important activities:</p>
            <list list-type="order">
               <list-item>
                  <p>Have students apply selected tools in class so that they can later do so independently. For most tools, they can view the display. For FANGS output, they might even read a selection of the simulated screen-reader output aloud to a peer.</p>
               </list-item>
               <list-item>
                  <p>Require a printout or screenshot of the tool outputs for at least the home page: the WAVE-checked page with icons, the W3C Markup Validation Service results, and the FANGS screen-reader output, headings list, and links list.</p>
               </list-item>
            </list>
            <p>Students do well beginning with the most visual tools: visual checkers and WAVE. These tools generate visual displays that will even let rank beginners know they have problems. Next, students should apply a screen-reader emulator (e.g., FANGS) to identify additional problems, including coding that will disrupt the flow of information for screen-reader users. Students can then work with WAVE or Web Developer to turn off styles, checking the flow of information on the page and other features. Finally, advanced students can use a number of other features in Web Developer, such as the form tools, to check for other problems.</p>
            <p>Students should be able to review one another’s work for accessibility features and problems, produce largely accessible sites, and write about both the importance of and techniques for making pages accessible. The sites my students produced consistently had basic accessibility features such as alt attributes, semantic tags for structure, links that could be understood out of context, and good contrast; even with limited main navigation links, many of these sites had off-page links that allowed screen-reader users to skip to the main content.</p>
         </sec>
         <sec id="section10-1050651912458924">
            <title>Adapting the Unit for Other Classes</title>
            <p>For classes that are an introduction to the discipline, or for other classes that need a taste of accessibility but not an intense, long lesson, this unit can be pared down. The essentials for students in these classes are the videos, especially <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1050651912458924">Anderson and Ewers’s (2001)</xref> video, and a demonstration of familiar sites using WAVE and FANGS. In a written assignment that incorporates accessibility, as I have used in my introductory classes, students should be capable of comparing the headings and links that they see on a page to those in the headings and links lists that FANGS displays. They should also be able to identify whether the links make sense out of context (isolated in the links list).</p>
         </sec>

      <sec id="section11-1050651912458924">
         <title>Conclusion</title>
         <p>I advocate not a particular set of evaluation tools but an approach for the long run. This approach includes using</p>
         <list list-type="bullet">
            <list-item>
               <p>a guest lecture or video to introduce new developers (or others involved in production) to at least one real user with a visual impairment. Have that user demonstrate a screen reader, both its features and limitations.</p>
            </list-item>
            <list-item>
               <p>several tools, including a screen-reader emulator, to demonstrate issues with familiar sites. Teach novice developers to use multiple tools because different evaluation tools work in a variety of ways. And as tools change, these developers must be able to adapt.</p>
            </list-item>
         </list>
         <p>Many other accessibility tools identify problems in Web pages. Some may now, or in the future, also emulate screen readers. I have not taken an exhaustive look at the options currently available. The W3C WAI (2008) lists 127 accessibility evaluation tools that were available even 4 years ago—most directly applicable to Web development, a few applicable to other electronic documents such as PDFs—although more tools are probably available now.</p>
         <p>Technical communication programs, and other training programs, have little reason not to give students a solid introduction to accessibility. We need to make accessibility problems real to students, give these problems exigency. Where speakers are unavailable, video is handy. Although the details of accessibility take time to master, visual displays such as WAVE are instant indicators of where something is wrong. And where budget, time (i.e., to master screen readers), and administration (i.e., lab restrictions) are issues—in other words, all over—WAVE and FANGS are valuable because they are free, easy to use, and easy for students to access, either online (WAVE) or by adding to a lab computer’s Firefox configurations (FANGS).</p>
