<abstract>
<p>At a time when disillusionment with mainstream institutions and a focus on black power appeared dominant in the struggle for racial equality in the United States, the interracial Scholarship, Education and Defense Fund for Racial Equality (SEDFRE) carried the ideals of the early civil rights movement into the late 1960s and early 1970s, garnering support from liberal foundations and individual donors for projects that fostered political and economic empowerment among black southerners. This analysis of SEDFRE's work demonstrates the continued role of national organizations and white supporters in the freedom struggle and provides further evidence that there was no clear distinction between the civil rights and black power eras.</p>

<p>The final chapters of books on the civil rights movement in the United States often make for disheartening reading. Media coverage and early histories depicted the late 1960s as a time when the movement fell apart in the face of declining white support and divisions among black activists themselves over the direction of the freedom struggle. The shift away from interracialism and nonviolence within the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) and the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) alienated many white Americans, who became less willing to contribute time or money to civil rights groups. Tensions within the movement grew as participants debated whether ending racism was possible without radically altering the social order. Taking down segregation signs was a simpler task than solving more deeply rooted problems like unemployment and poverty. Federal policy makers’ failure to adequately address economic inequality convinced some activists that white liberals were incapable of acting meaningfully to end discrimination and that the only real solutions were black separatism or violent revolution. After SNCC leader Stokely Carmichael called on African Americans to demand ‘black power’ in 1966, it appeared to many observers that the movement entered a new phase in which the idealistic hopes of earlier years had no place. According to Charles Payne, the rise of authoritarian leaders seeking to mold followers into a disciplined, revolutionary vanguard undermined the inclusive ‘organizing tradition’ of the earlier freedom movement, which had focused on developing indigenous grassroots leadership in black communities.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0022009413481826">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>More recent scholarship challenges important parts of this narrative. Several studies published in the past decade extend the historiography of the movement into the 1980s and 1990s, depicting ongoing struggles by black Americans to obtain political representation and a fairer distribution of economic resources. White people’s resistance to civil rights enforcement necessitated continued activism in all the areas where African Americans had fought against racism before 1965, including voting rights, education, and employment. Moreover, in the decade following the passage of civil rights legislation, the federal government’s war on poverty offered avenues for black empowerment and became a new site of struggle between proponents and opponents of racial equality. Scholars have also blurred the distinction that previous accounts drew between the civil rights and black power eras by showing how elements of black power thought and practice infused African American protest traditions long before the 1960s. Newer histories of the black power movement provide more nuanced interpretations than earlier studies that emphasized its destructive impact, noting activists’ achievements in unifying and mobilizing communities and their engagement in electoral politics, grassroots organizing, antipoverty work, and cultural production. The burgeoning literature on the post-civil rights era dramatically revises older assumptions regarding the demise of the movement. Rather than fading away in the late 1960s, the legal rights won through the civil rights movement generated new opportunities to push against the barriers of inequality, strengthening multiple freedom movements that persisted throughout the nation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0022009413481826">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>The image of the late twentieth-century freedom struggle that emerges from much of this scholarship is that it was localized, black-led, and virtually devoid of white participation or support. National organizations fade into the background, the liberal foundations that funded voter registration and other civil rights work in the 1960s disappear, and African American activists take control over their own liberation in keeping with the tenets of black power. While not seeking to completely overturn these interpretations, this article examines a previously neglected element of the story. Despite the disillusionment with mainstream approaches that seemed dominant after the mid-1960s, many activists believed the nation’s institutions could be made to work for African Americans and that traditional political processes and interracial cooperation were viable methods of achieving social change. The Scholarship, Education and Defense Fund for Racial Equality (SEDFRE) offered a means for people who remained committed to these principles to continue their involvement in the freedom struggle. An interracial, national organization that drew backing from prominent white liberals, SEDFRE, worked to empower black communities by training local people in how to effectively navigate the political system to pursue their own ends. These efforts were imbued by the organizing tradition and desire to build independent grassroots leadership that had previously characterized CORE and SNCC. The organization’s work with rural black southerners secured significant benefits for residents whose needs had long been neglected by racist white officials, and the competence displayed by SEDFRE-trained office holders helped to overcome white anxieties over black political participation. SEDFRE provides a case study of how some activists creatively adapted to the context of the late 1960s, carrying the ideals of the early civil rights movement into the black power era and gaining considerable white support without compromising their goals of black self-determination and social justice.</p>
<p>SEDFRE had its origins in 1962 when CORE created the Scholarship, Education and Defense Fund (CORE-SEDF) as a tax-exempt affiliate to carry out its educational and legal defense efforts. The main functions of the new organization were researching and publicizing ways to eliminate racism, providing financial assistance to students whose education had been interrupted because of their civil rights work, encouraging black political participation, and helping to pay the legal expenses of activists arrested during civil disobedience campaigns.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0022009413481826">3</xref></sup> Initially acting in a support role to CORE, SEDF staff moved to assert their independence when CORE came under the influence of leaders whose political philosophies differed significantly from their own.</p>
<p>Tensions began to build in 1965 as some CORE members questioned the role of white people in the movement and asserted that African Americans must lead their own struggle for equality. After Floyd McKissick replaced James Farmer as national director early in 1966, CORE leaders moved to restrict white activists’ participation and endorsed the black power philosophy articulated by their counterparts in SNCC. At the same time, the effectiveness of armed self-defense in combating violence against civil rights workers in the South convinced many activists that CORE’s earlier emphasis on nonviolence was misguided. Field workers and national officers indicated a willingness to work with armed groups like the Deacons for Defense and Justice in Louisiana, arguing that they could not prevent local people from carrying guns and that self-defense was a constitutional right. At its annual convention in 1966, CORE officially broke with its pacifist past by dropping the use of nonviolent methods as a requirement for chapter affiliation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0022009413481826">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>A number of staff members who were uneasy with CORE’s change of direction made their way into CORE-SEDF. Marvin Rich, a white activist who had headed CORE’s St. Louis chapter and was hired by the national office as community relations director in 1959, resigned his position early in 1965 to become executive director of SEDF. Ronnie Moore, Spiver Gordon, Carl Rachlin, James McCain and Shirley Lacy were among the other CORE veterans who made the move to CORE-SEDF between 1965 and 1966.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0022009413481826">5</xref></sup> The group’s board of directors comprised a mix of African American and white philanthropists, intellectuals, ministers, and labor organizers. Among them were Howard University vice president William Stuart Nelson, socialist leader Norman Thomas, <italic>Current</italic> editor Andrew Norman and attorney William Vanden Heuvel.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0022009413481826">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>The board and staff of CORE-SEDF watched developments within CORE with growing alarm. In March 1966 Norman Thomas suggested forming a subcommittee to re-examine the organization’s relationship with CORE, arguing that CORE’s shift ‘away from support of true integration … and toward a much diluted version of black nationalism’ was cause for concern.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0022009413481826">7</xref></sup> A few weeks later the staff of CORE-SEDF met and voted to change the organization’s name to the Scholarship, Education and Defense Fund for Racial Equality. An official statement from the board of directors noted that the name change more accurately reflected the group’s purposes, and they promised continued support for CORE programs that were compatible with SEDFRE’s mission.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0022009413481826">8</xref></sup> However, the move was largely motivated by a desire to disassociate from CORE. As Marvin Rich explained later, ideological differences prompted CORE-SEDF to change its name to SEDFRE ‘to express our complete independence’ from CORE.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0022009413481826">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rich and other staff members knew that attracting funding for their activities depended on distancing themselves from organizations that embraced black power ideology. Sharing his past experiences in fundraising, Rich advised the chairman of one CORE chapter to forget about approaching the New World Foundation for money. ‘The New World Foundation does not like CORE and will not support anything with CORE in the name’, he wrote. ‘I have spent a considerable amount of time talking to the Board members and staff people there with little success.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0022009413481826">10</xref></sup> Individual donors were also reluctant to support projects if they seemed linked to militant civil rights groups. Charles Cooper, for example, responded negatively to a request for support of SEDFRE’s programs because of its connections to CORE. He stated:<disp-quote>
<p>In view of your close relations with CORE … and in view of the recent violence – which I attribute in large part to the failure of CORE and similar groups to build interracial bridges, I shall withhold my contributions for those organizations which are fully dedicated to stressing the hope our common future in America can be non-violent and non-racial.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0022009413481826">11</xref></sup></p></disp-quote>Rich responded to Cooper by emphasizing that CORE and SEDFRE were two separate organizations, assuring him that SEDFRE was interracial and committed to nonviolence.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0022009413481826">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>SEDFRE became an alternative to more radical groups for activists and donors who wanted to preserve the earlier ideals of CORE and SNCC while adapting their activities to the new challenges presented in the post-civil rights era. In August 1966 Ronnie Moore reflected that when he first joined CORE, he thought it was ‘the organization that was going to lead the under-privileged Americans out of poverty and injustice,’ but it no longer seemed able to fulfill that role. Moore thought the new leadership’s rejection of nonviolence was a death sentence for the organization. As a veteran of CORE’s voter registration drives in rural Louisiana, Moore knew that black activists needed to protect themselves and he understood the value of armed self-defense to the freedom struggle. Nonetheless, he stated, ‘I know when it was wise to pick up guns and when it was wise to be non-violent. A man who says shoot at all times even on picket lines is either an idiot or a damn fool.’ Moore compared Floyd McKissick’s leadership style to that of southern politicians who surrounded themselves with people who agreed with them and refused to hear voices of dissent. In his view, CORE no longer had the potential to bring meaningful changes to the lives of black Americans. ‘What we need today is not slogans,’ he wrote. ‘We need men and groups with dedicated purposes and with a willingness to accept the challenge of [hard] work aimed at developing indigenous local leadership.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0022009413481826">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>SEDFRE consciously positioned itself as a counterweight to black revolutionaries. A 1966 proposal for a Leadership Training Fund stated, ‘It is particularly important at this time when there is extensive confusion about the goals of the civil rights movement, to spell out [SEDFRE]’s positive and constructive program. The LTF should be able to appeal to many who have maintained their interest in racial equality but no longer have organizational ties and are seeking a new way to register their interest.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0022009413481826">14</xref></sup> Appeals for funding emphasized SEDFRE’s difference from other organizations and its potential to defuse the incendiary rhetoric of black power leaders. One prospectus assured supporters that SEDFRE’s training sessions for grassroots activists focused on ‘programs for action rather than questions of ideology.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0022009413481826">15</xref></sup> Marvin Rich asserted that most participants were interested in learning about practical avenues to power rather than theoretical ones. ‘Despite the highly publicized remarks of certain leaders renouncing integration as a goal and declaring the irrelevance of [the] traditional political process,’ Rich observed, ‘Negroes in communities all over the country are realistically committed to achievement of their goals within the context of American society. They are finding the skillful use of the full range of American political and social action techniques can be relevant and effective.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0022009413481826">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>Framing SEDFRE as a moderate alternative to black power was an effective means of gaining support from people who had become disenchanted with other organizations. As contributions to SNCC and CORE dried up in the late 1960s, SEDFRE’s finances experienced slow but continuous growth, increasing from less than $10,000 in the early 1960s to more than $500,000 by the end of the decade.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0022009413481826">17</xref></sup> The money came from liberal institutions such as the Ford Foundation and the Rockefeller Brothers Fund as well as individual contributions solicited through direct mailing campaigns.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0022009413481826">18</xref></sup> Donors frequently praised SEDFRE’s approach to civil rights activism, which contrasted favorably in their minds with the tactics of other groups. North Dakota lawyer Milton Higgins’ warm response to a fundraising letter stated, ‘The tendency of so many black people toward the attempt to force the extension of civil and economic rights by violence is doomed to failure from the beginning. … What has been so badly needed is the very kind of organization you are setting up and I certainly wish you every success.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0022009413481826">19</xref></sup> Gladys Pedler enclosed her contribution with a note saying, ‘The recent <italic>destructive</italic> tactics employed by some people have caused me to wonder if my small efforts have been in vain. What your organization is attempting impresses me as a constructive effort worthy of support.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0022009413481826">20</xref></sup> Similarly, program staff at the Rockefeller Brothers Fund cited SEDFRE’s success in ‘promoting more effective communication and warmer relationships between members of different racial groups’ as a justification for providing financial assistance.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0022009413481826">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>SEDFRE’s relationship with white liberals earned scorn from some analysts of the movement. In a 1967 article and chart depicting five degrees of activism from the most militant to the most moderate, black journalist William Worthy listed SEDFRE among the organizations he labeled ‘Peacemakers for the Establishment (They pour oil on troubled waters).’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0022009413481826">22</xref></sup> Yet SEDFRE did not aim to maintain the status quo. Its staff fully supported the goal of black self-determination articulated by Stokely Carmichael, H. Rap Brown, and other leaders who topped Worthy’s chart. They just thought this could be achieved by using and transforming American institutions into instruments of black empowerment rather than overthrowing them. As Ronnie Moore explained it, while black power leaders adopted slogans like ‘Burn, baby, burn,’ SEDFRE encouraged African Americans to ‘Learn, baby, learn.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0022009413481826">23</xref></sup> Staff members were movement veterans with a strong commitment to social justice, including many black southerners who had joined with civil rights workers from outside the region to organize their local communities in the early 1960s. Working with SEDFRE was a way for them to continue their participation in the freedom struggle after SNCC and CORE pulled their organizers out of the South.</p>
<p>Ronnie Moore’s background was typical of the people who were involved in SEDFRE. After being expelled from Southern University for his civil rights activities, Moore served as CORE’s field secretary in Louisiana from 1962 to 1965, directing projects aimed at increasing black political participation, desegregating public facilities, improving services to black neighborhoods, and ending discrimination in employment and housing. He was hired to direct CORE-SEDF’s leadership development program in 1965 and became SEDFRE’s executive director in 1969. Similarly, James McCain had held leadership positions in the South Carolina Council of Human Relations and CORE before joining SEDFRE in 1966 to work on citizenship education efforts. Spiver Gordon and Kenny Johnson were black Louisianans who began their civil rights careers by working with CORE in the rural parishes where they had grown up. Both went on to play major roles in SEDFRE’s technical assistance program for black elected officials.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0022009413481826">24</xref></sup> A Ford Foundation evaluation noted:<disp-quote>
<p>SEDFRE’s people are very consciously ‘movement people’ who have weathered the civil rights battles of the early 1960’s and remain committed to that era’s vision of an integrated community. Shaped and guided by these earlier experiences, SEDFRE’s staff has a strong sense of direction and purpose, combined with a pragmatic sense of tactics. … While Afro hair-dos and dashikis abound and black power handshakes are exchanged, the group remains committed to its vision of a democratic integrated community.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0022009413481826">25</xref></sup></p></disp-quote>SEDFRE represented a logical extension of these activists’ earlier work in the freedom movement, and they had not abandoned the goal of fundamental social change that first inspired their involvement.</p>
<p>SEDFRE staff aimed to empower the black people they worked with to free themselves. Earlier experiences had taught them the importance of encouraging local involvement in decision making. As Marvin Rich observed in a report on a training session for CORE workers in January 1965, nothing permanent could be achieved by outsiders coming into the rural South and setting up freedom schools or community centers. ‘The Mississippi Summer Program suffered from the fact that many people came down from the North for short periods of time with their own program and ideas and initiative and this inhibited the involvement of local people,’ he wrote. ‘As a result, there was little local feeling of identification and ownership and many of the centers and schools closed when the northerners left.’ On the workshop itself, Rich expressed appreciation for the contributions made by local activists: ‘The involvement of non-staff community leaders was quite useful. They brought some of the theoretical discussion by the more youthful staff members back to reality.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0022009413481826">26</xref></sup> SEDFRE’s role was not to lead but to support local groups in their efforts to solve community problems by giving people the information and skills they needed to participate in politics and bring about social change.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0022009413481826">27</xref></sup> ‘Local people must decide for themselves, must run their own affairs, and must take full responsibility for their destiny,’ Ronnie Moore asserted. ‘The days of local projects enrolling civil rights activists are over.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0022009413481826">28</xref></sup></p>
<p>Yet the staff also knew that decades of disfranchisement had left most black southerners ill-prepared to influence the political process effectively. Local people well understood the sources of problems in their communities but they often did not know what concrete actions they could take to address their concerns. They sorely needed information on the way the political system operated, the structure of government, and the availability of federal programs that could help them.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0022009413481826">29</xref></sup> After passage of the Voting Rights Act, the big question was whether black votes could effect change that would benefit black communities. A SEDFRE prospectus asked: ‘Will the wheelers and dealers outsmart and outmaneuver the newer leaders and deny them once again, maximum participation in our democratic society?’ The answer depended on how fast local leaders could be trained to use the law, politics, and government to achieve their goals.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0022009413481826">30</xref></sup></p>
<p>SEDFRE’s response to these concerns began in September 1965 when CORE-SEDF hired Ronnie Moore to coordinate leadership training efforts in the South.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0022009413481826">31</xref></sup> Moore started work in October and spent the first month reading field reports and speaking with CORE task force workers to identify common problems before designing a prospectus. By March 1966 four workshops had been held in Louisiana and Mississippi and two in Maryland. Moore reported that local activists responded enthusiastically to the programs and that he had received many requests for assistance from leaders in other communities. ‘The SEDF workshops drove home to me more clearly than ever before the need to train local groups to help themselves,’ he wrote. ‘The invaluable nature of our training endeavor cannot be over emphasized.  … Everyone requested additional training institutes for smaller geographic areas. Expansion is essential.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0022009413481826">32</xref></sup> In July 1966 more than 100 activists from eight states attended a week-long regional training conference in Frogmore, South Carolina, to learn about the political system, how to run an election campaign, and the functions of various government offices. In response to participants’ requests for follow-up workshops at the state and county levels, SEDFRE held state conferences in Florida, South Carolina and Louisiana from October to December 1966 and began planning for county sessions to teach people how to gain political power at the local level.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0022009413481826">33</xref></sup></p>
<p>The workshops revealed the daunting scope of the problems that rural black southerners faced and the obstacles to their effective political participation. Among the issues that attendees cited as their top concerns were poverty, unemployment, segregated and deteriorating schools, substandard housing, job discrimination, reprisals for civil rights activity, police brutality and the absence of public services such as sewage systems or garbage removal in black neighborhoods. White administrators controlled the welfare system, federal agricultural programs and local antipoverty agencies, making it difficult for poor black people in many communities to gain access to economic assistance. Political disagreements and class conflict among local people themselves were also problems, often exacerbated by white leaders who rewarded ‘good Negroes’ with money and power in return for help in keeping the rest of the black population in line.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0022009413481826">34</xref></sup></p>
<p>An essential first step toward solving these problems was to elect responsive political leaders to replace racist officials who had no interest in addressing the needs of African Americans. SEDFRE workshops offered training in the mechanics of running for office and winning elections. Sessions for black political candidates taught participants how to produce campaign leaflets, canvass communities, organize precincts, get voters to the polls on election day, and monitor elections to ensure a fair vote count. But activists also knew that pressure from ordinary citizens was necessary to make the political system work. For this reason, SEDFRE aimed to arm cadres of ‘citizen-leaders’ with the information and skills they needed to take on specific concerns. Welfare rights workshops and manuals informed recipients of the laws that governed public assistance programs and enabled them to better negotiate the bureaucratic intricacies of a system that often denied aid to people who desperately needed it. Other training sessions considered problems with federal antipoverty programs and explored ways for poor black people to increase their influence in local community action agencies.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0022009413481826">35</xref></sup> A fundraising pamphlet distributed in the late 1960s described SEDFRE as a technical assistance and training arm of ‘the movement for civil rights and the elimination of poverty, as well as for the growing efforts to broaden community participation among the poor.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0022009413481826">36</xref></sup></p>
<p>A key strength of SEDFRE’s leadership development program was its ability to respond to the specific needs of the people it aimed to help. Requests from local people initiated the first stage in organizing a training session. SEDFRE staff then visited the community to gain a sense of the main problems identified by residents and the topics they were most interested in learning about. This enabled staff to develop a workshop agenda aimed at addressing those issues. Time was also built into the sessions for attendees to raise additional concerns or alter the focus of the workshop if they chose.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-0022009413481826">37</xref></sup> Local participants represented a cross-section of the black community and were often people with little formal education. According to a SEDFRE fact sheet, they included ‘farmers, lawyers, workers, welfare recipients, students, ministers, housewives, and elected officials.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-0022009413481826">38</xref></sup> The diverse clientele reflected the staff’s belief in a core tenet of the organizing tradition: that all people, regardless of social class, had something to contribute. Experience had taught them that many people who were not highly educated and had never held leadership positions before could develop the confidence and skills needed to become strong grassroots activists capable of making a difference in their communities.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-0022009413481826">39</xref></sup></p>
<p>Participants’ evaluations expressed their appreciation for SEDFRE. J.W. Augustus of Baton Rouge wrote that the workshop he attended helped him to plan his political campaign and avoid the mistakes made by other candidates. He hoped there would be more workshops, which would ‘make a better America for all of the peoples.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-0022009413481826">40</xref></sup> N.H. Smith concurred, saying, ‘The meeting was good and a schooling for us all. We will go to our states &amp; parishes with a message to improve our parish.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-0022009413481826">41</xref></sup> Participants in a leadership development program conducted in November and December 1967 said they had learned many valuable new skills, including how to speak out, organize their communities, solve problems, negotiate with white leaders, and get help from government agencies. Several people also stated that the workshop had inspired them to become more active in their communities and renewed their commitment to the freedom struggle.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-0022009413481826">42</xref></sup></p>
<p>SEDFRE’s growing reputation led to increasing requests for its services from community groups throughout the nation. ‘Each day we are faced with additional demands,’ Ronnie Moore reported in May 1966. ‘Community leaders are requesting workshops on political campaigning, farming, urban problems, etc.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-0022009413481826">43</xref></sup> The program filled a real need, and the movement background of its staff, their focus on empowering grassroots leaders, and their willingness to listen to local people’s suggestions and adapt their activities accordingly all enhanced its popularity.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-0022009413481826">44</xref></sup> As Marvin Rich observed, the organization’s success was evident in:<disp-quote>
<p>the response of the groups who have received our training – their obvious attention during the course of the workshops, their requests for additional workshops and for follow up staff consultations and assistance – and by the word-of-mouth reputation that has led to rapid growth in the number of requests for additional SEDFRE training programs.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-0022009413481826">45</xref></sup></p></disp-quote>Requests for workshops consistently exceeded SEDFRE’s ability to meet them. Staff did their best to expand the leadership development program as much as possible, often running over the organization’s limited budget.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-0022009413481826">46</xref></sup> In 1967 SEDFRE trained 2300 people in workshops held in 120 communities.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-0022009413481826">47</xref></sup> In keeping with the goal of fostering local independence from outside organizations, SEDFRE also developed a ‘training trainers’ series designed for experienced local activists who wanted to learn how to train others in their communities.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn48-0022009413481826">48</xref></sup> A list of workshops scheduled for February and March 1968 reflected the geographical and topical scope of the leadership development program: citizenship education for several parishes in Louisiana; problem analysis and strategy planning in Birmingham, Alabama; a police-community relations laboratory in Los Angeles; training for the board of directors of an antipoverty agency in Hartford, Connecticut; staff training for the Southern Cooperative Development Program in Lafayette, Louisiana; and an intergroup relations seminar for black, Jewish, and Puerto Rican residents of Pawling, New York.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn49-0022009413481826">49</xref></sup> Programs for the 1969–70 financial year reached more than 7500 people from 190 communities in 26 states.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn50-0022009413481826">50</xref></sup></p>
<p>In many communities the leadership development program achieved its goal of increasing both the extent and effectiveness of black political participation. In September 1966 James McCain reported that after a SEDFRE workshop was held in Clarendon County, South Carolina, white leaders had shown more willingness to cooperate with black residents in setting up a community action agency, integrating Head Start, and starting a school lunch program. ‘All this has come about since Negroes have registered to vote in great numbers in this county and the running of Negroes for public office,’ McCain stated. ‘This is an indication of what can happen in a community where Negroes and whites are willing to work and plan together for the common good of all.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn51-0022009413481826">51</xref></sup></p>
<p>Similar successes occurred as a result of SEDFRE’s work with local groups in Louisiana. In response to concerns that many newly registered black voters did not know how to use voting machines, Ronnie Moore persuaded state officials to provide 15 practice machines to local voters’ leagues in West Feliciana and East Feliciana Parishes. Nearly 1500 people learned how to use the machines before the 1966 elections.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn52-0022009413481826">52</xref></sup> Local people’s increasing confidence and ability to do things for themselves was apparent in the planning for a voter registration and education campaign across four parishes in June 1967. Instead of relying on a SEDFRE staff member to direct the drive, the coordinators decided they could hire someone from their own organization to do the job.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn53-0022009413481826">53</xref></sup> In November black candidates supported by the West Feliciana Voters League contested 29 out of 48 positions that were up for election in the parish.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn54-0022009413481826">54</xref></sup> SEDFRE assistance also helped African Americans in the town of Iberville to increase their influence in local government. By 1967 Iberville had a black councilman, school board member and antipoverty director and black candidates contested every available office in the November election. Spiver Gordon reported that town leaders were finally paying attention to the need for better sewage systems, roads, and lighting in black neighborhoods and that local companies had begun to hire more black workers.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn55-0022009413481826">55</xref></sup></p>
<p>Between 1965 and 1969 SEDFRE trained thousands of people in hundreds of communities across the nation in political activism, helping them to meet local needs ranging from voting rights and better schools to street lights and job opportunities. More than 60 people who took part in the leadership development program went on to win political office. Many other participants worked to improve their communities through other means, such as serving on antipoverty agency boards, pressuring government authorities to improve welfare services, or engaging in civil rights activities.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn56-0022009413481826">56</xref></sup></p>
<p>The increase in the number of black office holders and the mobilization of local constituents created a new task for SEDFRE: training newly elected school board members, sheriffs, town council members, county commissioners, district representatives and other officials in how to carry out their duties. In December 1968 SEDFRE created a technical assistance program to provide guidance and support to black office holders. SEDFRE offered one-on-one training using experienced officials from outside the community to help newcomers with tasks such as budgeting, research, record keeping, and public relations. It also held national meetings for people holding specific positions, such as a 1969 conference for black school board members. Regional workshops aimed to build cooperative networks among office holders so they could share expertise, contacts, and resources. In addition, SEDFRE held state seminars that brought elected officials into contact with grassroots activists to discuss the concerns of constituents.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn57-0022009413481826">57</xref></sup> The technical assistance program evolved naturally out of SEDFRE’s approach to the freedom struggle and its willingness to adapt its activities to the needs expressed by local people. As Marvin Rich explained, ‘We helped to get some of these people elected simply by showing them methods of campaigning. Now they want help in functioning more effectively in their new responsibilities.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn58-0022009413481826">58</xref></sup></p>
<p>SEDFRE provided training to hundreds of black office holders. The combination of local officials eager to improve conditions for black people and a national organization with contacts in the government, philanthropic, and business worlds had the potential to bring significant change to southern communities. Typically, white political leaders in the South had been wary of outside assistance, often failing to take advantage of federal funds or programs aimed at alleviating poverty. SEDFRE informed black officials of the resources that were available for projects such as upgrading housing, building water and sewage systems, and repairing schools, and taught them how to prepare successful grant proposals to get the money they needed. In 1970 Georgia legislator and former SNCC activist Julian Bond testified to the value of the technical assistance program to black elected officials. Bond remembered his first few months in office as ‘a period of bewilderment, despair and searching.’ Young, inexperienced, and facing hostility from white colleagues who tried to prevent him from being seated in the legislature, he found the information and other support he needed through SEDFRE. ‘Each year I find new reasons to be proud of my association with this deeply committed interracial group, providing needed services to the movement for civil rights and economic justice,’ he stated. ‘Learning to plan a budget or secure a Federal grant may not seem dramatic or glamorous. But the hard ABC’s of government are the next item on Freedom’s agenda.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn59-0022009413481826">59</xref></sup></p>
<p>Greene County, Alabama, typified many of the problems that rural southern office holders faced and provided a model setting for SEDFRE to test solutions aimed at securing funding to improve social services while working to create self-sustaining economies.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn60-0022009413481826">60</xref></sup> In the 1960s the county was the poorest in the state and the fifth poorest in the nation, with a per capita income of $1217. More than half of all families and 72 percent of black families earned incomes below poverty level. Much of the housing stock in the county was substandard, with 82 percent of families living in homes that lacked adequate plumbing.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn61-0022009413481826">61</xref></sup> Black plantation workers were rapidly being displaced as landowners moved to diversify production and mechanize as many functions as possible. White officials had done little to try to attract new industries, and public assistance programs were inadequate to cope with the large numbers of unemployed people. Many residents left the area to seek jobs in nearby cities or in the urban North. The county’s population declined from 13,600 to 10,650 between 1960 and 1970, with an out-migration rate among black residents of 27 percent.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn62-0022009413481826">62</xref></sup> Some African Americans suspected that political leaders were deliberately trying to force them to leave to lessen the threat to white dominance posed by newly enfranchised black voters.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn63-0022009413481826">63</xref></sup></p>
<p>Local activists began running black candidates for office in 1966 and succeeded that year in electing Peter Kirksey to the school board. In 1968 African Americans challenged white incumbents in every available position, but the probate judge responsible for certifying candidates left black campaigners’ names off the ballot. A federal court declared the election illegal and ordered a new vote to be held the following year. In July 1969 four black county commissioners and two more black school board members were elected.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn64-0022009413481826">64</xref></sup></p>
<p>Probate judge J. Dennis Herndon presided over the new black officials on the county commission. Having failed to prevent their election this time around, Herndon worked to obstruct their efforts to improve conditions for African Americans. When the black commissioners wanted to equalize the wages paid to white and black county employees, Herndon convinced them to work toward this by giving pay increases in equal percentages to both groups, thus preserving the wage differential. He told black leaders that several other measures they wanted to implement violated state laws. Later the commissioners found out that this information was inaccurate. Black school board members had similar problems with the white people they worked with. In both cases, African Americans’ unfamiliarity with important laws and administrative policies placed them at a disadvantage in relations with their white counterparts, who refused to share their own expertise with the newly elected officials.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn65-0022009413481826">65</xref></sup></p>
<p>The commissioners asked SEDFRE to provide the training they needed to overcome these obstacles. After holding a workshop for the black officials in December 1969, SEDFRE assigned Spiver Gordon to stay in the county and provide long-term assistance. In November 1970 Greene County voters elected black leader William McKinley Branch to replace Herndon as probate judge. Gordon worked with the all-black county government to address the desperate economic conditions the county faced and attract employment-generating businesses.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn66-0022009413481826">66</xref></sup> As always, Gordon based his approach on conversations with local people about what they wanted to do, and he encouraged them to express their own ideas for action rather than relying on him to take the lead. By the end of 1970 Gordon had helped residents to set up an Industrial Board, a Housing Authority, and a Recreation Board to serve as vehicles for community development.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn67-0022009413481826">67</xref></sup></p>
<p>Over the next six months Greene County’s development agencies scored some significant achievements. Funding obtained through federal antipoverty initiatives enabled the county to implement medical and food programs for poor people, two Neighborhood Youth Corp programs, an early childhood development program and a summer program for high school students. The Department of Housing and Urban Development provided a $20,000 loan to assist the Greene County Housing Authority with surveys and other preparation for building 150 new housing units. The county successfully applied for two foundation grants to pay for a junior deputies program and voter education efforts. Officials also worked to recruit new industries and expand existing businesses in the county. A Levis Jeans manufacturing plant opened in July 1971, and SEDFRE staff helped a local entrepreneur to obtain a $40,000 loan from the Small Business Administration (SBA) to build and operate an automatic car wash.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn68-0022009413481826">68</xref></sup></p>
<p>Efforts to develop private industry were a central part of SEDFRE’s strategy. Federally funded social services provided much-needed assistance to the county’s poor residents, created some new jobs and helped to build the infrastructure required for economic development. But local people and SEDFRE staff knew that continued federal support was uncertain, particularly after conservatives began to increase their influence over government policy and cut back on antipoverty programs.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn69-0022009413481826">69</xref></sup> In September 1970 county officials created an Economic Development Commission (EDC) to study ways to develop the region’s natural resources and recruit new industry for the area.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn70-0022009413481826">70</xref></sup> By 1973 the EDC had secured a major grant from the Economic Development Administration as well as several SBA loans for local businesses; established a public radio station and a one-year college in the county; created a college counseling program for young people; published a visitor’s guide and a county business directory; and encouraged expansion of the Levis Jeans plant and several other enterprises. Per capita income had increased 106 percent since 1960 and the county was growing at a faster rate than Alabama or the United States as a whole.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn71-0022009413481826">71</xref></sup> A SEDFRE newsletter claimed that Greene County was becoming a ‘national prototype’ for reversing poverty and economic decline in rural southern communities.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn72-0022009413481826">72</xref></sup></p>
<p>Success did not come without some difficulties, however. Relations between the EDC and county commissioners deteriorated amid arguments over how best to make use of grant funds. Personal antagonism developed between Spiver Gordon and William Branch, whose approach to governing earned an accusation of ‘bossism’ from Gordon. For his part, Branch believed SEDFRE did not really have the interests of local people at heart and instead wanted to use the county to get foundation grants for itself. Despite these problems, a consulting firm hired by the Rockefeller Brothers Fund to assess the effectiveness of economic development efforts in Greene County concluded that the EDC’s and SEDFRE’s contributions to improving conditions for local residents were significant. Comparing the county to five other black-controlled counties in the rural South, they found that Greene County had the highest per capita percentage increase in the amount of federal funding secured between 1970 and 1973. Social programs enhanced the quality of life for poor people and many projects that SEDFRE instigated had permanent benefits. The consultants doubted whether the county could have obtained all the federal and foundation grants it did without help from SEDFRE and the EDC. The two agencies secured outside sources of funding by publicizing the county’s needs and facilitating contact between black officials and potential donors. In addition, they provided the training necessary for local people to eventually take over research, grant writing, and other development functions themselves.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn73-0022009413481826">73</xref></sup></p>
<p>SEDFRE’s impact could also be seen in improved relations between white and black people in Greene County. The new government’s achievements melted some of the hostility from white residents that the black officials initially encountered. Local newspapers’ early reports reflected white editors’ skepticism regarding black people’s ability to govern effectively and derided the increased spending on social programs. A story in the monthly magazine <italic>Ala-West</italic> in August 1970 noted that the county commissioners controlled an annual budget of $1.2 million and that ‘comments by concerned citizens show that many Greene Countians – mostly whites, but also some blacks – are worried about the free-handed way these monies are being administered.’ Two years later the <italic>Greene County Democrat</italic> printed a more positive assessment under the headline ‘Greene County’s Negro Officials Have Things Humming.’ Among the accomplishments cited in the article were the acquisition of more than $1 million in federal funds to improve education, the location of new businesses in the county, and more professional law enforcement. According to the report, the feelings of many white people were summed up by <italic>Democrat</italic> editor Richard Martin, who opposed the black candidates when they first ran for office but now conceded, ‘We have some pretty good county officials.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn74-0022009413481826">74</xref></sup></p>
<p>SEDFRE worked with black governments in several other rural southern communities including Pritchard and Uniontown in Alabama; Tallulah, Louisiana; and Fayette, Mississippi. In each case the results were similar to developments in Greene County, with SEDFRE acting in a support role to help analyze problems, improve infrastructure, and encourage economic development. A report to the Rockefeller Brothers Fund emphasized that SEDFRE did not itself carry out these tasks but trained black elected officials to do things for themselves. ‘SEDFRE not only helps raise funds for the government, but also teaches fund-raising skills,’ it stated. ‘In places where SEDFRE has been involved for some time, the SEDFRE trainees are now being called upon to act as trainers in other localities.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn75-0022009413481826">75</xref></sup> This approach was squarely within the organizing tradition of the freedom movement and helped instill confidence in local people. According to Julian Bond, ‘SEDFRE’s quiet, behind-the-headlines work … created a dynamic cadre of better-trained, more competent city, county and state officials than most rural and small town areas ever before had, black or white.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn76-0022009413481826">76</xref></sup></p>
<p>The wisdom of SEDFRE’s efforts to foster local independence was borne out in the mid-1970s as economic recession and a more conservative political climate made it harder to obtain funding for the technical assistance program. The declining stock market meant decreased returns on investments for SEDFRE’s foundation supporters, with corresponding cuts in funding for the group. Individual contributions also shrank as inflation ate into people’s incomes.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn77-0022009413481826">77</xref></sup> Despite scaling back its legal defense and scholarship programs and postponing work with many black elected officials who had requested assistance, SEDFRE ended the 1972 financial year with a $144,000 deficit.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn78-0022009413481826">78</xref></sup> Further retrenchment enabled the organization to reduce its debt significantly in 1973, but raising money to support even the pared down version of SEDFRE remained a constant struggle.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn79-0022009413481826">79</xref></sup></p>
<p>SEDFRE was further weakened when the United States Attorney’s office in Newark, New Jersey, began investigating Ronnie Moore for allegedly misappropriating money meant for antipoverty work and spending it on personal luxuries. In October 1977 a grand jury returned a 43-count indictment against Moore for using federal funds to buy diamond rings, invest in real estate, and travel to Europe and the Caribbean. Moore at first denied the charges and sought help from supporters in the civil rights community for his legal defense. A letter signed by James Farmer and Newark mayor Kenneth Gibson referred to Moore as ‘an outstanding leader of the Civil Rights movement in the sixties’ who had overseen the administration of millions of dollars during his work with CORE and SEDFRE. In this context, they suggested, the $55,000 in ‘questionable costs’ listed in the grand jury indictment was insignificant. ‘All that Ronnie is asking is to have his day in court,’ the letter stated.<disp-quote>
<p>He has resisted the usual bargaining to settle the matter without a public trial … We urge you to lend him some visible support, whatever you can give so that Ronnie can clear his name and return to the struggle for justice in this country.</p></disp-quote>However, Moore eventually pleaded guilty and served a year in federal prison for his crime. SEDFRE never recovered from the scandal. Foundation and other support evaporated, and although there was no official liquidation of the organization, its board and staff informally disbanded in the late 1970s.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn80-0022009413481826">80</xref></sup></p>
<p>The ignoble circumstances of SEDFRE’s demise should not detract from its achievements. In the decade following the passage of civil rights legislation, SEDFRE was at the forefront of efforts to carry the freedom struggle into a new phase focused on ensuring political empowerment and economic justice for African Americans. Although these objectives were not so different from those of more radical contemporaries in SNCC and CORE, SEDFRE skillfully positioned itself as a safe, non-threatening alternative to those organizations to garner support for its leadership development programs from liberal foundations and individual donors. Despite accusations that they were tools of the white establishment, these activists maintained a commitment to black self-determination and allowed local people to direct activities rather than imposing a pre-chosen agenda. By working to help black voters and elected officials to translate their newly won rights into engines of social change, SEDFRE made significant contributions to rural southern communities. Both white and black residents benefited from improved public services, the development of new businesses and industry, and more competent government in the counties where SEDFRE staff trained political candidates and office holders. SEDFRE’s commitment to the interracial, inclusive organizing tradition of the early civil rights movement demonstrates the coexistence of these ideals alongside more militant calls for black power in the decade after 1965. In addition to showing the continuing role that national organizations and white supporters played in the freedom movement, this story provides more evidence that there was no clear line dividing the civil rights and black power eras. Instead, activists blended various strategies in the struggle for equality before and after the 1960s.</p>
