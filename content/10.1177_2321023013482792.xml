<p>First published in 2010, the <italic>Oxford Companion to Politics in India</italic> (OCPI) was brought out a year later in a student edition with a special preface. The Companion, organized in eight parts and spread around thirty-eight chapters, is a unique collection that not only brings out the richness and diversity of politics in the country but is also in many ways testimony to the robustness of scholarship on politics in India and a valuable exercise in taking stock of that study.</p>
<p>The OCPI, unlike other Oxford companions, actually falls somewhere between a handbook and a companion. Most Oxford companions usually have short dictionary like entries covering an encyclopaedic range of topics; handbooks in contrast are characterized by essay length surveys of research on a particular area. The OCPI attempts to mix both these genres giving us the value of both in one place. The rich but crisp essays cover a variety of issues around both the form and substance of politics in India. All essays essentially have three objectives, first, to raise and introduce theoretical and analytical questions; second, to provide some sense of the literature on that particular theme and third, to also present the author’s perspective on the theme.</p>
<p>The introduction by editors Niraja Gopal Jayal and Pratap Bhanu Mehta magnificently sets up the rich fare that follows. While keeping its observations on each contribution short, the introduction seamlessly and almost effortlessly weaves the different themes that receive focus in the companion into an essay on democracy in India. To guide both the non-specialist reader as well as the graduate user, the editors point to two explanatory frameworks that inform most essays, without necessarily endorsing either: one which prioritises structure and the other which prioritizes agency. The takeaway point is that our thinking about politics in India greatly depends on the logic of the explanatory mechanism used.</p>
<p>The tyranny of the word limit of this review does not allow me to examine each essay or even mention them all. I will therefore only present a snapshot. While each chapter could serve as an introduction, most contributions have been fairly successful in capturing the transformation that has taken place in contemporary India in the subject under discussion. The book opens with the section on institutions that provide the framework for organizing political interaction in India. The next section highlights the ebb and flow of major social cleavages in Indian politics. The subsequent section examines a wide range of political processes, including the working of political parties, local politics, political leadership and mobilization as well as the interaction between culture and politics.</p>
<p>The subject matter of the section on ideological contestations is not only the stuff of academic debate but is probably at the heart of politics in India. It highlights the complex multidimensional ideological space of politics in India and shows that the issues that have animated politics in India have also been in continual transformation.</p>
<p>The next theme, on social movements and civil society, looks at social movements in general, and explores women’s and farmers’ movements in detail, as well as non-governmental organizations. The section on politics and policy focuses on multiple issues including the political economy of the state and of economic reforms, the relationship between business and politics as well as poverty reduction and redistribution policies. The penultimate section is devoted to India’s external relations and defence policy. The concluding section not only informs us about various data sources for research but also presents a historical account of the twists and turns both in terms of the method and subject matter in the development of political science in India.</p>
<p>A reading of the OCPI confirms that the agenda of social scientists is shaped by the problems and issues of the society they are studying. A comparable corpus of scholarship would be that of the study of Latin America. The region was largely under authoritarian regimes, and the absence of democratic structures until very recently, put limits to what could be studied and what could not. As there was limited scope to focus on the internal, the scholars turned to examine the relationship between the domestic economies and the international economy. The underdevelopment and dependency scholarship came about largely as a result of the peculiarity of their situation.</p>
<p>In India, the significant questions did not revolve around the relationship with the external but on issues of nation building and social and economic change. The focus was on the ‘great creative force’ called politics, as Kothari put it in 1970, which has not only set the goals but has also provided the broad framework within which transformation has taken place. ‘Politicization’ and political change was therefore at the centre of scholarly attention. Just as the Latin American school struggled to make sense of their experiences, scholars of politics in India too quickly realized the inadequacy of existing explanations based on the experiences of other societies as well as contexts.</p>
<p>At the same time, the title ‘Politics in India’ reflects an attempt not to present an Indian notion of politics but to highlight the serious engagement with the discipline and then show how historical and structural factors influences the way politics plays itself out. The volume in a way shows that India has been an outlier not because of any exceptionalism or uniqueness but because comparative politics probably asked the wrong questions. The OCPI presents a number of instances—whether it is class, caste, nationalism, representation, party system or civil society—where the Indian experiences have gone against the scholarly grain.</p>
<p>Two insights from the scholarship, which readily come to the mind, have found wide resonance, include findings from the study of elections and the subaltern analytical framework. With politics in command, the study of elections and voting behaviour came very early to scholars examining politics in India, unlike in Latin America. From the modernization of tradition to the Bahujan upsurge thesis, there have been many, to use Arend Lijphart’s terminology, ‘theory-infirming’ insights that have not only helped understand the Indian experience but have also enriched the study of democracy and comparative politics in general. More recently these insights have been extended to understand similarly placed countries both in the region and outside.</p>
<p>The subaltern analytical framework is another contribution that has undoubtedly enriched the discipline. This school brought to the forefront the importance of context while questioning the dominant notions of modernity as well as the universalistic claims of ‘western’ theories. It has influenced thinking on a wide variety of key concepts including state, nationalism and civil society.</p>
<p>To quibble with the selection of topics covered is unwarranted; nevertheless there are two issues worth stating. The OCPI gives us an image that India has reached a stage of what Stefano Bartolini and Peter Mair call ‘conflict encapsulation’, as it deals only with the conventional politics, those which are constrained by the rules and procedures of the system. It leaves out the non-conventional or what may be considered ‘illegitimate’ modes of political action and behaviour as well as claims and demands which often question the fundamentals of the system itself. The form and substance of the politics of a wide variety of groups in particular parts of the country does not fit into the dominant pattern of politics. The editors do recognize the absence of a separate essay on violence; nevertheless it is a void that cannot be brushed away.</p>
<p>Another issue is that politics at the state level has not only received scant attention but also been inadequately conceptualized by the editors in their narrative. A large body of literature has argued that the last decade of the century gone by has been one in which states have come out of the shadow of national politics and in fact have started shaping them. A more nuanced understanding of Indian politics according to this school requires a closer focus on politics in states. The rise of state politics certainly merited consideration.</p>
<p>Not that this should take away any shine from the OCPI, which is undoubtedly an excellent resource that could appeal to multiple audiences. It can serve as a valuable instructional material for class room teaching at both the undergraduate and post graduate level. For those intending to pursue research, the OCPI would serve as good first cut into the mass of scholarship on politics in India. The bibliography at the end of each chapter, though not exhaustive, should provide adequate direction. There is also a useful index at the end of the book.</p>
<p>For those who bought the hardback copy, which is incidentally 7 times the cost of the Student edition, the preface attempts to put a finger on the continuous and rapid transformation of Indian politics. It not only outlines the contours of the major changes taking place under various themes but also raises many pointed questions intended to not only provoke but also throw light on future directions of research. Going by recent events—the role of the middle class and urban politics—it must be mentioned that the editors have been fairly successful in anticipating political change. The OCPI should definitely find space on the bookshelf of anyone who follows politics in India. Like any companion would, it will serve as a handy guide.</p>
