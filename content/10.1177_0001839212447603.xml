<p>It would be understandable, but mistaken, to assume that this volume written by and about the faculty and graduates of Stanford University consists of loosely related, nostalgic encomiums to their alma mater. It is, instead, a volume focused by strong editorial guidance to answer in an integrated way the question of how, and why, a single university was so influential in organizational theory. For three decades, Stanford University was a singularly productive scholarly community producing fundamental work in eight theoretical areas—resource dependency, institutional theory, ecology, learning theory, organizational culture, labor market theory, and healthcare research—across fields as diverse as sociology, political science, management, social psychology, law, industrial engineering, education, engineering, and healthcare. No other institution can match the scope and depth of its influence on organizational theory.</p>
<p>The editors explicitly ask the big question about Stanford’s community of organizational scholars, “How did it become so prominent in this field?” (p. xviii). The subject of each chapter was set by the editors to be part of a larger framework for answering this question. Consequently, the volume is an interdependent set of contributions that provide multiple answers at multiple levels.</p>
<p>There are three sections of eight chapters in the volume. Chapters in the first section are written by former graduate students directly involved in the development of each of the eight theories discussing how those theories developed in the Stanford environment. Chapters in the second are by members of the faculty at Stanford at that time who were researchers and participated in the broader organizational studies community. Chapters in the third are by former graduate students who reflect on their experiences as graduate students in that community. There are also excellent, informative introductory and concluding essays, providing an overview of the entire volume.</p>
<p>There are three audiences for whom this book is valuable. The first is anyone who is working in any of the eight theories addressed in its own separate chapter. Although the authors focus on happenings at their institution, it is usually significant enough to affect the field as a whole. And some of these chapters, such as Davis and Cobb’s chapter on resource dependence theory, go far beyond the boundaries of Stanford.</p>
<p>The second audience is current graduate students (or those who are developing graduate students), who should read the third section, in which scholars specifically and systematically analyze their experience of the Stanford community as a graduate student. These chapters are far more than war stories. They most often go beyond idiosyncratic events and interpersonal relations to attend to the structural and environmental influences that enabled and shaped the students’ development as scholars. It is rare that anyone reflects on his or her professional development in such a theoretically informed way. These chapters are a rare opportunity for graduate students to understand their experiences, and obstacles, as being connected to the larger structures in which they operate.</p>
<p>The third audience for this book is anyone interested in the future of the field of organizational theory, because one implication of the Stanford experience is that most institutions today could not replicate any part of Stanford’s success. A global conclusion of the contributors is that the cross-disciplinary nature of the community of graduate students and faculty at Stanford was necessary for its success. Yet few institutions today have the elements for building a cross-disciplinary community. One problem is the movement of organizational scholars into management schools. The number of organizational scholars in other departments at Stanford, especially in sociology, is much rarer today because of it. The evidence of this shift can be seen in the authors of the volume. Of the 35 contributors to this volume, 17 sit in business schools, and of the 10 former graduate students who wrote the chapters on each theory, seven of them are in business schools.</p>
<p>Another obstacle to founding a cross-disciplinary community is a lack of funds for cross-disciplinary research and graduate student training. Long-term grants supporting graduate training in organizations from the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) were the backbone of the organizational community at Stanford. There are few sources of funds today, however, with such a wide scope.</p>
<p>The final element most institutions lack for building a cross-disciplinary community is what James March puckishly calls “the fellow from Kansas,” a faculty member with prairie-state traits of humility (despite his or her own intellectual achievement), motivation to work for the community, and willingness to do the practical work to keep a community alive. As March points out, all the opportunity comes to naught if there are not specific people to pull it all together. In the case of Stanford, there was an actual fellow from Kansas who was the linchpin to the community: the remarkable W. Richard Scott. Although a university today cannot build or clone a Dick Scott, it would ideally have a position for an organizational scholar with the necessary traits and minimal barriers to taking on such a central role in a community. Instead, most organizational scholars today sit in professional schools of management that are structurally isolated from other departments in the university.</p>
<p>In conclusion, this volume intently asks “why” about a single case in the past, but it also provides answers to “why not” for the future. Though the historic conditions at Stanford University are not sufficient for building a strong community of organizational scholars, most are certainly necessary. The editors and authors of this volume have provided us with a checklist to understand the peculiar barriers, and possibilities, for building other communities for scholarship in the field of organizational theory.</p>
