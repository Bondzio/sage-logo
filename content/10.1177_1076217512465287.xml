<abstract>
<p>Oftentimes, when the subject of how to maximize Black students’ talent in gifted and advanced courses and programs is broached, they are treated as a monolithic entity. Too little scholarship explores gender differences among Black males and females. Yet, there is considerable evidence that unsuccessful attainment of academic excellence may be more troublesome for Black males than females at many points along the educational pipeline. School counselors, trained to understand the intended and unintended consequences of ignoring the importance of race and gender, are well equipped to assist in the efforts to increase the academic performance of gifted and talented Black males. The purpose of this article is to provide a brief introduction of the cumulative risks associated with being Black and male in educational settings as well as a discussion of how these risks are associated with mental health and academic performance. The article concludes with a discussion of implications for school counselors.</p>

<p>Too few school counselors have received formal training to work with and understand the experiences and needs of gifted students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1076217512465287">Peterson &amp; Morris, 2010</xref>); even fewer get training to counsel and guide gifted Black students. As a professional school counselor, I decided to take a different route to actively seek such training. I saw, and still see, so many gifted students, especially Black males, failing to maximize their potential. Serving as leaders and advocates, professional school counselors are in an ideal position to support gifted students. In addition to supporting students’ academic and career needs, they are also prepared to meet the personal and social needs of gifted students from all backgrounds. However, to be effective with Black males, in particular, specific information related to their particular and even unique issues and needs must be understood first.</p>
<p>Oftentimes, when the subject of maximizing Black students’ success in gifted and advanced courses and programs is broached, students are treated as a monolithic entity. Gender differences within this group are often not addressed. There is considerable evidence, however, that unsuccessful attainment of academic excellence may be more troublesome or challenging for Black males than females at many points along the educational pipeline (Bonner, Lewis, Bowman-Perrott, Hill-Jackson, &amp; James, 2009; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1076217512465287">Ford, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1076217512465287">Grantham, 2004b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1076217512465287">Toldson, 2008</xref>).</p>

<p>“Serving as leaders and advocates, professional school counselors are in an ideal position to support gifted students.”</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>When discussing Black males, a key issue is masculinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1076217512465287">Majors &amp; Billson, 1992</xref>). Unfortunately, when issues related to Black students, even those formally identified as gifted, are introduced in popular and scholarly literature, it typically focuses on race without taking Black males’ conceptions of masculinity into much consideration relative to race (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1076217512465287">Whiting, 2006</xref>). As a result, when constructing interventions to disrupt the negative academic trends of Black males, masculinity is sacrificed for a narrow focus on race; doing so fails to take into consideration the cumulative risks associated with being Black and male, as opposed to one or the other, and the issues the dual identities represent for them in academic settings. School counselors, trained to understand the intended and unintended consequences of ignoring the importance of race and gender, are well equipped to assist in the important goal of increasing (and maintaining) the academic performance of gifted and talented Black males.</p>

<sec id="section1-1076217512465287">
<title>Race, Gender, and Cumulative Risks</title>
<p>Popular and scholarly discourse is saturated with information describing Black males and academic achievement using a deficit lens (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1076217512465287">Ford, 2010</xref>). Indeed, it can easily be argued that the vast majority of information in the public sphere related to Black males is focused on their perceived inability to succeed in comparison with students belonging to other racial and ethnic groups. Although Black males are less likely to be identified as gifted than any other group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1076217512465287">Ford, 2010</xref>), there are, of course, Black males who have managed to be formally identified as for participation in gifted and advanced courses and programs. These students, however, are confronted with multiple stressors directly related to race and gender—the cumulative effects of which have negative implications for continued academic achievement and talent maximization.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1076217512465287">
<title>Black Male Adolescents and Mental Health</title>
<p>Although the mental health risks associated with being Black or being male are quite high, the amalgamation of the two social constructs can be distressing. Clearly, some environmental factors predispose Black males to negative mental and physical health outcomes. Black male adolescents living in urban areas, for example, have been found to experience disproportionately high levels of depression in comparison with adolescents from other racial/ethnic groups due to their exposure to high-risk settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1076217512465287">Lindsey, Joe, &amp; Nebbitt, 2010</xref>) and poor support from individuals (especially peers) in their social circles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1076217512465287">Hammack, Richards, Luo, Edlynn, &amp; Roy, 2004</xref>). It is also important to note that males account for 60% of all suicides among Black adolescents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1076217512465287">Joe, 2010</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section3-1076217512465287">
<title>Schools As High-Risk Environments</title>
<p>It could easily be argued that schools may, too, be considered high-risk environments for Black males, filled with many stressors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1076217512465287">Henfield, 2011</xref>). Much of this may be attributed to the current culture of accountability in which educators are expected to increase academic achievement for all students, regardless of race, socioeconomic status, and gender, as measured by scores on standardized tests. On the surface, this appears to be a significant social justice measure to close the achievement gap; however, there have been many instances suggesting that, in actuality, students may not be receiving the education they deserve due to increased pressures placed on teachers to use pedagogical practices designed to prepare students to achieve minimum competency on standardized tests. Such a strong emphasis on minimum competency, it has been asserted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1076217512465287">Loveless, Farkas, &amp; Duffett, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1076217512465287">Plucker, Burroughs, &amp; Song, 2010</xref>), has come at the expense of those students who have the potential to go far beyond minimal standards and achieve academic excellence.</p>
<p>Although closing the achievement gap between Black and White students as measured by meeting minimal standards has made steady progress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1076217512465287">Vanneman, Hamilton, Baldwin Anderson, &amp; Rahman, 2009</xref>), the gaps between Black and White students performing at the highest levels of achievement—otherwise known as excellence gaps—continue to grow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1076217512465287">Loveless et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1076217512465287">Plucker et al., 2010</xref>); nonetheless, in a study sponsored by the Thomas B. Fordham Institute, teachers were asked, “Who is most likely to get one-on-one attention from teachers?” In all, 81% of them named “struggling students,” and only 5% named “advanced students” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1076217512465287">Loveless et al., 2008</xref>). Clearly, the focus on minimal competency is not serving talented students well.</p>

<sec id="section4-1076217512465287">
<title>Mental Health and Academic Excellence</title>
<p>The achievement gap is virtually synonymous with the Black–White gap whereby White students’ performance is made the norm from which Black students are compared. Consistently falling short of the academic performance of White students may leave some Black students feeling inadequate at their failure to “measure up” to others’ academic standards. This phenomenon can be linked to episodes of stereotype threat, which has been found to have a negative impact on academic performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1076217512465287">Steele, 2010</xref>; Steele &amp; Aronson, 1995); it can also be associated with goal-striving stress, which must receive more coverage in K-12 and gifted educational literature.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1076217512465287">Sellers and Neighbors (2008)</xref> defined goal-striving stress as the tension associated with striving for goals that, for Black people, were historically unattainable but now are perceived as being within the realm of possibility. The degree to which efforts to reach socially derived aspirations match achievement of said aspirations determines which individuals experience goal-striving stress.</p>
<p>It makes sense that Black high-achieving students may experience goal-striving stress regardless of gender; however, research has shown that Black females are far more likely to seek out help in dealing with stress-related issues in comparison with Black males. From the time they are very young, males hailing from all types of cultural backgrounds are socialized to believe that seeking help is feminine and for the weak and they, as males, should rely on no one but themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1076217512465287">Courtenay, 2000</xref>). Such deeply embedded notions of masculinity or machismo oftentimes manifest as individuality, stoicism, and aggression among older Black (and Hispanic) males and are associated with their reluctance to utilize counseling services<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1076217512465287">1</xref></sup> and hide their giftedness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1076217512465287">Henfield, Moore, &amp; Wood, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>In what may be the most popular book exploring Black male masculine meaning-making, <italic>Cool Pose: The Dilemmas of Black Manhood in America</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1076217512465287">Majors and Billson (1992)</xref> submitted the widely cited term <italic>cool pose</italic> to describe how Black males cope with masculinity:
<disp-quote>
<p>By cool pose we mean the presentation of self many black males use to establish their male identity. Cool pose is a ritualized form of masculinity that entails behaviors, scripts, physical posturing, impression management, and carefully crafted performances that deliver a single, critical message: pride, strength, and control. (p. 4)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Recent conceptions of Black masculinity are thought of as more context dependent. Over time, literature related to the topic has evolved from the notion of masculinity based on White male norms to the understanding of it as a social construction that differs according to a number of factors such as race, ethnicity, social class, sexual orientations, and generation. Nonetheless, Black males who adopt traditional ideas of what it means to be “masculine” increase the risk that they will develop poor coping mechanisms that have a negative impact on their mental health and, consequently, their academic achievement. As described next, given the strong connection between stressful environments, perceived lack of support, and other debilitating conditions—even suicide—it is imperative that gender-specific measures be taken to specifically support Black males.</p>
<p>Professional school counselors are in a unique position in that they are, quite often, the only educators in school buildings who have been trained to render personal/social, academic, and career services to meet the needs of all students. Their position in schools makes them a valuable resource in comparison with other educators who have very different roles and responsibilities (e.g., teachers, administrators, school psychologists, reading specialists, etc.). As gifted Black males have been found to be reluctant to seek help from formal mental health service providers when confronted with problems and challenges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1076217512465287">Henfield et al., 2008</xref>), it stands to reason that this population of high achievers is deserving of targeted initiatives designed to meet their unique needs.</p>

<sec id="section5-1076217512465287">
<title>Recommendations</title>
<p>The Council for Accreditation of Counseling and Related Educational Programs (CACREP) assures that any student graduating from a CACREP-accredited master’s-level school counseling program has received a wide array of courses designed to ensure that he or she is capable of meeting the needs of all K-12 students on graduation. Although this is true, specific coursework geared toward teaching master’s students race- and gender-specific needs of gifted Black males is not addressed in CACREP standards (multicultural counseling coursework is required, but there are no explicit requirements for it to include topics germane to gifted Black males); as such, professional school counselors may graduate without ever receiving such information. It is, therefore, incumbent on them to advocate on their own behalf once employed and request that school administrators include information related to gifted Black males during professional development in their school.</p>
<p>Once trained, professional school counselor should then be able to implement the following interventions with a greater likelihood of success:</p>
<list id="list1-1076217512465287" list-type="order">
<list-item><p><italic>School–family–community (SFCs) partnerships.</italic> To successfully meet the needs of talented Black male students, it is important to develop strong SFC partnerships. This may entail attending events and frequenting places that are common among Black males and their families outside of school settings. Once professional school counselors demonstrate their commitment to meeting students’ needs by associating with them inside and outside school settings, the students will be more apt to trust them—a necessary ingredient for meeting the needs of Black male high achievers. This trusting relationship goes a long way toward helping Black males realize that asking for help is indeed masculine.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Mentoring programs</italic>. Professional school counselors should develop strong connections with Black male adults who have managed to overcome obstacles and meet their goals. This will provide students with the race- and gender-specific role models with whom they are most likely to identify with and rely on for support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1076217512465287">Grantham, 2004a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1076217512465287">Whiting, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1076217512465287">2009</xref>). In some neighborhoods, these individuals may be difficult to find. If that is the case, it will be important to rely on established community organizations (e.g., 100 Black Men, Big Brothers and Sisters, etc.) and neighborhood churches for assistance.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Individual counseling.</italic> If establishing SFCs and mentoring programs is achieved, professional school counselors should now have an important network of stakeholders able to assist Black males on a one-to-one basis. Within the context of individual counseling, Black males will be able to develop insight related to goal-striving stress and develop techniques to lessen its impact. They will have a safe place to share their personal concerns and needs.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Small group counseling.</italic> If there are several talented Black males who are underachieving or showing signs of failure, it may be prudent to meet with them in small group counseling sessions. Some of the topics to be addressed can be coping with goal-related stress, peer pressures, stereotypes and prejudice, as well as other issues more common among the general population of Black males.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Large group guidance.</italic> In addition to counseling Black male high achievers individually and in small groups, it is important that other students are aware of the problems associated with goal-striving stress. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1076217512465287">Sellers and Neighbors (2008)</xref>, Blacks suffer from this type of stress at a higher rate rather than Whites. Nonetheless, it is important that, like any other type of stress, all students are aware of the phenomenon and the potential ramifications if it is not addressed.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Advocacy.</italic> In addition to the above recommendations, it is just as important to institute changes to systems that allow barriers to persist. In the case of the excellence gap, more attention must be given to the phenomenon on a structural as well as an individual level—A two-pronged approach is needed. Administrators and other educators must be made aware that although students appear to be succeeding academically, a gap in achievement still exists among those in the upper echelon of achievement and must be addressed to maximize Black males’ gifts and talents.</p></list-item>

<title>Summary and Conclusion</title>
<p>It is no exaggeration to state that Black males are the lowest performing students in all academic settings (P-12 and college; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1076217512465287">Schott Foundation, 2010</xref>) and the most underrepresented group in gifted education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1076217512465287">Ford, 2010</xref>). Professional school counselors, working in concert with families and communities, are in a unique position to lend their considerable expertise—insights, training, and skills—to eradicating underachievement and underrepresentation. Moving away from a “one-size-fits-all” approach toward more individual and group-specific interventions (in this case based on race and gender) that demonstrate an understanding of the challenges and needs of Black males is a good place to begin.</p>

<p>In a conversation with Dr. Donna Y. Ford, she mentioned that during a recent visit to a private college, she spoke with Black males about what it takes to succeed in college. One Black male was failing because he did not want to ask for help. After this admission, at least a dozen others agreed and stated that doing so was a sign of weakness; they would rather fail than ask for assistance.</p>
