<p>At a time when the most disparate religious traditions are purposely tailored to serve and respond to politics, fashion and the needs and expectations of the global market, this book is a welcome contribution. The burgeoning interest in yoga has favoured the rise of new genres including hagiographies of yoga teachers, medical narratives, philosophical speculations, nationalist agendas, physical practice and erotica. Yoga has become a global business. Since White maintains a strong scholarly approach but does not distance himself from more commercial yogic developments, the book provides fresh insights into one of the most ancient Indic traditions and reflects on the role and reputation of yoga practitioners.</p>
<p>This study also makes us reflect on a number of previously neglected questions. For instance, why have some aspects of yoga been relegated to folklore? What is wrong with folklore? Why did the reflexive yoga of Patañjali and the devotional yoga (<italic>bhakti yoga</italic>) as celebrated in the <italic>Bhagavad Gītā</italic> become dominant? What determined the marginalisation and virtual obliteration of dissenting (antisocial) yogis? And how did yoga end up being a nationalist tool? <italic>Sinister Yogis</italic> explores these and other questions from different methodological angles. White borrows from Indology, the history of religion, art history, literary criticism, post-modernism and orientalist critique. He shows an impressive familiarity with primary literary sources in Sanskrit and vernacular (mostly Hindi) and also reports and reflects on close encounters with yoga practitioners during several years of fieldwork.</p>
<p>Presented as the third book of a trilogy (after <italic>Alchemical Bodies: Siddha Traditions in Medieval India</italic> and <italic>Kiss of the Yoginī: ‘Tantric Sex’ in its South Asian Contexts</italic>), <italic>Sinister Yogis</italic> is much more than the continuation of a suspended discourse. It is one of the most audacious and competent works on yoga of the last decades. At the core of White’s argument is the bold statement that yoga has been (and still is) misrepresented. Scholarly and lay literature alike has reported of meditative forms of yoga with a strong emphasis on physical exercise. Yogis are enlightened beings in peace with the universe. <italic>Sinister Yogis</italic> shows otherwise and mostly deals with the folklore of ‘yogism’. Moving from personal stories of acquaintance with Indian yogis (including a ‘fake’ yogi aiming at the money of the American traveller) White explores the history of a great mystification by constructing narrative chains, or conversing vignettes. From the effigies of the ‘proto-yogi’ of the Indus valley civilisation to modern and contemporary yogis, the book introduces the reader to a little known world populated by yoga practitioners who can possess, change form and manipulate reality, fight and act as warriors, resurrect corpses, move across time and space and trick gods and humans. In other words, it is the story of powerful beings, not reflective sages. These yogis, however, are not ‘sinister’, at least not etymologically speaking. They have very little to do with left-handed (<italic>vāmācāra</italic>) Tantrism, as one would assume. In fact, the characters that populate White’s narratives are transgressive. It is precisely such transgression, but also aggression, I dare say, that is at the core of most yogic traditions and orders of South Asia.</p>
<p>Detractors of White’s book will argue that interpretative scholarship does no good to the study of religion as it creates and perpetuates the stances and the agenda of those occupying a position of social prestige, or simply benefitting from economic power. If this is true, <italic>Sinister Yogis</italic> will be the object of fierce criticism. But this book is not just about personal interpretation. While White speaks from a position of authority, his book is sophisticated in scholarship, shows evidence of self-criticism and self-reflexivity, and is a much needed resource that fills existing gaps.</p>
<p>The book is divided into six chapters. Chapter 1 explores narratives of transgressive yogis, with stories taken from Vedic and Purāṇic literature, popular press and oral folklore. <italic>Śruti</italic> and <italic>smṛti</italic> tell us a different story from the one most of us are accustomed to, populated by powerful, frightening and mischievous yogis, as ‘there can be no doubt that the south Asian yogi does indeed stand as the Indic homologue of the villainous evil wizard of Western fairy tales, and that his behaviour often borders on the inhuman or the monstrous’ (p. 37). The yogi is precisely a monster, a word that in the original Latin (<italic>monstrum</italic>) indicates something marvellous and prodigious, but also a divine portent as, interestingly, it comes from the verb <italic>monere</italic>, to warn.</p>
<p>The second chapter explains that the yoga of the <italic>Bhagavad Gītā</italic> and <italic>Yoga Sūtras</italic>—among others—are the (later) product of an intelligentsia. By juxtaposing meditation to practice, such yogas embody the ‘priestly caste’ urges. South Asian literatures and imagery suggest that those who are seen meditating in their earthly hermitages are failed yogis. Accomplished yogis are those who have attained <italic>siddhi</italic> (supernatural power) and <italic>vibhūti</italic>, aptly translated ‘omni-presencing’ (p. 39) as a result of their heroic struggle. In that they are more similar to the yogic Kṛṣṇa who reveals his universal form (<italic>viśvarūpa</italic>), leaving other yogas to humans. Insider and outsider discourses callously ignored ‘accounts of yoga in which the term yoga itself or some other derivate of the verb *yuk, “to joke”, was employed, and of which there were many, in the ancient Hindu scriptures in particular’ (p. 42). This finds further confirmation in the work of Orientalists, theosophists and Hindu reformists, whose writings all bear witness to the primacy of <italic>rāja</italic> yoga as an intellectual, meditative practice. Conversely, White emphasises the militant (and military) attitudes of yogis and links yogic orders with warrior ethos. In that, the book disengages from visions of yoga as a practice for Brahmanic initiates who are bound by birth to social constraints, purity rules and the prestige exerted by their caste.</p>
<p>The third chapter explores how yogic practices and warrior ethics overlap in early <italic>Upaniṣad</italic>s, Purāṇic literature, Śaiva scriptures and Tantra. Hagiographies of saints, soteriologies or stories about yogic teachers and practitioners reflect a taste for the miraculous, with particular emphasis on the relation between meditation and the power to ascent. Such form of ‘embodied displacement’ is core to understanding the heroic struggle of the yogi who eventually is able to dominate the elements. This is particularly well-defended in White’s concluding discourse on <italic>utkrānti</italic> (‘upward advance’, elsewhere known as ‘yogic suicide’) and its strong association with the ‘self-willed battlefield death of the chariot warrior’ (p. 120).</p>
<p>Chapter four continues to explore the relation between the deeds of the yogi and the life of the <italic>kṣatriya</italic>. One of the most common practices of yogic folklore is entering (and controlling) other bodies. This, especially in Tantric literature, is ‘styled as a military assault’ (p. 121). Evidence to support this is also drawn from earlier sources, i.e. the <italic>Upaniṣad</italic>s, the epics and <italic>Āyurvedic</italic> texts. Along with a robust use of textual resources, White convinces in his exploration of ‘entering another body’ as core to several yogic practices. Such ‘projective model of perception’ (p. 125), as White explains, is shared by <italic>Mīmāmsaka, Sāṁkhya, Vedānta</italic> and, particularly, <italic>Nyāya-Vaiśeṣika</italic> whose philosophers and exegetes were in fact conversant of practices built on the permeability of mind and body, or their intrinsic lack of borders. Eventually, the irradiation of the yogi’s power leads to omniscience.</p>
<p>The fifth chapter on ‘Yogi Gods’ provocatively argues that—passing through epic and <italic>Purāṇic</italic> folklore—Śaiva and Śākta Tantras are at the origin of ‘the progressive marginalisation of yoga and its practitioners in favour of gnosis and ritual, that is, the mastery and manipulation of mantras’ (p. 196). While the large majority of Tantrikās were in fact Brahmans, ‘yogis, freelance (and often low-caste) seekers of supernatural enjoyments and power in the world, were marginalised because their existence threatened the power of the sanctioned tantric orders, lineages, and so on’ (p. 196). Fascinating as this may sound, such theory needs careful consideration. The current demographic of yogic orders and scriptural sources seem to validate White’s position. However, we lack a counter argument. Studies on folklore, social marginalisation and subalternity have proved that when dealing with the history of the subaltern, we mostly have to rely on secondary sources. Further, the cultural production of the subaltern is naturally inclined to manipulation, both from the inside and the outside. It is therefore not unrealistic that scenic stories of yogis might have been the response of the basis to the power exerted upon by the superstructure, as often folkloric products are. Accordingly, the association of yogis with gods can be read in two ways. On the one hand, it proves the ambiguity of yogis as radical religious practitioners, and the social fear they inspired. On the other, as White notes in his introduction (p. xiii), yogis are not only ‘sinister’ and the stories of their deeds are often pedagogical narratives.</p>
<p>The final chapter, ‘Mughal, Modern and Postmodern Yogis’ discusses the encountering between yogis and outsiders, i.e. Muslims and Asian travellers, but most of all, European colonisers. In colonial literature, the yogi is criminalised for his anti-social behaviour. He is portrayed as enchanter, spy, quack doctor, exorcist but also a terrible fighter and a dangerous (also sexual) predator. The marginalisation of yogis at the hand of Brahmanical elites and foreign rulers (Muslims and British) contributes to the consolidation of the yogi as a wild, untamed, individual whose physical features and behaviour become the trademark of the cultural and territorial ambiguity that most visitors observed and reported about India. But the yogi is also the object of exoticism and romanticism. Yogis and yogic culture become the ideal terrain for countless (Orientalist) speculations, hedonistic practices and nationalist agendas (see Vivekananda and Gandhi’s use of yoga as a unifying philosophy).</p>
<p>Apart from one oversight (Viṣṇu is deemed the creator and Brahmā the maintainer of the universe, p. 189), <italic>Sinister Yogis</italic> is an extremely accurate book. Detailed in its critical apparatus and rich in bibliographical resources, it is enjoyable for both specialist and lay readerships, despite some assumed knowledge. By presenting a critical analysis of yogic folklore, White provides material for further discussions and sets the ground for methodological innovation. <italic>Sinister Yogis</italic> contributes to the representation of an enduring fascination and mystery. It certainly is a work that fills a consistent gap in the study of yoga, and one that future scholars and researchers could not ignore.</p>
