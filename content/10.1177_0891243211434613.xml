<abstract>
<p>In this article, I use in-depth interviews with Black college students at two predominantly white universities to investigate the coconstruction of race, gender, and sexuality, and to examine intersectional identities as a dynamic process rather than bounded identity. I focus on Black college men’s talk about interracial relationships. Existing research documents Black women’s angry reactions to interracial relationships, but for Black men, interracial relationships present both problems and opportunities. I examine how Black men use two distinct forms of interracial talk— “player” talk and “intimacy” talk—to negotiate racialized gendered stereotypes of Black men’s heterosexuality. By moving between forms of talk, Black men negotiate the identity tensions they face as Black upwardly mobile men. Player talk and intimacy talk both respond to and use racialized stereotypes, reworking the relationship between gender, race, and sexuality. In this case, disrupted racial boundaries uphold gender inequalities between men and women.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>By treating sexuality as performative rather than innate, scholars have untangled the ways men use sexuality to create and challenge masculine identities (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0891243211434613">Grazian 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0891243211434613">Pascoe 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0891243211434613">Wilkins 2009</xref>). Many young men achieve masculinity through the relentless performance of heterosexual success and dominance over women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0891243211434613">Pascoe 2007</xref>). Most research universalizes heterosexual masculinity as a durable, privileged identity. However, race intersects with gender and heterosexuality to unevenly allocate privilege and power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0891243211434613">Collins 2004</xref>), complicating the relationship between heterosexuality and masculinity for some men. My study uses in-depth interviews with Black college students to examine the intersections of heterosexuality, masculinity, and race. I focus on Black men’s talk about heterosexual interracial relationships, treating this talk as a form of identity work—activity that gives meaning to identities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0891243211434613">Schwalbe and Mason-Schrock 1996</xref>)—used to claim and signify raced, gendered selves.</p>
<p>Collegiate interracial relationships disrupt racial rules for heterosexual intimacy, making visible underpinning assumptions about race, gender, and sexuality. Predominantly white universities expand opportunities for interracial liaisons, but these opportunities are conditioned in different ways by gender and race (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0891243211434613">Joyner and Kao 2005</xref>). Black college men’s greater participation in interracial relationships causes tension between Black college men and Black college women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0891243211434613">Childs 2005</xref>), while the heightened visibility of Black men’s intimate choices on predominantly white campuses increases both peer regulation of their relationships and their significance for men’s identities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0891243211434613">Ray and Rosow 2009</xref>). Research suggests that Black women’s anger about interracial relationships stems from their raced and gendered disadvantages in collegiate heterosexual markets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0891243211434613">Childs 2005</xref>). For Black men, however, interracial relationships present both problems and possibilities. In this article, I examine Black men’s talk about relationships with white women. This talk is not explicitly about sexual practices, but it evokes sexual meanings.</p>
<p>More than an arena of private practices, sexuality is a meaning system that is coconstituted with race and gender, used to signify identities, and to allocate social rewards and statuses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0891243211434613">Collins 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0891243211434613">Stein 2008</xref>). By examining the ways Black men use talk about heterosexual interracial relationships to negotiate their raced gender identities, I focus on the co-construction of race, gender, and sexuality in everyday life, considering these intersections as dynamic rather than a bounded identity.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0891243211434613">
<title>Theoretical Framework</title>
<p>Following an interactionst view of identities as “strategic social constructions created through interactions, with social and material consequences” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0891243211434613">Howard 2000</xref>, 371), I focus on the use of talk as a form of identity work used to signify and negotiate identities. People use talk to fashion views of themselves, link themselves to others, and create symbolic boundaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0891243211434613">Schwalbe and Mason-Schrock 1996</xref>). Talk is flexible, allowing people to signify and resignify their identities, combine and shift between meanings, and negotiate multiple identity concerns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0891243211434613">Howard 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0891243211434613">Wetherell and Edley 1999</xref>). But talk must also negotiate embedded forms of sense-making: Audiences must honor its meanings. Thus, talk is both adaptive and institutional. Moreover, identity work occurs in the context of unequal social conditions and cultural ideas about what groups of people are like, and is a central way through which social inequality is experienced, made manageable, and reproduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0891243211434613">Schwalbe and Mason-Schrock 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>Masculinity is a gendered, racialized, sexualized identity constructed and constrained through interactional processes. Gender, race, and sexuality entail interlocking social arrangements from which we take on core identities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0891243211434613">West and Zimmerman 1987</xref>). For males, being seen as and seeing themselves as masculine is central to the development of a gendered self, differentiates them from women, and “establish[es] eligibility for gender-based privilege” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0891243211434613">Schrock and Schwalbe 2009</xref>, 287). Men “take on” masculine identities by locating themselves discursively in relationship to conventional masculine expectations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0891243211434613">Wetherell and Edley 1999</xref>). Men’s talk signals credible masculinities to self and others, creates local ideas about masculinity, and creates distinctions among men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0891243211434613">Dellinger 2004</xref>). For example, Dellinger found that male workers at a pornography magazine asserted middle-class masculine identities in opposition to its “slimeball” working-class readers. Thus, talk coconstitutes gender with other social identities, producing males not just as men but as kinds of men. Moreover, the intersection of gender with race and sexuality structures both the conditions for masculine identity work and the meaning of masculinity. Race- (and class-)subordinated men are held accountable to different expectations and interpretations of their masculine identities than other men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0891243211434613">Wingfield 2008</xref>). In this article, I draw on these frameworks to examine how Black college men use talk to negotiate their raced and sexualized masculine identities, and how this talk reveals, reproduces, and challenges intersecting race, gender, and sexuality meanings.</p>

<title>Heterosexuality and Young Black Men</title>
<p>Research identifies heterosexuality as central to notions of “real” manhood and thus as an important component of high-status masculinities. Cultural ideas about testosterone-fueled young men who relentlessly chase (hetero)sex, avoid emotional intimacy, and dominate women create heterosexual expectations for young men that can conflict with their lived experiences or preferences. Many young men bridge the gap between expectations and practices by bragging about heterosexual knowledge and practices, talking about women’s bodies, anticipating the “girl hunt,” and repudiating the “fag” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0891243211434613">Grazian 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0891243211434613">Pascoe 2007</xref>). Young men may also situate themselves <italic>against</italic> these expectations. For example, Christian men disdain predatory and promiscuous masculinity, redefining abstinence as masculine and emphasizing the self-control required to avoid heterosexual temptation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0891243211434613">Wilkins 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Most research treats heterosexual masculinity as a means of accessing undiluted gendered privilege and power, but heterosexuality does not unequivocally shore up privilege for all men. Gendered sexual discourses associating “normal” heterosexuality with white people and sexual deviance with people of color contribute to inequalities between and among raced men and women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0891243211434613">Bederman 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0891243211434613">Collins 2004</xref>). For example, by portraying Black men as rapists who could not stay away from white women, powerful whites justified the need to control Black men through lynching, disenfranchisement, and segregation, and they controlled white women through “protection.” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0891243211434613">Messerschmidt 2007</xref>). For Black men, the intersection of race, masculinity, and heterosexuality entails both masculine privilege and racialized social control of their bodies.</p>
<p>Racialized gender stereotypes are a source of both status and stigma for Black men. The media markets images of Black men as hypersexual, representing Black men as sexually virile “pimps” and “players” able to control women and extract material resources (e.g., get women to buy things for them) without offering commitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0891243211434613">Collins 2004</xref>). Because the “player” image caricatures Black men as heterosexually superior and able to control others, it can be a source of masculine status. This same image, however, simultaneously stigmatizes Black men as predatory, promiscuous, uncontrolled, and dangerous, justifying greater institutional control and persistent racial inequality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0891243211434613">Ferguson 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0891243211434613">Pascoe 2007</xref>). Black men must position themselves as heterosexual men within the space created by these double-edged images.</p>
<p>Because race reduces Black men’s access to other socially valued masculine resources, including status and economic power, the importance of heterosexuality to masculine identity work may increase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0891243211434613">Collins 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0891243211434613">Schrock and Schwalbe 2009</xref>). Some research finds that Black men assume the hypersexual image, using it to claim status and respect in the absence of other routes to masculinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0891243211434613">Anderson 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0891243211434613">Majors and Billson 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0891243211434613">Staiger 2005</xref>). For example, poor urban Black men adopt a “cool pose” in which they gain masculine status, in part, through sexual conquests and the manipulation of women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0891243211434613">Majors and Billson 1992</xref>). Staiger finds that high school boys also use racialized images of the “pimp” and the “player” to fashion Black masculine identities predicated on their ability to extract resources from girls. By performing as “players,” they use heterosexual meanings to position themselves “as in control, rather than being controlled” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0891243211434613">2005</xref>, 425). Because the player has come to symbolize Black (masculine) authenticity, its appeal extends beyond the urban poor to young middle-class Black men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0891243211434613">Ford 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0891243211434613">Patillo-McCoy 1999</xref>). Yet the cool pose has costs: It reinforces sexualized stereotypes of Black men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0891243211434613">Staiger 2005</xref>), and can derail upward mobility and evoke class disrepute (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0891243211434613">Majors and Billson 1992</xref>).</p>
<p>Differently, some Black men distance themselves from stereotypes of hypersexuality by enacting “respectable” or “decent” Black masculinities in conformance with white expectations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0891243211434613">Duneier 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0891243211434613">Lamont 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0891243211434613">Wingfield 2007</xref>). Historically, Black men have sought eligibility for equal status with white men by aligning themselves with discourses of masculine civility and distinguishing themselves from the stereotype of hypersexuality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0891243211434613">Higginbotham 1994</xref>). Respectability seems to be particularly important for participation in predominantly white, middle-class institutions. Some Black college men distance themselves from cool pose by emphasizing academics instead of sex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0891243211434613">Harper 2004</xref>), or by adopting romantic, rather than predatory, orientations toward heterosexuality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0891243211434613">Ray and Rosow 2009</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0891243211434613">Collins (2004)</xref> argues, however, that images of Black middle-class respectability portray Black men as weak and effeminate.</p>
<p>Thus, cool pose and respectability each come with benefits and costs: Cool pose bolsters racial authenticity and masculinity, but it can undermine mobility; respectability facilitates mobility but at the expense of Black masculine authenticity—a trait that may be particularly costly for young men for whom high-status masculinity is more tightly linked to heterosexual success. Indeed, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0891243211434613">Ford (2011)</xref> finds that Black university men’s “status as upwardly mobile college students may further necessitate the use of certain thuglike . . . signifiers to symbolically maintain semblances of a legitimate black masculine persona that is visibly distinct from that of white men” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0891243211434613">2011</xref>, 59). Many of the men in her study, however, find these expectations burdensome and inauthentic. Black college men thus negotiate complex identities amid competing identity concerns. As college men, they are expected to demonstrate heterosexual prowess, but as upwardly mobile Black men, they are also expected to be safe and nonthreatening.</p>
<p>In this article, I examine how Black college men use talk about interracial relationships, and the sexual meanings it evokes, to fashion flexible raced gender identities in the face of their intersectional identity dilemmas. By framing interracial relationships sometimes as sites of heterosexual opportunity and sometimes as sites of true love and racial progress, they position themselves rhetorically as <italic>both</italic> players <italic>and</italic> respectable. Examining Black men’s identity work reveals the ways the intersections of sexuality, gender, and race both create identity problems and provide cultural resources for solving them, and provides a window on the ways race, gender, and sexuality are coproduced, reproduced, and lived in everyday life.</p>

<title>The Study</title>
<p>This study is part of a project aimed at investigating gender, race, and class in Black college students’ identities. Data come from 45 in-depth, one- to three- hour interviews conducted with Black undergraduates at two predominantly white universities. I conducted 39 interviews; a research assistant conducted six. Participants were students at one of two large, public universities. Midwestern (all names are pseudonyms) hosts a somewhat higher percentage (5.4 percent) of Black undergraduates than Western (1.4 percent). In different regions (the Midwest and the interior West), these universities are similar to other large, interior public universities with large athletic programs.</p>
<p>I sampled for within-campus heterogeneity among Black students, using initial interviews and informal conversations to map the terrain of Black students, and to develop multiple recruitment strategies. I included members of Black campus organizations and students who avoided those organizations, athletes and non-athletes, members of Black Greek organizations, members of predominantly white Greek organizations, and unaffiliated students. I recruited students who spent time in campus areas associated with Black students and those who did not. Thus, the study intentionally eclipses boundaries between student groups, attempting to include a broad array of campus experiences. Most participants identified themselves as “middle class.” However, based on self-reports of parental occupation and home communities, I designated four men and four women as class-disadvantaged. Most others grew up in predominantly white, suburban communities before attending university. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0891243211434613">Table 1</xref> summarizes the characteristics of the sample.

<p>Aware of my positionality as a white professional woman (the RA was also a white woman), we aimed to increase participants’ comfort by establishing common ground through small talk, explaining my interest in learning about racial dynamics from their own vantage, and starting with broad questions that let participants set the interview pace and tone. We also let participants determine where and when the interviews took place. Some chose my office; others chose the campus center or coffee shops. Other factors seemed to be more important in facilitating rapport. First, on both campuses, I received support from Black students who introduced me as an antiracist ally. Second, several participants noted my comfort talking about racial issues, as opposed, I think, to the color-blindness they often confronted in cross-racial communication. Third, because many Black students had grown up in predominantly white communities and trusted (some) white people, whiteness was not an automatic barrier to rapport with all interview participants. In addition, we used strategies for conducting interviews with men, including framing questions in terms of what other people have said, and asking them to tell us stories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0891243211434613">Schwalbe and Wolkomir 2003</xref>). These strategies also gave me access to a broader array of narratives about campus life, yielding the kinds of stories and stereotypes students share with each other.</p>
<p>My initial research questions were broad: “How do Black students experience the transition to college?” and “How does the experience of being Black change in college?” Interviews covered a set of open-ended topics, including schooling, friendship, and dating both before and after the transition to college, but accommodated emerging themes and topics of interest to the participants. In most interviews, we did not ask specifically about interracial relationships. Instead, participants introduced the topic themselves, bringing up interracial relationships when discussing their interactions with other Black students at the university, their dating experiences, experiences with campus organizations, and what it means to be a Black university man or woman. The scope of these topics directed my attention to the importance of interracial relationships in structuring and understanding experiences beyond students’ intimate lives themselves.</p>
<p>During data collection, I wrote analytic memos on emergent themes, and discussed them with colleagues and Black graduate students who had attended similar universities. Following interactionist principles, I treated the interviews as accounts or stories constructed for an audience. Interested in the construction of raced gender identities, I focused on the stories Black students told about each other. Interracial relationships were a central theme in these stories. I then turned to the ways men colluded in and defended themselves against women’s stories, asking myself what these particular stories accomplish. I identified two broad frames for interracial relationships. In one, Black men build on the caricature of the player, characterizing interracial relationships as a site of masculine heterosexual accomplishment. In the second, they describe interracial relationships as a site of intimacy. Having identified these distinct ways of talking, I read each interview transcript in its entirety to identify who used each kind of talk, and when, and how men used each kind of talk, attending to contradictions <italic>within</italic> interviews in addition to contradictions between them. I used women’s accounts to contextualize the men’s, although I am not analyzing their data explicitly in this article. I used a “write to think” process, writing initial analytic drafts that pushed me to deepen and sometimes alter my analysis. Throughout, I compared men’s talk about interracial relationships to women’s, and compared talk among Black men, looking for similarities and differences between athletes (six) and nonathletes (12), at Midwestern (eight) or Western (10), or between men who identified as heterosexual (15) and those who did not (three). Because men who expressed interest in other men (they do not all identify as “gay”) also participated in talk about interracial relationships, I include them in the analysis here. These men’s participation in these forms of talk is consistent with my understanding of heterosexuality as a set of meanings that may or may not correspond with people’s practices.</p>

Black men and Black women on this campus [because of] the stereotype that Black men only talk to [have relationships with] white girls.” As Desta indicates, for these students, “interracial” relationships almost always mean relationships between Black men and white women. And when they talk about “Black men,” they almost always mean Black athletes. The Black athlete is the dominant cultural symbol of Black manhood on these campuses, but most Black students are not rostered athletes. In this study, six of 18 men are athletes. The invisibility of alternative Black masculinities, however, leads most students to assume that all Black men are athletes, and compels <italic>all</italic> Black college men to negotiate their identities in the athletes’ shadow.</p>
<p>The specter of the athlete is both sexually virile and potentially dangerous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0891243211434613">Collins 2004</xref>). Interracial relationships are central to his lore. Campus stories portray Black athletes endlessly pursued by “snow bunnies” (white women). These stories occlude complexity and variability in Black college men’s intimate opportunities and practices. Ten of 18 men in this study report <italic>ever</italic> having had a relationship with a white woman, and six report more than one. Three report preferring Black women. Two are abstinent. Three are primarily interested in men, though none had successfully achieved a relationship (or had much sexual interaction) with one. Athletes describe more interracial opportunities than nonathletes, whom Black students call “regulars.” Ekon explains, “White men are looked up higher than regular. But athlete-wise, Black men are looked up higher than white men are.” Even some athletes, however, admit their interracial opportunities are not as endless as campus stories make them appear. Nonetheless, campus lore homogenizes Black men and their interracial behavior, painting all Black men in the hypersexual image of the athlete.</p>
<p>I examine Black men’s talk about interracial relationships as a form of raced gendered identity work. In the first section, I focus on “player talk”—men’s collusion with stories that portray them as “players” relentlessly chased by white women. In the second section, I examine the ways Black men distance themselves from the player by framing interracial relationships as a sign of racial progress and true love. I call this discursive frame “intimacy talk.” Although men do not all use player talk and intimacy talk in identical ways, these are not distinct strategies, but instead work together to negotiate Black college masculinity.</p>

<title>Interracial Debates and “Player” Talk</title>
<p>Black men in this study collaborate with other men in talk about interracial relationships regardless of their own practices or preferences, adopting a shared position supporting interracial relationships and opposing Black women’s objections. Interracial positions emerge as a predominant feature of raced gender identities in heated intra-racial debates that pit Black men against Black women in classrooms, workshops, and informal confrontations, and on Facebook. In these debates, women blame men’s behavior, while men blame women’s reactions. Black women, Marcus, a Western football player, explains, are “always stirring up an argument [about]: Why do we have sex with white women and date white women?” These debates foster inter-gender acrimony, and solidify the idea that, as Nick, another Western athlete, says, “all the men” share one perspective on interracial relationships, and “all the women” share another.</p>
<p>By focusing on between-gender differences, debates collapse distinctions <italic>within</italic> raced gender groups, crafting symbolic boundaries that cement the idea that each is a distinct group with shared sets of assumptions, experiences, and concerns. Ekon, the incoming president of the Western Black Student Association, explains the homogenizing effect of these debates: “It’s more of an assumption and so then a lot of people fall into the assumption. You know what I mean, it’s all talk here and there and then people are like okay and they fall into this assumption . . . and it just becomes reality.” The repetitive iteration of gendered views on interracial relationships performs and crystallizes Black masculinity: In this context, endorsing interracial relationships, regardless of actual practice, signals Black manhood. At the same time, gendered debates occlude differences in opportunities, practices, and preferences among Black men.</p>
<p>Debates about interracial relationships create gender boundaries not only because men and women take different sides but because their content crafts shared ideas about what Black men<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0891243211434613">1</xref></sup> are like. Because this talk draws on cultural images of Black men’s heterosexual drive and desirability, and colludes with campus stereotypes about the (exploitative) gender dynamics in interracial relationships, I call this discursive frame “player talk.” Player talk bridges discrepancies between men’s practices and raced masculine expectations, allowing differently situated Black men to capitalize on the athlete’s (presumed) heterosexual success.</p>
<p>Interracial player talk casts Black men as campus lotharios, pursued by relentless white women called “jersey chasers” and “snow bunnies.” Craig, an athlete, says, “The amount of white women who are just kind of tossin’ themselves at Black athletes is abundant.” Nick says, “We could kind of—it sounds kind of bad, we could pick and choose who we want to talk to, and most of us chose white women.” Interracial player talk is a form of heterosexual boasting similar to that used by other young men to establish public masculine credentials (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0891243211434613">Pascoe 2007</xref>), but the subject of interracial sexuality makes its racial content explicit. Talk about “snow bunnies” not only reinforces (to them and others) an image of greater heterosexual opportunities than many men actually have, but also symbolizes the centrality of race to the meaning of these opportunities. As Marcus, laughing, says:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>When I signed my [football] scholarship, I was sayin’ I was goin’ to go and fuck all these white girls and stuff like that, and . . . . like, I’m not gonna lie, bein’ young, I thought that havin’ sex with white women was also a sense of accomplishment . . . because my whole life I’ve been told that that’s off-limits.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>White women’s desire for Black men is thus central to this form of talk.</p>
<p>Player talk elides variations in the sexual opportunities, practices, and preferences of Black college men by constructing Black men as a uniquely desirable <italic>group</italic>. It emphasizes the universal, rather than individual, attractiveness and sexual superiority of Black men; player talk is usually formulated as “us” rather than “me,” as in “<italic>we</italic> could pick and choose.” Dominick is also a Western athlete. He says, “I just think white women are attracted to Black men because we’re exotic. And we have . . . great natural physiques.” Craig asserts, “I know a lot of girls who . . . swear up and down by Black men. They will never date another white man in their life. I guess we’re good at having sex, good in bed.” Black men’s sexual superiority is not, moreover, confined to their bodies. Lance, a high-profile Midwestern student, explains that when Black men are talking to a girl, “he’d be eating her out with his words. . . . By the end of it, she’s just this pool of nothingness.” Men summarize this claim in the expression “Once you go Black, you never go back.” In this talk, men draw on cultural ideas about the innate eroticism of Black men, and use them to claim masculine status.</p>
<p>Player talk includes boasting about the things white women will do for Black men. Men only occasionally talked this way to me, but women frequently reported this kind of talk, suggesting that such stories are commonly exchanged among Black students. Yemisi, a leader in the Western BSA, said, “I mean, one of my friends, he was telling me, like, ‘I’ve never had to do my laundry while I was at [university]. And I rarely had to write papers.’” Mei, who runs track at Western, noted, “White girls give the Black guys whatever the hell they want. They always give everything . . . free pussy, free clothes, food.” Brenda, a Midwestern student, generalizes that when Black men date white women, “He just wants fuckin’. He just wants to ball her. He doesn’t want anybody to challenge him.” Here, stories about relationships with <italic>white</italic> women sustain gendered power over <italic>Black</italic> women. To Black women, the message is clear: We don’t need you. If you want us, you should cater to our needs.</p>
<p>Some men acknowledged the prevalence of this kind of boasting to me, but often deracialized it, as Dominick does here: “That’s any girl. Any girl will do it. You just have to find the right one to do it. . . . But, it’s easy to say [that it’s about race] when you go to a school that’s predominately white.” Marcus adds, “[Black women] always say that we always mess with [white women] because they give it up easy. That’s part of it. You could say that. But in my lifetime, I’ve found that all colors and creeds of women can be easy.” Vincent, a Midwestern student, makes the same point, “I mean, I messed with everything. . . . The same criteria goes for both races.” This deracialized talk claims masculine power over women in another way; by contending that “any girl” will do things for them, these men fortify their desirability, their location in a position of gendered power, and their ability to disregard any woman who doesn’t comply with their expectations.</p>
<p>These stories are not just about Black men’s relationships with women; they also use gendered ideas to invert racialized hierarchies by depicting white women laboring on behalf of Black men. David, another Western athlete, is explicit: “Some white men hate that African American men are stealing their women.” In these stories, crossing racial boundaries confirms Black men’s masculinity and upsets racialized hierarchies between white and Black men. At the same time, sexist ideas about women as “property” shore up Black men’s right to transgress racial boundaries in the first place. Thus, player talk is a form of identity work in which Black college men use cultural ideas about raced, gendered sexuality to claim and give meaning to Black masculinity.</p>

<title>Player Talk and Campus Position</title>
<p>Black college men do not all participate in player talk in the same ways. As the previous section revealed, athletes boast more often and in more contexts than regulars do, while regular students primarily collude in this talk in community forums. Black men do not have to actively participate in player talk, however, to benefit and lose from the collective meanings it creates. Instead, the repetition of stories about interracial intimacies combines with the content of interracial boasting to conceal differences among Black college men, sustaining stereotypes of Black masculinity as relentlessly heterosexual. This stereotype generates distinct identity opportunities and dilemmas for differently situated men.</p>
<p>Regulars use the image of Black sexuality for their own purposes. Ekon admits to desiring men but has not been intimate with a man or told many people about his interest. He proposes that the image of the hypersexual Black athlete gives him latitude to explore his sexuality: “When people know that you are an athlete, you know, they expect you to date all these girls and do . . . this and that. But when you’re not, I mean you . . . [when] you’re a regular student you don’t have so much pressure on you.” Jeffrey, who says he is “waiting for marriage” to have sex, makes a similar claim: “It’s interesting because we’re stereotyped as very sexual beings. . . . I get more respect [for being abstinent] than any kind of criticism.” Tim, a member of the Western BSA, uses the homogenized athlete image differently: “My friend . . . a lot of girls hit on him and what he does is he passes them off to me. . . . [they ask] ‘Oh, do you play sports?’ I’m like, ‘Yeah, I play basketball.’” Tim gets away with portraying himself as an athlete because of the assumption that all Black men are athletes, and uses this assumption to increase his interracial opportunities. Thus, men enlist the hypersexual stereotype in a range of personal strategies.</p>
<p>These strategies, however, are more complicated than these men propose. They are correct that the stereotype of the hypersexual Black college man is so pervasive that it masks variations in their practices: The success of player talk is evidenced by outsiders’ insistence that all Black college men are having endless sex with white women. Contradictorily, the same image constructs a relentless, predatory Black masculine heterosexuality that questions the heterosexuality (and masculinity) of Black men who do not match its narrow expectations. The same women who propose that “all” Black men are having sex with white women also, without any sense of paradox, suggest that nonathlete Black men are gay: “It seems like ok, if you’re a Black man you’re either an athlete or you’re gay,” Desta says. “That <italic>is</italic> one of the stigmas,” Ekon concedes. “Society has it ingrained that athletes are supposed to be men . . . and if you’re not that” then you’re gay. Even Tim, a “regular” who described picking up women by successfully posing as an athlete at parties, laments that people insist he’s gay. Men’s ability to use or deflect the player images thus shifts across contexts and audiences. Regular Black men frame their identities within the rhetorical space of interracial tales that reinforce the idea of relentless Black male heterosexuality—tales that simultaneously enable and constrain their own sexual practices.</p>
<p>Athletes, more likely to participate in interracial relationships, face different opportunities and dilemmas. Player talk deflects attention from the personal frustrations many have finding and sustaining intimacy with women, and thus hides individual worries about heterosexual success. The disjuncture between player talk and talk about relationship troubles is jarring. For example, in the same interview in which he boasted about how “any woman” will do things for him, Dominick lamented, “I’ve dated girls who told me flat out, ‘Hey, I’m using you for this, just to let you know. . . .’ They end up doing me wrong, I know that.” Like other men’s private talk about heterosexual troubles, Dominick’s contradictions underscore the use of player talk to do public identity work.</p>
<p>The player image exacerbates athletes’ relationship dilemmas. By depicting Black men as a uniquely desirable group, player talk undermines <italic>individual</italic> desirability. Interpreting white women’s interest as a fetish, outsiders discount these relationships as “jungle fever”—racialized sexual curiosity but not “real.” “Jersey chaser” stories similarly repudiate the authenticity of Black men’s relationships. By implying that Black men are desired exclusively because of their (gendered) race, these images deny Black men individual desirability and the possibility of emotional connection. Several Western athletes expressed ambivalence about being desired for their racial otherness. Nick equivocates:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>I guess you could say it’s flattering . . . like, it’s always good to be liked by people, I guess—but I feel like when . . . I think of “groupie,” I feel like that’s just somebody who’s tryin’ to get with as many football players as possible type thing. That’s not me. I’m not for that.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>David regrets,</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>If I’m walking around with a white woman, a lot of white guys look at me like, “I can’t believe that, the only reason she’s dating him is because he’s an athlete, or because he’s Black.” And I like to think somebody is dating me—that could be true—but I like to think people date me because I’m me.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>These men do not want to be desired <italic>just</italic> because they’re athletes; instead, they want women to be interested in them as individuals. Men who have interracial relationships also do not want to be perceived as <italic>only</italic> liking white women. Jackson, a Midwestern football player, laments that other students reduce his relationships to a jungle fever fetish, “[They] say, “He only likes white girls. That’s just a dumb thing to say.” The manhood that player talk establishes for the group limits the ability of individual Black men to create an unmarked masculinity; instead, they are always desired as <italic>Black athletes</italic>, never just as men.</p>
<p>Black college men benefit from colluding with the racialized image of the player, but the image is homogenizing and limiting, creating tensions for differently situated men. Black-ness both bolsters masculine status and jeopardizes it, albeit in different ways for regulars than for athletes. Regulars struggle to be recognized as real Black men within its narrow confines, while athletes struggle to enact unmarked masculinities that extend beyond their racialized bodies.</p>
<p>For both sets of men, the double-edged cultural meanings of Black men’s sexuality mean the “player” image slips into predatory stereotypes of Black men. White sororities circulate the image of the Black male rapist in “safety” alerts warning women to avoid potentially dangerous Black men. Black women more subtly link Black men to predatory images, condemning their relationships as exploitative, based only on sex, and motivated by “jungle fever” rather than authentic emotional interest. As Aisha, a woman at Western, says, “Talking to the Black men on this campus, they’re like, ‘Well, she’s easy, she’s right there, why not?’ Like they don’t care for her or like, I don’t know. They just don’t respect her as much as they should.” Thus, Black women turn Black men’s player talk back on them, using men’s own claims to portray them as sexually uncontrolled.</p>
<p>It’s unclear if all Black college men are aware that the predatory image follows them onto campus, but Nick, an athlete, laments that while some white women chase after him, others are afraid to look at him. And Jeffrey, a regular, explains that Black men protect each other from racialized misinterpretations of their behavior: “People make sure you’re acting with good sense and not putting yourself into a compromising situation.” Lance, a Midwestern regular, explains that Black men also teach each other how to talk about their sexual practices in ways that protect their reputations. He says, “I learned that some things you just don’t say as far as explaining [sexual practices].” These comments suggest that many are aware of the pervasiveness of the predatory image—and the problems it entails. Stereotypes of predatory Black masculinity heighten surveillance of Black men, but being viewed as the wrong <italic>kind</italic> of men has additional, more insidious identity consequences for these men. The predatory image conflicts with strategies of respectability used by many middle-class Black men to facilitate participation in white institutions. Thus, player talk can jeopardize mobility strategies premised on masculine heterosexual respectability.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0891243211434613">
<title>Intimacy Talk</title>
<p>Black college men mitigate the costs of player talk by framing interracial relationships as sites of intimacy, authenticity, and progress. Because this second form of talk emphasizes intimate emotions over sexual practice, I call it “intimacy talk.” As with player talk, all of the men in this study used intimacy talk, but not in identical ways. Intimacy talk disassociates Black men from the player image in two ways. First, it draws distinctions among them, casting other Black college men as players. Second, it transforms the meaning of interracial relationships from a site of racialized heterosexual opportunity to a site of racial progress and true love. Thus, in contrast to the boasting in player talk, intimacy talk justifies interracial relationships, connecting interracial intimacy to more broadly held middle-class norms. By resignifying interracial relationships, men also resignify Black college masculinity.</p>
<p>Intimacy talk attributes the image of the player to <italic>other</italic> Black men. Jackson, a Midwestern football player, says, “I’ve heard people say off the wall shit, like about a white girl, ‘You can have sex with them but you can’t wife [marry] them.’” Jeffrey, a member of the BSA, says the “Mandingo fantasy” is “an athlete thing.” Craig, a Western football player, distinguishes <italic>among</italic> athletes, explaining that some athletes pursue white women indiscriminately, but he does not. Describing a teammate, he says, “All of a sudden he’s attracted to white girls, because he’s never had a chance to talk to them, a relationship with them, so he’s talkin’ to all these white girls.” These distinctions do two things. First, they sustain, rather than dispute, the image of the player. Second, they censure the player’s <italic>racial</italic> motivations, underscoring <italic>racialized</italic> sexuality as the problem. For Jackson, desiring white women is appropriate, but treating them as sexually disposable is not. For Jeffrey and Craig, sex with white women is fine, but desiring white women <italic>because</italic> they’re white is not. In both cases, intimacy talk distances the speaker from race-based desire. In contrast, intimacy talk professes a color-blind love for all women. Lance, a prominent student leader at Midwestern, says:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>I’ve dated so many different races of women within my short life—I’m not sure how that sounds. But you know, a woman is a woman is a woman is a woman. Love is love is love is love. [People who object] always come back to, “Don’t you feel a responsibility to who you are?” I’m like, “This <italic>is</italic> who I am. I’m so many nations.” . . . The heart wants what the heart wants.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>And David, a Western football player, comments:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>I’m a very revolutionary humanist person, and I have very progressive gender roles. I’m not perfect, but I don’t believe in living by any standard of the body of demographics or defining roles by your gender or race or anything like that. So for me, I don’t see traditional standards of color, I see beauty. I don’t contort that with societal influences. I just see beauty, see people for who they are. . . . Beauty to me comes in so many different forms, shapes, sizes, colors.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Intimacy talk portrays interracial relationships in opposition to player talk. It deemphasizes sex, emphasizing instead emotions and authenticity. It replaces crude exploitation with romanticized gender hierarchies in which Black men are motivated by love and beauty. It condemns racial motivations in which “getting white women is a form of accomplishment” and exalts color-blind heterosexuality in which “women are women are women”—and, presumably Black “men are men are men.” By thus emphasizing essentialist gender categories, Black men claim their right to (race-neutral, color-blind) masculinity.</p>
<p>Intimacy talk also crafts the meaning of Black college masculinity. First, by portraying interracial relationships as a site of social control, men’s participation in (or support for) them becomes evidence of their autonomy and, as Vincent, a Midwestern student, says, “security.” Men who won’t “wife” white women, Jackson, the Midwestern athlete, explains, “are afraid of what people might think.” In intimacy talk, autonomy and self-control signify masculinity. Second, men claim to be “progressive” by depicting interracial relationships as a sign of racial progress. In this formulation, interracial relationships are evidence that Black men are not limited by race, but instead have multicultural, sophisticated tastes. Third, by claiming emotionally authentic motivations, intimacy talk combats “jungle fever” allegations that interracial relationships are inauthentic.</p>
<p>Intimacy talk is strategic. It manages the predatory stigma while justifying interracial practices in a context in which Black men’s relationships are always contested and politicized. Even for men who do not have interracial relationships, intimacy talk maintains the <italic>possibility</italic> of interracial relationships as central to the definition of Black masculinity. It stakes out this position not through braggadocio, but by invoking a gentle set of explanations: Intimacy talk transforms Black men’s interest in white women from racially motivated, predatory sexuality into authentic (i.e., color-blind), romantic, progressive intimacy. These accounts, in turn, challenge campus understandings of Black masculinity, converting Black men from <italic>bad</italic> men—players—into <italic>good</italic>, that is, respectable, men.</p>
<p>Because all Black college men are figured as predators, they all benefit from the race and gender meanings intimacy talk creates, but not in the same ways. Some men have never been in an interracial relationship. These men do not have to justify their practices but instead have to explain their allegiance with the interests of other Black men. Philip, a queer-identified Western student, says, “I love [interracial relationships] because I think they’re honest, I think they’re true.” To Terry, they are “a sign of [racial] progress.” Somewhat ruefully, Ekon, who is more private about his interest in men, admits, “I guess if you love each other, you know, I’m not going to knock love. That just doesn’t make sense.” Ekon’s ruefulness stems from his recognition that he is adopting a masculine position against the Black women with whom he is close. When interracial relationships are framed as authentic and progressive, however, supporting them is logical, recasting this position from a betrayal of Black women to a commonsense call for social progress.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether intimacy talk is personal or more general, Black college men make similar links among interracial intimacy, emotional authenticity, progressiveness, and cosmopolitanism, and use these links to create symbolic boundaries with Black women, who often angrily object to Black men’s interracial relationships. Ekon’s reluctance notwithstanding, regular men, more than athletes, use intimacy talk to craft distinctions with Black women, perhaps because they have to repudiate feminization. For instance, Tim, who is heterosexual-identified but laments being seen as gay, portrays Black women’s objections to interracial relationships as regressive: “It’s the twenty-first century! Get over it!” Philip, who is queer-identified and more openly gender transgressive than other men in this study, more gently distinguishes himself from Black women. He explains, “I understand that that’s [interracial relationships] a place of pain for [Black women]. I would say, ‘Expand your circle. See something greater than just that.’” In these ways, intimacy talk, like player talk, demarcates Black men from Black women. By fashioning Black masculinity as progressive and emotionally authentic, these distinctions stigmatize Black women as regressive, emotionally inappropriate, and unsophisticated. This identity work is enabled by gendered arrangements that accord Black women responsibility for sustaining Black families, and free Black men to pursue their individual desires independent of community concerns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0891243211434613">Dalmage 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Nonetheless, men also use intimacy talk to repair their relationships with Black women. Black women are often more sympathetic to intimacy talk than to player talk, as Tiffany reveals: “A lot of the older football players have gotten it,” she says, “but the ones coming in are just like, ‘Oh, wow!’ This is a totally different scene for most of them. So they just kind of like to score the whites.” Forthcoming about the strategic uses of intimacy talk, Lance, a Midwestern leader, explains that he “learned there are some things you just don’t say” from older Black men students. Intimacy talk allows him to participate in interracial relationships <italic>and</italic> friendships with Black women. Intimacy talk does not always work, however. Aisha, a Western woman, tells me that some men use intimacy talk to “play us like bein’ dumb. I feel like they just say that stuff ’cuz it sounds good but I don’t know if they really feel it.” Thus, women do not always interpret intimacy talk in the ways men hope.</p>
<p>Inasmuch as intimacy talk salvages Black masculinity, it does so at a cost. First, the distinctions men craft sustain the stereotype of the predatory Black man. Second, in claiming that “women are women are women,” men discount the ways race and gender meanings organize patterns of attraction. Efforts to distance themselves from the costs of race-based desire, ironically, compress the space for conversations about intimacy that acknowledge race, invalidating the legitimacy of an antiracist discourse based on explicit discussions of racial power. Third, essentialized ideas of “progressive” men sustain the idea that the way to be a good man is to commit to a woman, denying the possibility that some women may too desire sex without emotional intimacy. Thus, intimacy talk, like other strategies of respectability, maintains sexualized distinctions among people of color, and between men and women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0891243211434613">White 2001</xref>).</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Heterosexuality and masculinity are intimately coupled and mutually reinforcing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0891243211434613">Connell 1995</xref>), but raced gender stereotypes complicate Black men’s use of heterosexuality to claim masculinity, according Black masculinity both stigma and status. The double-edged meaning of Black men’s sexuality creates complex identity dilemmas for Black college men. While most research on Black men suggests that cool pose and respectability provide distinct strategies for navigating these dilemmas, the men in this study combine both strategies by moving between opposing discursive frames. Player talk and intimacy talk coexist in uneasy tension, working together to achieve and manage Black masculine identities in the context of the university. University status structures and racialized erotic markets reward Black men for enacting heterosexual swagger, and penalize them for relinquishing it, creating incentives for Black men to link themselves to the player image. Player talk occludes variations in Black college men’s practices, allowing differently situated Black men to capitalize on the heterosexual status of the athlete. But player talk also comes with costs: It perpetuates narrow ideas about Black masculinity, undermines individual desirability, and reproduces the stereotype of the predator. Intimacy talk buffers men against these costs, mitigating fears that they are threatening, dangerous, or in a relentless quest for white women. Intimacy talk relies on player talk for meaning; it is effective precisely because people think “all Black men are players.” Just as Jeffrey’s abstinence seems more laudable because people assume that Black men “are very sexual beings,” so too does intimacy talk seem more valuable because Black women believe most Black men are “only interested in sex.” Player talk and intimacy talk are thus not distinct strategies but work together to negotiate Black men’s identities. Men move between frames, using them to negotiate complex, flexible identities within and across interactional situations.</p>
<p>Talk about interracial relationships creates a shared Black masculinity across a range of differences by crafting boundaries between Black men and Black women, aligning Black men’s concerns with those of other Black men, and confirming and reworking the meaning of Black masculinity. These strategies, while shared, create diverse opportunities and dilemmas for Black men as they intersect with campus locations, bodies, and personal preferences. Accordingly, men do not benefit equally. Player talk links men to the image of the athlete, and intimacy talk distances them from it, but neither form of talk disrupts the athletes’ hegemony as the predominant form of Black masculinity on these campuses. Player and intimacy talk respond <italic>most</italic> to the specific concerns of athletes and less to the concerns of marginalized regular men. While some research on Black college men (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0891243211434613">Harper 2004</xref>) suggests that nonathletes employ strategies of respectability to differentiate themselves from athletes, I did not find this to be the case. Instead, in both player and intimacy talk, regular Black men align themselves with the perspectives and concerns of athletes, claiming a Black masculinity from which they are otherwise excluded. In doing so, they both manage and reproduce their marginal social identities as nonathlete Black men.</p>
<p>Black college men’s identity work manipulates the relationships among race, gender, and sexuality. Player talk uses racialized, gendered ideas about sexuality to claim and fortify Black masculine status, while intimacy talk attempts to transcend racial limits on masculinity by crafting a Black masculinity aligned with broader sexual ideals. The success of their efforts to both use and transcend racialized images is limited, however, as they do not successfully unseat the narrow cultural images of “real” Black men that prompt their identity work in the first place. Regular Black men continue to contend with feminization, while athletes continue to be seen as predators. Investment in masculinity—the need to be seen as real men—itself sustains these racial inequalities between men.</p>
<p>Yet Black men’s identity work also disrupts racial boundaries. Intimate boundaries mandating intraracial relationships can be used to maintain race and gender hierarchies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0891243211434613">Donovan 2003</xref>), but here Black men claim the right to cross these boundaries. Their identity work disrupts race in two ways. First, player talk inverts racial hierarchies, using heterosexuality to claim dominance over white men. In player talk, white women choose Black men because of Black men’s physical superiority. By “stealing” white women and extracting labor from them, Black men undercut white men’s masculine “right” to control white women’s bodies and labor, inverting a historical legacy in which white men could access Black women’s bodies and labor with impunity, but maintaining gendered understandings about men’s right to women’s bodies. In contrast, intimacy talk minimizes the importance of race in Black men’s relationships but also essentializes heterosexual femininity: A “woman is a woman is a woman” and “beauty is beauty is beauty.” In intimacy talk, heterosexual gender categories justify men’s crossing of racial boundaries.</p>
<p>In the case at hand, then, stabilizing gender also stabilizes race, but destabilizing race does <italic>not</italic> destabilize gender. Instead, as I have found in other work, destabilizing one axis of inequality often requires stabilizing another, and thus shifts inequalities without undoing the interlocking structures holding them together. For example, “Puerto Rican wannabes”—white women in intimate relationships with Black and Puerto Rican men—also cross racial boundaries, but, like Black college men, they legitimize their racial boundary violations by shoring up heteronormative gender hierarchies in which women are expected to be sexually restrained (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0891243211434613">Wilkins 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0891243211434613">2008</xref>). Goth women, differently, attempt to transcend gender hierarchies by claiming agentic sexuality, but are enabled in their efforts by their privileged positions as white and middle-class. Moreover, their continued investment in codes of middle-class respectability, expressed through commitment to romantic relationships, ultimately reproduces their gendered disadvantages in their heterosexual relationships, undermining the radical potential of agentic feminine sexuality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0891243211434613">Wilkins 2008</xref>). In all of these cases, efforts to transcend the limits of one structure of inequality—to break out of limited race or gender rules—are enabled by the stabilization of another category. Each group justifies breaking some rules by invoking rules in other arenas of their lives. In these examples, intersectional identities provide resources—gender, race, or class meanings—people can use to challenge some of the limits inequality poses in their lives. At the same time, however, the relationship between intersectional categories undercuts these challenges, blunting their transformative potential.</p>
<p>This case thus further underscores the complexity and intractability of intersectional relationships. While previous research has shown how both cool pose and respectability reproduce the structural problems facing Black men, this case shows how men’s nuanced, flexible use of both strategies provides small benefits at the cost of supporting the structural conditions that shape identity problems in the first place. More research is needed to examine the relationship between structural axes of oppression, whether and when disruptions on one axis might lead to disruptions on another, and how these relationships are experienced and made manageable in everyday life.</p>
