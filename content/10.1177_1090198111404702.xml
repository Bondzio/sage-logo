<abstract>
<p>Smoke-free air policies have been shown to reduce smoking, but the mechanism of behavior change is not well understood. The authors used structural equation modeling to conduct a theory of planned behavior analysis with data from 395 smokers living in seven Texas cities, three with a comprehensive smoke-free air law and four without a comprehensive law. Agreement with regulating smoking in public places was significantly associated with attitudes and perceived normative pressure about quitting. Nicotine dependence was significantly associated with attitudes and perceived behavioral control. There was also a direct effect of nicotine dependence on intention to take measures to quit smoking. Smoke-free air laws appear to influence quitting intentions through the formation of positive attitudes about regulating smoking in public places and the perception of normative pressure to take measures to quit. Implications for smoke-free air policy campaigns and challenges in evaluating their effectiveness are discussed.</p>

<p>Despite declines in recent years, more than 20% of the adults in the United States continue to smoke, and cigarette smoking remains the single largest preventable cause of the death in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1090198111404702">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2009</xref>). As such, considerable effort is expended to implement interventions to prevent and reduce cigarette use. Increasingly, policy-based approaches have been used. One such policy-based strategy involves passing laws that restrict smoking in public places and workplaces. Over the past 25 years, the number and scope of such laws have increased dramatically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1090198111404702">Eriksen &amp; Cerak, 2008</xref>). Although these laws are intended primarily to reduce the public’s exposure to secondhand smoke, there is significant evidence that they are also effective in reducing smoking behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1090198111404702">Bauer, Hyland, Li, Steger, &amp; Cummings, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1090198111404702">Fichtenberg &amp; Glantz, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1090198111404702">Hahn et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1090198111404702">Heloma &amp; Jaakkola, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1090198111404702">Moskowitz, Lin, &amp; Hudes, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1090198111404702">Siegel, Albers, Cheng, Hamilton, &amp; Biener, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>What is less well understood, however, is the mechanism by which smoke-free air laws influence smoking behavior. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1090198111404702">Fong et al. (2006)</xref> proposed a conceptual framework whereby tobacco control policy interventions operate through a causal chain of events. According to this conceptualization, a policy intervention influences policy-specific variables, which in turn influence psychosocial mediators, such as attitudes and beliefs about quitting smoking. Finally, these psychosocial mediators predict future changes in smoking behavior. This suggests that, for behavior change to occur, a tobacco control policy must be salient to smokers through recognition or agreement with the policy intervention, depending on the specific policy. Then they will experience a change in one or more of the psychosocial mediators and this change will lead to subsequent smoking cessation behavior. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1090198111404702">Fathelrahman et al. (2009)</xref> found that smokers’ responses to and perceptions of stronger cigarette pack warning labels (i.e., policy-specific variables) predicted self-efficacy for quitting.</p>
<p>One of the primary theories underlying <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1090198111404702">Fong et al.’s (2006)</xref> conceptual framework is the theory of planned behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1090198111404702">Ajzen, 1985</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1090198111404702">1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1090198111404702">Ajzen &amp; Madden, 1986</xref>). According to the theory of planned behavior and the latest version of this psychosocial model of behavior known as the <italic>integrative model of behavioral prediction</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1090198111404702">Fishbein, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1090198111404702">Fishbein &amp; Ajzen, 2010</xref>), intention, the perceived likelihood of engaging in a behavior, is the most important determinant and immediate predictor of that behavior. Intention, in turn, is determined by the combination of three global factors: attitude toward the action, perceived normative pressure, and perceived behavioral control. The effects of background, or precursor, variables on intention are assumed to be mediated by these global factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1090198111404702">Ajzen &amp; Albarracín, 2007</xref>). In the current study, we applied this theoretical framework to the behavior of taking measures, such as reducing the amount smoked or using nicotine replacement therapy, to quit smoking. Specifically, we tested the influence of smoke-free air laws on smokers’ attitudes, perceived normative pressure, perceived behavioral control, and intention related to taking cessation measures. We chose to frame the behavior in terms of taking measures to quit smoking because, for many smokers, quitting smoking is an ongoing process that may require several attempts with multiple strategies. This process has been equated to managing a chronic disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1090198111404702">Fiore et al., 2008</xref>). Thus, the behavior of interest in this study was engagement in various actions that may lead to cessation. We included actions as diverse as trying to quit cold turkey and enrolling in a smoking cessation class as taking measures to quit smoking. This study focused on smokers’ intention to engage in such actions.</p>
<p>Following the approach described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1090198111404702">Hennessy et al. (2010)</xref> for conducting the theory of planned behavior analyses, we treated exposure to a smoke-free air law (i.e., a policy intervention) and extent of agreement with regulating smoking in public places (i.e., a policy-specific variable) as background variables. Importantly, this is different from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1090198111404702">Fong et al.’s (2006)</xref> framework, which conceptualizes the policy-specific variable as mediating the effect of exposure to policy on cessation behavior. Moreover, because nicotine dependence is an important predictor of cessation behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1090198111404702">Baker et al., 2007</xref>), we included it as an additional background variable. In this context, structural equation modeling is useful for examining whether a particular background factor, such as agreement with a smoke-free air law, influences the target behavior through changes in attitudinal, normative, or control factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1090198111404702">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<p>We used data collected from smokers living in seven Texas cities to test whether exposure to a comprehensive local smoke-free air law (i.e., one that covers all public places and workplaces, including restaurants and bars), extent of agreement with regulating smoking in public places, and nicotine dependence influenced intention to take measures to quit smoking directly or indirectly through differences in attitudes, perceptions of norms, or perceptions of control. It has been suggested that smoke-free air laws change the social norms related to smoking in a community making smoking less socially acceptable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1090198111404702">Levy &amp; Friend, 2001</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1090198111404702">Albers, Siegel, Chen, Biener, and Rigotti (2007)</xref> reported that strong smoke-free restaurant regulations were associated with smokers’ perceptions that smoking was socially unacceptable. Accordingly, we predicted that living in a city with a comprehensive smoke-free air law and extent of agreement with regulating smoking in public places would be most strongly associated with perceived normative pressure to take measures to quit smoking as compared with attitudes or perceived behavioral control. We estimated a structural equation model to test our prediction. Living in a city with a comprehensive smoke-free air law, extent of agreement with regulating smoking in public places, and nicotine dependence were treated as background variables. We modeled the relationships between these variables and the theory of planned behavior constructs of attitudes, normative pressure, and perceived behavioral control and the relationship between the theory of planned behavior constructs and intention to take measures to quit smoking. A better understanding of how smoke-free air laws exert their influence over smoking behaviors will aid in the development of communication messages that accompany the implementation of the laws to help move more smokers toward cessation.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section2-1090198111404702">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>Study participants were 395 adults who reported current cigarette smoking (smoked at least 100 cigarettes in their lifetime and smoked every day or some days at the time of measurement; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1090198111404702">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2008</xref>). Participants lived in one of seven Texas cities, three with a comprehensive smoke-free air law and four without a comprehensive law. A person was considered a resident of the city if they reported living in the designated city for at least 6 months. They were required to be a resident of the city proper (not the metropolitan area) because of the primary interest in testing the effect of the city smoking regulations. In terms of demographic characteristics, 47% of these 395 smokers were male, 55% were non-White, 20% were of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity, 55% had some education past high school, and their average age was 46 years (range 18-86 years).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1090198111404702">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>In September and October of 2007, we obtained a quota sample of adults from seven preselected Texas cities by random digit dialing. We selected the largest cities in Texas that represented a range of laws prohibiting smoking in public places and workplaces. Data were collected by computer-assisted telephone interviews. The adult in the household whose birthday had most recently passed was selected for the interview. If the identified individual was not available at the time of the initial call, the data collection team made up to three additional attempts to reach that person. Data were collected until a target sample of 50 current and former smokers and 50 nonsmokers each was obtained from Austin, Dallas, El Paso, Forth Worth, Lubbock, and San Antonio and a target sample of 100 current and former smokers and 100 nonsmokers was obtained from Houston. Only five individuals reported prior smoking so they were excluded from analyses as were the nonsmokers. All participants answered questions about attitudes and perceptions of smoking and smoke-free air laws in the city where they lived, reported exposure to smoking-related messages, and reported demographic information. Participants who reported current cigarette smoking answered additional questions about their smoking behavior and taking measures to quit smoking. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the investigators’ institution.</p>

<title>Measures</title>
<sec id="section5-1090198111404702">
<title>Intention to take measures to quit smoking</title>
<p>Participants were provided with a list of common smoking cessation measures (e.g., quit cold turkey, use nicotine replacement therapy, call a telephone quit line, and go to a clinic or quit smoking group) and asked whether they would try them during the next month. Then, participants responded to six items asking about their general intention to take measures to quit smoking cigarettes in the next month (e.g., “How likely is it that you plan to take these measures in the next month?”). All items were scored on a scale ranging from 1 to 5. The intention variable used in the analyses was computed by taking the mean of items with available responses. Internal consistency was .798. The mean intention score was 3.12 (standard deviation [<italic>SD</italic>] = 1.03, range 1.00-4.83).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1090198111404702">
<title>Attitude toward the act of taking measures to quit smoking</title>
<p>Participants reported their attitude toward taking measures to quit smoking using a semantic differential measure of taking measures in the next month as “pleasant or unpleasant,” “sweet or sour,” “satisfying or dissatisfying,” “good or bad,” “wise or foolish,” and “beneficial or harmful.” For analyses, we computed the mean of the available responses from the six items. Internal consistency was .773. The mean attitude score was 3.67 (<italic>SD</italic> = 0.96, range 1.00-5.00).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1090198111404702">
<title>Perceived normative pressure to take measures to quit smoking</title>
<p>To assess perceived normative pressure to take measures to quit smoking in the next month, participants responded to seven items, each measured on a 5-point scale. One item (“People who are important to me think I should take these measures in the next month”) measured general subjective norm and six items (e.g., “Health professionals think I should take these measures in the next month”) measured specific subjective norm. For analyses, we created a composite variable by computing the mean of the available responses from the seven items (internal consistency = .877). The mean for perceived normative pressure was 3.59 (<italic>SD</italic> = 0.87, range 1.00-5.00).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1090198111404702">
<title>Perceived behavioral control over taking measures to quit smoking</title>
<p>Participants responded to three items asking about their perceived behavioral control over taking measures to quit smoking cigarettes in the next month (e.g., “Is your taking these measures in the next month completely under your control, somewhat under your control, a little under your control, or not at all under your control?”). Two of the three items were scored on a scale ranging from 1 to 5. The third variable, which was scored on a scale ranging from 1 to 10, was rescaled to a 5-point scale for consistency. For analyses, we computed the mean of the available responses from the three items. Internal consistency was .684. The mean perceived behavioral control score was 4.11 (<italic>SD</italic> = 0.82, range 0.83-5.00). This construct may also reflect participants’ self-efficacy for taking measures to quit smoking, as self-efficacy is considered one aspect, along with controllability, of the overarching concept of perceived behavioral control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1090198111404702">Ajzen, 2002</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1090198111404702">
<title>Exposure to a comprehensive smoke-free air law</title>
<p>Participants were divided into those who lived in a city with a comprehensive smoke-free air law (Austin, El Paso, and Houston; <italic>n</italic> = 196, 50%) versus those who lived in a city without a comprehensive smoke-free air law (Dallas, Fort Worth, Lubbock, and San Antonio; <italic>n</italic> = 199, 50%) at the time of the data collection.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1090198111404702">
<title>Extent of agreement with regulating smoking in public places</title>
<p>Participants responded to a single item (“In general, regulation of smoking in public places is a good thing”) measured on a 5-point scale from <italic>strongly disagree</italic> to <italic>strongly agree</italic>. The mean response was 3.29 (<italic>SD</italic> = 1.32).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1090198111404702">
<title>Nicotine dependence</title>
<p>We measured nicotine dependence with the Fagerstöm Test for Nicotine Dependence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1090198111404702">Heatherton, Kozlowski, Frecker, &amp; Fagerström, 1991</xref>). Scores ranged from 0 to 9 with a mean of 2.98 (<italic>SD</italic> = 2.27).</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1090198111404702">
<title>Statistical Analyses</title>
<p>We used Mplus Version 5.21 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1090198111404702">Muthén &amp; Muthén, 2006</xref>) to conduct the structural equation modeling analyses of the theory of planned behavior with the three background variables. Structural equation modeling was used to model sequential systems of precursor variables, the theory of planned behavior mediators, and the intention outcome variable and estimate the relationships among them. Because of possible nonindependence due to living in the same city, all the standard errors were adjusted by including a clustering variable for city.</p>

<sec id="section13-1090198111404702" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>Bivariate relations among study variables are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1090198111404702">Table 1</xref>. As predicted by the theory of planned behavior, intention to take measures to quit smoking was significantly associated with attitudes toward taking measures, perceived normative pressure to take measures, and perceived behavioral control over taking measures. In terms of the background variables, exposure to a comprehensive smoke-free air law was not significantly related to any other variable. Extent of agreement with regulating smoking in public places was significantly related to nicotine dependence, attitudes toward taking measures to quit smoking, perceived normative pressure to take measures to quit smoking, and intention to take measures to quit smoking. Nicotine dependence was significantly negatively associated with extent of agreement with regulating smoking in public places, attitudes toward taking measures to quit smoking, perceived behavioral control over taking measures to quit smoking, and intention to take measures to quit smoking.</p>

<p>In terms of the three background variables, living in a city with a comprehensive smoke-free air law was not significantly associated with attitudes, perceived normative pressure, or perceived behavioral control related to taking measures to quit smoking. Looking at extent of agreement with regulating smoking in public places, the smokers with higher levels of agreement had more positive attitudes toward taking measures to quit smoking (β = .071, <italic>SE</italic> = .033, <italic>p</italic> = .032) and perceived more normative pressure to take measures (β = .177, <italic>SE</italic> = .020, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). However, there was no association between agreement with regulating smoking in public places and perceived behavioral control (β = −.023, <italic>SE</italic> = .027, <italic>p</italic> = .402). For nicotine dependence, smokers with lower levels of nicotine dependence had more positive attitudes toward taking measures to quit smoking (β = −.073, <italic>SE</italic> = .020, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) and had higher levels of perceived control over taking measures (β = −.073, <italic>SE</italic> = .019, <italic>p</italic> &lt;.001). There was no association between nicotine dependence and perceived normative pressure to take measures to quit smoking (β = .006, <italic>SE</italic> = .017, <italic>p</italic> = .721).</p>
<p>Although the theory of planned behavior assumes that the effects of the background variables on intention are mediated by attitudes, perceived normative pressure, and perceived behavioral control, the relatively poor model fit suggested that examination of direct paths from the background variables to intention was warranted. Therefore, we added the direct effects of living in a city with comprehensive smoke-free air law, extent of agreement with regulating smoking in public places, and nicotine dependence on intention. With these three direct effects added, all the results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1090198111404702">Figure 2</xref> were replicated with the addition of a significant direct effect from nicotine dependence to intention (β = −.044, <italic>SE</italic> = .015, <italic>p</italic> = .002). There were no significant direct effects of living in city with a comprehensive smoke-free air law (β = .093, <italic>SE</italic> = .117, <italic>p</italic> = .426) and agreement with regulating smoking in public places (β = −.009, <italic>SE</italic> = .034, <italic>p</italic> = .789). With this evidence, it appears that agreement with regulating smoking was completely mediated by the theory of planned behavior global factors and nicotine dependence was partially mediated. Finally, living in a city with a comprehensive smoke-free air law did not have a direct effect on intention or an indirect effect on intention through the theory of planned behavior mediators.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The first finding of note was that attitudes, perceived normative pressure, and perceived behavioral control were all significantly associated with intention to take measures to quit smoking. Thus, as predicted by the theory of planned behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1090198111404702">Ajzen, 1985</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1090198111404702">1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1090198111404702">Ajzen &amp; Madden, 1986</xref>), all three global constructs played a role in influencing intention in this sample of adult smokers. However, the magnitude of the association between attitudes and intention was much greater than the magnitude of the associations between perceived normative pressure and intention and perceived behavioral control and intention. In a review of the application of the theory of planned behavior to health behaviors in several domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1090198111404702">Godin &amp; Kok, 1996</xref>), attitudes were strongly related to intention across the board, and the associations between perceived normative pressure and intention were generally much weaker. Unlike our findings, however, most studies reviewed found that the relation between perceived behavioral control and intention was comparable in magnitude to the relation between attitudes and intention. The relatively weak link between perceived behavioral control and intention in our data may be attributable to difficulty measuring perceived behavioral control for an action related to an addictive behavior such as cigarette smoking; that is, the construct could have measured perceived difficulty in taking measures to quit smoking or perceived lack of control over smoking or both. There are differing views on whether perceived difficulty and perceived control are related but distinct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1090198111404702">Rise, Kovac, Kraft, &amp; Moan, 2008</xref>) or unidimensional (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1090198111404702">Courneya, Conner, &amp; Rhodes, 2006</xref>). Another possibility is that the 1-month time frame for taking measures to quit smoking may have been too short for some of the smokers in this sample to adequately consider their perceived control over taking the measures.</p>
<p>The primary aim for the current study was to test the effects of three background variables, exposure to a comprehensive smoke-free air law, extent of agreement with regulating smoking in public places, and nicotine dependence, on quitting intentions and to determine whether these effects were mediated by attitudes, perceived normative pressure, and perceived behavioral control. For nicotine dependence, our analyses suggest that there are both mediated and unmediated effects of nicotine dependence on intention to take measures to quit smoking. For the indirect effects, nicotine dependence was the only background variable considered in this study that was significantly associated with perceived behavioral control over taking measures to quit smoking. Perceived behavioral control, which reflects one’s perceptions of how much control one has over engaging in a particular behavior, is influenced by past events. Largely because of the addictive nature of cigarette smoking, many smokers make multiple unsuccessful cessation attempts despite expressing a desire to quit smoking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1090198111404702">Hyland et al., 2004</xref>). Therefore, based on this previous experience, smokers who view themselves as highly addicted to nicotine are likely to express less perceived behavioral control over quitting.</p>
<p>In terms of the two background variables related to smoke-free air laws, an unexpected finding was that living in a city with a comprehensive smoke-free air law was not associated with intention to take measures to quit smoking or with any of the three psychosocial mediators. This may be because of the methodological limitations of the current study. For example, the cross-sectional design did not allow for a test of the causal chain of events as proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1090198111404702">Fong et al. (2006)</xref> to explain the impact of tobacco control policies on cessation behavior. Exposure to policy, agreement with regulating smoking in public places, the psychosocial mediators, and intention to take measures to quit smoking were all measured at the same time. A related issue was that all the smokers in this study were treated as if they were exposed to a smoke-free air law at the same time. However, because they lived in different cities, they had been exposed to a law for differing amounts of time. Thus, they may have been at very different stages of potentially being influenced by exposure to policy. There are other potential confounding factors that may explain the lack of an effect. Although all the cities had comprehensive smoke-free air laws in place, the implementation of the laws may have been quite varied in terms of accompanying communication messages and enforcement strategies. A better study design would use longitudinal data collected at multiple time points to represent the complex stepwise nature of the impact of policy on behavior and subsequent health status improvement. Moreover, a stronger approach would have the entire sample at a common starting point in term of policy exposure at baseline and consider additional factors that may influence the impact of the policy on smoking behavior. Unfortunately, resource constraints and the relative unpredictability of the policy-making process make such studies difficult to conduct.</p>
<p>We found that the smokers who expressed higher levels of agreement with regulating smoking in public places were more likely to hold positive attitudes about taking quitting measures and perceive more normative pressure for taking measures after adjusting for exposure to a comprehensive smoke-free air law and nicotine dependence. These positive attitudes and perceived normative pressure were, in turn, associated with intention to take measures to quit smoking. It is important to note that these relations, although statistically significant, were relatively weak. This may be partially due to the lack of sensitivity of the one-item measure of extent of agreement with regulating smoking in public places, which may not account for differences in perceptions of regulations locally versus more generally. Further research in this area would benefit from the development of more sensitive measures of agreement with smoke-free air policies or other policy-specific variables that capture the extent to which a smoker recognizes the existence of the policy.</p>
<p>As predicted, the strongest association was between extent of agreement with smoking regulations and perceived normative pressure. This suggests that the success of smoke-free air policies in reducing smoking behavior, as reported in many studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1090198111404702">Bauer et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1090198111404702">Fichtenberg &amp; Glantz, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1090198111404702">Hahn et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1090198111404702">Heloma &amp; Jaakkola, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1090198111404702">Moskowitz, Lin, &amp; Hudes, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1090198111404702">Siegel et al., 2008</xref>), may be attributable to positive perceptions of the policies and subsequent increases in perceived normative pressure to engage in quitting behaviors. Indeed, an evaluation of the California Tobacco Control Program, which used social norm change as its core strategy, found that smokers with more positive attitudes toward secondhand smoke reduction interventions reported more quit attempts and stronger intention to quit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1090198111404702">Zhang, Cowling, &amp; Tang, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Importantly, these findings provide guidance on the development of communication messages to accompany campaigns to pass and implement smoke-free air laws and possibly other tobacco control policies. Building grassroots support for a smoke-free air law among smokers in particular may result in more smokers eventually engaging in quitting behavior. In addition, communication messages focused on how the law reflects community norms against smoking and toward smokers taking measures to quit may be particularly effective in moving smokers toward cessation. Messages similarly focused on social norms, but targeted to youth, may be a useful prevention tool. Evidence from prior research suggests that there are important relationships among smoke-free air policy, social norms about smoking, and youth prevention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1090198111404702">Siegel, Albers, Cheng, Biener, &amp; Rigotti, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1090198111404702">Wakefield &amp; Forster, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition to those previously discussed, there are other limitations of the current study that should be considered. First, this study used a quota sample, so some caution in generalizing the results is warranted. Second, the relatively small sample size and lack of measured variables limited our ability to test for moderating effects in this study. Future studies with larger sample sizes are needed to explore possible moderators of the effect of smoke-free air policies on cessation behavior. Third, our analyses did not include a measure of past quit attempts, which may be an important predictor of intention to take measures to quit smoking. Fourth, because these data were cross-sectional, the direction of effects in our models was assumed and there was no behavioral outcome considered. Finally, these analyses were based on a linear framework, but tobacco control operates in a complex dynamic system. For example, the combined effect of multiple tobacco control policies and pro-tobacco forces (e.g., the industry) operating simultaneously was not considered. As a result, a true control group was not feasible in this study. Individuals who live in a city without a strong smoke-free air law are nonetheless exposed to other antismoking policies and messages (and pro-tobacco messages). This makes isolating the effect of one tobacco control policy challenging.</p>
<p>Despite these limitations, this study provides insight into the mechanism by which smoke-free air laws influence intention to take measures to quit smoking. When analyzed as a background variable within a theory of planned behavior framework, extent of agreement with regulating smoking was significantly associated with psychosocial variables related to smoking cessation. This supports the role of policy-specific variables in promoting behavior change and suggests that building support for tobacco control policy is an important component of a cessation strategy. Moreover, these data suggest that smoke-free air laws may exert their influence more through changes in perceived normative pressure than attitudes or perceived behavioral control related to smoking and quitting. As more policies that restrict smoking are enacted, a better understanding of how they change behavior will result in more effective implementation and communication campaigns to further reduce smoking.</p>
<sec id="section15-1090198111404702">
<title>Implications for Practitioners</title>
<p>There are important implications from this research for public health and tobacco control practitioners involved in the passage and implementation of smoke-free air laws and other policy interventions. First, investing resources to build grassroots support for smoke-free air laws among smokers, in addition to nonsmoking advocates and policy makers, may result in long-term benefits in the form of more smokers making quit attempts or reducing the amount they smoke. Thus, by working to build agreement with smoke-free air policy among a wider segment of the population, there are potential gains in multiple areas. Specifically, passage of the policy, which results in reduced exposure to secondhand smoke, is more likely, and this study’s findings suggest that there may be an additional benefit of reduced smoking. Although further research is needed, this may apply to other tobacco control policy interventions as well.</p>
<p>Second, the finding that smokers’ extent of agreement with regulating smoking influences quitting intentions primarily through perceptions of normative pressure has implications for smoke-free air policy implementation campaigns. Communication messages that emphasize that people who are important to smokers want them to take measures to quit smoking may be more effective in increasing quitting intentions. This could be in the form of media messages featuring physicians encouraging smokers to seek quitting assistance when a policy goes into effect. Prior research has shown that a physician’s advice to quit is an important cessation motivator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1090198111404702">Ockene, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1090198111404702">Stead, Bergson, &amp; Lancaster, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Third, it is noteworthy that attitude was strongly related to intention to take measures to quit smoking in this sample of smokers. This suggests that attitude change strategies may be useful components of smoking cessation intervention campaigns. Indeed, tobacco control programs often include messages designed to change attitudes toward smoking to prevent adolescents from starting to smoke and to influence current smokers to attempt smoking cessation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1090198111404702">National Cancer Institute, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, an important implication of the current study is related to the nonsignificant relations between living in a city with a smoke-free air law and quitting intention and the psychosocial predictors of intention. As previously discussed, this likely reflects the difficulty in evaluating the impact of a policy on the complex behavior change process. More resources are required to conduct the sophisticated longitudinal studies, with all the potentially contributing factors and large sample sizes necessary to accurately measure how behavior changes in response to exposure to policy. It is important that practitioners understand these challenges and communicate them to policy makers eager for evidence that policies are effective in improving health status.</p>
<p>In short, the current study provides additional information for practitioners involved in campaigns to pass and implement smoke-free air laws. Because resources for tobacco control programs are becoming increasingly limited and the decline in smoking prevalence has largely stalled, it is critical that practitioners target their efforts in areas that will be most effective in encouraging smokers to take quitting action.</p>
