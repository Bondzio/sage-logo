<abstract>
<p>This article presents findings from a case study of a socioenvironmental conflict concerning mountaintop removal coal mining (MTR) in Spain. For 15 years, illegal and subsidised MTR has been providing a number of jobs along with significant negative environmental and social impacts in an area protected by European environmental legislation. In 2018, the European Union (EU) will prohibit state coal subsidies and the local population is already deeply divided, and the atmosphere confrontational. Drawing on ethnography, interviews, and document analysis, this article explores the narrative variations—“disease,” “traitor,” “lazy foreigner,” and “salon environmentalist”—characterising environmentalists as scapegoats, and the importance of these social processes for building an ecological resistance movement in a historical coal mining area. The article concludes that, as in related conflicts elsewhere, violence against those criticising MTR practices, as well as a “culture of silence,” have strongly limited the success of the anti-MTR movement.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Laciana Valley. August 2011. Next to the Sosas River, the environmentalist M-15<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1086026612464973">1</xref></sup> camp, “Reclaim the Mountain,” stands amid a field. This camp constitutes a symbolic and material site of resistance to the expansion of illegal mountaintop removal coal mining (MTR) in the valley. Around 250 people from all over Spain gather for 2 weeks to highlight the socio-environmental impacts of MTR along with the mining company’s illegal activities and the lack of political will to close the mines. However, it is not possible to get to the camp. There is a counter-demonstration in favour of MTR blocking the road for anyone aiming to reach the camp. One hundred and sixty people, including the Villablino mayoress, some trade unionists, and MTR workers are blockading the way. With sticks and stones in their hands, they threaten and insult not only the campers but also a small group of local anti-MTR people who are hiding in a house near the camp. These local environmentalists are accused of orchestrating the M-15 activities and the campaign against MTR. The pro-MTR counter-protesters have banners saying, “Laciana is black. Greens go away!” They dare the local “greens” to leave the shelter of the house and to come out to confront them. A police line is protecting the campers and the local environmentalists from the pro-MTR group. The M-15 protestors try to calm the situation down by designating 10 people to mediate but there is no room for dialogue or debate. The counter-demonstrators are not here to deliberate. They yell at the M-15 people. They also insult a local journalist who has been writing about the conflict. She ends up crying and running away. It seems difficult to express opinions openly when it is people from <italic>within</italic> the community—neighbours, family, and acquaintances—who are vilifying anybody who prioritises the mountain ecosystems, rather than the few MTR jobs. After 3 hours, the pro-MTR block begins dispersing. Then, some local environmentalists start crying because of the frustration of repeatedly experiencing this kind of situation: “We are sick and tired of this. It burns us up inside.” says one of the local greens (Personal journal, 2011).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This is a journal entry from my fieldwork in the environmentally protected Laciana Valley, Spain. It depicts an episode of confrontation in the context of a protest camp, where (mainly) local environmentalists<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1086026612464973">2</xref></sup> are violently assaulted by members of their own community.</p>
<p>In many so-called developed countries, the coal extraction industry has experienced significant transformations in the past decades, because of both an increased mechanisation of production processes <italic>and</italic> growing imports of resources from the Global South, where labour is cheap(er) and regulations less strict (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1086026612464973">Bell &amp; York, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1086026612464973">Scott, 2010</xref>). Alongside these economic developments, because of negative socio-environmental impacts of surface mining techniques, such as MTR, social movements rejecting this type of mining have emerged, claiming that protecting the environment is both desirable and vital. Generally, MTR conflicts unfold within a web of social relations and practices intersected simultaneously by social, political, cultural, and ecological dimensions, which, in turn, are shaped by place and scale conditionings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1086026612464973">Scott, 2010</xref>). Typically, as in many other cases, these socio-environmental conflicts also entail confrontations <italic>within</italic> a community, when people hold different views on economic dependency, and environmental and social effects of MTR. In such intra-communal conflicts, environmentalists are often fervently blamed and attacked for undermining local economies by opposing MTR extractive industries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1086026612464973">Scott, 2010</xref>). Inherent to the practices of scapegoating, is the implicit and explicit support for the coal extraction industry, even when there is a steep decline in jobs accruing from it.</p>
<p>In this article, I examine the ways in which scapegoating practices occur to weaken anti-MTR movements, with a focus on how a dominant pro-MTR narrative <italic>against</italic> environmentalists constrains their activism. Thus, I pursue two inter-related questions: What stories are told to justify the scapegoating practices? And how do these practices affect the anti-MTR movement? Using the Laciana case study, I present variations from the dominant narrative used to stereotype, vilify, and discredit anti-MTR movements. Emanating from this narrative is a general fear of speaking out against MTR, and these socio-cultural factors are posing severe challenges to ecological resistance. The dominant narrative casts environmentalists as culprits of the socio-economic decline that the community has already been experiencing for decades. As punishment, they must either be expelled or “converted” into allies of MTR. My findings suggest that the jobs-versus-the-environment myth, a widespread tactic used by business and governments to manipulate public opinion by insisting that people must choose between jobs and environmental quality, and the historically dominant coal-mining identity are crucial factors in understanding attacks on environmentalists and community support for coal extraction industries. Furthermore, silencing criticisms against MTR through sheer physical violence helps maintain coal hegemony in the area.</p>

<title>Anti-MTR Ecological Resistance and the Scapegoat’s Otherness</title>
<p>Anti-MTR movements have emerged in the past three decades in different regions of the world. These movements express growing resistance to ecological destruction, consisting of a conglomerate of stakeholders who are ultimately struggling for changes in local, regional, or national politics, thereby avoiding, transforming, or stopping environmentally controversial (economic or political) actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1086026612464973">Taylor, 1995</xref>). These movements are dynamic, heterogeneous, and fragmented, with a multitude of differentiated meanings, forms of action, and modes of organisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1086026612464973">Melucci, 1996</xref>), mobilising a very wide range of different resources—financial, symbolic, human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1086026612464973">McAdam, Tarrow, &amp; Tilly, 2005</xref>), and knowledge based (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1086026612464973">Jamison, 2003</xref>). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1086026612464973">Melucci (1996)</xref> points out, they propel conflicts beyond the framework within which they unfold. Moreover, during the process of struggle, the stakeholders’ interaction constantly modifies the rules of the game. Indeed, opponents and proponents to MTR do not just restrict themselves to express a conservancy dispute but they are in constant interaction with and adaptation to the socio-political context and the antagonistic stakeholders’ actions, articulating complex aspects of the conflict, such as economic identities, habitus, gender formations, and human–nature relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1086026612464973">Scott, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Some scholars have indirectly explored the challenges anti-MTR movements face by examining why some communities continue to support extractive industries (such as coal) despite the declining benefits and negative socio-environmental impacts of these industries. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1086026612464973">Scott (2010)</xref> explores some of the key cultural processes surrounding MTR, examining in particular, how race, gender, and class intersect to make Appalachia a region where people and the environment are exploited for the sake of the “national interest.” Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1086026612464973">Bell and York’s (2010)</xref> study of community economic identity in West Virginia reveals how the coal industry, which faces a legitimation crisis because of declining coal-mining jobs, has increased efforts to maintain its influence on local communities by engaging in cultural manipulation. Thus, these industries aim to ensure that the community economic identity is re-constructed and remains rooted to the anachronistic vision of the coal industry, which is presented as both the only source of employment and the only cultural definition of the region. The importance of identity is also recognised by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1086026612464973">Bell and Braun (2010)</xref>, who argue that the hegemonic masculinity in Central Appalachian coal fields as well as the coal industry’s role in maintaining the gender order is shaping and constraining anti-MTR activism.</p>
<p>Most discourses of identity are constructed on a projection of an “other” who is not “us,” which is precisely the division of the Laciana community and other communities in environmental conflicts. Despite a multiplicity of “others” that can range from invader-aliens to welcome-others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1086026612464973">Kearney, 2003</xref>), and even despite the fact that, in a way, the “other,” the stranger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1086026612464973">Simmel, 1971</xref>), lives also within ourselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1086026612464973">Kristeva, 1991</xref>), prejudices against an impure and threatening “other” have historically triggered conflicts everywhere. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1086026612464973">Douglas (1973)</xref> points out, rituals of purity and impurity create unity of experience. The dream of purity—in this context having a community whose economy is unproblematically based on MTR, and also fuelled by corporate interests—aspires to construct a definitive natural order, eliminating anything that introduces or sustains a threat to our securities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1086026612464973">Douglas, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1086026612464973">Zubero, 2012</xref>). The “other” as an invader, an alien or a stranger is anyone or anything that—in an extreme, absolute manner—does not fit into our cognitive, moral, or aesthetic universe. There is a dividing line, as it were, defined by support or opposition to MTR, which determines who are the included (“us”) and the excluded (“them”). Social violence, thus, emerges as a response to a transgression or a threat to “identity frontiers.” Paradoxically, however, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1086026612464973">Zubero (2012)</xref> notes, <italic>proximity</italic> rather than anonymity incites the worst deeds. In fact, far from inhibiting violence, proximity intensifies the “neighbourly spirit” of cruelty and scapegoating.</p>
<p>A theoretical understanding of scapegoating has developed over the past 40 years, led by French cultural anthropologist Rene Girard, who has offered an alternative explanation of the motivation for prejudice, based on frustration/aggression theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1086026612464973">Adorno, Frenkel-Brunswik, Levinson, &amp; Sanford, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1086026612464973">Allport, 1958</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1086026612464973">Lindzey, 1950</xref>). This work is helpful in understanding psychosocial processes at play in the conflict of Laciana. Girard argues that scapegoating is an innate, archetypal, and aggressive mechanism to generate consensus and social order, found at the core of the creation of culture and religion along with mimetic desire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1086026612464973">Burkert, Girard, &amp; Smith, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1086026612464973">Girard, 1999</xref>). He claims that to survive the war of all against all, societies originally needed a way of limiting violence. Scapegoating is a way of dealing with violence—through violence itself—by channeling a society’s repressed frustration, anger, rage, and aggression on towards one or more victims—the scapegoat(s). Within this process, the scapegoat takes on great symbolic significance, as a ritualistic, collective understanding of the scapegoat is constructed. First prejudice, then violence, is thrust on the scapegoat victim under the cloak of blind righteousness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1086026612464973">Girard, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1086026612464973">Redekop, 1998</xref>). The scapegoat and the context of victimisation, in the literature, feature four distinctive features, which are suggestive aspects for understanding the MTR conflict: (a) the scapegoat emerges at a time of crisis when the uniqueness and viability of a community is questioned; (b) the scapegoat commits a “crime,” which threatens hierarchical distinctions; (c) the perpetrators of these “crimes” possess characteristics that identify a victim; and (d) there is violence. The result of this process, if successful, is the (re)creation of order and social cohesion, which is very similar to hygienic/purification rituals, where “filth” is stigmatised and removed to re-order the environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1086026612464973">Douglas, 1973</xref>).</p>
<p>Seemingly endless examples of scapegoating can be found throughout history and geography. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1086026612464973">Girard (1999)</xref> illustrated how Jews and the so-called “witches” were scapegoated in medieval Europe. We also know that scapegoating frequently happens within families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1086026612464973">Vogel &amp; Bell, 1960</xref>), schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1086026612464973">Nairn &amp; Panelli, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1086026612464973">Norman &amp; Connolly, 2011</xref>), ethnic/religious/nationalist conflicts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1086026612464973">Bilewicz &amp; Psychology, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1086026612464973">Doubt, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1086026612464973">Redekop, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1086026612464973">Roy, 2009</xref>), penal policies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1086026612464973">Welch, 2006</xref>), antiterrorist policies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1086026612464973">Gorringe, 2002</xref>), or patients of sexually transmitted diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1086026612464973">Gilmore &amp; Somerville, 1994</xref>). Indeed, scapegoating is not restricted to the realm of human groups: places (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1086026612464973">Brown &amp; Stivers, 1998</xref>), pets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1086026612464973">Carlisle-Frank, Frank, &amp; Lindsey, 2004</xref>), and endangered animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1086026612464973">Mazza, 1990</xref>) can also be targets.</p>
<p>It is not my aim, however, to discuss Girard’s theory, but to take it as a point of departure for examining the dynamics at play in the acts of stereotyping, vilifying, and discrediting “ecological resistance” in communities with internal conflicts over resource extraction. As various authors have shown, relatedly, communities commonly have multiple narratives of development, consisting of a widely used dominant narrative against which other narratives compete (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1086026612464973">Alkon, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1086026612464973">Starkey &amp; Crane, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1086026612464973">Welcomer, 2010</xref>). Communities are, indeed, heterogeneous human associations, which most commonly harbour different positions—often antagonistic ones—when dealing with challenging issues. This is precisely the case of Laciana, a rural mountain community bitterly divided on the issues of illegal MTR and its impacts, where local environmentalists have, as reported by the regional press (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1086026612464973">Araujo, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1086026612464973">De la Villa, 2012</xref>), been attacked repeatedly.</p>

<title>The Story of the Conflict</title>
<p>The Laciana Valley (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1086026612464973">Figure 1</xref>) is a mountainous region reaching altitudes of more than 2,000 meters, covering an area of 21,700 hectares in the Northeast of the province of León, Spain. The area contains habitats of great ecological value<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1086026612464973">3</xref></sup> and is protected under European environmental legislation through the Habitats Directive and the Natura 2000 Network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1086026612464973">European Commission, 1992</xref>). It is also a Place of Community Importance, has been catalogued by the EU as a place of unique importance for the conservation of endangered avifauna (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1086026612464973">European Commission, 2010</xref>), and was recognised as Biosphere Reserve in 2003. Since 1918, until recently, industrial coal extraction has been the main economic driver, attracting thousands of new residents and gradually replacing traditional cattle and subsistence farming.</p>

</fig>
<p>In the past two decades, Laciana has fallen into severe socio-economic decline, with a population reduction of 27.5% since 1999, to 10,660 inhabitants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1086026612464973">Instituto Nacional de Estadística, 2009</xref>). In largely the same period, coal mining has been gradually, but substantially reduced, partially driven by EU liberalization measures of the energy market that reduce State intervention in the extraction of coal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1086026612464973">European Commission, 1993</xref>). Since 1990, coal production has shrunk 67% in Spain<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1086026612464973">4</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1086026612464973">Senate, 2012</xref>). Surface mining in Spain began in the 1970s, but it was not until 1985 that MTR, much less labour-intensive, started replacing underground mining on Laciana’s private land. From 1994 until now, contrasting with MTR cases in West Virginia, where most of the land is owned by absentee land companies that lease the land to coal companies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1086026612464973">Bell &amp; York, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1086026612464973">Rasmussen, 1994</xref>), in Laciana, MTR has taken place on public land and has become the main technique by which coal is extracted, with significant socio-economic and environmental consequences. Because of the restructuring plans and the increasing mechanisation of the sector, coal mining jobs dropped from 3,850 in 1984 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1086026612464973">Rodríguez, 1984</xref>) to approximately 300 in 2009 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1086026612464973">De la Villa, 2009</xref>) and continues to fall.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1086026612464973">5</xref></sup> While a comprehensive review of the environmental impacts of MTR is beyond the scope of this article, a few include flooding, fragmentation, reduction, and elimination of vegetation and forests, pollution of air, soil and rivers, noise, and destruction of springs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1086026612464973">Burns, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1086026612464973">Palmer et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1086026612464973">Redondo, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1086026612464973">Younger 2004</xref>). In Laciana specifically, contamination from waste dumping has dramatically upset the ecosystemic balance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1086026612464973">De Luis et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1086026612464973">Naves, Wiegand, Revilla, &amp; Delibes, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>The existing MTR mines, nevertheless, have been active for more than 15 years without the legally required permits. At the same time, these illegal activities have, curiously, been intensively subsidised by the Spanish government and indirectly by the EU.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1086026612464973">6</xref></sup> As a result of the illegalities, the biggest private mining company in Spain, Coto Minero del Cantábrico, was brought before a Spanish court by individuals and local environmental groups. In 2006, it received the highest environmental fine in the country’s history (approx. €170 million) and was ordered to stop activities by the regional Administrative Court (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1086026612464973">Méndez, 2006</xref>). In November 2011, the European Court of Justice also recognised the environmental crimes in Laciana (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1086026612464973">Court of Justice of the European Union, 2011</xref>). Disregarding the legal verdict, the fine remaining unpaid, the company continues MTR activities and plans expansion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1086026612464973">Junta de Castilla y León, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The local population is highly polarised with regard to the continued existence of MTR and the future of the valley. On the one hand, the Town Council, the regional government, the trade unions, and parts of the local population support MTR and urge the company to expand and create more jobs. On the other, a heterogeneous ecological resistance movement has emerging<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1086026612464973">7</xref></sup> addressing the destruction of natural resources and the residents’ future.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1086026612464973">8</xref></sup> The movement, which has multi-scalar expressions, demands a different future, based on economic activities that are compatible with the environment. It is made up of groups and individuals of diverse age, gender, educational level, place of residence, and economic status: Small cattle farmers, shopkeepers, tertiary industry workers, retirees, housewives, environmental technicians, both former and active underground miners, students, freelance entrepreneurs, MEPs, and more recently also participants of the M-15 movement. Additionally, a large portion of the valley’s population remains silent about the conflict, some of which might agree with the environmentalists.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>To examine the scapegoating practices and the effects on the anti-MTR movement in the Laciana Valley, I collected data during 5 years of intermittent fieldwork (2008-2012), using a variety of methods:</p>
<list id="list1-1086026612464973" list-type="order">
<list-item><p><italic>Participant observation.</italic> Intermittently, I spent 5 months doing participant observation. My field notes documented various activities of environmentalists (meetings, parties, press conferences, radio programs, and different actions), a traditional village-based administrative meeting (<italic>Concejo</italic>), and five particular episodes of community frictions. Additionally, for 12 months, while away from Laciana, I observed and participated <italic>virtually</italic>, using social networking technologies such as N-1, Facebook, and local websites, performing an “ethnography of the internet” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1086026612464973">Gobo &amp; Diotti, 2008</xref>). Accessing various online public forums (“Reclaim the beach, reclaim the mountain” <italic>Facebook group</italic>, “Protect Laciana from the outraged” <italic>Facebook group</italic>, “No to MTR in Laciana and Babia” <italic>Facebook group</italic>, “Outraged, go away!” <italic>Facebook group</italic>; and “Reclaim the mountain” <italic>N-1 group</italic>) has allowed me to follow ongoing debates, document the opinions of local inhabitants about certain events, and to observe the dynamics of everyday life of the people in the Valley and within the M-15 movement.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Semi-structured interviews.</italic> Between March 2007 and August 2011, I conducted 45 individual and group semi-structured audio-recorded interviews. The interviews focused on stakeholders’ stories about the tensions between MTR activities and efforts to preserve the mountains. The interview sample included 20 local environmentalists from 2 environmental groups and the local Green party (8 of who were former underground miners); 2 local trade union spokespersons; the Mayoress and 2 former Mayors; and 20 additional local residents, including MTR workers, underground miners, owners of rural tourist hostels, cattle farmers, hunters, fishermen, ski trainers, and a women’s charitable group. The mining company declined to be interviewed. The interviewees’ names have been anonymised.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Written materials (press and documents).</italic> These data included 200 press articles from both Spanish national (<italic>El Pais, Publico</italic>) and regional press (<italic>Diario de León, La Crónica de León, La Nueva España</italic>). From these articles, I identified key stakeholders and reconstructed the evolution of the conflict. Other data accessed include public records and censuses, government rulings and regulations, and European Parliament questions to the European Commission.</p></list-item>

<title>Scapegoating Practices and Narrative Variations of Environmentalist Persecution</title>
<p>As described above, the ecological resistance movement is strongly vilified by its opponents. Despite the growing national and international recognition of the environmental crimes in the area, given the few current jobs and the European Commission announcement to progressively phase out State aid to coal by 2018 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1086026612464973">Euractiv, 2010</xref>), few people dare to express negative opinions of mining. Indeed, scapegoating happens when there is a public expression against MTR. Members of environmental groups, especially at the local level, are common targets of diverse scapegoating practices, such as threats; insults; having their houses, businesses, and vehicles defaced (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1086026612464973">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1086026612464973">3</xref>); having their animals fed with food containing needles; having their trees felled; physical and verbal aggression; attempted arson of houses and barns; social isolation; having their meetings and political activities boycotted; intimidatory visits, and coercion, as several of my interviews and observations revealed. The following images illustrate the defacing of houses, businesses, and vehicles belonging to environmentalists, which were targeted following the closure—by order of a court—of an illegal MTR mine situated in a critical area for capercaillie reproduction.</p>

</fig>
<p>These practices of scapegoating are embedded in a <italic>dominant productivist narrative</italic>, which tells a story in which environmentalists want to ruin the future of the valley by stopping MTR, leaving workers unemployed. Narratives are here understood as stories people tell to themselves in order to understand the world in which they live. They are intricately linked to cultural norms, values, and social class positions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1086026612464973">Bocking, 2006</xref>), and convey deeper assumptions about progress, reveal rhetorical strategies for distinctive paths, or establish boundaries around specific understandings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1086026612464973">Macaraig &amp; Sandberg, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1086026612464973">Walton, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Different figures—or portraits—of the environmentalists are used in the performance of scapegoating in Laciana. The dominant narrative presents four non-exclusive, or overlapping narrative variations: “disease,” “treachery,” “lazy foreignness,” and “salon environmentalism.” <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1086026612464973">Table 1</xref> outlines these narrative variations, their implicit intended effect, the type of behaviour by which they manifest, as well as the type of environmentalism targeted and its scale.</p>

<title>The Environmentalist as a Disease</title>
<p>In this narrative variation, environmentalism is conceived as a dysfunction, as an alteration of a healthy ontological state in which MTR is not questioned. From the perspective of this narrative variation, a pathological condition—a disease of the social system—is jeopardising Laciana’s future. The environmentalists are considered social deviants and seen as a social group that does not perform appropriately in the valley. This narrative variation is especially expressed in episodes of direct confrontation between anti-MTR and pro-MTR groups. Furthermore, the description of environmentalists as a disease invokes to two clinical metaphors. The first describes environmentalists as “malicious tumors,” that is carcinogenic elements of the community that should be removed (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1086026612464973">Figure 4</xref>). The second refers to them as other potentially life-threatening infectious and contagious diseases—as plagues or pests—which have to be controlled, fought, and eradicated. The following excerpts from my field notes illustrate two situations of public persecution of environmentalists and attest to the desirability of their eradication:
<disp-quote>
<p>The counter-demonstration of trade unionists and MTR workers were passing next to Isabel’s house on their way home. A group of five people stopped in front of her house. One of them, addressing the rest of the group, started yelling and pointing at Isabel’s house and her family: “The [<italic>environmentalist</italic>] nest is here! Here! Their houses should be burned! They should be eradicated!” (Personal journal, 2011)</p>
<p>Yesterday evening, three hooded men visited Santiago’s house and threw a fire bomb at his barn, which luckily didn’t catch fire. Santiago heard the dogs barking and went out. The hooded men saw him, pushed him to the floor and beat him up, before running away, insulting and threatening him: “Green son of a bitch. We are going to kill you!” (Personal journal, 2012)</p>
</disp-quote></p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1086026612464973-fig4.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>Additionally, around the valley there are visual messages, comparing the Laciana environmentalists to cancer, as can be seen in the graffiti on the wall of the illegal coal-washing plant (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1086026612464973">Figure 4</xref>).</p>
<p>The narrative variation of the environmentalist as a disease is associated with a panoply of violence: from insults, threats, or social exclusion to aggressions and physical violence. The implicit intended effect of this narrative variant is to annihilate environmentalists. This “eradication,” of course, could be achieved by forcing them to leave their homes or to remain silent on the MTR controversy. If that happened, the valley’s community would be considered to be purified and “healthy” again, an effect that has been commonly reported in studies of scapegoating practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1086026612464973">Gilmore &amp; Somerville, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1086026612464973">Girard, 1999</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1086026612464973">
<title>The Environmentalist as a Traitor</title>
<p>The second variation refers to the coal mining-related past of many people who belong to the local, ecological resistance. Many of them are former underground miners, pre-retired with the restructuring plans of the sector, or retired due to mining-related illnesses. From the pro-MTR point of view, these people are traitors to the mining company, to the valley’s community, to their past, and to their miner identity. Following a protest video uploaded to the Internet in which a local environmentalist explained the multiple impacts of MTR in the area,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1086026612464973">9</xref></sup> several comments on Facebook groups exemplify the spread of the narrative of the “environmentalists as traitors”:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>A:</speaker>
<p>It is shameful that characters like the one in the video, who have lived from coal all their lives, are now against it.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>P:</speaker>
<p>I am wordless to see someone who has lived on mining, whose ancestors likely were miners, too, and now this man is making such a video. Unbelievable!!</p>
</speech>
<p>The regional news (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1086026612464973">Araujo, 2012</xref>) also reports the MTR workers’ opinion about the local environmentalists, and also former underground miners, who brought a case of illegal MTR before the Court:
<disp-quote>
<p>Some time ago they [<italic>the former miners turned environmentalists</italic>] agreed [on <italic>the dismantling of underground mining</italic>] and they benefited from pre-retirement plans. Now that their future is assured, they don’t care if other people lose their jobs.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Despite being an area with a strong history of class struggle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1086026612464973">Martínez-Celada, 2002</xref>), it appears that MTR proponents feel they owe something to the mining company and that they cannot understand how people who used to work in and make a living from mining can turn their back on it. Thus, any complaint about the company’s controversial activities is also perceived as an attack on its workers and on mining history. This perception increases if it is a former miner who complains, and it is magnified if he mentions the socio-environmental affects the valley is experiencing. Thereby, the former miner turned environmentalist is perceived as a selfish renegade, a traitor to his own kind, who deserves to be expelled from the community or converted and silenced back into the promising future of MTR. The violence associated with this variation, like the former, also covers a range of intensities.</p>

<sec id="section8-1086026612464973">
<title>The Environmentalist as a Lazy Foreigner</title>
<p>This narrative variation emerged when 250 people across Spain decided to camp in Laciana to support the community’s environmentalists, while protesting against the pro-coal energy policy of the Spanish government. The narrative variation consists of discrediting some of the grassroots environmental activists on the basis of being outsiders to the local conflict, for being mostly unemployed, and for being able to organise protest camps for several weeks without going to work. The following dialogue is from the <italic>Protect Laciana from the outraged</italic> Facebook group, 2 weeks before the camp took place:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>P:</speaker>
<p>They are saying on Twitter they are coming to propose alternatives to MTR. Oh, my god! We have to get rid of them quickly.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>L:</speaker>
<p>They are coming to make this valley shameful. Alternatives? Bullshit! They can keep them where they come from. Why do these outsiders have to come here to tell us what to do? ( . . . ) They are just a bunch of lazy people. Who can afford to leave their jobs for such a long time? Maybe they don’t even have a job . . . and they are not doing anything to get one.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>R:</speaker>
<p>I propose to wait for them in Sosas [<italic>a village</italic>]. We can “welcome” them with a big mob.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>O:</speaker>
<p>We must all remain together when facing them. We have to kick them out by any means possible. We cannot allow these meddlers coming here to protest against what is feeding us.</p>
</speech>
<p>The mere presence of environmental activists, it seems, is perceived as a threat. Even proposals for alternative socio-economic activities are seen as a threat. Workers’ terror of losing their jobs is the most common motive promoting attacks. It is also central to claims against the environmentalists. In this narrative variation, as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1086026612464973">Girard (1999)</xref> and also found in accounts of the anti-MTR movement in Appalachia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1086026612464973">Scott, 2010</xref>), the target of scapegoat practices are outsiders or foreigners—who know nothing about the place—and nobody knows anything about them—and who are also accused of fuelling the crisis the Valley is experiencing. Their portrayals of environmentalists are as jobless, lazy people, incomprehensibly obsessed with nature, who do not care about the place and its history, mining workers or their families. The implicit intended effect is to send these foreigners away from the valley. Violence associated with this narrative variation, however, unlike the previous ones, is less physical, as it is limited to insults, threats, and a few thwarted attempts of physical attacks.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1086026612464973">
<title>Salon Environmentalist</title>
<p>The concept of “salon environmentalist” (cf. “champagne socialist”) is used with contempt to mock and de-legitimise outsider, middle-class urbanites, who criticise MTR. It is leveled at MEPs and independent Spanish and international professionals (journalists, academics, etc.) who have publicly argued against MTR in Laciana. The following quote from the <italic>No to MTR in Laciana and Babia</italic> Facebook group, which is addressed to an academic who condemned MTR, illustrates this narrative variation:
<disp-quote>
<p>You can be a 100%, a 50%, a 20% environmentalist or you can be a salon environmentalist. ( . . . ) It is easy to say NO [<italic>to MTR</italic>] from your city salon, but come to this valley and tell us what we eat if we do not extract the Earth’s natural resources.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This type of environmentalists are perceived as <italic>false</italic> because they are considered to be alien to the reality of the valley and do not know what living in nature and generating stable jobs in a rural area “really” means. By insisting on their ignorance of the valley reality, the claims of this type of environmentalists are, in effect, easily disqualified and consequently the portrait of the city intellectual is created. These types of environmentalists are also considered arrogant and socially privileged for protesting against the faraway realities of MTR, its workers, and their families from their comfortable armchairs and salons. Accordingly, they are considered to be harming working-class people, mining activity and the future of the valley itself. In contrast to the expression of the previous narratives, however, attacks on “salon environmentalists” are limited to insults and mockery, that is, they are non-physical.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1086026612464973">
<title>“Crimes” of Environmentalists</title>
<p>The findings of the present study reveal different narrative variations according to different environmentalist profiles (local, local and former miner, outsider activist, outsider professional). These variations add both nuances and specificity to the dominant narrative and are used in combination to at once act out <italic>and</italic> to justify oppression and violence against and punishment of environmentalists. Certainly, scapegoat victims are always those who are different, whether ethnically, culturally, or physically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1086026612464973">Burkert et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1086026612464973">Girard, 1999</xref>). In Laciana Valley, ironically also known as the “Valley of Freedom”, the scapegoats are those who express certain aspects of an ecological, political ideology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1086026612464973">Dobson, 2000</xref>) and struggle to put an end to MTR. They are, by part of the community, judged and punished for behaving contrary to what is conducive for the preservation of the valley’s distinctive culture.</p>
<p>Likewise, these scapegoating practices are related to perceived “crimes” committed by environmentalists. Thus, in the aforementioned context of Laciana’s socio-economic decline, the perceived “crime” seems, at least, two-fold. On the one hand, it consists of jeopardizing MTR jobs through lawsuits and publicly denouncing both the illegal activities and the environmental impacts of MTR. Indeed, the well-rehearsed dichotomy of jobs versus environment and its expression through job blackmailing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1086026612464973">Kazis &amp; Grossman, 1982</xref>) is fervently used to dismiss any dissenting voices against the illegal MTR activity and to justify violence against environmentalists, as has also been reported from the Appalachian region in the United States. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1086026612464973">Bell &amp; York, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1086026612464973">Scott, 2010</xref>). Hence, the claims of environmentalists and the aim of building an anti-MTR movement are perceived as a threat to MTR, the local economy, and the livelihoods of residents.</p>
<p>The phenomenon of scapegoating in Laciana is similar to a conflict in old-growth forests in the Pacific Northwest coast of the United States. There, the loggers were terrified of losing their jobs because of the protection of the endangered spotted owl (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1086026612464973">Mazza, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1086026612464973">Satterfield, 2002</xref>). In a context of intensive industry propaganda and historically strong connections between timber industry, regional banks, media and manufacturers, the spotted owl, considered by environmentalists as an indicator of ecosystemic health, was portrayed as a “dirty bird,” and blamed for the loss of jobs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1086026612464973">Mazza, 1990</xref>). Like the spotted owl, the environmentalists in Laciana are criminalised for the coal-mining industry’s decline. Unlike the conflict of the old-growth forest and other accounts of environmentalists neglecting the importance of labour—that is, where largely middle-class urban environmental movements failed to reach out to working class people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1086026612464973">White, 1996</xref>)—Laciana’s environmental groups are primarily working-class environmental groups. Notably, this movement acts in coalition with middle-class environmental urban movements, as has happened in other accounts of socio-environmental conflicts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1086026612464973">Tsing, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1086026612464973">Scott, 2010</xref>). In fact, their claims have certain similarities with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1086026612464973">Martinez-Alier’s (2002)</xref> account of <italic>Environmentalism of the Poor</italic> in the sense that environmentalists call for the protection of the natural resources of the valley as a way to ensure the future survival of its population. Despite environmentalists’ attempts to link an alternative socio-economic development to the protection of nature, the juxtaposition of jobs and the environment is a major trigger of <italic>and</italic> justification for scapegoating practices.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the second perceived “crime” of the environmentalists is their attempt to redefine the identity of the region and themselves away from coal and towards more environmentally friendly activities. This aspect represents a taboo for the mining culture and fuels an identity crisis. It implies not only major changes to Laciana’s socio-economic structure but also a profound shift in the underlying reality and people’s conception of themselves, all of which have been defined by coal for a century. Thus, the intention of shifting the valley’s identity, a taboo conceived as a threat to a traditional identity, emerges as a fundamental element shaping the conflict, similar to the phenomena identified by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1086026612464973">Satterfield (2002)</xref> in the aforementioned socio-environmental logging conflict or to MTR conflicts in Appalachia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1086026612464973">Bell &amp; York, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1086026612464973">Fox, 1999</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1086026612464973">Scott, 2010</xref>). Indeed, attention to the taboos of a culture is important to understanding scapegoat mechanisms since it is often the taboos that determine the gravity of what is interpreted as a “crime” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1086026612464973">Redekop, 1998</xref>). Thus, these two perceived “crimes”—rendering people unemployed and attempting to redefine the “community economic identity” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1086026612464973">Bell &amp; York 2010</xref>) away from coal, foster the fear of the symbolic and real death of coal mining in the area, which, in turn, promotes violence against those people who propose different futures for the valley.</p>

<sec id="section11-1086026612464973">
<title>Neutralising Ecological Resistance Through the Promotion of Silence</title>
<p>Scapegoating practices and their perpetrators are reproducing and validating the position of power within this socio-environmental conflict. This position, characterised by a productivist vision, is promoting fear among the locals and encouraging what Paulo Freire calls a “culture of silence” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1086026612464973">Freire, 1985</xref>). Certainly, the consequences of scapegoating are not always an increase in hatred or prejudice against those scapegoated, as Brown and Stivers (1988) point out. Especially in antagonistic socio-environmental conflicts, major implications of scapegoating are the spread of fear of speaking against MTR among the local population, preventing most of the residents from joining the environmentalist groups (or even be seen with environmentalists) and thus partially isolating and dismantling the resistance. Who would like to join (or remain in) a minority group, which is continuously under the threat of violence? Indeed, affliction, rage, and hopelessness can be traced in the words of Jana, a young mother and a local environmentalist, when describing episodes of community violence and when thinking about leaving the Valley:
<disp-quote>
<p>The situation is fucked up. This is like the Spanish civil war, in which people run into the forest not because of the fascists, but because of their own neighbours. This week, Rafa was verbally abused in his job. My uncle, the fish seller, was almost beaten up. Emilio had three dogs poisoned, and today my father was in a tight spot with some cocky MTR workers. To me, the toughest thing is how people look at you, even if they do not say anything. Actually most people do not say a word. They do not want to be exposed and avoid being seen with us. It makes me sad that I enter a place and people immediately leave, or that old friends are not longer talking to me. [ . . . ] Lately I barely go out anymore. It really upsets me that people do not look at me or treat me as I was evil. We only think differently. We do not deserve this. [ . . . ] A few days ago, I was talking to my dad about leaving. All this is very tiring and in the end they are going to destroy everything anyway.</p>

<p>Laciana’s conflict is not only about a powerful company oppressing a local united community, as seen in many socio-environmental conflicts accounts (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1086026612464973">Gaventa, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1086026612464973">Gould, Schnaiberg, &amp; Weinberg, 1996</xref>), but it also illustrates a case of a divided community in which certain residents oppress their neighbours in daily interaction, actively (through violence) and passively (through silence). Indeed, in situations of conflict and oppression, the powerful players try to prevent any real participation of the powerless, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1086026612464973">Gaventa (1982)</xref> points out. The “culture of silence” spread by these scapegoating practices has been identified in other coal-mining conflicts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1086026612464973">Bell &amp; Braun, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1086026612464973">Bell &amp; York, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1086026612464973">Gaventa, 1982</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1086026612464973">Bell and Braun (2010)</xref>, for instance, also identify this “culture of silence,” especially in Appalachian men, discouraging them from participating in anti-MTR activism, for fear of losing status within the community. In Laciana, the historical–cultural configuration of a culture of silence validates scapegoating through an attitude of dependence and servitude to the dominant narrative and the practices that accompany them. This culture of silence is sustained by a set of alienation practices linked with the limited public denouncement of the illegal MTR practices and the lack of public positioning on the attacks received by the environmentalists. Nobody seems to see, nobody seems to hear, and nobody speaks. Thus, this culture of silence further contributes to the isolation of local environmentalists, as silence also grants implicit consent, legitimising scapegoating, and preventing more people from taking on critical stances.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>This article contributed to answering the question addressed elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1086026612464973">Bell &amp; York, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1086026612464973">Scott, 2010</xref>) about why people support environmentally damaging industries that increasingly provided fewer jobs, by showing how ideological and physical violence articulate with each other, thus shaping and constraining the emergence of ecological resistance movements.</p>
<p>I documented Laciana’s conflict and illustrated the symbolic mechanisms used to stereotype and criminalise ecological resistance movements. I explored four narrative variations—disease, traitor, lazy foreigner, and salon environmentalist—that combine to construct a picture of environmentalists as destroying the future of a traditional coal-mining valley. Each variant is a stereotypical portrait of a different environmentalist profile and justifies practices of social exclusion and violence against a minority addressing environmental injustices. These practices are perceived as rightful and legitimate as they are understood to be protecting both workers and an <italic>historical</italic> coal-mining culture. However, they also fracture local ecological resistance, while promoting a culture of silence within the local population, implicitly allowing the continuation of those practices.</p>
<p>As conflicts imply some degree of stakeholder interactions, this article also raised some questions, regarding the responses of environmentalists to violence and punishment. In Laciana, as well as in many other contexts of environmental struggle, activists are responding in different ways to these practices of prosecution and scapegoating. An important implication for future research, therefore, is the need to look more closely at the discourses, strategies, and tactics of contestation developed by environmentalists in order to challenge the violence with which they are met. Tracking these responses across different contexts could be potentially useful to understand change, creativity, and adaptation within the ecological resistance movements.</p>
