<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The main thesis we want to defend in this article is that learning <italic>about</italic> nationalism from a historical, sociological, and normative point of view constitutes one important, but rather neglected, dimension of a good citizenship education. The issue is important because, although the debate about nationalism and education has received considerable attention from political and educational philosophers in recent years, the dispute has mainly focused on the question of whether public schools can legitimately promote nationalist sentiments – patriotism – in young people. Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1746197913483657">Alasdair MacIntyre’s (1984)</xref> seminal paper on the topic, proponents of patriotic education, most notably <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1746197913483657">Eamonn Callan (1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1746197913483657">1997</xref>) argue that if patriotism is understood as a civic virtue, for instance, because it provides the motivational basis for citizens to make sacrifices for each other and is thus instrumental for distributive justice, then this constitutes a powerful reason to count promoting patriotism among the legitimate aims of liberal–democratic education. By contrast, opponents of patriotic education, such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1746197913483657">Harry Brighouse (1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1746197913483657">2003</xref>), counter that the mere possibility of identifying virtuous species of patriotism is not in itself sufficient to justify its promotion in public schools since, in practice, the dominant and operative understanding of patriotism may undermine rather than promote justice. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1746197913483657">Brighouse (2003)</xref> puts it, ‘in many actual liberal countries, even those with relatively inoffensive national identities, patriotism all too often cuts against justice’ (p. 163).</p>
<p>The current debate about patriotism and education is ongoing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1746197913483657">Callan, 2005a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1746197913483657">Hand, 2011</xref>). However, in this article, we wish to shift the focus away from the question of promoting patriotism and toward the question of the role that teaching <italic>about</italic> the phenomenon of nationalism and about specific nationalist movements can play in reinforcing liberal and democratic civic values and principles such as mutual respect. We argue that such teaching can indeed play an important role and that this is true regardless of whether one views patriotism as a civic virtue or not and regardless of whether the aim of promoting patriotism in schools is legitimate or not.</p>
<p>This article is divided into the following sections. In section titled ‘The need to distinguish legitimate and illegitimate forms of nationalism’, we outline what we take to be the basic argument in favor of teaching about nationalism in public schools for civic purposes. The argument is simply that young citizens should learn how to carefully and thoughtfully distinguish between <italic>legitimate</italic> and <italic>illegitimate</italic> forms of nationalism and that teaching about nationalist movements contributes significantly to the promotion of that aim.</p>
<p>In section ‘Teaching about nationalism and the goals of citizenship education’, we develop three specific, significant implications of this general argument. First, teaching about nationalism fosters the capacity to reflect critically on the assimilationist threats that nations pose toward minority groups and to evaluate questions of reparative justice; second, it enables students to critically evaluate demands for recognition and political autonomy; third and finally, it provides an important basis for civic respect.</p>
<p>In the final two sections, we address a number of potential objections to our arguments in favor of teaching about nationalism in school. In section ‘Will educating about nationalism reinforce illiberal patriotism?’, we address objections that may seem to undermine our claim that schools are an appropriate venue for teaching about nationalism. In section ‘Is it necessary to teach about nationalism?’, we respond to objections that suggest that the principles of liberal–democratic citizenship can be adequately promoted by other means than teaching about nationalism.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1746197913483657">
<title>The need to distinguish legitimate and illegitimate forms of nationalism</title>
<p>Before presenting our main argument, let us first specify what we mean by a ‘legitimate form of nationalism’. In order to focus our discussion in this article, we assume without argument that ‘no set of social arrangements could be just or legitimate unless it was liberal and democratic’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1746197913483657">Brighouse, 2003</xref>: 160), and so no polity or political movement that is incompatible with the most fundamental liberal principles of justice could be legitimate. Therefore, we understand the idea of ‘legitimate’ nationalist claims as claims that are consistent with or derivative from ‘liberal’ principles of justice, that is, essentially, the basic liberty and equality of all citizens.</p>
<p>Our argument in this section starts with two basic observations about the phenomenon of nationalism. The first is that nationalism has a very wide psychological appeal—indeed, some commentators argue that ‘the appeal of nationalism is almost universal’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1746197913483657">Glover, 2000</xref>). This does not mean that nationalism is always ethically benign, however. In fact, and this is our second basic observation, both nationalist sentiments and nationalist movements and claims can take very nasty, violent, and discriminatory illiberal forms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1746197913483657">Goodin, 1997</xref>). We argue that, therefore, a good liberal civic education, which should aim at promoting liberal values and political stability, needs to address the ethical complexity of nationalism. More specifically, we argue that the capacities of citizens to critically evaluate the ‘legitimacy’ of political movements or claims, and more generally to be able to carefully distinguish between legitimate and illegitimate forms of nationalism, is a very important element of good citizenship in a liberal society and one with respect to which the teaching about nationalism is uniquely well suited to address. In other words, our basic argument here is that learning about the phenomenon of nationalism from a historical, sociological, and normative point of view is important for developing the capacity to distinguish between legitimate and illegitimate nationalisms: a capacity that, in turn, serves political stability and liberal justice.</p>
<p>There are at least three main reasons for which the last claim is true. First, citizens need to be capable of identifying the legitimate grounds upon which minority national movements may demand special treatment from the federal state and to evaluate different proposals for how the state may recognize nationalist demands—secession, partial sovereignty, federalist accommodations, and so on. Second, in some cases, the benefits that political stability brings (including benefits that are instrumental to justice and social cooperation) mean that citizens sometimes need to be able to contribute to political discourse in ways that enable and strengthen federal–civic identities that are inclusive of a variety of liberal minority national identities that can be nested within the federal one. Here <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1746197913483657">Jeremy Waldron’s (2000)</xref> comments on what he calls ‘the duty of civic participation’ are especially apt. As Waldron notes, ‘the duty of civic participation is not just a duty to do X but a duty to do X carefully and responsibly. In the case of this duty […] it means participating in a way that does not improperly diminish the prospects for peace or the prospect that the inhabitants will in fact come to terms and set up the necessary frameworks’ (p. 157). Teaching students about nationalism can significantly facilitate the capacities associated with what Waldron calls the duty of civic participation when political disputes turn to questions that threaten national unity. Third, and finally, teaching students the capacities they need to make political judgments that distinguish between legitimate and illegitimate nationalist claims can help to redress problems of political mistrust and resentment—another potential source of political instability and injustice. For example, there is a strong potential for state measures that are designed to recognize and respect legitimate nationalist claims to be perceived as special pleading or favoritism. When this happens, political mistrust and resentment may result in part from faulty ethical evaluations of the legitimacy of the nationalist claims in question.</p>
<p>Importantly, teaching young citizens about nationalism can address each of these issues by providing a comparative historical and political context within which nationalist claims can be evaluated and judged. The political vocabulary of nationalism is not likely to be eliminated from political debates in many pluralist democracies any time soon. As a result, the potential for citizens to treat varied nationalist movements indiscriminately remains an enduring problem for civic educators.</p>
<p>This being said, the capacity to distinguish between legitimate and illegitimate forms of nationalism involves a distinct, more elementary, but very complex ability. Before judgments about legitimacy can be made, citizens must first <italic>identify</italic> nationalist claims in order to distinguish them from other types of claims that typically arise in the course of political discourse in pluralist societies. The problem is that the application of this distinction to concrete cases is often unclear, since nationalist claims can be used as strategic or rhetorical political maneuvers that disguise (intentionally or not) underlying political interests that in fact have little to do with concerns for national recognition or sovereignty. Nevertheless, the fact that the task is likely to be difficult and the fact that there are likely to be deep disagreements about how to draw the conceptual boundaries of what counts as a ‘nationalist’ claim and how these boundaries apply to particular cases do not defeat the idea that the task is essential with respect to the central purposes of democratic citizenship—namely, the purposes of upholding principles of justice and maintaining political stability.</p>
<p>Consider the following example. In the 1970s, some Canadians formed a secessionist movement that advocated forming a separate territory including the four westernmost provinces of Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta, and British Columbia. Ultimately, the stated aim of this movement was ambiguous. In some versions, the stated goal was to join the United States as a 51st state. In other versions, it was to form a separate ‘Western Canadian’ state. Similar examples present themselves in the United States as we complete the final revisions to this article. Citizens of states like Texas and Louisiana, apparently motivated by dissatisfaction over the reelection of President Barack Obama, have initiated petitions to separate from the Union. In turn, the cities of Austin and El Paso have recently petitioned to secede from Texas in the event of an actual Texas secession—a move that further reflects the deep and complexly nested political chasms that cut across different regions of the country. A similar phenomenon is familiar to Canadians, where Anglophones who constitute majorities within certain areas of Montreal have claimed a right to secede from Quebec in the event of Quebec’s secession from Canada (as well as the aforementioned case of secessionist movements in other parts of Canada).</p>
<p>It is difficult to judge how seriously such movements should be taken qua demands for national self-determination. While such movements are no doubt underwritten by genuine (not necessarily to say legitimate) political grievances, in most of these cases it seems doubtful that they reflect a genuine aspiration to <italic>national self-determination</italic>, or even whether they are claims that primarily pertain to issues of national identity at all, in spite of the prevalence of nationalist rhetoric. Instead, such movements might seem like political strategies that opportunistically dabble in nationalist rhetoric for other political purposes—designed to capitalize on the dramatic political weight that nationalist rhetoric often carries as a means of advancing very different sorts of political goals.</p>
<p>We introduce these examples of nominally nationalist claims in order to illustrate complexities of nationalist rhetoric in everyday political discourse and to suggest that these complexities trigger a need for citizens to make reasoned and principled distinctions between authentic and inauthentic nationalist claims. In short, when nationalist claims proliferate due to local exigencies, resentments, or perceived injustices, as in the US and Canadian examples above, there is a genuine danger of overlooking the legitimate grounds upon which regional or nonnational ethnic groups may legitimately protest unfair or unequal treatment at the hands of the federal government. The failure to distinguish between authentic and inauthentic forms of nationalism may therefore increase both injustice and seriously undermine political stability.</p>
<p>This is why being able to identify the ‘nature’ of different political claims is an important first step for the evaluation of the ‘legitimacy’ of these different political claims in democratic deliberation, however complex and difficult it might be to try to apply the distinction to real political movements. Of course, teaching students to reflect in a principled way about the ‘legitimacy’ of nationalist movements goes beyond the task of merely identifying authentic and inauthentic forms of nationalism; citizens crucially need to also be capable of critically evaluating the potential threats that authentic nationalist movements pose to basic human rights and to the more specialized range of social and political rights that liberal societies typically guarantee individuals as citizens of a particular political society.</p>
<p>We are not suggesting here that the distinction between artificial and genuine nationalist claims, or that between legitimate and illegitimate nationalist claims, is straightforward or uncontroversial in particular cases, nor are we suggesting that every nationalist movement can be simply categorized according to a ‘black and white’ dichotomy. In fact, many nationalist movements make some nonnationalist claims or identify themselves with nonnationalist values. And nationalist movements may appeal to nonnational values in order to correct for and redress illiberal, and hence illegitimate, elements in the national history and culture. For example, one interesting characteristic of contemporary Quebec nationalism lies in the eagerness of some proponents to ally Quebec with a more cosmopolitan and internationalist outlook than is seen to be possible if Quebec remains bound to Canadian federalism. Incorporating and endorsing extranational, cosmopolitan values can be an important means of liberalization for nations with histories of domination, assimilation, and misrecognition toward minority groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1746197913483657">Kymlicka, 2003</xref>). As Will Kymlicka points out, in circumstances of vastly increased globalization ‘[n]o group is truly “institutionally complete”’ (p. 157). As a result, sustaining and expanding liberal values within the nation, and redressing and eliminating illiberal tendencies, requires citizens who are committed to upholding cosmopolitan values.</p>
<p>The key point arising from these reflections is that while we insist on the educational importance of teaching students to identify genuine nationalist claims and to distinguish between legitimate and illegitimate nationalist claims, we also acknowledge that doing so is a practically complex and challenging task. No nation is simply and completely ‘liberal’ or ‘illiberal’, rather the reality is that nations reflect complex mixtures of liberal and illiberal tendencies and evaluating the legitimacy of nationalist claims or policies will involve complex contextual burdens of judgment. This means that citizens will inevitably disagree about how to draw the conceptual boundaries between genuine and inauthentic or about how judgments regarding the legitimacy and illegitimacy of nationalist claims apply in particular cases. But this difficulty does not defeat the idea that the task of making such distinctions is essential to advancing the central aims of democratic citizenship. On the contrary, we believe the complexity and difficulty of applying such important distinctions further support our suggestion to teach them, since such judgments are central to the purposes of upholding principles of justice and maintaining political stability. The bottom line is that teaching and learning about nationalism in schools, and more specifically in this case discussing what considerations make a political claim a legitimate <italic>nationalist</italic> claim, would contribute to the development of the citizen’s ability to understand or reflect on concrete issues of social justice and political stability. By incorporating this insight into our understandings of what is involved in the practice of democratic citizenship education, citizenship education in schools can better equip future citizens to distinguish between acceptable and unacceptable forms of nationalist claims, movements, and discourse. Such citizens will thereby be more likely to condemn the former and tolerate the later. This is undeniably a very desirable competence of the good citizen, and therefore, one important aspect of civic education.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1746197913483657">
<title>Teaching about nationalism and the goals of citizenship education</title>
<p>In the preceding section, we concentrated on defending the claim that liberal–democratic citizenship education ought to enable students to distinguish between legitimate and illegitimate forms of nationalism. These general principles form the basis of our general argument in favor of a program of teaching about nationalism in schools. In this section, we explore three more specific issues with which such a program should concern itself. Each of these issues represents a significant political challenge for multinational democratic societies, and as such, each one constitutes an important basis for educating morally competent citizens.</p>
<p>Liberal–democratic societies are characterized by significant political asymmetries between citizens of majority and minority national groups—asymmetries that impede justice, mutual respect, and civility. Teaching about nationalism is an important way of illuminating such asymmetries and thus of enabling students to develop an ability to understand and evaluate their political significance and, if necessary, to explore possible ways of resolving unjust inequalities. In the remainder of this section, we elaborate on the educational implications of teaching about nationalism for addressing three major dimensions of the social, cultural, and political asymmetries in multination states.</p>
<sec id="section4-1746197913483657">
<title>Cultural assimilation and restorative justice</title>
<p>One way of illuminating political asymmetries and challenging prejudices between members of different national groups is to have a closer look at the assimilationist history of nation building. In this respect, it is particularly important in multination states that citizens who primarily identify with the majority nation be able to critically reflect on their own characteristic assumptions about nationalism and its value or disvalue.</p>
<p>One such characteristic assumption is that the majority nation is benign and liberal, whereas minority nations are illiberal and unreasonable. Both assumptions are misguided and need to be problematized. This seems especially important in multination states where nationalism is an important political force and plays a significant role in everyday political discourse. In countries like Canada, political verbal sparring between Quebec and Canadian nationalists can be acerbic and insulting without (in most cases) leading to violence.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1746197913483657">1</xref></sup> However, even short of outright violent conflict, liberal nationalist sentiments can be quickly mobilized and distorted for unjust political purposes in the face of perceived threats from (sometimes quickly socially constructed) ‘dangerous outsiders’, a phenomenon with respect to which contemporary Islamaphobia provides perhaps the most prominent contemporary instantiation.</p>
<p>Historically, the state as a political unit has often preceded and provided the necessary institutional conditions for creating the ‘nation’, in the sense of a well-defined group of people who think of themselves as ‘belonging’ or as ‘members’ of the nation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1746197913483657">Glover, 1997</xref>: 143). The creation of the nation is in such cases a politically designed process of ‘creating Italians’ or of ‘turning peasants into Frenchmen’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1746197913483657">Weber, 1976</xref>). In all such cases, the project of nation building is a conscious and sometimes violent political and educational process, whereby minority nations are created out of processes designed to eliminate or destroy them through assimilation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1746197913483657">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>The salience of such examples for our purposes in this article lies in the fact that in some cases historical attempts to assimilate minority national groups reflect illiberal national attitudes of cultural superiority. In other cases, they reflect a straightforward commitment to morally unacceptable forms of discrimination. Whereas the majority nation predicates assimilative or colonialist nationalist policies on the value of a shared national identity, it often does so while denying that same value for members of minority national groups. Seen in this light, teaching the history of nation building can be a way of illustrating the ways in which illiberal majority nationalist movements can exemplify ethically egregious attitudes analogous to other forms of moral chauvinism such as racism and sexism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1746197913483657">Gomberg, 1990</xref>), while minority nationalist movements can reflect legitimate liberal demands for political self-determination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1746197913483657">Tamir, 1993</xref>).</p>
<p>From the perspective of liberal–democratic citizenship education, these examples illustrate value for both the members of the majority nation and for the members of the minority nations of learning about and reflecting on the assimilationist historical patterns of nation building. Such learning can significantly contribute to the development of a critical attitude toward the majority nation and thus eliminate any unjustifiable sentiment of cultural or moral superiority toward minorities. This is a necessary condition for nonviolent, fruitful, and respectful dialogue between the members of different nations. Furthermore, learning about some of the ethically egregious attitudes involved in assimilationist history of the nation can provide members of minority nations with tools to forestall illiberal nationalist tendencies in their own nation, by fostering the desire to respect their own cultural minorities; it can also provide conceptual and historically informed bases for improving the nation’s historically poor treatment of such minorities.</p>
<p>Finally, another (related) good consequence of teaching about illiberal nationalist movements is that this is likely to contribute to the development of children’s sensitivity to the injustices of the past. As we have seen, most (currently) liberal nations have been built at least to some extent on histories of oppression, including failed attempts to assimilate national minority groups. Where historical injustices persist into the present, important questions arise about what, if anything, is required of citizens now as a matter of correcting injustice in the past (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1746197913483657">Waldron, 1992</xref>). Teaching about nationalism, from both a normative and a historical point of view, would incline future citizens to recognize and fulfill their duties in terms of reparative justice. It would incline them to fulfill those duties precisely because they would learn not only some general relevant moral distinctions regarding nationalism but also how those distinctions apply to specific nationalist movements or policies in light of different historical contexts. More specifically, they would learn about how the history of illegitimate forms of nationalism and nationalist policies from the dominant group might legitimate the claims of some actual nationalist movement, which might otherwise appear illegitimate or unreasonable to the members of the dominant group. In other words, teaching about nationalism would render future citizens better able to both identify (critically) what was illegitimate about a given policy or attitude toward a minority nation from the dominant one (perhaps theirs) and therefore understand when a claim of reparative justice is legitimate and should be granted. And these capacities render future citizens much more likely not only to respect but also to <italic>stand up</italic> for just nationalist struggles that are embedded in past and/or persistent injustices, not only within the multicultural and multinational state but also at the international level.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1746197913483657">
<title>Recognition and political autonomy</title>
<p>The existence of minority national groups and the fact that these groups are entangled in nationalist conflicts that include webs of legitimate and illegitimate claims on the parts of both minority and majority national groups create the need for citizens to learn about the possible reasonable grounds for justifying demands for political autonomy and for reflecting on different possible mechanisms by which the desire for political self-determination might be realized. The fact that federal governments afford greater political autonomy to minority national groups than they afford to merely territorial governments should not be assumed, a priori, to reflect unfair or unequal treatment. Multinational citizens must learn to acknowledge the ways in which the varied historical experiences of different national groups may bestow deep and reasonable differences in political authority for minority national groups.</p>
<p>Minority nationalist demands for political self-determination are grounded not only on claims about national identity or restorative justice but also in social, economic, and geographical facts that are distinctive of national groups and that are not characteristic of other groups such as minority religious or ethnic communities. But as Will Kymlicka has argued in various places, these demands are also frequently aligned with important liberal values.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1746197913483657">3</xref></sup> The fact that such differences involve relationships between different ‘societal cultures’ means that minority national groups can provide their members with a distinct ‘cultural context of choice’ that supports the development of liberal capacities for personal autonomy and democratic citizenship. This means that when citizens of the majority nation are called upon to grant substantial forms of political autonomy to minority national groups, they cannot simply assume that such accommodations stand in conflict with key values such as personal autonomy and equality. Instead, supporting accommodations for the political autonomy of minority national groups may be an important, and indeed in some cases essential, means of upholding those key liberal values. As such, political disagreement and deliberation in multination states generate claims for national accommodations that are based on distinctive political and ethical grounds. Since an important aspect of citizenship is learning to properly evaluate the merits of such claims, it is important that young citizens learn what is distinctive about such claims.</p>
<p>We are not claiming here that students in multination states should learn that accommodations for national minorities are always or generally more reasonable than those for minority religious communities. Of course, judgments about reasonable accommodation in particular cases will vary according to context whether they are based on religious affiliation or national affiliation. Sometimes the accommodation of minority nationalisms can be illiberal, for example, when such accommodations involve overlooking concerns about the unjust treatment of vulnerable members of the group such as children and women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1746197913483657">McDonough, 2003</xref>). The insight we are highlighting here is simply that claims for accommodation on grounds of national identity are distinctive grounds that need to be evaluated differently from other sorts of group-based claims to accommodation. And enabling students to competently evaluate such demands requires that they learn something about the distinctive nature of minority nationalist movements.</p>
<p>Here we once again see the importance of teaching young citizens to carefully distinguish between legitimate and illegitimate nationalist claims for accommodation and to evaluate the merits of particular legitimate nationalist accommodation claims. Indeed, it is crucial to be capable of understanding what exactly can be wrong or right about nationalist movements or claims in order to be able to adopt the right attitude in terms of accommodations for nationalist minorities. This can hardly be achieved without naming and explaining the phenomenon of nationalism and without having some critical discussions of current and past nationalist movements. This is to say, again, that learning about nationalism in schools is an excellent way to foster these critical capacities of citizenship.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1746197913483657">
<title>Civic respect</title>
<p>As we noted earlier, nationalism can be and often is a source of value for people. Where matters of identity are concerned, issues of mutual respect and recognition necessarily arise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1746197913483657">Appiah, 2003</xref>). This is another context in which teaching about nationalist movements can be a valuable component of citizenship education. One complicating factor here is that the requirement of civic respect does not align precisely with the legitimacy or even the moral acceptability of nationalist claims. Even members of nationalist movements that advance illegitimate or morally unacceptable claims must be treated with respect in political deliberation. Once again, teaching about nationalism can be an important means of fostering such civic respect.</p>
<p>As a component of identity, nationality can be a source of pride and humiliation, of collective joy and accomplishment as well of collective threat, of indignity as well as of dignity. Indeed, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1746197913483657">Taylor (1997)</xref>, for contemporary people, the nation provides <italic>the</italic> paradigmatic source of what he calls ‘categorical identities’—that is, a ‘direct’ identification between the individual and the nation such that each individual’s sense of self-worth <italic>qua</italic> member of the nation is unmediated by subaffiliations of lineage or clan:<disp-quote>
<p>The more we are inducted into modern society, the more this is the form in which the question of dignity will pose itself for us. Nationalism is modern because it is a typically modern way of responding to the threat represented by the advancing wave of modernization. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1746197913483657">Taylor, 1997</xref>, p. 45)</p>

<p>It is precisely because national identity <italic>matters</italic> a lot to many people that liberal education ought to take seriously the place of nationalism in the curriculum. Indeed, where nationalism forms a part of people’s identity, where it constitutes an important aspect of what makes their life worthwhile – that is, when it is an aspect of the conception of the good—it must be treated with respect even if particular nationalist movements and demands must sometimes be criticized and rejected.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1746197913483657">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>We would stress here that teaching mutual respect in multinational societies would seem to be well served by teaching students about the fact that their fellow citizens have varying national attachments; some may identify with the majority nation, others with a minority nation, and still others to several nations at once. Further complicating matters is the fact that some citizens will have cosmopolitan identities that lead them to reject nationalist identifications completely. With these variations in mind, teaching about nationalism in the way we propose in this article is an invaluable means of teaching mutual respect; however, it does not follow that doing so requires emphasizing deep or unbridgeable differences of identity, quite the opposite in fact. Teaching students that differences of national identity merit an attitude of respect involves fostering a commitment to generously engage with identity differences on their own terms and to instill the disposition to critically evaluate identity claims, where appropriate, in light of liberal principles of individual autonomy and equality. This is far from teaching that respecting differences entails adopting an uncritical attitude or a completely deferential stance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1746197913483657">Callan, 2000</xref>: 58–63).</p>
<p>To conclude this section, let us briefly summarize the main arguments we have made so far in this article. Importantly, all our arguments rely on at least one or more basic assumptions about the phenomenon of nationalism. Indeed, in different sections of this article, we identified three of such key assumptions about nationalism, widely recognized in the literature and upon which our arguments are based. Those grounding assumptions are the following:</p>
<list id="list1-1746197913483657" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Nationalism is, as a matter of fact, an important aspect of many people’s identity or conception of the good, and nationalist claims are at the core of many political struggles or movements.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Nationalism can, in principle and in practice, be compatible with liberal justice. This is to say that there are legitimate nationalist political demands as well as inoffensive nationalist sentiments and identities.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Nevertheless, human history shows us that nationalism often is and can always become an illiberal political force, and as such, it potentially threatens the necessary conditions for a respectful and peaceful dialogue and cohabitation between the members of different nations.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>We drew an important normative conclusion from these three basic assumptions:<disp-quote>
<p>When nationalist claims <italic>are</italic> legitimate in the sense that they constitute legitimate justice-based demands of recognition or political autonomy for instance, they should not be simply dismissed; they should be acknowledged as such, i.e. taken seriously by citizens in the multinational state and at the international level. This is the case not only because it serves stability in the multinational state, but also because accommodating a minority nation by granting its claims (say, for special political autonomy) is sometimes simply what justice requires, independently of stability issues.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Now, we hope to have shown that the combination of these premises (the three key basic facts about the phenomenon of nationalism and the crucial normative implication that we draw from them) directly supports our main thesis in this article: that learning <italic>about</italic> nationalism from a historical, sociological, and normative point of view constitutes an important dimension of a good citizenship education. Indeed, as we have argued, the capacity to identify liberal forms of nationalist feelings and claims, as well as to distinguish them from their unreasonable or illegitimate counterparts, is a highly desirable component of good citizenship. And this complex set of capacities requires a quite sophisticated understanding of, and especially a capacity to reflect critically on, the controversial phenomenon of nationalism itself. From this, we conclude that there is a powerful case in favor of educating citizens about the phenomenon of nationalism.</p>
<p>This being said, we have not provided an argument explaining why we think that <italic>schools</italic> (and the public school curriculum) in particular are the very best political institutions for accomplishing this goal. But the reason for this should become clear in the next section. The question of introducing nationalism as an educational topic in schools has been a key focal point for critics of patriotic education. As we pointed out in the introduction to this article, the claim that schools should teach <italic>about</italic> nationalism does not imply a commitment to the further claim that schools should promote nationalist affiliations or sentiments. Critics of patriotic education may nevertheless remain concerned that teaching about nationalism is likely in practice to provide (perhaps indirect) support for patriotic education. The task of our next section is to respond to such concerns; in doing so, we clarify the grounds for making schools important sites for discussing the topic of nationalism.</p>

<title>Will educating about nationalism reinforce illiberal patriotism?</title>
<p>The concern at issue in this section is whether incorporating nationalism as a topic within liberal–democratic citizenship education implies that it is also appropriate to <italic>promote</italic> or <italic>strengthen</italic> students’ nationalist sentiments or affiliations. As mentioned in the introduction to this article, this idea is actually defended by some preeminent liberal theorists, including Will Kymlicka, David Miller, and Eamonn Callan. In this section, our task is twofold. First, we provide a more detailed explanation of how our position differs from both proponents and opponents of liberal patriotic civic education. Second, and most importantly, we shall argue that the main objections to patriotic education do not apply to our proposal. Indeed, the concerns that motivate and fortify criticisms of patriotic education partly motivate and underwrite our own arguments in favor of teaching about nationalism in schools.</p>
<sec id="section8-1746197913483657">
<title>Civic education and political legitimacy</title>
<p>As a starting point, it will be helpful to begin by sketching out the main argument for a liberal patriotic civic education. According to proponents of this position, the main reason for fostering patriotic sentiments through civic education is given by the supposed links between a ‘shared national identity’ and the realization of justice in practice. The idea is that fostering a sense of nationalism can actually increase justice in a society by providing people with psychological and moral resources that reinforce their tendency to uphold civic obligations. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1746197913483657">Kymlicka (2001)</xref> expresses the argument succinctly:<disp-quote>
<p>Social unity […] requires not only shared principles [of justice], but also a sense of shared membership. Citizens must have a sense of belonging to the same community, and a shared desire to continue to live together. Social unity, in short, requires that citizens identify with their fellow citizens, and view them as ‘one of us’. This sense of shared identity helps sustain the relationships of trust and solidarity needed for citizens to accept the results of democratic decisions, and the obligations of liberal justice. (p. 311)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>However, as critics have pointed out, even if we grant for the sake of argument the controversial claim that promoting patriotic loyalty among citizens promotes just outcomes, this is not sufficient to warrant state support for patriotic education in public schools. One reason, forcefully pressed by Harry Brighouse, is that promoting patriotism is coercive, especially in the case of children, and thus undermines the conditions for political legitimacy. Brighouse notes that even ‘soft’ coercion is still coercion, and when soft coercion is implemented in education, for instance, through the recognition of public holidays and other dominant cultural symbols, students may be guided to internalize an attachment to the nation before they are capable of choosing whether they reflectively endorse that attachment. This means that even apparently benign forms of patriotic education such as those proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1746197913483657">Andrew Mason (2000)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1746197913483657">David Miller (1997)</xref> are coercive in the sense that they jeopardize the child’s ability to consent freely to the state.</p>
<p>This criticism is one toward which we find ourselves sympathetically inclined. Notably, however, teaching <italic>about</italic> nationalism turns out to provide an important corrective to the coercive (and hence delegitimizing) tendencies of a more thoroughgoing patriotic education. In assessing this concern, it must first be noted that the challenge it poses is partly empirical and has to do with somewhat speculative conclusions about the psychological outcomes or effects of patriotic education. While we do not claim to have any special insights about such empirical matters, we can still offer some clarificatory remarks about what is involved in teaching <italic>about</italic> nationalism, as opposed to teaching patriotism. We can also explain why what we are proposing might actually militate against the danger of patriotic education that Brighouse warns against here.</p>
<p>Teaching about nationalist struggles—whether these are the struggles of one’s own national history or the struggles of nationalists in other countries—is to learn about the ways in which clashes between different nations are always complexly related to liberal values. When measured by the yardstick of individual rights, most nationalist movements—even those that are typically represented as just in the prevailing political culture of the nation—will, if taught competently, portray the harsh effects of nationalist struggles and thus promote skepticism and criticism of the ‘official’ story of nations (i.e. the story told by the dominant groups).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1746197913483657">S.J. Connolly’s (2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1746197913483657">2010</xref>) recent history of Ireland is a useful case in point. Connolly’s account powerfully complicates the story of Irish Nationhood (beginning in the 16th century) as a struggle between English aspirations to dominance and Gaelic resistance. His story of the development of modern Irish identity is one of pragmatic compromise and adaptation, dramatically shifting loyalties and power dynamics, whereby the relationships between Irish Catholics and Protestants, on the one hand, and English political authority, on the other, have always been mediated in complex and radically shifting ways along a variety of other social identity axes, most importantly clan loyalty.</p>
<p>Notably, Connolly’s description of Irish nationhood illustrates that teaching about the history of nationalism and nationalist struggles need not proceed by ‘distorting the process of cultural formation and reformation, and in particular by distorting the development of the national idea’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1746197913483657">Brighouse, 2003</xref>: 167) in ways that jeopardize the child’s ability to freely consent to political authority. Rather, if such teaching is appropriately sensitive to the kind of historical complexity that Connoly’s account of Irish nationalism draws our attention to, then students will be encouraged at most to maintain a skeptical and highly conditional attachment to the nation—one that is tempered by an understanding of the highly contingent nature of most nationalist identities and of the emotionally sanitized national narratives that support such identities.</p>
<p>Once again, the importance of making nationalism a topic of education in compulsory public schools emerges clearly here. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1746197913483657">Brighouse (2003)</xref> misses this point when he claims that<disp-quote>
<p>there is a strong case for depriving the state of authority with respect to the stance the child develops toward the state: not because this allows the child to develop its views without influence of any authority, but because granting parents authority will more reliably reproduce a diversity of stances toward the state which constitute the patriotism of conationals who are free and equal. (p. 166)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Brighouse’s point seems to be that citizens who are genuinely free to give their consent must have opportunities to reflect upon ‘a diversity of stances toward the state …’. Otherwise, their consent will be conditioned in ways that undermine its authenticity. This is a reasonable claim, but Brighouse’s suggestion that devolving authority from the state to parents is the best way to produce the conditions for reflection is too quick and ultimately doubtful.</p>
<p>The problem with parental authority is that while it promises to reproduce diverse views, it also promises to insulate children from reflection on views that are not given much air time within the home. This worry is especially pressing in family settings that are structured to inhibit careful reflection. Our proposal, on the other hand, suggests a way in which the state might teach about nationalism in ways that represent the dominant story of the nation as an object of critical reflection in light of a realistic story about the complex and contested ways in which current ideas about the nation were born. This story too will inevitably involve the presentation of diverse stances that individual citizens and groups have adopted toward the state—and indeed will represent the diverse forms the state has taken over the course of centuries. But unlike the proposal to leave such education up to parents, the proposal to teach about nationalism in public schools would enable students to reflect on and evaluate different attitudes and stances toward the nation, <italic>including the stance promoted by their own parents</italic>.</p>
<p>Of course, the possibility still exists that the educational process will nevertheless be distorted in ways that favor the state. But as Brighouse already implies, such distortions are also likely in the case of parental authority. The question is which approach is more likely to produce citizens who can reflectively offer or withhold their consent to political authority. And the balance of risks and benefits with respect to this question seems far more favorable to the proposal of including a robust curricular focus on nationalist struggles than to either of the alternatives currently on offer—that is, an education for patriotism or an education according to which parents are granted the authority to shape children’s stances toward the state.</p>
<p>An education that teaches about nationalism should show students that nations have been, in one form or another (again, the history being taught is likely to portray the radically dynamic and shifting political alliances that have shaped national history), powerful centers of political authority and are likely to continue to be the foreseeable future. While nations often do bad, they also sometimes do good, and in any case, they provide probably the most formidable, if far from perfect, mechanisms for expanding justice and rectifying injustice.</p>
<p>On this basis, it seems plausible to think that teaching about nationalism could reinforce a conditional attachment to the nation—that is, the view that national loyalties and commitments are good only insofar as they support individual rights and justice and that they are evil if they undermine such goods. As such, the danger of ‘conditioning’ the child’s consent to the state is not eliminated completely—but the effects with respect to consent should be that children’s consent is conditioned solely upon the acceptance of liberal values, which would support rather than undermine the conditions of liberal political legitimacy.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1746197913483657">
<title>Civic education and social justice</title>
<p>Brighouse worries also that promoting patriotism may undermine ‘other loyalties or attachments which are instrumental for justice’ such as social class solidarity. This objection could apply in practice even to conditional patriotic affiliations of the kind liberals support. Indeed, even if the kind of patriotism that is promoted in schools is fully liberal, children may come to see things in ways that blind them to (a) other forms of human solidarity that can conduce toward justice and (b) the ways in which even reflective and critical nationalism can impede or block such alternative forms of affiliation.</p>
<p>Would teaching about nationalism have the same type of undesirable side effects? It could do so only <italic>if</italic> teaching about nationalism itself were to have the side effect of promoting a liberal form of patriotism of the kind cherished by Callan and others. We suggested earlier that it is in fact reasonable to think that teaching about nationalism could reinforce a conditional attachment to the nation for some students. But it is important to keep in mind that this is not the <italic>aim</italic> of our proposition as such and that for many students the outcome is likely to weaken rather than strengthen nationalist attachments. Teaching about nationalism in the way we suggested in this article might in fact ‘liberalize’ some otherwise illiberal nationalist affiliations, but it might as well, in some cases, bring some children to reject nationalist commitments altogether (for instance, in favor of a more ‘cosmopolitan’ identity) or it might reinforce <italic>other</italic> kinds of attachments or solidarities. These possibilities are due to the neutral and critical nature of our proposal.</p>
<p>An additional reason why we think that teaching about nationalism need not corrode morally and politically benign sub- or supranational forms of social solidarity is that if teaching about nationalism is undertaken conscientiously, it will include discussions of how nationalism has and often does oppress minority cultural and religious groups, working class associations (trade unions), and so on. It will also include discussions of the roles that working class and other movements have historically played in challenging and even overturning the militaristic and economic excesses of national expansionism. This suggests that teaching about nationalism and about other sociological and historical forms of group solidarities are certainly not, and should not be, mutually exclusive educational options. So in our view, teaching about nationalism should not replace or prevent teaching about other forms of solidarity and can potentially provide students with information that will be useful in helping them to make informed and intelligent choices about how they act in ways that work to strengthen and build such forms of solidarity.</p>

<title>Is it necessary to teach about nationalism?</title>
<p>In the course of our arguments in this article, we have emphasized the role that teaching about nationalism plays in promoting various goals of liberal–democratic education. However, while we have emphasized the role that teaching about nationalism from a historical and sociological goal might play in promoting these goals, we have not directly addressed the question of whether teaching about nationalism is the only, or at least the best, way to achieve these goals. To reinforce our argument for this latter claim, we would like in this section to highlight and briefly address two final objections that might be advanced against our proposal.</p>
<p>First, one could argue that while teaching about nationalism is one possible way of promoting goals of liberal civic education, it is not necessary to include the study of nationalism in order to promote these aims. For example, one might argue that the development of a capacity for personal autonomy would be enough to secure commitment to liberal–democratic values and principles, since autonomous citizens, being able to think critically, would possess all the previous capacities and, thus, would be able to fulfill their duties as citizens.</p>
<p>Our reply to this objection is the following. First of all, we agree that the development of personal autonomy is one (if not, <italic>the</italic> most) important goal, not only of citizenship education but also of schooling in general. We also agree that being able to think critically, to think for one self, is necessary for achieving the goals of civic education. However, most importantly, we deny that the development of a capacity for personal autonomy is by itself sufficient to create good citizens. The reason is not only that one can possess the capacity for personal autonomy and yet be unable to exercise it well in some respects but also that one can possess the capacity for personal autonomy and yet be a bad citizen. Importantly, in the present context, this may happen precisely when nationalist sentiments or prejudices against minorities are at stake. For this reason, we believe that there is no better way of ensuring the achievement of the important goals of civic education that we have been discussing in this article than to explicitly teach about nationalism in schools. Insofar as our proposal involves learning how to make relevant moral distinctions and to reflect critically about questions of justice, it contributes to the development of both the capacity for personal autonomy and its exercise in the political sphere. In response to the previous objection, we can therefore conclude that our proposal <italic>serves</italic> the goal of developing children’s personal autonomy and, indeed, that the development of future citizens’ autonomy cannot be complete without it.</p>
<p>A second objection has it that it is unnecessary to teach about nationalism for the purposes of civic education because it would be sufficient to teach about justice and liberal rights. Here we would simply reiterate one of our central points: making future citizens critically aware of a phenomenon that (history teaches us) threatens liberal justice, by creating a potential of conflicts and asymmetries between groups within the multinational state (and at the international level), is certainly a better way to protect justice, prevent conflicts, and promote civic friendship than to remain silent in this respect. It is certainly an improvement on an approach that would simply teach rights and justice in more abstract or ad hoc ways. Here, there is an important parallel to be made with the justification of religious education: one of the reasons typically advanced in favor of teaching religion from a cultural and historical point of view in schools today is precisely that religion is an important source of conflict and tensions between individuals and groups in multicultural societies, one that impedes mutual respect and civility. Teaching about religion is widely regarded as a good means of confronting or preventing the prejudices that are often the basis of tensions and of an unwillingness to accommodate the legitimate demands of religious minorities. The same reasoning applies to nationalism, thus providing a powerful reason to emphasize nationalism in its own right as a focus of civic education.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1746197913483657" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In this article, we have argued that discussing the phenomenon of nationalism from a historical and sociological point of view in schools would serve a number of desirable civic educational goals in ways that are not widely recognized or taken seriously in the scholarly literature. Teaching students critical thinking capacities needed in order to distinguish between legitimate and illegitimate forms of nationalism serves the civic educational aims of helping students to recognize and challenge cultural oppression and assimilation, to engage reflectively with difficult issues such as claims of reparative justice and national self-determination, and it helps them to find ways to do all these things in a spirit that is not only consistent with but also promotes mutual civic respect, personal autonomy, and a commitment to fundamental liberal–democratic principles of justice.</p>

<p>Even in contexts where nationalist disputes are typically peaceful, there is always the potential when nationalist identities are concerned for the political discourse to take a violent turn. In Canada, two prominent examples serve to illustrate this point. The October Crisis of 1970, centered on a flare up of violence culminating in the kidnapping of two government officials by the FLQ (Front de libération du Québec). One of the kidnapped, Pierre Laporte, was later found murdered. The Oka Crisis of 1990 centered on a land dispute between the First Nations Mohawk community in Kanesetake, Quebec, and the neighboring town of Oka, in which one provincial police officer was killed. On the FLQ crisis, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1746197913483657">Tetley (2006)</xref>.

<p>It is important to keep in mind here that we are referring specifically to nationalist policies designed to assimilate entire groups without regard for the preferences of individual persons and not to processes of assimilation by which individuals may voluntarily, gradually, and entirely legitimately adopt an identification with the majority nation (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1746197913483657">Callan, 2005b</xref>).</p>
