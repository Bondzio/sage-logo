<abstract>
<p><italic>Aims</italic>: To describe and compare health-related quality of life (HRQoL) among homeless persons with a general population sample in Stockholm County, 2006, and to analyse the importance of certain social determinants of health among the homeless. <italic>Methods</italic>: Face-to-face interviews with 155 homeless persons and a postal survey to a general population sample, mainly based on the same questionnaire, including questions on social determinants of health and HRQoL measured with the EQ-5D. <italic>Results</italic>: Chronic illness was three times more common among the homeless. HRQoL was worse among homeless persons than in the general population sample: the homeless reported more problems, especially more severe problems, in all the EQ-5D dimensions and had considerably lower EQ-5D<sub>index</sub> and EQ<sub>VAS</sub> score than the general population. Most problems were reported in the dimension anxiety/depression. Among the homeless, longer duration and more severe degree of homelessness lowered HRQoL, but few determinants were statistically significantly related to HRQoL. Having mental disease significantly lowered HRQoL. <bold><italic>Conclusions</italic>: This study was an attempt to include hard-to-reach groups in an assessment of population health. Homeless persons had considerably worse HRQoL than the general population and reported most problems in the dimension anxiety/depression. Some diseases may contribute to causing homelessness; others may be seen as consequences. Homeless persons are a vulnerable group in society. Further interview studies are needed based on larger sample of homeless persons to explore health determinants such as sex, age, socioeconomic factors, duration and degree of homelessness, and health-related behaviours among the homeless persons.</bold></p>

<title>Background</title>
<p>The homeless are a vulnerable group, and have worse physical and mental health than the general population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1403494811435493">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1403494811435493">4</xref>] and also report a higher degree of mistrust in societal organisations, including health care, than the general population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1403494811435493">5</xref>]. The physical diseases and injuries that homeless persons sustain are respiratory disorders, such as asthma, chronic bronchitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, infections such as tuberculosis, hepatitis, and HIV, cardiovascular disease, skin disorders, and fractures and poisoning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1403494811435493">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1403494811435493">11</xref>]. Mental disorders, including substance misuse, are common among the homeless [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1403494811435493">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1403494811435493">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1403494811435493">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1403494811435493">13</xref>]. These diseases may be seen both as potential causes and consequences of homelessness.</p>
<p>Knowledge regarding health status of homeless persons compared to the general population is partly limited, since they are sometimes not covered in registers and are not reached by public health surveys. Two Swedish studies have measured the health gap between 1704 homeless (20% women) and 5000 persons from the general population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1403494811435493">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1403494811435493">4</xref>]. Concerning principal diagnosis, the homeless group had a double risk of being hospitalised for physical diseases and injuries. Concerning principal and secondary diagnoses, homeless women had 21 times higher risk and homeless men had 13 times higher risk compared to the general population, to be hospitalised for psychiatric diseases (including substance misuse disorders).</p>
<p>Morbidity measures focus on certain diagnoses and types of disease, and it is difficult to make comparisons of health status when the subjects have more than one disease. There is scarcity of studies regarding health-related quality of life (HRQoL) among homeless persons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1403494811435493">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1403494811435493">15</xref>]. HRQoL is a subjective account of health assessment, which reflects different dimensions of health such as physical, psychological, social, cognitive and role function, and general wellbeing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1403494811435493">16</xref>]. One argument for using HRQoL to measure health is the multidimensional concept that is not reflected in the commonly used global self-rated health question. EQ-5D is a HRQoL instrument, where respondents can report their health in five dimensions and on a visual analogue scale (VAS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1403494811435493">17</xref>]. The measure is designed for self-completion by respondents, but can also be used in postal surveys, clinics, and face-to-face interviews.</p>
<p>As homeless persons have worse health than the general population, it is relevant to study the influence of social determinants including age, sex, country of origin, health-related behaviours, and the degree and duration of homelessness on their health.</p>
<p>In Sweden, homelessness has drawn attention from society, and surveys have been conducted 1993, 1999, and 2005 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1403494811435493">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1403494811435493">20</xref>]. According to the surveys, about 75% of the homeless have substance misuse (more men than women) and nearly half of them have psychiatric problems (more women than men). Other specific studies have also found increased mortality, high prevalence of mental problems, misuse of alcohol and illicit drugs, and dental problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1403494811435493">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1403494811435493">23</xref>]. However, knowledge regarding homeless person’s HRQoL is still limited.</p>
<p>In Sweden, a homeless person is defined as an individual who has no permanent place to stay, who is referred to special lodging houses or shelters for homeless, lives outdoors, or is currently in hospital, institution, or prison without a place of his/her own in which to stay when discharged, and finally a person who stays with friends and families, or rents a room/flat for a short while, and who has sought help from social services for his/her housing problem [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1403494811435493">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1403494811435493">20</xref>]. Variations of the definition of homeless persons have occurred in the national surveys during the years. This leads to difficulties to assess the number of homeless persons in Sweden and whether the homeless population has increased during the years. According to this, 10,000–18,000 persons in Sweden are homeless and about one fourth are women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1403494811435493">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1403494811435493">20</xref>]. Approximately one-third of those live in Stockholm County and about 700–1000 persons were considered as real rough sleepers and shelter stayers.</p>
<p>The aim of the present study was to describe and compare health-related quality of life among homeless persons with a general population sample in Stockholm County, 2006, and to analyse the importance of certain social determinants of health among the homeless persons.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1403494811435493" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods and participants</title>
<p>We used data from two sources: an interview study with homeless persons and a postal survey to a general population sample, both conducted in Stockholm County in the autumn 2006, using mainly the same questionnaire.</p>
<sec id="section3-1403494811435493">
<title>Homeless persons</title>
<p>Face-to-face interviews were performed with homeless persons. As a random procedure was not possible, the interviewer dwelled among homeless persons in the special lodging houses, shelters for the night and institutions and asked potential participants. The interviewer abstained from approaching homeless persons who seemed to be too ill or too intoxicated (almost asleep) to participate in the study. Those who declined to participate were, despite being selectively approached, sometimes in a bad shape and thus not capable to participate or interested without expressing any reason therefore. The time for an interview varied from 30 minutes to 6 hours. All interviews except two were performed by one of the authors (RI). In total about 300 homeless persons were approached, of whom 155 accepted to participate in the interviews. Participants were aged 21–73 years, most were rough sleepers (<italic>n</italic>=18) or shelter stayers (<italic>n</italic>=74). Out of those 155 persons, two had missing in all EQ-5D dimensions; four had missing in one dimension. As the sample size was small, for those four persons we imputed data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1403494811435493">24</xref>]. The sample size in the present study for EQ-5D analysis thus became 153 persons.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1403494811435493">
<title>General population sample</title>
<p>The Public Health Survey 2006 was a cross-sectional survey of a representative sample of the general population. A self-administrated postal survey questionnaire was sent to 57,009 persons aged 18–84 years (response rate 61%). In order to perform comparison with the homeless persons, we restricted the general population sample to the same age group, 21–73 years, as the homeless persons. After restricting the age and exclusion of those who had missing answers on any of the EQ-5D dimensions, the population sample size became 30,431 persons.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1403494811435493">
<title>Survey questionnaires</title>
<p>The structured interview questionnaire for the homeless persons was based on the standardised questionnaire used in the Public Health Survey, but adapted for the interviews among homeless. Public Health Surveys have been carried out in Stockholm County every fourth year since the mid-1980s and questions are asked on self-rated health, symptoms of diseases and chronic diseases, education, employment, economic situation, country of origin, health-related behaviours, safety and security, living environment, social network, subsistence from social welfare, and perceived trust in health care and other societal institutions, etc. The EQ-5D instrument has been included since 1998 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1403494811435493">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1403494811435493">26</xref>]. In the adapted questionnaire used to interview the homeless, some of the above questions were harmonised to better mirror the situation for the homeless group such as response options for supporting oneself. Questions on health-related behaviours and measurement of the degree and duration of homelessness were also added to the interview questionnaire. The diseases reported by the homeless were classified according to ICD-10.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1403494811435493">
<title>The EQ-5D instrument</title>
<p>The EQ-5D is a generic HRQoL measure, which enables respondents to classify their own health status into five dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression) and three levels of severity (no problems, moderate problems, severe problems) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1403494811435493">17</xref>]. In total, 243 health states could be generated by this classification and a single index value, EQ-5D<sub>index</sub> (where 0=dead and 1=full health), could be assigned to each unique health state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1403494811435493">27</xref>]. The EQ<sub>VAS</sub> enables respondents to rate their own overall health status on a scale between 0 (worst imaginable health state) and 100 (best imaginable health state).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1403494811435493">
<title>Measurement of the degree and duration of homelessness</title>
<p>The degree of homelessness was based on the question “Where did you sleep last night?” in the interview questionnaire to the homeless. The responses were divided into four categories, partly based on the definitions used in the national homelessness surveys:</p>
<list id="list1-1403494811435493" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p><italic>Rough sleepers</italic>, who had spent the night outdoors, in the parks, under the bridges, in cars, in stairwells, and similar arrangements.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Sheltered homeless</italic>, who the last night had slept in shelters, lodging houses, or so-called low threshold hostels where it is possible to stay for some weeks (sometimes longer) and where the guests are allowed to be drunk or intoxicated by some drug when entering for the night.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Homeless in</italic> temporary <italic>residential institutions</italic>, who had stayed in different institutions, including treatment institutions, institutions where the guests usually not are allowed to be drunk or intoxicated. Those living in prisons and institutional care were also included in this category, as those who spent the last night in the apartment of some friend or family member, and those who had stayed at youth hostels, camping grounds, and in hotels.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Homeless close to housing</italic>, who had the most stable living conditions and where entry to the ordinary housing market in the near future was most probable, e.g. persons with a short-time sublease, or a long-term contract with a foundation for those with obstacles on the regular housing market, or someone living in a trial apartment with an option of taking over the rental tenure.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Duration of homelessness was based on responses to the question: “When was the last time that you had a housing of your own?” and categorised into three groups: 1–3 years, 4–9 years, 10 years or more.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1403494811435493">
<title>Data analysis</title>
<p>Based on the sample size and the age distribution among the homeless, four age groups were formed (21–34, 35–44, 45–54 and 55–73 years). Characteristics of the samples of homeless persons and the general population were compared, based on questions included in both surveys, i.e. country of origin, level of education, subsistence from social insurance or social assistance, social relations, exposure to violence, refraining from health care due to economic problems, health-related behaviours, and self-reported health. In order to further study the homeless persons’ health, we also performed analyses by sex, age group, country of origin, and degree and duration of homelessness. Percentage of problems reported in EQ-5D dimensions, EQ-5D<sub>index</sub> and EQ<sub>VAS</sub> score (mean±SD) were calculated. The chi-squared test and t-test were used to test the significance of differences between the groups. Multiple regression analysis was used to study how the EQ-5D<sub>index</sub> varies with age, sex, country of origin, degree and duration of homelessness, self-reported diseases, and self-rated health. All covariates were entered as dummy (0/1) variables. All analyses were performed using SAS 9.1 and a 5% significance level was used.</p>

<title>Homeless persons’ health-related quality of life compared to the general population</title>
<p>Overall the homeless persons reported significantly worse health than the general population, both among men and women (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1403494811435493">Figure 1</xref>). The mean EQ-5D<sub>index</sub> was 0.59 among homeless women, compared to 0.82 among women in the general population, and among men the corresponding figures were 0.60 and 0.85, respectively. Homeless women reported a mean EQ<sub>VAS</sub> score of 62.6 compared to 78.9 among women in the general population, and among men the corresponding figures were 54.9 and 80.2, respectively. While in the general population most problems were reported in the dimension pain/discomfort, among the homeless most problems were reported in the dimension anxiety/depression. The proportion reporting severe problems was also higher among homeless persons. In the general population women reported worse health than men; among the homeless, this difference was not observed. Age-specific analyses comparing the homeless persons with the general population sample are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1403494811435493">Table II</xref>. Health status decreased with age for the general population sample. However, such a gradient was not clear among the homeless.</p>

<p>Among the homeless persons there were some differences in health status by country of origin (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1403494811435493">Table III</xref>). However, the observed differences were not systematic. The degree of homelessness was related to health. Overall, with some exceptions, problems reported in EQ-5D dimensions increased, EQ-5D<sub>index</sub> and EQ<sub>VAS</sub> score decreased with degree of homelessness and health was worst among rough sleepers. The EQ-5D<sub>index</sub> decreased with duration of homelessness. However, this was not obvious in problems reported in EQ-5D dimensions. The highest proportion of problems was reported in the anxiety/depression dimension by respondents being homeless 1–3 years and in the dimension pain/discomfort by respondents being homeless 4–6 years.</p>

<title>Variation in EQ-5D<sub>index</sub> in relation to social determinants and diseases</title>
<p>The variation in EQ-5D<sub>index</sub> by country of origin, degree and duration of homelessness, health-related behaviours, self-reported diseases, and self-rated health was analysed using multiple regression, controlling for sex and age (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1403494811435493">Table IV</xref>). Some of the results were not statistically significant, which might be due to the small sample size; however, trends of the estimates can still be seen. In all the models, women had lower EQ-5D<sub>index</sub> than men, and EQ-5D<sub>index</sub> decreased with age. In model 1, origin from countries outside Europe meant lower EQ-5D<sub>index</sub> than origin from Sweden. Respondents’ health status decreased with worse degree of homelessness and there was a significant difference in EQ-5D<sub>index</sub> between rough sleepers and homeless close to housing. Respondents’ health status also decreased with duration of homelessness, however, not significantly. In model 2, health-related behaviours were also added. Overall, the pattern was similar to that in model 1, but some effects were altered. In model 3, the effect of self-reported diseases was analysed. Those with a disease had lower EQ-5D<sub>index</sub> than those without, and the effect was largest for mental disease, followed by musculoskeletal system diseases and hepatitis C. In model 4, the EQ-5D<sub>index</sub> decreased with worse self-rated health.</p>

<title>Homeless persons compared with general population sample</title>
<p>As population-based postal surveys to the general population do not reach homeless persons, the present study attempted to include the homeless through face-to-face interviews and to compare their HRQoL with the general population. Overall, as expected, HRQoL was worse among homeless persons than in the general population sample: the homeless reported more problems, especially more severe problems, in all the EQ-5D dimensions and considerably lower EQ-5D<sub>index</sub> and EQ<sub>VAS</sub> score than the general population. However, there are important area and social differentials in HRQoL also within the general population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1403494811435493">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1403494811435493">29</xref>]. Among the homeless, most problems were reported in the dimension anxiety/depression while most problems were reported in the dimension pain/discomfort in the general population. The age gradient and sex difference in health seen in the general population were less clear among the homeless. In some EQ-5D dimensions (mobility, self-care, and usual activities) homeless women even reported fewer problems than homeless men, and higher EQ<sub>VAS</sub> score. This partly contradicts findings of two other studies which reported worse physical and mental health among homeless women than men [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1403494811435493">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1403494811435493">23</xref>]. Limiting longstanding illness was nearly three times more common among homeless persons than in the general population sample. Homeless persons had a 10-fold higher exposure to physical violence, reported more binge drinking and smoking than the general population, and a greater proportion had refrained from seeking health care and dental care or refrained from purchasing prescribed drugs, because of economic difficulties, in spite of a perceived need.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-1403494811435493">
<title>Health of homeless persons, explanatory variables</title>
<p>The homeless persons reported a high prevalence of both somatic and mental diseases, which may reflect both that mental disease may contribute to causing homelessness, and that diseases may be health consequences of being homeless, as found in other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1403494811435493">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1403494811435493">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1403494811435493">21</xref>]. Some of the diseases also mirror the high prevalence of drug abuse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1403494811435493">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1403494811435493">4</xref>]. In the regression analyses, when adjusting for other factors, there was an age and sex gradient in health, and country of origin outside Europe was associated with worse health status than being born in Sweden. The duration or degree of homelessness was not statistically significantly related to HRQoL as expected, which may be due to different factors, including the small sample size. In addition, homelessness may be more detrimental to health in the beginning of homelessness, and there may be a selection effect in surviving many years of homelessness. Our measure of degree of homelessness was based on the type of housing in the last night before the interview, which may have led to misclassification of degree of homelessness. Somatic and mental disease significantly lowered EQ-5D<sub>index</sub>; however, mental disease had the strongest negative impact on HRQoL.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-1403494811435493">
<title>Strengths and limitations</title>
<p>One strength of the present study is that the same person has conducted all but two of the interviews; another is that the questionnaire was mainly the same as in the population survey, which is one novel approach to including also hard-to-reach groups in an assessment of population health. However, the different modes of administration, face-to-face interview and postal survey, might have influenced the results. There are very few studies comparing mode of administration of the EQ-5D instrument: one study among AIDS patients showed that self-administration and interview administration yield similar results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1403494811435493">30</xref>]. Several studies using other health measures suggest that respondents reported better health during face-to-face interview situations than in postal surveys [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1403494811435493">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1403494811435493">32</xref>]. In our study, the homeless persons might have answered questions in the interview situation more positively, and hence their health status might be overestimated. Our sample was 155 homeless persons, including 32 women, which limits the statistical power of analysis. Although the composition of our study sample was similar to the national homeless survey, with regard to mean age, proportion of women, and proportion born outside Sweden [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1403494811435493">20</xref>], the representativeness of our study population still needs to be considered. As only those interviewees available and willing to participate were included in our study, the study sample of homeless persons was selected. Those homeless persons who were not interviewed were often in a bad shape, too ill or too intoxicated to participate, and were likely to have worse health than those interviewed, which might have led to an overestimation of the health status among the homeless in our study.</p>
<p>Hence, due to the interview situation and the selectiveness of the homeless sample, the difference in health status between the homeless persons and the general population might be underestimated. The degree of homelessness is difficult to define in a single dimension. Our measure of degree of homelessness was based on the type of housing in the last night before the interview. The national homeless survey had the same question, but referring to the preceding week. The degree of homelessness may be difficult to pinpoint, as the type of housing of respondents may vary from day to day. This measure should be further developed, and its shortcomings may partly explain the lack of significant associations between degree of homelessness and HRQoL.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>This study was one attempt to include also hard-to-reach groups in an assessment of population health. Homeless persons had considerably worse HRQoL than the general population and reported most problems in the dimension anxiety/depression. Some diseases may contribute to causing homelessness; others may be seen as consequences. Homeless persons are a vulnerable group in society. Further interview studies are needed based on larger samples of homeless persons to explore health determinants such as sex, age, socioeconomic factors, duration and degree of homelessness, and health-related behaviours among the homeless persons.</p>
