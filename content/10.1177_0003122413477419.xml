<abstract>
<p>Social epidemiologists Marmot and Wilkinson argue that relative deprivation is the dominant mechanism through which socioeconomic status (SES) affects mortality. If such an argument is valid, we would expect to consistently see the influence of relative deprivation in situations where two or more highly qualified and very similar individuals are nominated in a status competition, but only one receives the status boost conferred by winning. We studied mortality experiences of Emmy Award winners, Baseball Hall of Fame inductees, and presidents and vice presidents—comparing each to nominated losers in the same competition. Our findings and results of similar studies fail to show consistent advantages for winners. The association between winning and longevity is sometimes positive, sometimes negative, and sometimes nonexistent. We conclude that the critical processes determining the strength and direction of any status effect on longevity are changes in life circumstances that result from winning or losing, rather than the processes that inexorably flow from one’s relative position in a status hierarchy.</p>

<p>Could it really be that every rung one scrambles up the status ladder confers a significant mortality advantage? And if it is true, why should it be so? These questions are motivated by a very robust association between socioeconomic status and mortality that is so finely graded that each step up in income, education, or wealth is associated with lower mortality and better health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0003122413477419">Marmot 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0003122413477419">Phelan et al. 2004</xref>). This empirical finding poses what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0003122413477419">Adler and colleagues (1994)</xref> have dubbed the “challenge of the gradient.” How do we explain the incremental benefit associated with each finely graded level of socioeconomic status (SES)?</p>
<p>Critical to any explanation of health gradients is a firm understanding of what is most important about positional location in initiating the cascade of intervening social, psychological, and biological mechanisms that lead to disease and death. Some scholars argue that the essential aspect of social hierarchy is relative position or relative deprivation—that where one stands in relation to others explains the powerful effect of hierarchy on health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0003122413477419">Marmot 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0003122413477419">Wilkinson 2005</xref>). Others contend that crucial resource advantages are associated with finely graded differences in education, income, wealth, or occupational standing, and use of these resources reliably confers a mortality advantage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0003122413477419">Link and Phelan 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0003122413477419">Lynch et al. 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0003122413477419">Phelan, Link, and Tehranifar 2010</xref>). For this study, we identified circumstances that allow us to test key aspects of the relative deprivation argument as it is put forward in the work of social epidemiologists <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0003122413477419">Marmot (2004)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0003122413477419">Wilkinson (2005)</xref>. Specifically, we test (1) whether winning a high-stakes mobility contest, and thereby achieving a significant status boost, affects longevity and (2) whether such effects are consistently in the direction of increasing longevity, as relative deprivation theory would predict.</p>

<title>The Relative Deprivation Approach</title>
<p>A long tradition of theory and research has examined the sources and consequences of relative deprivation for circumstances other than health. Initially, the concept was not only useful, but was essential for understanding the morale of soldiers who experienced very different objective conditions of comfort and threat during World War II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0003122413477419">Stouffer et al. 1949</xref>). Research on relative deprivation that has accumulated since that time underscores its role as a critically important subjective reality with many personal and social consequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0003122413477419">Smith et al. 2012</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0003122413477419">Runciman (1966</xref>:10) provides an explicit definition of relative deprivation: a person is relatively deprived if<disp-quote>
<p>(i) he does not have X, (ii) he sees some other person or persons, which may include himself at some previous or expected time, as having X (whether or not this is in fact the case), (iii) he wants X, and (iv) he sees it as feasible that he should have X.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0003122413477419">Marmot (2004)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0003122413477419">Wilkinson (2005)</xref> link relative deprivation to health and mortality, claiming that these processes represent the most important determinants of the SES gradient in health. Consider <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0003122413477419">Marmot’s (2004</xref>:1) description of what he terms the Status Syndrome:<disp-quote>
<p>Where you stand in the social hierarchy is intimately related to your chances of getting ill, and your length of life. And this is not so much about material circumstances because you are not poor. You are employed. Your children are well fed. You live in a decent house or apartment.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>What is problematic about relative position, as per <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0003122413477419">Marmot’s (2004</xref>:1) argument, is that “you acknowledge that some are higher than you in the social hierarchy: they may have more money, bigger houses, a more prestigious job, more status in the eyes of others, or simply a higher class way of speaking.” This leads to what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0003122413477419">Marmot (2004</xref>:1) calls a “remarkable” finding concerning people’s placement in social hierarchies: “the higher the status in the pecking order, the healthier they are likely to be.”</p>
<p>According to the relative deprivation explanation, hierarchical position matters for health because “low social status is a stressor in itself,” as we are all “highly sensitive to feeling looked down on, being devalued, and being treated as second rate” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0003122413477419">Wilkinson 2005</xref>:75). The resulting stress affects health and mortality in two ways. First, stress (especially when experienced over long periods of time) can have direct physiological effects on the body that lead to pathogenesis, disease, and death. Second, stress can result in harmful health behaviors such as drinking alcohol in excess, eating food for comfort, smoking, or spending too much time on the couch watching television (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0003122413477419">Wilkinson 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>In its emphasis on exposure to stress across the life course, Marmot’s and Wilkinson’s explanation addresses concepts and theories that are also important in medical sociology and the sociology of the life course. The stress process would certainly incorporate relative deprivation as a potential source of stress, but it also points to a much broader band of socially situated circumstances in specifying SES-related sources of stress (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0003122413477419">Aneshensel 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0003122413477419">Pearlin 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0003122413477419">Turner, Wheaton, and Lloyd 1995</xref>). Similarly, concepts used in life course research, such as cumulative advantage and disadvantage, allostatic load, and weathering, presume that a diverse set of experiences accumulate to induce harmfully excessive levels of stress response hormones, thereby contributing to biological wear-and-tear and premature aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0003122413477419">Seeman et al. 2010</xref>). If <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0003122413477419">Marmot’s (2004)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0003122413477419">Wilkinson’s (2005)</xref> relative deprivation explanation is valid, it would speak to all these concepts and theories, winnowing the broad band of factors they identify to locate the essential driver of stress in the SES–health relationship in relative deprivation.</p>

<sec id="section3-0003122413477419">
<title>Evidence Used to Support the Relative Deprivation Explanation</title>
<p>In making their arguments for relative deprivation, Marmot and Wilkinson draw evidence from three sources: ecological studies of wealth and health between and within countries; individual-level epidemiologic cohort studies; and studies of nonhuman primates. With respect to ecological studies, they present evidence that, among countries with advanced economies, level of material wealth (measured by gross domestic product) is weakly correlated with life expectancy. At the same time, <italic>within</italic> each of these advanced economies, we see a gradient between measures of SES (education, occupation, or income) and mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0003122413477419">Wilkinson 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0003122413477419">2005</xref>). To the extent that absolute levels of material resources are important, one would expect a person directly in the middle of the income distribution in a relatively wealthy country (e.g., median income $50,000 per year) to be better off with respect to longevity than a person located in the middle of the income distribution of a less wealthy country (e.g., median income of $25,000 per year). But the evidence indicates that the life expectancy of these two hypothetical individuals is quite similar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0003122413477419">Wilkinson 1997</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0003122413477419">Wilkinson (2005)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0003122413477419">Marmot (2004)</xref> conclude that the absolute level of material resources within a society is less important for mortality than a person’s relative position within that society.</p>
<p>Second, the Whitehall cohort study of more than 18,000 British male civil servants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0003122413477419">Marmot et al. 1991</xref>) found a strong health gradient according to the men’s employment grade—not only for all-cause mortality, but for most major causes of death as well. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0003122413477419">Marmot (2004</xref>:41), “Whitehall is an ideal ‘laboratory’ in which to discover how subtle differences in social ranking can lead to dramatic differences in health, in people who are neither very rich nor very poor.” This is because many absolute differences in material circumstances are not an issue in this setting—none of the men in the study are extremely deprived in a material sense, their work is rarely dangerous or dirty, job security is very strong, and all the men receive medical coverage from the British National Health Service. Furthermore, Whitehall findings indicate that health behaviors cannot account for the observed gradient. For example, only a portion (no more than one-third) of the differences in coronary heart disease mortality by employment grade can be explained by obesity, smoking, leisure time activity, baseline illness, blood pressure, and height (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0003122413477419">Marmot 2004</xref>). In summary, because so many competing factors are held constant in this setting, and so many other biological and behavioral risk factors are held constant in the analysis, Marmot claims that being lower down in the social hierarchy—that is, being relatively deprived—is inherently stressful and harmful to health.</p>
<p>Third, with respect to nonhuman primates, a particularly influential study conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0003122413477419">Shively and Clarkson (1994)</xref> found that experimentally inducing changes in primates’ social position from dominance to subordinance produced dramatic increases in atherosclerosis—a key marker of cardiovascular disease. The study not only links a monkey’s relative position in the hierarchy to biological pathways that are associated with health, but it is persuasive because the experimental manipulation of status strongly supports the inference that the direction of cause is from status to health (social causation) rather than health to status (social selection). Moreover, material conditions, including food and shelter, were held constant in the experiment, thereby isolating relative position as the main factor distinguishing the animals from each other. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0003122413477419">Wilkinson (2005</xref>:75) concludes that “for monkeys and humans low social status is a stressor in itself . . . we are highly sensitive to feeling looked down on, being devalued and being treated as second rate.”</p>

<sec id="section4-0003122413477419">
<title>The Role of Material Resources, Health Behaviors, Environmental Exposures, and Medical Care in Explaining SES Gradients in Mortality</title>
<p>Marmot’s and Wilkinson’s reading of this evidence leads them to assign a lesser role to material resources (e.g., money), health behaviors (e.g., smoking, diet, exercise), environmental exposures (e.g., air pollution, occupational exposures to toxins), and medical care as explanations for an SES gradient in health. They acknowledge that these factors matter for health, but argue that they are not the key factors driving the SES gradient. With respect to material resources (income), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0003122413477419">Marmot (2004</xref>:75) suggests that above a certain level of privation, income becomes merely a means of “keeping score” in the competition for status (i.e., a relative deprivation mechanism), rather than an important resource that can be used to procure circumstances beneficial to health (i.e., a material resources mechanism). Marmot and Wilkinson also deem health behaviors to have only a modest impact on the SES gradient because controlling for such behaviors reduces—but does not eliminate—the gradient in the Whitehall study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0003122413477419">Marmot 2004</xref>) and other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0003122413477419">Lantz et al. 1998</xref>). Finally, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0003122413477419">Marmot’s (2004</xref>:82–83) view, the studies of monkeys suggest that health behaviors and medical care cannot account for gradients by social status:<disp-quote>
<p>Low status baboons don’t smoke, eat hamburgers, or fail to keep appointments with their doctors; high status baboons don’t read the health pages of the <italic>New York Times</italic> or belong to fitness clubs. Yet there is a social hierarchy . . . health differences are more likely to be due to something else related to social position in the hierarchy, rather than health behaviors or medical care.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Because, in their view, material resources, health behaviors, environmental exposures, and medical care are not the central factors producing SES gradients, and because of the evidence they identify supporting the importance of relative position, Marmot and Wilkinson claim that psychosocial factors associated with relative position are the critical determinant of health gradients. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0003122413477419">Wilkinson (1997</xref>:591–92) puts it, “mortality in developed countries is affected more by relative than absolute living standards” and “psychosocial effects of social position account for the larger part of health inequalities.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0003122413477419">
<title>Evaluating the Evidence for the Relative Deprivation Explanation</title>
<p>Certainly the evidence marshaled by Marmot and Wilkinson to support the predominance of relative deprivation is consistent with their view. However, the question remains whether this evidence can also be explained by resource-based explanations.</p>
<p>Consider first the ecological argument that <italic>within-country</italic> differences in mortality by SES are more prominent than <italic>between-country</italic> differences. We argue that an explanation focusing on social and economic resources is also compatible with this pattern of results. When people deploy SES-related resources, they do so within the context of a given set of health-related circumstances within countries. Individuals and groups jockey to avoid risk factors (e.g., pollution, violence, and substandard housing) and to gain access to protective factors (e.g., parks, fresh vegetables, and lifesaving cancer screens) within local contexts, thereby producing SES gradients within countries. This process does not generate between-country differences, because, for the most part, individuals and groups do not directly vie for advantageous health circumstances across international boundaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0003122413477419">Link and Phelan 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Second, with respect to the Whitehall study, the evidence in question is a residual effect of employment grade on mortality after controlling for health behaviors and biological markers. But such an effect is difficult to interpret because the list of health behaviors and their markers is much longer than the relatively short list of controls included in Whitehall or other studies. The assessment of behaviors is focused only on current behaviors and circumstances, thereby missing the impact of a lifetime of such behaviors, and under adjustment for such factors could occur to the extent that they are measured with error. For all these reasons, a residual association between employment grade and mortality does not represent strong evidence that relative position is inherently stressful and harmful to health.</p>
<p>Finally, although findings from some primate studies are compatible with the relative deprivation explanation, a comprehensive review in <italic>Science</italic> challenges the consistency of the association between social rank and health across animal species and populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0003122413477419">Sapolsky 2005</xref>). Specifically, the effect of rank on health depends on the social organization of a species, and even the culture of specific populations within a species. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0003122413477419">Sapolsky (2005</xref>:650), in some situations, “social dominance can be associated with the most stress-related pathology, whereas in other situations, this is a trait of subordinate individuals.” He concludes that “rank means different things in different species and populations” (p. 648). This conclusion challenges <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0003122413477419">Wilkinson’s (2005</xref>:75) claim that for monkeys and humans “low social status is a stressor in itself.” At least for animals, the effect of low social rank depends on the conditions that rank confers and is apparently not a powerful stressor in itself. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0003122413477419">Schieman, Milkie, and Glavin (2009)</xref> provide a demonstration of these principles in a sociological context in their analysis of the stress involved in balancing work with family and leisure activities. Whereas in most aspects of the stress process, higher status confers a stress-reduction or stress coping advantage, Schieman and colleagues show that some characteristics of high-status jobs (authority, decision-making latitude, skill, and earnings) are associated with greater intrusion into family and leisure life and thus greater stress in this role domain. We take two ideas about rank and health from this literature: (1) lower rank may not be inherently stressful (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0003122413477419">Sapolsky 2005</xref>) and (2) understanding the effects of rank requires understanding the conditions that rank confers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0003122413477419">Sapolsky 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0003122413477419">Schieman et al. 2009</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0003122413477419">
<title>The Relative Importance of Two Competing Perspectives</title>
<p>As described earlier, Marmot and Wilkinson see downward placement as inherently stressful—leading to poor health via behavioral and physiological pathways that ultimately create SES gradients in health. But <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0003122413477419">Sapolsky’s (2005)</xref> analysis of the animal studies suggests another possibility: there is nothing inherently stressful about lower placement. Rather, in some circumstances lower rank confers greater stress, whereas in other circumstances, higher rank induces greater stress. This alternative vantage point asks us to focus on the precise <italic>conditions</italic> that rank confers and whether these conditions determine the effects that rank will have (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0003122413477419">Sapolsky 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0003122413477419">Schieman et al. 2009</xref>). If a status boost brings salutary conditions, health should be enhanced; if it brings stressful or otherwise harmful circumstances, health should suffer; and if it brings nothing of health relevance at all, no health effects should be observed.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0003122413477419">
<title>Empirically Assessing the Relative Importance of Competing Explanations</title>
<p>Clearly, a major problem in evaluating the importance of these explanations is that relatively higher SES placement generally brings salutary consequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0003122413477419">House 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0003122413477419">Link 2008</xref>). Thus, in most circumstances (but not all, see below), predictions from the two explanations are the same: both predict that a higher position will lead to better health—albeit for very different reasons. Therefore, we need circumstances that allow a test of these competing explanations—circumstances where relative position is powerfully manipulated, but the life circumstances following the achieved status boost are very different. In light of this need, we study the longevity of winners and nominated losers in high-stakes competitions that confer enormous status rewards.</p>
<p>The competitions we chose are specific examples of a more general class of circumstances that conform to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0003122413477419">Turner’s (1960)</xref> concept of “contest mobility.” According to Turner, people compete to achieve high status in educational, occupational, artistic, and athletic realms through contests—like sports events—but that more generally include common, quotidian challenges such as tests, job interviews, maintaining large bottom lines, and submitting manuscripts to prestigious journals. Here, we focus on specific examples of contest mobility that allow us to test the issues of interest to us.</p>
<p>We conducted analyses of the Emmy Awards (the Emmys) for the television industry, admission to the Major League Baseball Hall of Fame, and U.S. presidential elections. Analyses of the Academy Awards (also called the Oscars) for the film industry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0003122413477419">Redelmeier and Singh 2001a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0003122413477419">2001b</xref>) and Nobel Laureates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0003122413477419">Rablen and Oswald 2008</xref>) were undertaken in previous research and are directly relevant to the issue at hand. Some people get these honored positions or awards and some almost do, but, ultimately, do not. Those who do not are very similar to the winners on pre-competition dimensions, such as occupation, education, talent, and drive to succeed in their chosen profession. Among these otherwise relatively similar individuals, a large gap in relative status is created between winners and nominated losers due to the prestige of winning. This situation naturally constructs a design feature that allows a test of the central issue we wish to understand. In these situations, status is powerfully manipulated and, if relative position is the most important reason for health gradients by SES, the winners should live longer than the losers.</p>
<p>The potential for honorific awards to provide evidence about the role of relative status in longevity was brought forward in a provocative article by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0003122413477419">Redelmeier and Singh (2001a)</xref>. They reported that Academy Award-winning actors and actresses lived significantly longer (more than three years longer on average) than actors and actresses who were nominated for—but did not receive—the awards. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0003122413477419">Marmot (2004</xref>:21) saw these results as significant support for the relative position approach, describing it as a “natural experiment” in which differences in status were induced in otherwise quite similar individuals.</p>
<p>Subsequent research revealed a methodological bias in Redelmeier and Singh’s analysis that favored winners over losers because of an inappropriate start time for follow-up. An immortality–time bias occurred because the analysis credited an Oscar winner’s years of life before winning toward survival subsequent to winning. Due to the analytic approach rather than any true effect of winning or losing, the years before winning are “immortal years” because the person had to live through them in order to ultimately win (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0003122413477419">Sylvestre, Huszti, and Hanley 2006</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0003122413477419">1</xref></sup> In a reanalysis that avoided this bias by starting the survival contest at the time of the win (or loss), winners’ advantage was reduced to one year and reached statistical significance at only the .10 level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0003122413477419">Sylvestre et al. 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Additionally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0003122413477419">Redelmeier and Singh (2001b)</xref> examined the survival of screenwriters, comparing those who won Academy Awards to those who were nominated but did not win. This time, the <italic>losers</italic> lived an average of three years longer than the winners despite an immortality–time bias favoring winners. More recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0003122413477419">Rablen and Oswald (2008)</xref> reported data comparing Nobel Prize winners for chemistry and physics to nominees who never won for the period 1901 to 1950. Results showed a statistically significant difference, with winners living between one and two years longer than nominees. Clearly, a relative deprivation explanation would have been strongly supported by consistent results across these three studies. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0003122413477419">Marmot (2004)</xref> provides an interpretation of the screenwriters study that is consistent with relative deprivation, but he acknowledges that the fact that losers live longer than winners in this competition is potential counter evidence for the relative deprivation explanation and states that more data are required.</p>
<p>Our empirical analysis provides such further evidence by examining three additional situations that compare award winners to otherwise very similar nominated losers. It would be instructive to consider status competitions enacted in more ordinary circumstances, but several features of the competitions we studied make them appropriate for the issue at hand. First, because of the great interest these competitions garner and the competitors’ fame, it is possible to accurately and systematically collect information with almost no loss to follow-up about both the contest and winners’ and losers’ mortality experience. Second, the specific contests are examples of a more general set of mobility contests (e.g., tests, admission to desired schools, job interviews, procurement of tenure or partnership in a firm) that are a very common means of achieving status mobility for ordinary citizens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0003122413477419">Turner 1960</xref>). Third, our tests directly address a critical and salient point in the debate about the origins of the gradient: Why should there be a difference between the very top and the level just slightly below the top? As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0003122413477419">Marmot (2004</xref>:2) put it, “Why should educated people with good stable jobs have a higher risk of dropping dead than people with a bit more education or slightly higher status jobs?” Fourth, the circumstances we study confer a distinct design advantage over more common status contests because we not only know who won, but also who was nominated and almost won. This allows a test of the consequences of winning versus losing among people who are quite similar on many pre-competition attributes. Fifth, as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0003122413477419">Table 1</xref>, the selected status contests allow us to make predictions about the relative importance of different explanations for the mortality experience of winners and losers.</p>

<title>Hypotheses Concerning the Mortality Experience of Winners and Losers of Status Competitions</title>
<p>First, as described earlier, a <italic>status-based relative deprivation perspective</italic> emphasizes the inherent effects of relative position and leads to the prediction that winners will outlive losers in all three of the competitions described in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0003122413477419">Table 1</xref> (Row 1). Evidence consistent with these predictions would strongly support the relative deprivation perspective, because these competitions alter the relative status of people who are otherwise very similar with respect to SES.</p>
<p>Second, a <italic>selection hypothesis</italic> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0003122413477419">Table 1</xref>, Row 2) suggests that something about winners causes both victory and a longer life. We mention a selection hypothesis but would find the status-based relative deprivation hypothesis more compelling in the event that, as both hypotheses predict, winners consistently lived longer than losers. The plausibility of selection is reduced because, as mentioned earlier, the design compares people who were very similar to one another on multiple characteristics (i.e., occupation, income, success, and skill sets) before the award.</p>
<p>Third, a <italic>null effects hypothesis</italic> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0003122413477419">Table 1</xref>, Row 3) predicts no difference between winners and losers because the important factors in the relation between SES and health are different from relative deprivation and not strongly manipulated in these circumstances. Winners and losers are simply too similar on the SES factors that really matter—educational attainment, occupational prestige, and income—to observe any differences in mortality experience. Small, nonsignificant longevity differences across the status competitions would be consistent with a null effects hypothesis.</p>
<p>Fourth, a <italic>life circumstances hypothesis</italic> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0003122413477419">Table 1</xref>, Row 4) predicts that effects of winning will vary according to the life conditions a victory brings. This hypothesis is consistent with arguments by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0003122413477419">Sapolsky (2005)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0003122413477419">Schieman and colleagues (2009)</xref> that health effects of status are dependent on the social circumstances that status confers. To separate this perspective from the relative deprivation approach, we chose to study status competitions that would be similar in conferring an enormous status boost, <italic>but differ in the circumstances that a victory confers</italic>. Below, we describe why circumstances following a win might confer a mortality advantage to Emmy winners, no advantage to Hall of Fame inductees, and a mortality disadvantage to elected presidents.</p>
<p>Winning an Emmy—like winning an Oscar—is important for contract renewals, salary raises, additional screen time, future (and better) television and movie opportunities, and other benefits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0003122413477419">O’Neil 2000</xref>). Any added work might bring some additional stress in terms of being overburdened, but the benefits render substantial resources to cope with those stresses. As actor John Larroquette (who won an unprecedented four consecutive Emmys in the 1990s) noted: “There’s no doubt that having an Emmy precedes you through the door. In my case, it precedes me <italic>everywhere</italic>. . . . They’re [Larroquette’s four Emmys] a bell ringer that makes people pay attention to your work” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0003122413477419">O’Neil 2000</xref>:6). Winning opens tremendous opportunities relevant to an actor’s current and future occupational standing and remuneration.</p>
<p>In contrast, baseball players are admitted to the Hall of Fame at an age (mean 48.8 years) roughly similar to the age of many Emmy winners when they win (mean 44.6 years), but, for baseball players, induction occurs after their playing careers are over. The similar age means that winners and losers are exposed to any consequences that might ensue at nearly the same age and for roughly the same amount of time in their lives. But for baseball players, the award occurs after their careers are over and thus has no bearing on their future opportunities as players. Unlike the Emmys, Oscars, or Nobel Prize, winning does not signal a current competence (as a hitter, pitcher, or fielder) that employers would compete to procure. Of course, induction likely leads to an increment in autograph signings, product endorsements, and speaking fees. Although the income from these sources can be substantial, it is not nearly as large as the amounts one would expect if the award signaled a current competence in baseball playing skills. Winners’ life circumstances could change in some ways relative to the men who are nominated but do not win, but the award of being inducted, which has no direct monetary compensation associated with it, is less likely to have a strong influence on subsequent jobs, living conditions, or power in day-to-day activities than an award one can receive while active, like an Emmy.</p>
<p>Finally, for presidential and vice presidential candidates, winning an election undoubtedly alters life circumstances in innumerable ways, including some that could compromise health. Victors experience enormous danger from the threat of assassination, as well as extreme stress from doing a very difficult and demanding job. Former President Bill Clinton, quoted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0003122413477419"><italic>Time Magazine</italic> (2004</xref>:35), put it this way:<disp-quote>
<p>Almost all of the mistakes I’ve made in my life, personal and public, happened to me when I was so tired I could hardly lift my arms above my shoulders. It’s not fashionable to say, but it is true. And I’ll bet it is true in the George Bush White House. I bet it’s true in every White House that has ever existed.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>In addition to testimonials like Clinton’s, we sought to anchor our hypothesis about harmful mortality effects in some objective evidence. We reasoned that presidents, because of their education, income, and pre-presidential job status, should live longer than the average male their age. Using data on men who served during the twentieth century and who had died by 2008 (William McKinley through Ronald Reagan), we compared the survival of presidents and vice presidents after their first inauguration to the survival of the average male of the same age at the time of the inauguration, using U.S. Social Security life tables available for this period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0003122413477419">Bell and Miller 2005</xref>). The 15 presidents lived an average of 1.9 years <italic>less</italic> (16.7 versus 18.6) and vice presidents the same number of years (16.8 versus 16.8) when compared to the expected life span of the average male of the same age at the time of inauguration. Considering all presidents who died of natural causes, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0003122413477419">Olshansky (2011)</xref> used French mortality data for comparisons of U.S. presidents who lived before the U.S. life tables were available (and U.S. tables for the rest) to determine that, despite being a highly educated, well cared for, privileged group of men, presidents (73.0 years) showed no survival advantage from birth over the average man (73.3 years). Clearly, this small piece of evidence cannot confirm assertions about the dangerous and stressful nature of the president’s job, but, when considering not only actual assassinations but assassination attempts (e.g., Theodore Roosevelt, Gerald Ford, and Ronald Reagan) and presidents’ stress-related health conditions while in office (e.g., Franklin Roosevelt dying in office from a stroke), it does give us some basis for forming hypotheses grounded in such an assertion.</p>
<p>In summary, we have identified distinctly different circumstances about which Marmot’s and Wilkinson’s relative deprivation theory makes different predictions than do alternative explanations. Each of the status contests we study will provide facts that bear on these predictions, thereby achieving a test of the relative importance of the theories that generated these predictions.</p>

<title>The Emmy Awards sample</title>
<p>Each year since 1948, several thousand members of the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences have identified nominees and selected winners for awards categories offered for U.S. programming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0003122413477419">O’Neil 2000</xref>). Using two comprehensive sources—the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0003122413477419">Academy of Television Arts and Sciences’ (2010)</xref> official website and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0003122413477419">O’Neil’s (2000)</xref> <italic>The Emmys: The Ultimate, Unofficial Guide to the Battle of TV’s Best Shows and Greatest Stars (3rd Edition)</italic>—we identified all nominated performances by actors, singers, comedians, and other personalities who appeared in front of the camera during prime-time programming. With these criteria, we identified 1,335 performers from 62 Emmy ceremonies (1948 to 2009) who had been nominated for at least one Emmy, 519 of whom we classified as winners by nature of them having won at least one Emmy during this period. We collected data on the year of each performer’s first nomination and, among winners, the year of their first Emmy award. We obtained additional biographical data on performers’ year of birth, race/ethnicity, and vital status or year of death (as of January 1, 2010) from the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0003122413477419">Internet Movie Database (2010)</xref> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.imdb.com">http://www.imdb.com</ext-link>).

<title>Baseball Hall of Fame sample</title>
<p>The Baseball Hall of Fame honors players who have shown outstanding performance during their professional careers. For this study, we consider baseball players in the major leagues playing between 1920 and 1980. We chose a start date of 1920 because the Hall of Fame did not begin inducting players until 1936, so players from years prior to 1920 were likely to have been inducted posthumously. We selected the end date of 1980 because many players from more recent cohorts are not yet eligible to be considered for the Hall of Fame and their generally young age yields very few years at risk for mortality.</p>
<p>Players are inducted into the Hall of Fame through evaluation and recommendation by either the Baseball Writers Association of America (BBWAA), the old-timer’s/veteran’s committee, or the now-defunct Negro League committee. We restricted our Hall of Fame sample to players inducted by the BBWAA<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0003122413477419">2</xref></sup> who were alive at the time of induction. Using these selection criteria, we identified 88 players who were inducted by the BWAA between 1936 and 2010 and who played between 1920 and 1980 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0003122413477419">National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Players who received votes toward induction into the Hall of Fame but were never inducted constitute the <italic>nominee</italic> group. From a total of 521 nominees, we selected a random sample of 200 players for the Hall of Fame nominees in this study. Two nominees (Goose Gossage and Bruce Sutter) were subsequently inducted (and included as winners) while this article was in preparation, yielding a final nominees sample of 198. To be included in this sample, all players who died had to have done so after retiring from baseball.</p>
<p>We determined the vital status of all members of the Hall of Fame group (<italic>N</italic> = 88) and the random sample of nominees (<italic>N</italic> = 198) on January 1, 2010 using several professionally managed, highly reputable print and Internet sources (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://Baseballlibrary.com">Baseballlibrary.com</ext-link> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0003122413477419">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0003122413477419">Forman 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0003122413477419">National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum 2010</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section13-0003122413477419">
<title>Presidential and vice presidential sample</title>
<p>Using biographical data compiled from Internet websites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0003122413477419">Leip 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0003122413477419">Whitehouse Home Page 2010</xref>), we ascertained vital statistics for every major party candidate who ever ran for the offices of president or vice president of the United States. We defined a major party as any party that ever won an election (Federalist, Democratic-Republican, Democratic, National Republican, Whig, and Republican) and included nominees of parties who ran before their party won its first election. We selected January 1, 2010 as our cutoff date for assessing age and vital status (alive versus deceased) and constructed four groups—president, vice president, presidential candidate, and vice presidential candidate—assigning each individual to the highest status attained. For example, John Adams, who served as both vice president and president, was coded as <italic>president</italic>; Al Gore, elected as vice president, but who also ran as a presidential candidate and subsequently lost, was coded as <italic>vice president</italic>. We chose this approach because, from a relative deprivation point of view, the highest status achieved represents the maximum status boost a person experienced. From a life circumstances point of view, losers are not exposed to the stressful conditions that winning induces. This decision leads to a fair test of the different perspectives, but we also controlled for a variable indicating whether, after achieving the highest position a person would ever achieve, an individual subsequently lost a race for either a higher position (e.g., Al Gore) or a position at the same level (e.g., Jimmy Carter). Controls for this variable produced no appreciable change in the direction or significance of the results reported here.</p>
<p>Our final sample consisted of 146 candidates (43 presidents, 33 vice presidents, 31 presidential candidates, and 39 vice presidential candidates). Of these 146 individuals, four—all presidents—were assassinated (Abraham Lincoln, James Garfield, William McKinley, and John F. Kennedy). Consistent with the argument that winning shapes life circumstances, we kept the four assassinated presidents in the sample to reflect the fact that election increases the risk of a murderous attack; we also report results of a competing risks approach that separates the deaths into those due to assassination and those due to other causes.</p>

<title>Pre-competition Differences between Winners and Losers</title>
<p>As described earlier, because each competition takes place within an occupation, one dimension of SES is held constant in all of our analyses. Additionally, because we restricted our samples to individuals successful enough to have been nominated, other pre-competition dimensions of SES are likely very similar as well. Winners will, of course, be different on some other factors, such as the number of votes received in the competition or, for baseball players, performance indicators that lead sportswriters to vote for induction. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0003122413477419">Tables 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0003122413477419">3</xref>, and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0003122413477419">4</xref> compare winners and losers on potential pre-competition differences that are available. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0003122413477419">Table 2</xref> shows no statistically significant differences between Emmy winners and losers in terms of race/ethnicity, gender, or year at first nomination.

<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0003122413477419">Table 3</xref> shows that baseball players inducted to the Hall of Fame played to older ages and, as expected, scored higher on a measure of performance. The performance measure is the sum of standardized batting average and standardized slugging percentage for batters and the sum of standardized won/loss record and standardized earned run average for pitchers. Despite significant differences between awardees and nominees, there were large areas of overlap in the distributions of both age during last year of play and performance, suggesting that meaningful matches were available for statistical comparison.</p>
<p>Looking at the presidential data, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0003122413477419">Table 4</xref> shows no statistically significant differences in age, educational attainment, or year of the status competition (described below). Presidents and vice presidents were, however, more likely to have experienced multiple elections than the men (and two women) they beat. This variable could represent conditions that follow from an initial win and thus something we should count as a consequence of victory. However, it also indexes survival in the face of stress and danger before we begin to follow this group for survival (see rationale for start times below), and thus is something we need to control for.

<title>Discrete-Time Hazards Model</title>
<p>We tested differences in survival for winners and losers in each of the three different samples using discrete-time hazards models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0003122413477419">Yamaguchi 1991</xref>) estimated in Stata 11 as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0003122413477419">Rabe-Hesketh and Skrondal (2008)</xref>. This approach allowed us to test whether the relationship between the hazards of dying and being either a winner or a loser changed the longer people survived. Additionally, it allowed us to calculate the probability of dying at each year following the status competition and thereby estimate the median survival time for winners as compared to losers. Both of these benefits of the discrete-time hazards model are not shared by the somewhat more common Cox proportional hazards model.</p>
<p>We modeled individuals at discrete time points (e.g., τ = 1,…, τ = <italic>t</italic>) that correspond with duration in years from the status competition. Individuals were observed until death or the last age observed in the dataset. The proportion of individuals surviving at time τ = <italic>t</italic> is the <italic>survivorship</italic> probability <italic>S</italic>(τ) and is derived from the hazards of mortality <italic>p</italic>(τ) as follows:</p>

<p>The conditional probability <italic>p</italic>(τ) of dying at time τ = <italic>t</italic> given that one has survived until τ = <italic>t</italic> − 1 is referred to as the (discrete-time) hazard of mortality. We tracked individuals’ vital status by defining a dependent variable <italic>y</italic> at each time τ = <italic>t</italic>, in which <italic>y</italic> takes the value of either 0 or 1 depending, respectively, on whether the individual was alive or deceased in that year <italic>t</italic>. We defined a variable <italic>duration</italic> that indexes the time points τ = <italic>t</italic> in which vital status was assessed. The variable <italic>status</italic> distinguishes between winners and losers in the status competitions. The hazards of mortality <italic>p</italic>(τ) were then associated with our main variable of interest, <italic>status</italic>, using the statistical regression model:</p>

<p>In this model, we also controlled for a matrix of variables that are depicted here as <bold><italic>X</italic></bold> and that include the static, pre-competition characteristics we described earlier as differing between winners and losers. For the presidents and vice presidents sample, <bold><italic>X</italic></bold> also includes a time-varying control for the total number of previous elections, which was updated at each duration time-point.</p>
<p>Any link function for binary data can be used to model the relationship defined in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula2-0003122413477419">Equation 2</xref>. We used the logistic function, thereby implying that the covariates are linear in the log-odds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0003122413477419">Maddala 1983</xref>). The parameterization of the discrete-time hazards model denoted in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula2-0003122413477419">Equation 2</xref> involves proportional hazards equivalent to the Cox model. In contrast to the Cox model, a discrete-time model allows us to test the assumption that the hazards of mortality for winners and losers are proportional over time by assessing the statistical significance of an interaction between the variable <italic>status</italic> and the variable <italic>duration.</italic> In findings not shown, we determined by this method that the interaction between <italic>duration</italic> and <italic>status</italic> was not statistically significant in any of the three samples, and thus the hazards of mortality for winners and losers were in fact proportional over time.</p>
<p>Estimation of hazards models in each of the three samples requires construction of the vital status and duration variables denoted in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula2-0003122413477419">Equation 2</xref>. To best answer the questions of interest in this study, we did not start to assess survival from age zero because, by doing so, the majority of hazards would predate the age at which exposure to a status change occurred. Starting to assess survival from age zero or from any time before the status change of interest occurred induces immortality bias—the problem that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0003122413477419">Sylvestre and colleagues (2006)</xref> identified in a reanalysis of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0003122413477419">Redelmeier and Singh’s (2001a)</xref> study of Oscar-nominated actors. To avoid this problem, we identified a starting point from which winners’ and losers’ life experiences are hypothesized to take different shapes. For the Emmy Award sample, this starting point is the year of the performer’s first award for winners and the year of the first nomination for those who never won. We defined vital status and duration since the starting point in each year until the performer’s death or until the end of the observation period (January 1, 2010). Because performer’s age at the starting point differs by about two years for winners and losers, we controlled for respondent’s age at first win or nomination for winners and losers, respectively. We also controlled for the year in which the first win or nomination occurred, thereby adjusting for differences in survival associated with the time-period of the status competition. As a consequence of these controls, our estimation of the survival probability associated with winning (versus losing) is independent of, and thus no longer potentially confounded by, these variables.</p>
<p>For the Hall of Fame sample, we used the end of the player’s last season as the starting point for the analyses. We assessed vital status and duration in each year until the player’s death or until the end of the observation period (January 1, 2010). As described for the Emmy sample, we controlled for the player’s age and the year in his last season to adjust for cohort and period differences in survival. Finally, for the presidential sample, we followed candidates from the election year of their last highest bid for office until the end of the observation period (January 1, 2010). As described earlier, candidates who were elected to the vice presidency or presidency, but subsequently experienced an unsuccessful last election, were followed from the year of their last <italic>successful</italic> highest bid for office. For example, former Vice President Al Gore’s last successful election was in 1996, so despite his unsuccessful bid for the presidency in 2000, he was observed from 1996 through 2010 for a total of 15 person-years. As in the other samples, we controlled for candidates’ age and the year at their last highest (successful) bid for office. In all three analyses, in addition to controls for age and year at the time of the status competition, we controlled for any variable that shows a significant difference between winners and losers (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0003122413477419">Tables 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0003122413477419">3</xref>, and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0003122413477419">4</xref>).</p>

<title>Emmy Awards Sample</title>
<p>The first two rows of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0003122413477419">Table 5</xref> report findings for the differences in the hazards of dying for actors and actresses who won Emmy Awards compared to nominees who never won. Using the hazards regression model, we are able to examine the difference in survival controlling for age, year of first nomination, gender, and race/ethnicity. The hazards ratio (HR) for winners (HR = .77) is significantly lower than for nominees, meaning that Emmy winners experienced a 23 percent reduction in mortality risk compared to nominees. Our finding that the hazards of mortality are proportional for winners and losers indicates that this 23 percent reduction in mortality risk is observed for winners regardless of the number of years since the Emmy Awards competition. We examined whether this effect of winning varied by gender, race/ethnicity, year of nomination, or age at nomination and found no evidence—in the form of significant interaction effects—to indicate that it did so. Using predicted survival probabilities calculated from the hazards regression model estimates, we calculated the median number of years that winners and nominees survived after their first Emmy nomination. Our calculation indicates that the reduction in mortality risk for Emmy winners translates into a 2.7-year advantage in survival.</p>

<title>Baseball Hall of Fame Sample</title>
<p>The second set of findings in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0003122413477419">Table 5</xref> show differences in survival for baseball players who were inducted into the Hall of Fame versus players who were nominated but never inducted. The results shown are with controls for age, year of the last season played, race/ethnicity, and a measure of playing performance. As the hazards analysis shows, there is no significant difference in survival between inductees and nominees (HR = 1.12; n.s.). Performance as a baseball player, the variable showing the largest pre-competition difference between the two groups, is nonsignificantly associated with shorter survival. When we excluded performance from the analysis, the effect of induction (HR = 1.36; n.s.) remained nonsignificant and in the direction of shorter survival for inductees. No significant interactions between induction and age at the beginning of the follow-up period, race/ethnicity, last season played, or performance level as a player were evident. Inductees’ median survival time was two years less than nominees who were not inducted, but this difference was not significant. Moreover, not only was the effect nonsignificant, but, to the extent it was expressed, it showed a slight advantage for losers over winners; this leads us to strongly question the existence of a beneficial effect of winning in this competition. We conclude that the status conferred by Hall of Fame induction or nomination has very little bearing on longevity.</p>

<sec id="section21-0003122413477419">
<title>Presidential and Vice Presidential Sample</title>
<p>The last set of findings in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0003122413477419">Table 5</xref> show differences in survival for elected presidents and vice presidents compared with individuals who ran for these positions but never won. We initially found that, after controlling for age at last election, year of last election, and total number of presidential and vice presidential elections, the risk was greatest for presidents (HR = 2.11, <italic>p</italic> ≤ .05), followed by vice presidents (HR = 1.69, <italic>p</italic> ≤ .10) and vice presidential candidates (HR = 1.21, n.s.), with presidential candidates as the reference category. Because differences between presidents and vice presidents were nonsignificant, as were differences between losing presidential and vice presidential candidates, we combined the groups into winners and losers.</p>
<p>When we combined winning (elected) candidates (presidents and vice presidents) and compared them to both groups of losing candidates (nonelected presidential and vice presidential candidates), the hazard ratio for winning candidates was HR = 1.66 (<italic>p</italic> ≤ .05) with controls (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0003122413477419">Table 5</xref>), indicating a 66 percent increase in mortality risk (without controls HR = 1.55, <italic>p</italic> ≤ .05). Using the survival probabilities estimated from this hazards model, we found that this increase in mortality risk for elected officials translated into a 5.3-year disadvantage in survival. Some part of this trend toward higher mortality for elected officials was due to the danger of assassination in this group. If we implement a competing risks model using multinomial logistic regression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0003122413477419">Pintilie 2006</xref>), the hazard ratio for causes of death other than assassination is significant at <italic>p</italic> ≤ .10 (HR = 1.53). The hazard ratio for assassination is very large but not significant with only four cases of assassination.</p>
<p>We also conducted analyses to determine whether the personal risk associated with winning dissipated over time. Although point estimates for the hazard ratio were larger for the period during and shortly after office than they were for later periods, in no case were the hazard ratios significantly different for the periods tested. We also found no evidence to indicate that effects were modified by an individual’s age or the calendar year in which the competition took place. Still we urge caution in the interpretation of the hazard ratios as the confidence intervals are quite large and the effect size and significance somewhat dependent on the model specification.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>At the outset, we drew attention to a robust association between socioeconomic status and longevity and to the finely graded nature of that association. Responding to this “challenge of the gradient” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0003122413477419">Adler et al. 1994</xref>), social epidemiologists <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0003122413477419">Marmot (2004)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0003122413477419">Wilkinson (2005)</xref> constructed theoretical explanations that strongly favor relative deprivation in accounting for the SES gradient in mortality. In doing so, both scholars see the role of material factors, health behaviors, environmental exposures, and health care as secondary to relative deprivation as explanations for the gradient. We reasoned—as did <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0003122413477419">Marmot (2004)</xref>—that circumstances in which status differences were powerfully manipulated among individuals who were otherwise quite similar would provide an excellent test of the relative importance of these ideas. We chose three status competitions that produce these circumstances: the Emmy Awards, the Baseball Hall of Fame, and U.S. presidential elections. Analyses of these three contests, in conjunction with two conducted by Redelmeier and Singh of Academy Award-winning actors and actresses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0003122413477419">2001a</xref>) and screenwriters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0003122413477419">2001b</xref>), and one of Nobel Prize winners conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0003122413477419">Rablen and Oswald (2008)</xref>, provide six tests of Marmot’s and Wilkinson’s idea that status differences are the most important determinants of SES gradients in longevity. We now consider the implications of these six tests (ours and others) for the four hypotheses set forth in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0003122413477419">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<title>The Status-Based Relative Deprivation Hypothesis</title>
<p>Results of our empirical analysis and other studies could have strongly supported the relative importance of the Marmot–Wilkinson explanation over alternatives if winners consistently outlived losers. But this did not occur. Instead, some winners lived longer than losers; others experienced no survival advantage; and still others lived fewer years than those they beat. As such, the evidence does not support the idea that relative status dominates over other factors in producing the SES gradient in longevity. Relative status likely plays some role in explaining health inequalities, as there is evidence to indicate that it induces resentment and anger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0003122413477419">Smith et al. 2012</xref>) and these emotions have been linked to health in observational studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0003122413477419">Kawachi et al. 1996</xref>) and to health-relevant biological markers in experiments (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0003122413477419">Moons, Eisenberger, and Taylor 2010</xref>). Research thus indicates that both subjective perceptions of material conditions and material conditions themselves play a role in health inequalities. Our findings provide a useful corrective to an overemphasis on relative deprivation as it has been expressed in recent, highly influential explanations of health inequalities. Relative deprivation likely plays some role in health inequalities, but it is not, as our results suggest, so dominant as to relegate other processes to secondary importance.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section24-0003122413477419">
<title>The Selection Hypothesis</title>
<p>When broadly considering associations between socioeconomic factors and health, social selection processes are critically important and likely explain some part of the association. Indeed, studies across the life course show that early indicators of health predict socioeconomic attainment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0003122413477419">Case, Fertig, and Paxson 2005</xref>), and quasi-experimental assessments of the relative importance of social selection and social causation suggest that selection matters greatly for some health outcomes (schizophrenia) and plays a lesser role for others (depression and substance use) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0003122413477419">Dohrenwend et al. 1992</xref>). As stated earlier, one desirable aspect of our study design is that, just before the competition takes place, winners and losers are very much alike with respect to critical characteristics that might influence their health and select them into social positions. As such, many of the factors that would form the basis of selection explanations are held constant in our design and, to the extent that they are, cannot confound our results. That said, our design remains quasi-experimental and cannot definitively rule out subtle differences between winners and losers in factors such as personality, attractiveness, or capacity for self-promotion.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, when we consider the full pattern of results, we do not find selection to be a compelling explanation. The selection hypothesis predicts that winners have characteristics that lead to their winning ways and that these characteristics are also related to their subsequent mortality. But winners failed to outlive losers across all status contests. To create a selection explanation that fits these collective empirical findings, one would need to postulate a set of preexisting, life-enhancing characteristics that winners of Emmy, Nobel, and (marginally) Academy awards, losers of screen writing awards, and losers of presidential elections enjoy that their competitors do not. It is difficult to construct a selection explanation to fit these facts even after the facts are known. Thus, in light of the pattern of results actually achieved, we are led to question selection as the main source of the observed results.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section25-0003122413477419">
<title>The Null Effects Hypothesis</title>
<p>Before seeing any results, it might have been very reasonable to expect no difference in longevity between winners and losers. Winners and losers are really very similar in other respects, so why would there be any differences at all? Such a view would have been sustained if small, generally nonsignificant effects were found across the different circumstances studied. But as it turns out, there are some relatively large mortality differences between winners and losers, but not in a consistent direction.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section26-0003122413477419">
<title>The Life Circumstances Hypothesis</title>
<p>In interpreting results in terms of the life circumstances hypothesis, a useful concept is “life chances,” which emerged from the Weberian tradition and is defined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0003122413477419">Dahrendorf (1979</xref>:73) as “the crystallized probability of finding satisfaction for interests, wants and needs, thus the probability of the occurrence of events which bring about such satisfaction.” Our findings are consistent with—but do not fully support—the following possibility: conferral of high status to one person and not to another carries the potential to dramatically affect individuals’ life chances, acting as a kind of turning point in their life course trajectories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0003122413477419">Laub and Sampson 2003</xref>). In some instances, a substantial increment to status brings salutary consequences, as results for Emmy, Nobel, and (marginally) Oscar winners seem to suggest. In other instances, attainment of status has the opposite effect—it brings the possibility of exposure to health-harmful circumstances. For example, presidents are exposed to a very stressful job that confers a significant risk of assassination. Finally, in instances such as the Baseball Hall of Fame, even a substantial status boost can have a relatively modest impact on health consequential life chances. The conclusion that the important aspect is the circumstances status brings, and not status per se, is supported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0003122413477419">Sapolsky’s (2005)</xref> comprehensive assessment of research on social hierarchies among animals.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section27-0003122413477419">
<title>Implications for the Study of Stratification Processes</title>
<p>We used <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0003122413477419">Turner’s (1960)</xref> concept of contest mobility because it helped situate the particular situations we studied within a broader context of contests that boost the social standing of winners and leave losers in a lower status situation. Our study also reflects on the utility of the concept, which has gained ascendancy in recent years. Turner’s article was cited more often in 2010 than in any prior year, and more often in the past five years (2007 to 2011) than in any consecutive 10-year period before that (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0003122413477419"><italic>Web of Science</italic> 2012</xref>). Our work contributes to the general resurgence of this stratification concept by suggesting that, when enacted, mobility contests have far-reaching consequences extending beyond a move up the status ladder to other critically important life domains. Our work thus suggests the utility of studying a broad range of mobility contests for their potential linkages not only to health, but to a range of other domains of sociological interest (e.g., crime, housing, and life course developmental trajectories). Moreover, direct assessment of participants in such contests would allow further probing of the subjective and objective meaning of any social inequality they experience, further clarifying the issue addressed in this article.</p>

<sec id="section28-0003122413477419">
<title>Implications for Understanding the SES Gradient in Mortality</title>
<p>Our results provide two important insights for understanding the SES gradient in survival. First, status matters for longevity. It is not just relative position in a status hierarchy that matters for health, but the life circumstances that status differences create that have health consequences. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0003122413477419">Cockerham (2005)</xref> builds on Dahrendorf’s Weberian conception of life chances in proposing that life chances contribute to producing lifestyles (collective ways of being) that have relevance for health. In our research, winning versus losing―and thus, attaining status versus not attaining it—appears to be enormously consequential in shaping access to the different life circumstances that produce dramatically different mortality outcomes depending on the award.</p>
<p>Second, if status matters through its impact on the life circumstances it brings, then it follows that such life circumstances matter greatly for longevity. We found this to be true even when observing differences in life circumstances of people who were otherwise very similar in terms of such critical factors as chosen occupation, wealth, and aspirations for high status. If we extrapolate beyond the particular situations we studied to the full panoply of life circumstances that people encounter, it follows that differences in such circumstances have enormous influences on mortality.</p>
<p>But what are the implications of these considerations for the SES gradient in mortality? Our findings tell us that status can confer not only a substantial mortality benefit, but also a substantial mortality threat. If this is so, why should there be a finely graded association between SES and mortality? One avenue to understanding is to step back from the particular circumstances affecting a few status acquisition situations (like the status competitions we studied) and focus on the social distribution of life chances surrounding many situations. The idea is that, on average, higher status leads to life circumstances that are better for health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0003122413477419">Lutfey and Freese 2005</xref>). To be sure, there are countervailing mechanisms that put people with more status at higher risk and thus have an impact that runs counter to the general trend (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0003122413477419">Lutfey and Freese 2005</xref>). The risk of assassination when holding the position of President of the United States is a good example of how high status can lead to mortality threat. But as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0003122413477419">Lutfey and Freese (2005</xref>:1365) point out, even though countervailing mechanisms can work in the opposite direction, “the only requirement is that the effects of such mechanisms are cumulatively smaller than the mechanisms producing the fundamental relationship.” And, of course, there are very good reasons to expect that status-driven mechanisms that harm health will have a smaller cumulative effect than status-driven mechanisms that enhance health. People with more knowledge, money, power, prestige, and beneficial connections will, on average, deploy those resources individually and collectively in such a way as to enjoy a health advantage, thereby producing a finely graded SES-gradient in mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0003122413477419">Link and Phelan 1995</xref>).</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Rising to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0003122413477419">Adler and colleagues’ (1994)</xref> “challenge of the gradient,” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0003122413477419">Marmot (2004)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0003122413477419">Wilkinson (2005)</xref> proposed interesting and provocative explanations for SES gradients in health that emphasize relative status differences as the key factor. Their explanation focuses on the social psychological experience of downward placement in a hierarchy and places differences in material factors, environmental exposures, health behaviors, and health care in a secondary position. Certainly, Marmot’s and Wilkinson’s theories point to explanatory factors that have consequences in many life domains, but their assignment of prominence to such factors in the health domain is likely misguided. As indicated in our review of the literature, the arguments used to support their preferred, relative deprivation-based explanations and to discount alternative explanations can be reinterpreted to support a much broader inclusion of SES-related determinants of health. Moreover, when we isolate the status processes of relative disadvantage favored in their explanations, and test hypotheses consistent with these processes using data on the survival of winners and losers in high-stakes competitions, we find that these processes cannot explain our empirical findings. Our findings and review of the literature have encouraged us to focus less on the experience of relative status differences and to place more emphasis on the life circumstances produced by different status positions. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0003122413477419">Weber ([1921] 1978)</xref> noted, status or prestige in conjunction with knowledge, money, power, and beneficial social connections shape the nature of the life chances that people experience. In the long run, when considered across many different circumstances, these improved life chances produce salutary circumstances that increase health and longevity.</p>

<p>As described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0003122413477419">Sylvestre and colleagues (2006)</xref>, the bias results not from any substantive process such as selection into winning versus losing or the consequences of winning versus losing, but rather from the inappropriate counting of survival years.
