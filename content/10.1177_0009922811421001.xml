<abstract>
<p>Failure to thrive (FTT) in children is an important pediatric problem. Environmental and behavioral causes predominate, and detrimental effects on neurocognitive development are well documented. Multidisciplinary clinics designed to identify and treat FTT are effective but have not been widely adopted. A retrospective chart review was conducted of all patients with FTT seen at the authors’ large inner-city children’s hospital over a 40-month period, including those referred to a new multidisciplinary clinic. Over 40 months, only 75 children were referred and only 20 had moderate or severe FTT (<italic>z</italic>-score &lt;−2.0). Nutritional status improved with treatment, but the small number of referrals who were severely affected led to the closing of the clinic. Recommendations for evaluating and treating children with mild FTT in primary care settings and a standardized definition of FTT that warrants more intensive treatment would help ensure that children were referred and treated appropriately.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Despite the childhood obesity epidemic, undernutrition in children remains a significant problem that must be identified and treated. It is estimated that up to 5 in 100 infants and children in the United States have failure to thrive (FTT),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0009922811421001">1</xref></sup> a term used to describe children who are not growing as expected. More than 90% of cases in most series do not have an underlying medical cause, and virtually all medical causes are identified by a careful history and physical exam.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0009922811421001">2</xref></sup> Environmental and behavioral causes predominate, and detrimental effects on neurocognitive development are well documented.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0009922811421001">3</xref></sup> These children also have increased rates of infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0009922811421001">4</xref></sup> and behavioral problems, including impaired communication skills and attention deficit disorder.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0009922811421001">5</xref></sup> Children treated in multidisciplinary clinics experience a more rapid correction of FTT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0009922811421001">6</xref></sup> and improved cognitive testing scores<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0009922811421001">7</xref></sup> when compared with a traditional primary care setting. A multidisciplinary approach may reduce overall health care expenses, despite high staffing costs, by lowering hospital admission rates of children with FTT.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0009922811421001">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is important to identify and treat children with inadequate growth because of the adverse sequelae of FTT.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0009922811421001">8</xref></sup> Many factors contribute to a child’s cognitive development and it is likely that malnutrition is not the sole contributor to impaired cognitive development in children with FTT.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0009922811421001">9</xref></sup> When FTT was examined in the general population, rather than in exclusively low-income families, no adverse cognitive effects were identified.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0009922811421001">10</xref></sup> It is likely that neurocognitive deficits attributed to FTT are a result of both poor nutrition and the well-documented detrimental effects of poverty and psychosocial stress on child development.</p>
<p>Our Grow clinic was established in 2006 in a community-based practice affiliated with Morgan Stanley Children’s Hospital, a large, tertiary care children’s hospital in a low-income, immigrant community in New York City. It was modeled after the multidisciplinary Grow clinic at Boston Medical Center. The clinic accepted referrals for 16 months, but was then closed because of the small number of referrals and the mild nature of growth failure in those referred.</p>
<p>The objective of this report is to describe the growth characteristics, reasons for poor growth, and health services utilization of children referred from a tertiary care hospital–based clinic system to our Grow clinic for evaluation and management of FTT. A secondary goal was to estimate the prevalence of moderate and severe FTT in children without significant medical comorbidities in our catchment area by looking at the records of all children referred to Grow, Gastroenterology and Endocrinology clinics of the Morgan Stanley Children’s Hospital (CHONY), hereafter referred to as the GI and Endocrine clinics, respectively.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0009922811421001" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>Medical records were reviewed for all children referred to the CHONY Grow clinic between November 1, 2006 and February 29, 2008. Charts were also reviewed for children with environmental/behavioral FTT referred to the GI and Endocrine clinics between November 1, 2004 and February 29, 2008. Children at the GI clinic were considered for inclusion if they received a diagnosis of FTT, identified using the ICD-9 billing code for FTT, 783.41. Children at the Endocrine clinic were considered for inclusion if they had diagnosis of FTT, short stature or growth delay. All patients were insured through Medicaid or Child Health Plus or were seen on the self-pay sliding fee scale.</p>
<p>Exclusion criteria included the following: children with a medical condition that was considered to be the primary cause of their FTT; children without a height/length measurement recorded any clinic visit; children who were older than 8 years 2 months at their initial visit; children seen at the Grow clinic who were also seen at the GI or Endocrine clinics were excluded from the groups seen at the subspecialty clinics; children who were seen at both the GI and Endocrine clinics were included only in the GI clinic group. All Grow clinic patients were included in the study. Patients with private insurance (all from the GI and Endocrine clinic) were excluded.</p>
<sec id="section3-0009922811421001">
<title>Data Collection</title>
<p>Basic demographic information was collected from each chart reviewed, including date of birth, gender, insurance status, and zip code of residence.</p>
<p>The height and weight of each child included in the study were recorded at the initial visit and at 3-, 6-, 12-, and 18-month follow-up visits. For one child where no data were available for the first visit, height and weight from the next visit were used as the initial point.</p>
<p>When available, additional data were collected, including the number of visits, the child’s gestational age, possible causes for FTT, and country of origin of parents. Data were collected from all of the patient’s visits at the clinic.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0009922811421001">
<title>Cause of Environmental/ Behavioral Failure to Thrive</title>
<p>The categories for the causes of environmental/behavioral FTT were adapted from the Massachusetts Growth and Nutrition Program Report<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0009922811421001">11</xref></sup> (see table later in text). The causes were assigned through a post hoc analysis of the presumed causes of each child’s FTT as documented in the medical record at each visit. The following definitions were used for each category. “Nutritional information deficit” was defined as the use of false information for determining the feeding practice for or foods given to the child. “Overreliance on liquids” was presumed when the assessment/plan for the patient included the terms similar to “too much juice” or “advised to stop giving juice.” “Family stressors” included documentation of difficulties between the mother and father of the child, social isolation of the primary caregiver, illegal immigration status, or a chaotic home environment. “Maternal depression” was assigned when the record indicated that the mother was depressed. “Maternal child interaction, other” included any documentation of conflict or other difficulty in the relationship between the mother and child other than maternal depression, such as evidence of maternal anxiety during feedings. “Meal pattern/schedule problem” was defined as lack of structure to feeding schedule or a lack of a consistent environment for feeding. “Ineffective feeding, other” included inappropriate response to child cues, the late introduction of solid foods, inadequate structure at mealtime, or actions taken by the caregivers that delayed or prevented meals. “Parental lifestyle” was defined as documentation of substance use in the caregiver. “Food shortage” was defined as documentation of inability to afford food for the child or sharing Pediasure assigned to one child with other siblings. “Other” included all reasons that did not correspond to the above categories. “Unclear” was assigned when no causes of FTT were documented or the reason for FTT was documented as “unclear” by the team.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0009922811421001">
<title>Nutritional Status Indices</title>
<p>The calculation of 3 anthropometric indices (weight-for-age, height-for-age/length-for-age, and weight-for-height/weight-for-length) was conducted using the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) EpiInfo software (based on the CDC 2000 growth reference).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0009922811421001">12</xref></sup> A corrected age was calculated for premature infants up to 2 years of age and was used to determine the anthropometric indices.</p>
<p>For purposes of this study growth was defined categorically as follows: normal (<italic>z</italic>-score &gt; −1.00), mild malnutrition (−1.00 ≥ <italic>z</italic>-score &gt; −2.00), moderate malnutrition (−2.00 ≥ <italic>z</italic>-score &gt; −3.00), and severe malnutrition (<italic>z</italic>-score ≤ −3.0).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0009922811421001">
<title>Grow Clinic Evaluation and Intervention</title>
<p>In the Grow clinic, all children received an interdisciplinary assessment by a senior pediatrician, a nutritionist, a social worker, and an experienced developmental pediatrician. All were assessed for underlying medical etiology with a detailed history and physical and a simple set of lab tests that included: a complete blood count, lead, urinalysis, basic metabolic panel, and liver function tests. Other tests were occasionally done when suggested by the clinical history and physical exam. In addition, a full psychological evaluation was done by a clinical child psychologist in cases where it was deemed necessary after the initial evaluation. After assessment the team met to determine a treatment plan. In most cases, this included advice about strategies to increase food intake (such as structured mealtimes) and strategies to increase the calorie content of age appropriate foods. In selected cases families received training on feeding practices, social support services, and psychological treatment services as indicated by the interdisciplinary assessment.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0009922811421001">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>Analysis of variance of the mean number of clinic visits was used to examine the relationship between the severity of FTT and the number of visits. To evaluate treatment outcomes, a paired <italic>t</italic>-test was used to compare the weight-for-height and weight-for-age <italic>z</italic>-score at each follow-up visit to corresponding <italic>z</italic>-scores at the initial visit. PASW Version 18.0 (IBM, SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, 2009) was used for all analyses.</p>
<p>The protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board at Columbia University Medical Center, and a waiver of authorization was also obtained.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0009922811421001" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>A total of 359 charts were reviewed and 75 children met all inclusion criteria for chart review. This included 29 Grow clinic, 27 GI clinic, and 19 Endocrine clinic patients. The populations seen at the 3 clinics were similar. There was no difference in FTT severity between the Grow and GI clinic patients. In Grow clinic, GI clinic, and Endocrine clinic, a combined 20 children were seen over a 40-month period with moderate to severe FTT (weight-for-height <italic>z</italic>-score ≤ 2.0; Grow n = 11, GI n = 6, and Endocrine n = 3).</p>
<p>The analysis will focus on children seen at the Grow clinic whose demographic characteristics are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0009922811421001">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study describes a cohort of children treated in a large, urban medical center referred for evaluation of FTT. Over a 3-year period, 75 children with environmental/behavioral FTT were referred to the Grow, GI, and Endocrine clinics at our hospital, including 29 children referred during an 18-month period to the Grow clinic. This is a small number given that there are more than 110 000 pediatric visits per year to its primary care clinics and emergency department combined.</p>
<p>More than half of the children referred had normal growth or mild FTT. The number of children with moderate or severe FTT was remarkably small for a 3-year period given the large referral base—27% of all children referred for FTT to GROW, GI, or Endocrine over 3 years (n = 20). Though this referral sample is not an epidemiologic study of population prevalence, because our hospital is the major children’s referral center for the local community and because we reviewed records in the 3 clinics where children with FTT would commonly be referred, these low numbers suggest that the prevalence of FTT is not high in our community. A surveillance project, such as the one established in Boston emergency rooms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0009922811421001">13</xref></sup> would be important to document the true prevalence and to ensure that the highest risk children are engaged in services.</p>
<p>Our analysis of the treatment outcomes at the Grow clinic shows that the nutritional status of children improved, though the interpretation of these results is limited by the lack of standardization of the weight and height measurements in these children and by the small sample size.</p>
<p>As discussed above, the literature suggests that treating FTT can improve cognitive and behavioral outcomes and a multidisciplinary approach is the most effective treatment strategy. FTT is often associated with other factors that can have significant impact on development ranging from nutritional comorbidities such as iron deficiency to impaired mother–infant interactions resulting from maternal depression or the multiple stresses of poverty. It is likely that a diagnosis of FTT identifies a population of children at both nutritional and psychosocial risk. Multidisciplinary models of FTT treatment address both the nutritional and psychosocial needs of these families simultaneously.</p>
<p>The success of a multidisciplinary clinic in one study was attributed in part to its ability to ensure more visits and better follow-up by assigning a case manager to each patient.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0009922811421001">6</xref></sup> In our program, children were not assigned a case manager and more than half of the children in our study sample with moderate or severe FTT were lost to follow-up after 4 visits or less. Three of these 11 children had only one visit. The Medical Director of the Grow clinic reports that more severe socioeconomic stressors and complex psychopathology were seen in caretakers of some of the more severely affected patients, including multiple caretakers because of mothers having to work long hours (Melanie Gissen, personal communication). More severe socioeconomic and psychosocial stressors may be a reason that more severely affected children are more difficult to initially recruit into a treatment setting and explain the importance of case management.</p>
<p>Some argue that, to appropriately focus resources, children identified as having FTT should be assessed and then triaged to different treatment settings based on their degree of FTT and documented comorbidities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0009922811421001">14</xref></sup> In our study, 62% of our Grow clinic patients had a normal weight-for-height or mild FTT by weight-for-height <italic>z</italic>-score. Of these children, more than 50% had normal weight-for-age and height-for-age <italic>z</italic>-scores. None had significant comorbidities identified. Daniel et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0009922811421001">14</xref></sup> found that 51.5% (n = 50/97) of the children referred to a pediatric endocrine clinic for FTT caused only by “insufficient nutritional information.” This is similar to the percentage in our clinic if we merge the categories of “insufficient information” and “overreliance on liquids” (usually juice). They argue that these children should only be referred to specialists after a work up and initial intervention in a primary care setting, as focused education in a primary care setting is likely to be effective and specialist referral is not cost effective.</p>
<p>Our Grow clinic was closed after 16 months because of the belief that most of the children seen were not severely affected and could be taken care of in a primary care practice. There was also concern that emphasizing increased calorie intake could lead some children in the long term to develop obesity. There is, however, literature which suggests that even mild FTT is associated with significant adverse outcomes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0009922811421001">15</xref></sup> A recent, well-designed study confirms that children from low-income communities with mild FTT by weight-for-height <italic>z</italic>-score benefited from aggressive treatment at a multidisciplinary clinic, the effects of which are augmented by a home intervention.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0009922811421001">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>Most children referred for FTT to our large urban medical center have mild nutritional deficits. These may be best addressed, whether in a primary care or multidisciplinary setting, by assessing and addressing psychosocial stressors and teaching families about healthy eating practices (eg, organized mealtimes and less juice and sweetened beverages). Maximizing support for the family is likely to also be important.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0009922811421001">16</xref></sup> More severely affected children may need case management to prevent them from falling out of care. Further studies of FTT treatment should address the issue of what components of care lead to improvement in different subpopulations of children with FTT. Recommendations for treating and evaluating children with mild growth deviations in primary care settings and a standardized definition of FTT that warrants more intensive treatment would help ensure that children are referred appropriately and that resources are focused on the highest risk children. The potential adverse cognitive and behavioral outcomes in low-income children with FTT lend urgency to improving the definition, identification, referral, and treatment of these children.</p>
