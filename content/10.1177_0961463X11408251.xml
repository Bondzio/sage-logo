<abstract>
<p>Calendars and almanacs are objects designed to allow users to gain information about time that results from complicated calculations and observations, and to do so without having to replicate these cognitive tasks. Objects based on Gregorian calendrical logic have features that lead one to think that they represent homogeneous time, yet, adaptations of the Gregorian calendar as manifest in calendars and almanacs allow the homogeneous temporal framework to be used as a palimpsest for the representation of distinctive temporalities. This argument challenges the importance Anderson gives to homogeneous empty time as represented by newspapers in <italic>Imagined Communities</italic>, and offers an object-mediated alternative in which the counterpoint of temporal homogeneity and heterogeneity in the material manifestation of calendars and almanacs becomes a crucial means of imagining community. These issues are explored through historical evidence of calendars and almanacs in early modern Great Britain and ethnographic evidence from Trinidad.</p>

<body>
<p>In his book <italic>Imagined Communities</italic>, Benedict Anderson argues that homogeneous, empty time was a crucial component in the emergence of national identities. He states that this temporality was fostered by print media, particularly daily newspapers in which the association of dates, stories, and awareness of other readers created an imagined community: ‘The date at the top of the newspaper, the single most important emblem on it, provides the essential connection—the steady onward clocking of homogeneous empty time’ (2006: 33). The mass production of newspapers was also important—Anderson refers to them as ‘one day best-sellers’ (2006: 35) and emphasizes their consumption in solitude combined with their daily obsolescence. While performing such habits ‘each communicant is well aware that the ceremony he performs is being replicated simultaneously by thousands (or millions) of others of whose existence he is confident, yet of whose identity he has not the slightest notion’ (2006: 35). The appearance of universal chronicity in the daily, serial progression of dates on newspapers then promoted a sense of homogeneous empty time that allow the reader to conceptualize relationships of simultaneity with an imagined community.</p>
<p>In <italic>The Spectre of Comparisons</italic> (1998), Anderson further develops his idea that the temporality promoted by newspapers cultivated a sense of universal serialization and simultaneity. Yet in this analysis, Anderson develops the notion of a contrasting ‘bound’ seriality characterized by therhythm of censuses and elections. This bound seriality cuts against homogeneity. In it not all time is equal, and moments allow the definition of both temporal and social heterogeneity. Bound seriality contrasts with unbound seriality—the homogeneous empty time of newspapers. In developing the contrast, Anderson allows for the emergence of forms of temporal hybridity. Even though Anderson builds his case for homogeneous empty time through a discussion of newspapers in Europe, his framework ofbound in relationship to unbound seriality allows him to discuss the complicated forces acting upon the construction of national identity in postcolonial contexts. The structure of his argument is that the processes of nationalism that emerged in European print media was diffused by colonialism throughout the world, and these processes have become constitutive of collective identities in the process of decolonization and in the formation of identities after independence was achieved.</p>
<p>Anderson's argument privileges newspapers to account for the globalization of homogeneous temporalities. The ethnographic record on postcolonial contexts indicates the widespread distribution of the sort of temporality that Anderson describes. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0961463X11408251">Postill (2002)</xref> describes how an Iban community in Borneo has its activities organized by the times of radio and television programming—times quite similar to what Anderson describes in association with newspapers. Yet, the hegemony of homogeneous empty time seems incomplete. Examples such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0961463X11408251">Hoskins’ (1993)</xref> discussion of the conflicts over calendrical time keeping in association with identity in Kodi suggest that while the Gregorian calendar implicit in print media might be ubiqituous, its ubiquity should not be confused withhaving erased other time systems that emphasize heterogeneous or kairotic time.</p>
<p>Moreover, if one considers other print media that are used to chart time, particularly almanacs and calendars, one recognizes the homogeneous time was not completely dominant in Europe, and that the media of calendars and almanacs were well-adapted to capturing temporal heterogeneity inwhat seems to be a universalizing Gregorian calendrical logic. A focus on calendars and almanacs presents a far more complicated perspective on time than the homogeneous empty time extolled by Anderson, and adopted by others in discussing modernity (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0961463X11408251">Taylor, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Since the structure of Anderson's <italic>Imagined Communities</italic> involves the representation of ideas moving from Europe to organize ideas of nationalism throughout the world, to make my argument here I shall consider the emergence of temporal heterogeneity in relationship to print media in early modern Great Britain, and then explore a contemporary manifestation of this in Trinidad. The early modern period in British history is chosen for two reasons. First, that is the period of the emergence of newspapers, which play a critical role in Anderson's argument. Second, this period of British history also included the debate over the replacement of the English calendar with the Gregorian calendar—a debate in which many assumptions and ideas about the calendar where publicly discussed and debated and which moved Great Britain from calendrical heterogeneity to a homogeneity shared with the rest of Western Europe. As a former British colony, one would expect the influence of British approaches to the calendar in Trinidad to be strong, yet, as is the case with cricket (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0961463X11408251">James, 1993</xref>), the surface similarities simply allow the performance of difference.</p>
<p>The consumption of calendars and almanacs is different from newspapers. Newspapers are a daily product; almanacs and calendars are annual products. Newspapers are consulted by their consumers as part of a daily habit; calendars and almanacs are usually used to mark and note occasions. Newspapers are objects that are often discarded after being read; calendars and almanacs are kept and consulted for a year. A copy of a newspaper tends to be consumed by one person at a time; calendars are often displayed so that many people can refer to them. In England, from the 17<sup>th</sup>- through the early 19<sup>th</sup>-centuries, the circulation of almanacs dwarfed that of newspapers: in 1803 the <italic>Times of London</italic> had a circulation of 1000 in contrast to the 1802 circulation of the almanac <italic>Vox Stellarum</italic>, which was 365,000 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0961463X11408251">Capp, 1979</xref>: 263). With the spread of print technology into colonies, almanacs and calendars again seem to be of greater importance than newspapers. At least in India, and probably elsewhere, almanacs were among the first things printed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0961463X11408251">Jain, 1995</xref>: 70). In rural Trinidad where I have conducted field research, I have no firm statistics on the circulation of newspapers versus the number of homes with calendars, but did note that almost every home had a calendar, but not nearly every home had someone who regularly read a newspaper.</p>
<p>In contrast to the homogeneous time indicated by dates on daily newspapers, calendars and almanacs represent heterogeneous time. Moreover, inthese printed temporal artifacts, the sense of imagined community emerges out of a sense of contemporaneity combined with nationalistic and often irregular rhythms displayed in calendars and almanacs. Temporal homogeneity makes all nations alike, whereas the unique nationalist features materially manifest in printed calendars and almanacs displays distinctions.</p>
<sec id="sec1-0961463X11408251"><title>Cognitive artifacts and cultural knowledge</title>
<p>Calendars and almanacs are what Hutchins calls cognitive artifacts (1999). These are artifacts that incorporate cognitive functions into their design soas to ease the cognitive load on their users’ minds. The knowledge incorporated into calendars and almanacs is extremely impressive—representing over two millennia of accumulated astronomical and, in the case of almanacs, meteorological and astrological knowledge. Even a basic Gregorian calendar has implicit within it the determination of the Earth's revolution around the sun, the length of the months, the days of the week, and whether or not a year is a leap year. Despite all the knowledge embodied in these artifacts, they are quite easy to use. It is possible for someone to know on what day of the week November 5 will fall simply by consulting a calendar; and if one wanted to know the time of sunset on the day of the next full moon, one consults an almanac. Thus, calendars and almanacs incorporate a great deal of knowledge in an easy to use form.</p>
<p>Not only do calendars and almanacs represent their ideas in easy to understand ways, but they also hide aspects of their logic and function. For instance, most users of the Gregorian calendar are aware that it charts the duration of the Earth's orbit, but have little knowledge of how to chart that orbit by reference to the movement of where the sun rises or sets on the horizon. Moreover, few are bothered by the anachronistic survivals in the calendar. Tylor defines survivals as ‘processes, opinions, and so forth, which have been carried on by force of habit into a new state of society different from that in which they had their original home’ (1920: 16). In the case of the Gregorian calendar, the months of September through December have Latin roots that indicate that they are the seventh through the tenth months of the year, rather than their present position asthe ninth through the twelfth months. For that matter, the word ‘month’ is a remnant from the charting of lunar cycles—something that the Gregorian calendar's months do not do. In the case of almanacs, the arcane knowledge used to produce their astrological and meteorological predictions is purposefully and explicitly hidden from users to give them the veil of secrecy. The validity and usefulness of calendars and almanacs is taken for granted—they fall squarely into the category of cultural productions Miller calls ‘stuff’: they are ubiquitous (2010: 5), and they have ‘a quiteremarkable capacity for fading from view, and becoming naturalized, taken for granted, the background of frame to our behaviour’ (2010: 155).</p>
<p>The capacity of these objects to be ubiquitous frames for behavior while being taken for granted gives them the quality which Austin calls ‘speech acts’—a case where stating something is doing something (1962: 6). By stating it is April, calendars make it April for their users, and by stating that the planets are aligned in an auspicious way on a particular day, astrological almanacs make it so for their readers. The self-referentiality in theserepresentational objects gives them great power to frame and organize behavior—their representations are naturalized in such a way as to be beyond challenge. This makes the distribution of calendars and almanacs a powerful means of conveying cultural meanings, imposing social rhythms and cycles, and making the timing of cultural events seem significant. This iswhy one of the first accoutrements of independence is national holidays—the government of the new nation indelibly putting its stamp on the calendar. The potential to educate through controlling aspects of the calendar is also important in many religions—the sequence and timing of sacred ceremonies is often used to tell sacred stories, whether it be the death and resurrection of Jesus (Holy Week), the exodus of the Hebrews from Egypt (Passover), the victory of Prahlada over his aunt and father (Holi or Phagwa), or the death of Husayn (Ashura). Indeed, calendars become a means of maintaining religious identity across space through the temporal coordination ritual activity and the telling of the sacred stories associated with particular dates. For this reason, even though the Gregorian calendar seems ubiquitous, it co-exists with other religious calendars.</p>

<sec id="sec2-0961463X11408251"><title>Almanacs and temporal politics in 18th- and 19th-century Great Britain</title>
<p>At the beginning of the 21st-century, the calendar is largely taken for granted. During the 18th<sup>-</sup>century in Great Britain, debates about the reform of the calendar was fodder for many pamphlets and other publications (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0961463X11408251">Poole, 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0961463X11408251">1998</xref>). On the one hand, there was resistance against adopting a calendar identified with the Pope. On the other hand, the health and wealth of the nation were of central concerns in these debates and multiple calendars created complications for commercial transactions. Until 1752, there were two British calendars. The ‘new style’ calendar began its year on January first. The ‘old style’ calendar began its year on March 25, also known as Mary Day. These two calendars were forms of the Julian calendar which had been replaced in much of the rest of Europe and its colonies after 1582 by the Gregorian calendar. By 1752, the Julian calendar was running 11 days behind the Gregorian calendar.</p>
<p>At this time in Great Britain, there was a concern with prophecy and prognostication that created a popular demand for almanacs. The social significance of these almanacs emerged in the 17th-century, and was a result of their combining what Capp calls natural and judicial astrology (1979: 16). Natural astrology involved documenting the effect of astronomical cycles on agriculture and health. Judicial astrology was intended to guide people in their decisions. Consequently, almanacs were never just calendars, but included abundant information about feasts, holidays, commemorations, astrology, and astronomical cycles and convergences. For a period starting in the late 17th-century, Thomas suggests that almanacs outsold Bibles in England (1971: 292). Curry reports that in 1760, the sales of the fifteen major almanacs totaled around 476,000 copies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0961463X11408251">Curry, 1989</xref>: 100). These objects, and not newspapers or magazines, were by far the dominant means of charting time throughout the year.</p>
<p>With such high rates of circulation, almanacs were things at the center of debates about calendar reform—they were artifacts in which time reckoning and politics were merged. Largely because of anti-Catholic sentiments, Great Britain had maintained its own calendar as the rest of Europe adopted the calendar reforms of Pope Gregory XIII. By the 1730s, most English almanacs were tools to assist with converting from one calendrical system to the other. The convention followed by almanacs was to represent the two calendars in the two columns on the right hand page devoted to each month. While this representation was common among almanacs, the labels they gave to the columns differed: ‘English account’ versus ‘Roman account’ (Wing's <italic>Olympia Domata</italic>, and Moore's <italic>Vox Stellarum</italic>), ‘Julian’ versus “Gregorian” (Coley's <italic>Merlinus Anglicus Junior</italic>), and “English account” versus “foreign account” (Partridge's <italic>Merlinus Liberatus</italic>).</p>
<p>The debates and processes that led to British calendrical reform involved a protracted discussion that mixed astronomy, business, and theology and that embroiled many of the most notable thinkers and writers of the age.</p>
<p>The old calendar was astronomically incorrect. As the medieval British scientists Roger Bacon and Richard Grosseteste had demonstrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0961463X11408251">McCluskey, 1998</xref>: 198–199; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0961463X11408251">North 1983</xref>: 80–84), the Julian calendar had an error that amounted to a one day of drift away from the solar year every400 years. Knowledge of this error motivated the Gregorian reforms in 1582, and Great Britain eventually adopting those reforms in 1752. In a pamphlet published shortly after Great Britain reformed its calendar, William Parker wrote, ‘if the calendar vary from the sun's real course, which it was intended in effect to point out, the use thereof will be lost: Itwill become deceitful instead of being serviceable and very convenient to man’ (1753: 17). By 1752, this error amounted to eleven days since the Council of Nicaea in 325 AD. The Council of Nicaea had been used in the Gregorian reforms because the date and sequence of most feast days had emerged since then, as well as the determination of March 21 as the vernal equinox for purposes of determining Easter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0961463X11408251">Ziggelaar, 1983</xref>: 223). The British calendar reforms adopted the Gregorian solution to the astronomical shortcomings of the Julian calendar—instead of a leap year every four years, years that were divisible by 100 but not by 400 were not leap years.</p>
<p>Issues that emerged from business practices also encouraged calendrical reform. Trade relied on bills of exchange—particularly the profitable trade with the West Indies. The problem was that different trading partners used different calendars. If a debt was to be paid between January 1 and March 25, the year in which it was due was in doubt, and there were courtchallenges over this very issue. For instance, in 1577 a case came before the Privy Council over a debt that was due January 15, 1578. The debtor claimed that the date was under the old style in which the year began March 25. This would, in effect, give the debtor an extra year to pay. The lender insisted that the year started in January, making the term of the loan one year shorter than what the borrower claimed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0961463X11408251">Ponko, 1968</xref>: 54).</p>
<p>The case just mentioned occurred before the Gregorian reforms. After 1582, much of Europe not only began its year on a date different than theold style English calendar, but had shifted its calendar 10 days in relationship to both the old style and new style English calendar. To make matters worse, some countries adopted the new calendar, some did not. As international trade expanded, this necessitated that merchants carefully note the calendrical conventions of every merchant in every port with whom they traded. This challenge gave rise to several guides advising merchants on how to handle bills of exchange in relationship to time and dates. Onesuch guide, by John Marius, contains a section titled ‘How to Reckon the Time’ which gives some indication of how complicated this the time challenge could be, and the necessity to rely on almanacs and calendars tied to specific ports rather than try to keep all the information in one's head:<disp-quote>
<p>A Bill of Exchange dated the second of March new stile, which is the twentieth of February old stile (except in Leape yeare, which will be then the twenty one of April) payable in London at double usance, will be due the twentieth of April old stile, and not the twenty second of April, as some do erroneously imagine, who would deduct the ten daies (to reduce the new stile to old stile) at the end of the double usance, and so they would go as far as the second of May new stile, and then backwards ten daiees, when of right theyshould go forwards from the date of the old stile, relating to the place where it is payable, and reckon the double usance from the very date of the Bill. (1655: 89)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>The 1752 edition of Wing's <italic>Olympia Domata</italic>, a popular almanac, expressed a pragmatic justification for the calendar reform: ‘Inconveniencies arise by the different Methods of Computation, to Merchants and to Persons corresponding with those Nations where the reformation of the Calendar is practiced, by Mistakes and Disputes which frequently happen in the Dates of Lending Accounts’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0961463X11408251">Wing, 1752</xref>:42). The growth of trade, then, meant the growth of calendrical confusion with financial consequences, but the reform was seen as alleviating these problems.</p>
<p>Adopting the Gregorian calendar solved the astronomical and financial issues, but was theologically and politically unpalatable to the English. TheGregorian calendar was Roman Catholic—a bad association in Protestant England. The distaste for Rome was made clear in the almanacs,with the title page of <italic>Merlinus Liberatus</italic> declaring on its title page in1721:<disp-quote>
<p>‘An ALMANACK for the Year of our Blessed Saviour’s Incarnation 1721. Being the First after LEAP YEAR, and from the Creation of the World, according to the best of Prophane History, 5670; but according to the HolyScriptures, 5682. And the 32d of our Deliverance by K. William from <italic>Popery</italic> and <italic>Arbitrary Government’</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0961463X11408251">Partridge, 1721</xref>: title page, emphasis in original).</p></disp-quote></p>
<p><italic>Poor Robin's Almanack</italic> directly linked its dislike of the Pope with itsdislike of the Gregorian calendar. On its title page for 1740 it says it contains a two-fold calendar:’viz. The good, old, true, plain, honest English Account, together with the New-fangled, Minute-splitting (or rather Month-splitting) Whimsey-Heads, Paper-feull'd, slender-witted, Pretendrical, Perkinical, Popish Account’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0961463X11408251">Winstanley, 1740</xref>: title page).</p>
<p>Some of the most popular holidays of the time, particularly Guy Fawkes Day, celebrated the foiling of Roman Catholic plots against the nation. Asthe November 1738 edition of the almanac <italic>Vox Stellarum</italic> describes Fawkes' conspiracy:<disp-quote>
<p>Gunpowder Plot designed to be acted November the 5<sup>th</sup>, 1605.</p>
<p>This horrid Design was contrived by Jesuits, Priests, and other Papists, who, by undermining the Parliament House, and planting there 36 barrels of Gunpowder intended, when both Houses were sitting, to have blown up the King, Prince, and all the Royal Family, with the Bishops, Nobility and theFlower of the Gentry of the whole Kingdom; all should at one Blow have become a Sacrifice to the bloody-minded Papists, a Villainy that no Age or Nation can parallel, and which was miraculously detected by the Finger of God, when the very Train was laid, and Fire almost put to it. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0961463X11408251">Moore, 1738</xref>: 29)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>The anti-papal sentiment was not simply about Guy Fawkes and the Gunpowder Plot—the Civil War of the century before had been fought, in part, because of Parliament's concern over excessive Roman Catholic influence in the Royal court. Consequently, the disgust expressed toward anything ‘popish’ contained many more meanings than simply the break between the Anglican Church and the Roman Catholic Church during the Reformation. The Pope was both the Antichrist and a threat to Great Britain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0961463X11408251">Spadafora, 1990</xref>: 119–120). In this context, almanacs did not just represent time, but also fanned anti-papal sentiments: Tycho Wing's <italic>Olympia Domata</italic>, Moore's <italic>Vox Stellarum</italic>, and Partidge's <italic>Merlinus Liberatus</italic> contained an anti-papal statements in most of their editions in the 18th-century, including the following astrological doggerel in <italic>Olympia Domata</italic> from August of 1738:<disp-quote>
<p>The Sun’s Eclipse this Month denotes great Ire,</p>
<p>And furious Mars contributes to the Fire:</p>

<p>In Great Britain, debate about the calendar reform gained momentum after 1700, when Leibniz created a plan that the Protestant states ofGermany could accept (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0961463X11408251">Leibniz, 1997</xref>: 807–810). In Leibniz's plan, Germany would adopt the Gregorian calendar's correction of the Julian calendar, but reject Roman Catholic Church's tables to determine the date of Easter using a church-decreed spring equinox which was always March21. The Roman Catholic tables were to be replaced by an astronomically determined equinox. In Leibniz's letters, one can sense the conceptual division he drew between science, on the one hand, and popery and popular custom, on the other: ‘Indeed, if Gregory had restored calendars to the true laws of the heavens, and had made astronomers their guardians, nothing could have been added to his foresight’ (1997: 807). Leibniz advised the Royal Society in England (1997: 807–810), but his recommendations weregreeted coolly, in part because of the growing hostility between himand Isaac Newton. By the May after Leibniz's letter, Flamsteed, the English Astronomer Royal, reported having a paper written by Newton annotated as ‘Mr Newtons [sic] paper in Answer to it [Leibniz's letter]’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0961463X11408251">Flamsteed, 1997</xref>: 823). This paper describes ‘the motions of the Sun and Moon from the Vernal Equinox’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0961463X11408251">Flamsteed 1997</xref>: 822). Since Newton saw the origin of Mary Day as connected with the vernal equinox, his proposal to begin the year on that day actually reflected the old British calendar. Newton was not merely content to criticize Leibniz's adoption of the Gregorian calendar for secular purposes, but proposed an astronomical solution to the calendar problem that was more accurate, albeit more complicated, than Leibniz's, and subtly nationalistic in its choice of thedate on which to start the year, namely, the first day of the year in the Old Style English calendar.</p>
<p>The adoption of the Gregorian calendar in Great Britain did not simply make the British calendar the same as the rest of Europe, however. Almanacs preserved distinctive British calendrical features—particularly nationalist holidays—and combined this with astrological predictions stated in the form of doggerel. This can be seen in the 1800 edition of <italic>Vox Stellarum</italic> which contained this rhyme for November:<disp-quote>

<sec id="sec3-0961463X11408251"><title>Trinidad's calendar</title>
<p>Superficially, it appears that two-island nation of Trinidad and Tobago uses the same calendar as Great Britain—after all, Trinidad and Tobago had been a British colony. Calling Trinidad a former British colony obscures the complexity of colonial processes and diversity of populations that settled there. As a colony it passed from Spanish to British rule in 1797, but at that moment, the majority of the population consisted of enslaved Africans working for French planters who had been invited by the Spanish to develop the island. After emancipation, the planters demanded colonial support for finding new populations of workers. This resulted in the immigration of indentured laborers from South Asia, China, the Middle East, and Portugal, with South Asia being by far the largest contributor. Among the South Asians were both Muslims and Hindus, each with their own calendrical system. Then, in the late 19th-century, Trinidad was joined to Tobago in a single colonial unit. Tobago had been a French then British colony, and had never received the numbers of South Asian indentured laborers as Trinidad.</p>
<p>The shared Gregorian calendar could lead one to believe that there is temporal homogeneity between Great Britain and Trinidad and Tobago. Yet, Trinidad and Tobago has made its own calendar distinct, and this distinction is materially manifest in the printed calendars that grace most Trinidadian homes and shops. Understanding the distinctiveness of Trinidad and Tobago's calendar and how material manifestations of the calendar are obtained shows that like 18th-century British almanacs, these objects are not embodiments of homogeneous time, but of heterogeneous nationalist time.</p>
<p>In almost every business and home in Trinidad one finds a wall calendar. Most of these calendars reflect relationships with businesses, in that one form of advertising used by businesses is to get calendars made with their information, and an image which they deem represents their identity. AsMiller has shown, in Trinidadian advertising, businesses seek to associate nationalism with their products (1997: 201). Miller's treatment of advertising focuses mostly on national brands and television and newspaper advertising with regard to which he notes a pattern that is also true of the calendars associated with these national brands, namely, the use of models who are brown-skinned and which do not reflect ‘the same range of physiognomy that might be met with in a street’ (1997: 206). Such calendars often have photographs of revelers during Carnival or women in bathing suits. Small businesses also use calendars to advertise—for some, it is the primary means of advertising other than word of mouth. These calendars sometimes adopt an approach that cultivates a particular clienteleand image of respectability through the choice of images, often religious, identified with a particular segment of the population, e.g. Hindu or Christian imagery. Most Trinidadians have access to multiple calendars—some with religious themes, some nationalistic, and some verging on soft pornography, so their choice of which one to hang on their wall of their home not only indicates some of their image of themselves in relationship to Trinidad, but also of the businesses they choose to endorse. Notsurprisingly, rum shops (agloss of a wide variety of liquor licenses) display calendars of the more pornographic kinds. The calendars on which Ishall focus, grace the homes of ‘respectable’ families in a cocoa-growing community in eastern Trinidad.</p>
<p>In addition to wall calendars, some Hindu homes have a specialized Hindu calendar or almanac. As I learned when interviewing devout Hindus about their holidays, this calendar/almanac is typically not hung on a wall, but stored. It is a reference to be pulled out and consulted whenthere is a need or an anthropologist to educate. These calendrical artifacts are typically organized in a Gregorian format in which Hindu holidays and astrologically auspicious days are indicated. The Hindu and Gregorian calendar logics are different. The Hindu calendar has lunar, solar, and sidereal elements. The months in the Hindu calendar are lunar, but since twelve lunar months is about eleven days shorter than a solar andsidereal year, the Hindu calendar has embolismic months every three years—an extra month added to the calendar. Moreover, the first day of the year in the Hindu calendar is anchored to celestial events, whereas New Year's Day in the Gregorian calendar is not. The Gregorian calendar measures a solar year, and uses an extra day in leap years to stay in reasonable relationship to the period of the Earth's rotation, but its beginning is arbitrary.</p>
<p>Most ‘Hindu’ calendars in Trinidad are actually Gregorian calendars containing Hindu holidays and auspicious days and displaying Hindu chromolithic art. This, in fact, is also true of calendars in India (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0961463X11408251">Jain, 2007</xref>). In Trinidad, the Gregorian emphasis is because the calendar's users are more familiar with the Gregorian calendar than the Hindu calendar. The result is a cognitive artifact that represents important Hindu days through a Gregorian medium. This is manifest in discussions of calendrical logic which I had with Hindu Trinidadians, such as the following excerpts from a conversation about the cycle of Hindu Holidays in which the man with whom I was talking moved back and forth between Hindu logics and Gregorian dates while referring to a ‘Hindu’ calendar he kept in his house:<disp-quote>
<p>In Hindi, the month does not carry 30 days or 31 days like the English … Divali is determined by the moon, well yes. We have Divali on the new moon day, in the Month of October, in the Hindi month of Kartik. Divali is new moon day. That is one, yeah. Then we have, le me see, I think I may have to get something to check here [he gets a ‘Hindu’ calendar—a Gregorian calendar that displays Hindu holidays and auspicious days]. Wehave the birth of Hanuman on a full moon in April. April, on a full moon, we had the birth of Hanuman [long pause while looking at a calendar in which Hindu holidays are displayed in a Gregorian rubric] Otherwise, you know we have according to the Hindu calendar everyday there is something … Now the fourth of October [this year] that is the full moon which they call Kartik Nahan, when they go out and bathe by the sea … Well, we celebrate Phagwa really on a full moon day also, that is in March month.</p></disp-quote>The type of calendar this man used is a representation that allows devoutHindus to be aware of important astronomical cycles as well as the relationship between important times in the Hindu calendar and the Gregorian calendar. The Hindu emphasis on astrology makes such references important. Not only should one know the major Hindu holidays, but also the auspicious days for major business transactions, for the holding of pujahs, and for weddings. In a community consisting of many small proprietors, the timing of business is particularly important. Consequently, for Hindus, the calendar is not merely a time-reckoning tool, but an astrological tool. As one man explained to me early in my fieldwork while showing me his Hindu almanac:<disp-quote>
<p>This is a calendar with dates listed on it as good for marriage, for building, and here it have bad days for sickness. In Hinduism, there are good and bad days for every thing. If a child is born on a bad day, then the pandit assigns prayers to be performed or else the child will become sick and die. When a Hindu is born, the family go to a pandit who then determines the name. Hedoes this by looking things up in a book. Hindus don’t do anything by guess, like time.</p></disp-quote>Several months later, I asked another man about the same issue—he was regarded as one of the leading authorities on Hinduism in the village:<disp-quote>
<p>P: Now you see in every month they have some of the days chosen, auspicious days. Now there is a next calendar here which again shows you the same auspicious days [he takes out an almanac, and points to different sections]: new building and construction days, you see? They have it here as simplified. Planting days below the ground, month, different agricultural days [he points to a different section]. So they show you, now this is eclipse and so on; this is the moon circle; bad days for sickness, accident, or childbirth—they have that also; Hindu wedding days.</p>
<p>R: How are these days determined?</p>
<p>P: They get that through a book they call the Patram. That is the guide, and that Patram has been printed in India by some of the people who study these things.</p></disp-quote>Such astrological concern in connection to one's prospects finds itself into literary representations of life in Trinidad, such as in V. S. Naipaul's classic <italic>A House for Mr Biswas</italic> (2001) where the protagonist's struggles are frequently linked to the astrological alignments of his birth.</p>
<p>Most wall calendars do not indicate all of that Hindu information, however, but they are still different from calendars in other nations. The reason for this has to do with the rhythm of the Trinidadian year. National holidays are important occasions for the celebration of nationalism. In his <italic>Imagined Communities</italic>, Anderson neglects national commemorations in favor of the homogeneous time of newspapers, but as he recognizes in some of his work on Southeast Asia (1990, 1998), it is holidays that serve as condensations of identities and histories, and the temporalities organizing these holidays can be quite different than European historical and calendrical logics. Trinidad and Tobago is remarkable for the shear number of its holidays that are moveable in the Gregorian calendar. These include the Christian-based celebrations of Carnival and Easter, the Hindu celebrations of Divali and Phagwa, and the Muslim celebrations of Hosay (the Trinidadian name for Ashura) and Eid. Each one of these holidays is an occasion for stories about Trinidad's ‘cosmopolitan’ composition. Carnival has been dubbed ‘national theater’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0961463X11408251">Hill, 1972</xref>). Since these are nationally recognized holidays, every wall calendar lists them. Moreover, while many of the holidays are religious in origin, they are recognized and celebrated by people of many faiths. The secular qualities of the Gregorian calendar allows the display of religious days without its users having to know the logics and theological justifications for those days. This can be seen in ecumenically-toned discussions about the timing of Divali close to the Roman Catholic celebrations of All Saints' Day and All Souls’ Day. Divali is celebrated with the lighting of lamps called deyas; All Saints’/All Souls’ with the lighting of candles. These holidays can all be explained with reference to ethnoastronomical traditions that note the waxing and waning of light throughout the year (see Birth, forthcoming)</p>
<p>The structure of the Gregorian calendar as an empty grid by means of which differences generated by other calendrical traditions can be displayed, allows the calendar to serve a dual purpose. It displays what Segal has called prenational distinctions (1994) but in a way that makes the collection of these distinctions themselves a means of distinguishing Trinidad and Tobago from other nations. This allows for the weak nationalism that Segal describes which locates ‘the disassociation of national citizens in the past that is continuous with the present’ (1994: 235), but does so in a nationalistic way.</p>
<p>Hindu and Muslim holidays are not really moveable, however—they are only moveable in relationship to the Gregorian calendar. The image of their moving is a consequence of their being represented by an object organized according to a Gregorian framework—if, say, Christmas was placed in a Muslim or Hindu calendar, it would appear to move. The organization of the artifact thus gives the impression of a holiday either remaining the same from year to year or moving. Within the logic of the Hindu and Muslim calendars, the holidays of these religions are directly and unvaryingly tied toastronomical events. The Islamic year is a strict lunar year of 12 lunar months. This makes its length around 354 days—11 days (or 12 in a leap year) shorter than the Gregorian calendar. Consequently, Muslim holidays shift in the same direction by 11 days relative to the Gregorian calendar, butwithin the Muslim calendar, Hosay is always the same day within the month of Muharram, and Eid is always the end of the month of Ramadan. In the Hindu calendar, Divali is always the new moon in the month of Ashwin; and Phagwa is always the full moon of the month of Phalguna. Even with the variations in timing in relationship to the Gregorian calendar, Hindu and Muslim holidays have clear patterns that create a distinctive rhythm of the year. This can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0961463X11408251">Figure 1</xref>. The only truly moveable holidays are Carnival and Easter, which are on cycles that only repeat with regard to the day of the year, month, and week every 532 years.
<fig id="fig1-0961463X11408251" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Polyrhythm of Holidays in Trinidad by Day of the Year, 1989-2007.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0961463X11408251-fig1.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p>The implication is that while Gregorian calendars are material media that represent homogeneous time, it is, in fact, filled with heterogeneous annual rhythms. The logics of the Hindu and Muslim calendars are not displayed in the Gregorian calendar, but their products shape how the calendar is used. Indeed, probably the most intersubjectively shared use of calendars in my fieldsite in Trinidad is to know when Carnival, Divali, Phagwa, and Eid will be, since these are holidays that are celebrated locally, and all holidays which do not fall on a fixed Gregorian date. The mixture of logics becomes apparent as people speak of the holidays that move in relationship to the Gregorian calendar. In one discussion of such issues, I was told: ‘We celebrate Phagwa on a full moon day also, that is in March month. You see, in March month this year gone we have Phagwa on the tenth of March, that was a full moon day’. This person placed Phagwa within the Gregorian month of March, but also was aware of its moving relative to the full moon of that month.</p>
<p>There is also a behavioral consequence to holidays moving in a Gregorian framework. This appearance of movement from year to year makes anyone who wishes to know when these holidays will occur reliant on a calendar. The movement of Carnival, Easter, Divali, Phagwa, Eid, and Hosay in the Gregorian calendar compel Trinidadians to use calendars, and not merely to use them, but to place calendars in locations where they are easily seen and consulted.</p>
<p>As a material object then, despite the homogenizing temporal logic of theGregorian calendar, Trinidadian versions of the calendar are used to keep track of rhythms distinctive to Trinidad. Moreover, it is the temporally homogeneous structure of the Gregorian calendar that produces the heterogeneous movement of holidays with timings originally determined by non-Gregorian calendrical logics. The global hegemony of the Gregorian calendar that seems to create a common calendar among nations has become a template for national calendrical differences. These differences are reproduced and distributed through printed calendars, and increasingly through electronic devices and downloaded applications. Lastly, states create their own holidays to display their own distinctiveness—the process of decolonization involved the choice of the day to become independent, and consequently, the anchor for a national holiday. If one consults the <italic>Oxford Companion to the Year</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0961463X11408251">Blackburn and Holford-Strevens, 1999</xref>) to get a sense of how these independence days are distributed throughout the year, one is struck by how rare it is for a single date to be attached to independence in two different nations. In the Philippines, there was a period in which its independence day was shared with the United States by virtue of it being granted independence on July 4th. But there was dissatisfaction with this date, so in 1964 the Philippines changed its independence day to July 12th—the date on which Filipino nationalists declared independence form Spain in 1898.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0961463X11408251"/>1</sup></p>

<sec id="sec4-0961463X11408251" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Anderson's representation of the emergence of nationalism which privileges homogeneous time represented by newspapers is incomplete. Nationalist sentiments are not cultivated by a representation of homogeneous time, andnewspapers are not the primary media for the distribution of time. In 18th-century Great Britain, it was not the adoption of the same calendar as the rest of Europe that fostered British identity, but the resistance to that calendar for almost 200 years, coupled with distinctive British features of that calendar. In Trinidad, the Gregorian calendar's homogenizing logic suppresses the Hindu and Muslim calendars at the same time as making Hindu and Muslim holidays seem moveable, but the objective manifestation of the Gregorian calendar is not homogeneous—not even from one year to the next. Instead, it represents the rhythm and movement of Trinidad's major religious holidays, with two of those holidays, Carnival and Easter, having very irregular patterns, and the other religious holidays, moving through the year in very predictable ways. Trinidadian time is polyrhythmic. The Trinidadian pattern parallel's Jain's description of India where ‘itis not so much the newspaper and the novel which provide a sense of shared time and experience at the level of the nation… but forms like the calendar’ (1995:72).</p>
<p>Through calendars and almanacs, it is not homogeneous time, per se, thatfosters the imagined community, but homogeneous time as providing atemplate shared among nations in which their heterogeneous times are displayed. Trinidadians can look at their calendars, and watch news broadcast from the United Kingdom and the United States and be acutely awarethat while they share the same calendar, they do not share the same holidays or social rhythms. Through the homogenizing temporalities of the news media combined with the heterogeneous rhythm of holidays, calendars represent Trinidadian distinctiveness. Based on the doggerel in 18th-century British almanacs, one can take a similar view of Great Britain for that period.</p>
<p>Even as electronic media overshadow print media for the presentation of dates and time, the heterogeneity produced by multiple religious calendars remains present through websites and applications for handheld devices that relate different calendars. Indeed, increasingly religious organizations are taking advantage of the internet to display and distribute their calendars. The current global distribution of the Gregorian calendar through physical calendars and electronic media could be viewed as a global hegemony of homogeneous time, but when examined more closely, it is a homogeneous calendar that is a palimpsest for the representation of temporal diversity. This diversity and its varying rhythms, in fact, compels people to acquire or electronically access calendars and sometimes also almanacs. These cognitive artifacts are taken for granted, ubiquitous and necessary for sociality. They are made necessary because of the variability of important days from nation to nation, religion to religion, and year to year even among those who use the superficially uniform Gregorian calendar.</p>
