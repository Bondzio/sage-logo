<p>Transcriptions are the orthographic representations of data in communication research. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1461445613476791">Lapadat and Lindsay (1999)</xref>, the choices that researchers make during transcription ‘enact the theories they hold and constrain the interpretations they can draw from their data’ (p. 64). Given this primary importance of transcriptions in research on interaction, Jenks’s timely publication has relevance for postgraduate researchers and scholars, especially in the field of conversation analysis (CA). The book is a comprehensive introduction to transcribing interaction, which covers both practical and theoretical aspects of the phenomenon.</p>
<p>As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1461445613476791">Ten Have (2007)</xref> argues, transcriptions are not data, but are ‘a convenient way to capture and present the phenomena of interest in written form’ (p. 95). In Chapter 1, Jenks addresses this problem and presents the grounds for the benefits of transcriptions. His following chapter further extends the phenomenon to a theoretical position, which has the potential to benefit novice researchers and can help to develop awareness of the politics and ethics of transcriptions. Jenks, in Chapter 3, successfully transfers his experience in teaching transcription and lecturing on interaction into words, by addressing issues related to technology, organization (e.g. line breaks, spacing) and content (e.g. font type, speaker representation). Having the potentially problematic practices of transcribing made clear by Jenks, researchers are given access to observed but not previously detailed practical concerns on ‘doing transcription’. This chapter, therefore, proves to be an invaluable resource for novice researchers, although already experienced researchers may not need to consult some of the sections.</p>
<p>Chapter 4 is a comprehensive resource for transcribing interactional and paralinguistic features of talk, which especially informs those carrying out classical interaction-based research on audio-recordings. The author includes transcription of basic interactional features such as turn-taking and pauses, as well as detailed paralinguistic features (e.g. intonation, stress and tempo). One significant advantage of this chapter is that different transcription conventions are introduced in order to avoid any kind of bias for a particular convention. Furthermore, throughout the chapter, Jenks explains the relevant interactional and paralinguistic phenomena from a comparative perspective by representing talk with CA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1461445613476791">Jefferson, 2004</xref>), Gesprächsanalytisches Transkriptionssystem (GAT; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1461445613476791">Selting et al., 2009</xref>) and Santa Barbara School (SBS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1461445613476791">Du Bois et al., 1993</xref>), respectively. Thus, readers are given guidance for each of the conventions, rather than being encouraged to pick a particular one based on the author’s preference. The chapter clearly exemplifies each interactional phenomenon with representative extracts from Jenks’s original corpus of transcribed interactions, further enhancing the originality of this book.</p>
<p>Chapter 5 is an invaluable resource for those who are working with video-recordings, as it presents a wide array of issues in transcribing nonverbal conduct with reference to body postures, facial expressions, gestures, gaze and proximity. The chapter not only introduces these visual resources, but also aims at teaching how they can be integrated into orthographic transcripts with illustrations from the author’s corpus. Jenks goes on to explore the representation of nonverbal features of talk by focusing on the media used to represent nonverbal behaviour, including video stills, drawings and digital renderings. Furthermore, the methods for representing sequentiality are explicated by making use of certain symbols and time stamps. Although the chapter is comprehensive enough and covers a great deal of detail on nonverbal conduct, more practical tips could be given on representing, for instance, head nods or shakes, since a variety of actions can be accomplished by these embodied resources in turns at talk. However, considering each phenomenon separately could go beyond the scope of this book.</p>
<p>Chapter 6 identifies and discusses advanced theoretical and practical issues in transcription. This chapter is a groundbreaking contribution to the field, which introduces new concepts like myopia in interaction research. The involvement continuum is of great importance for both advanced researchers and, especially, for doctoral students who may have a high level of involvement with data, but then end up with ‘tunnel vision’, which is defined by Jenks as making ‘representational decisions without carefully considering other transcription options’ (p. 91). Another risk with high involvement is ‘emotional attachment’, which may lead to the situation where researchers ‘condition themselves to hear and see data recordings in a biased, unproductive way’ (p. 92). Lastly, the quick start guide in the appendix is a comprehensive, yet precise and clear, map for early career researchers and postgraduate students.</p>
<p>All in all, this erudite guide to transcription in interaction research makes a significant contribution to the field by combining the theory and practice of transcribing as an indispensable aspect of communication research. This book has the potential to inform both novice and experienced researchers and can be used as an informative resource in postgraduate programmes in communication, sociology, psychology, anthropology, education and applied linguistics all over the globe.</p>
