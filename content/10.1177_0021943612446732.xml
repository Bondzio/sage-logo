<abstract>
<p>Large organizations involved in supply chain relationships increasingly are creating joint sustainability initiatives. The authors investigated sustainability-related discourse directed to and created by employees representing two organizations engaged in a supply chain relationship. CRAWDAD was used to map the concepts appearing in (a) each company’s sustainability-related training material, and (b) sustainability-focused interviews conducted with employees. Shared terms in the training documents included the following: corporate mission, corporate performance, corporate responsibility, product (healthy, sustainable, design), price, packaging, reduced waste, energy (reduction, use), and carbon emission. Overlaps between training texts and interview comments revolved around key corporate business goals as well as sustainability as the right thing to do. In the interviews, value statements (e.g., sustainability as the right thing to do or a “good way to do business”) were especially strong. Within both text and talk, the buyer-supplier relationship was emphasized. Areas of divergence between talk and text and between organizations were identified.</p>

<p>Increasingly, companies from Nike to Intel to Coca-Cola are engaging in sustainability initiatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0021943612446732">King, 2009</xref>). For some, these initiatives emerge as their leaders confront resource depletion, recognize new roles for business in economic and social change, or respond to demands from stakeholders (e.g., government, employees, shareholders, environmental groups, nongovernmental organizations [NGOs], citizens) for information and accountability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0021943612446732">Aras &amp; Crowther, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0021943612446732">CEOForumGroup, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0021943612446732">Green, 2008</xref>). Sustainability initiatives are how companies enact their sustainability goals through their operations and practices. Initiatives might include tracking and/or reducing greenhouse gas emissions, designing sustainable products, or seeking to eliminate waste. Such initiatives are increasingly important for many corporations as they move toward being perceived as sustainable, if not actually becoming more sustainable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0021943612446732">Salzmann, Ionescu-Somers, &amp; Steger, 2005</xref>). This shift represents a “paradigm shift in the global economy” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021943612446732">Anonymous, 2009a</xref>) and is part of a strategic business strategy as “Businesses of all sizes are recognizing that going green can save money, open up new avenues of revenue, and help keep employees, shareholders and customers happy” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0021943612446732">Mincer, 2008</xref>, p. R4).</p>
<p>Some corporate sustainability initiatives reach across the globe and deep into an organization’s structure. For example, in 2007, Walmart CEO Lee Scott gave a landmark speech (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0021943612446732">“Walmart CEO Lee Scott Unveils,” 2007</xref>), which put the world’s largest retailer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0021943612446732">Farfan, 2009</xref>) on the path toward sustainability. In 2009, his successor, CEO Mike Duke, pledged that Walmart (&gt;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0021943612446732">Anonymous, 2009b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0021943612446732">2009c</xref>) would broaden its sustainability efforts to all functions within the company, as well as geographically to all the countries where it has operations, working in conjunction with its suppliers (e.g., Unilever, Procter &amp; Gamble) and with NGO’s (e.g., the China Green Foundation). Walmart’s move is representative of a new trend—suppliers and buyers linked by supply chain relationships working together on sustainability-related initiatives, with each benefiting from the other’s efforts.</p>
<p>As this trend continues, it is likely to have a significant impact on business communication between suppliers and buyers as well as between employees. Thus, it is important to better understand areas of communication related to coordinated sustainability initiatives. That is the focus of our study. We investigate sustainability-related messages from two multinational corporations (MNCs) engaged in a supply chain relationship; these include messages both directed to employees and created by employees.</p>
<p>The current study adds to the growing, albeit limited, research appearing in communication journals (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0021943612446732">Bullis, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0021943612446732">Dawkins &amp; Ngunjiri, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0021943612446732">Gill, Dickinson, &amp; Scharl, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0021943612446732">Livesey, 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0021943612446732">2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0021943612446732">2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0021943612446732">Livesey, Hartman, Stafford, &amp; Shearer, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0021943612446732">Moreno &amp; Capriotti, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0021943612446732">Signitzer &amp; Prexl, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0021943612446732">von Kutzschenbach &amp; Brønn, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0021943612446732">Wexler, 2009</xref>) which address environmental sustainability and organizational communication issues. Communication-related topics also emerge in the broader scholarly literature investigating the language used in the definition of sustainable development and the content of corporate sustainability reports (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0021943612446732">Aras &amp; Crowther, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0021943612446732">Guthrie &amp; Farneti, 2008</xref>), corporate sustainability disclosures (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0021943612446732">Stiller &amp; Daub, 2007</xref>), corporate websites (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0021943612446732">Hunter &amp; Bansal, 2007</xref>), corporate social responsibility (CSR; e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0021943612446732">Hartman, Rubin, &amp; Dhanda, 2007</xref>), and in the broader natural resource debate (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0021943612446732">Bentrupperbaumer, Day, &amp; Reser, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Our descriptive study focuses specifically on internal organizational communication related to sustainability at two levels: organizational text (through corporate training materials) and individual talk (through interviews with key organizational members). We focus on <italic>discourse</italic> as a way to make linguistic sense (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0021943612446732">Kennoy, Oswick, &amp; Grant, 1997</xref>) of these organizational phenomena. An important distinction exists between <italic>discourse</italic> and <italic>Discourses according to</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0021943612446732">Grant, Hardy, Oswick, and Putnam (2004)</xref>. The <italic>discourse</italic> (i.e., the study of talk and text) we study here is informed by broader sociopolitical sustainability <italic>Discourses</italic> (i.e., the general and enduring systems of thought that influence the formation and expression of ideas within a historically situated time). Consistent with other recent research (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0021943612446732">Byrch, Kearnins, Milne, &amp; Morgan, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0021943612446732">Lourdel, Gondran, Laforest, Debray, &amp; Brodhag, 2007</xref>), we use a mapping approach to identify the constructs and linkages emerging within talk and texts.</p>
<p>Three research questions guide the current case study. First, how do two large MNCs operating within a supply chain relationship define and/or discuss sustainability in their training materials? We argue that these training materials have the potential to act as an agent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0021943612446732">van Dijk, 2006</xref>), or act in such a way as to make a difference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0021943612446732">Caster &amp; Cooren, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0021943612446732">Cooren, Thompson, Canestraro, &amp; Bodor, 2006</xref>). Management’s purpose in designing them is to shape employees’ social reality; partly in hopes of influencing how their employees discuss sustainability with their counterparts in the other organizations within their supply chain. The second research question expands on the employee-enacted connection between the MNCs. This question focuses on the extent to which the sustainability-related content appearing in corporate training materials overlap with how employees discuss sustainability. We expect overlap due to the employees’ exposure to the training materials and to the societal-level sustainability <italic>Discourses</italic> that inform both the employees’ and organizations’ discourse. However, employees have their own attitudes and can exert agency. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021943612446732">Alvesson and Karreman (2000)</xref> argue, “The ways in which subjects relate to discourse may be Teflon-like; therefore the language they are exposed to or use may not ‘stick’” (p. 1132). The third research question examines the extent to which the sustainability-related comments made by representatives of these two organizations overlap. Overlaps and disconnects at this level have important implications for conversations surrounding joint sustainability-related initiatives because differences of opinion about what sustainable development is do not “bode well for its achievement” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0021943612446732">Byrch et al., 2007</xref>, p. 26).</p>

<title>Organizational Discourse</title>
<p>In the <italic>Sage Handbook of Organizational Discourse</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0021943612446732">Grant et al. (2004)</xref> argue “that ‘organizational discourse’ has emerged as an increasingly significant focus of interest” (p. 1). Discourse can be approached at multiple levels from a variety of theoretical and methodological perspectives. Business communications regarding sustainability are not simply “corporate communication,” but rather multiple discourses at varying levels that operate simultaneously to negotiate the ongoing (re)construction of organizations’ shared social representations or ideology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0021943612446732">van Dijk, 1998</xref>). To prepare for our investigation into areas of convergence and divergence in how “sustainability” is discussed in the training documents of two MNCs and by their respective employees, in the next section we address (a) the relevant macro-level sustainability <italic>Discourses</italic>, (b) how organizations partly are discursive constructions created by human and nonhuman actors, and (c) factors influencing sustainability-related supply chain interactions.</p>

<title>The Macro-Level Sustainability Discourse</title>
<p>In this study we focus on sustainability. The most frequently used definition of sustainability in the scholarly literature focusing on organizations reads, “Sustainable development is development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0021943612446732">World Commission on Environment and Development, 1987</xref>, p. 43). However, sustainability and sustainable development remain abstract terms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0021943612446732">Byrch et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0021943612446732">Sheppard, 2003</xref>) surrounded by myths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0021943612446732">Lemonick, 2009</xref>). Therefore, it is important to begin by identifying some of the broader macro-level environmental <italic>Discourses</italic>, some of which specifically involve sustainability. While an analysis of the broad causes and consequences of macro-level environmental <italic>Discourses</italic> is not our primary focus, these <italic>Discourses</italic> interact with the organizational and employee <italic>discourse</italic> investigated in this study and so must be explicated. <italic>Discourses</italic> order and naturalize the world, are culturally standardized, and establish power/knowledge relations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0021943612446732">Fairhurst &amp; Putnam, 2004</xref>). Understanding the range of environmental <italic>Discourses</italic> is important because they are what shape how environmental debates are framed and what is considered to be a “reasonable” option (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0021943612446732">Dryzek, 1997</xref>) when environmentally related choices are being made.</p>
<p>Scholars (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0021943612446732">Dryzek, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0021943612446732">Prasad &amp; Elmes, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0021943612446732">Salzmann et al., 2005</xref>) have identified multiple and often conflicting environmentally related <italic>Discourses</italic> that exist generally as well as within the business community. For example, Dryzek described nine environmentally related <italic>Discourses</italic> in hopes of promoting “critical comparative scrutiny of competing discourses” (p. 20). Because each <italic>Discourse</italic> is based on different “assumptions, judgments, and contentions that provide the basic terms for analysis, debates, agreements, and disagreements” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0021943612446732">Dryzek, 1997</xref>, p. 8), they often conflict. Two of the nine relate specifically to sustainability (i.e., sustainable development, ecological modernization) and highlight the use of imaginative yet nonradical ways to “dissolve the conflicts between environmental and economic values” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0021943612446732">Dryzek, 1997</xref>, p. 14). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0021943612446732">Prasad and Elmes (2005)</xref> explored various <italic>Discourses</italic> related to natural resource management including corporate environmentalism (e.g., eco-efficiency) and reform environmentalism (e.g., sustainable development, ecocentric management). Using critical discourse analysis, they “examine the hegemonic dimensions of the language of pragmatism, showing how the discourse of practical relevance continues to limit rather than enhance a more ecologically viable condition” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0021943612446732">Prasad &amp; Elmes, 2005</xref>, p. 846).</p>
<p>Several additional sustainability-related <italic>Discourses</italic> exist primarily within the business community and the management journals, including the business case for corporate sustainability (see, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0021943612446732">Salzmann et al., 2005</xref>), CSR, and environmental and social governance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0021943612446732">CEOForumGroup, 2009</xref>). CSR reports are being repackaged as sustainability reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0021943612446732">Aras &amp; Crowther, 2008</xref>) and being taken to the global marketplace level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0021943612446732">Cruz &amp; Boehe, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Researchers (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0021943612446732">Aras &amp; Crowther, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0021943612446732">Dryzek, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0021943612446732">Hajer, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0021943612446732">Prasad &amp; Elmes, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0021943612446732">Springett, 2003</xref>) argue that often such sustainability-focused <italic>Discourse</italic> is misleading if not disingenuous. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0021943612446732">Prasad and Elmes (2005)</xref> contend that much of the current “green” rhetoric used by industry really is about actions which do little to protect the natural environment. Due to the strength of the argument for practicality, other environmental Discourses, even more mainstream arguments, are excluded because they are not practical enough. As a result, in the end neither is nature conserved nor is industrial pollution reduced.</p>

<sec id="section4-0021943612446732">
<title>Organizations, Discourse, and Agents</title>
<p>The competing macro-level <italic>Discourses</italic> surrounding the environment and sustainability make for a confusing array, leaving open the opportunity for corporate management to create and communicate their own version of sustainability to their internal and external stakeholders through business communication channels (e.g., training materials, sustainability reports). In this section, we discuss how organizations partly are discursive constructions created through the agency of both nonhuman and human actors and relate that discussion to the forces shaping how employees representing corporate partners within a supply chain relationship communicate about sustainability.</p>
<p>While many aspects of an organization are clearly material (e.g., property, plant, and equipment), within organizational studies “Scholars increasingly assert that organizations are discursive constructions because discourse is the very foundation upon which organizational life is built” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0021943612446732">Fairhurst &amp; Putnam, 2004</xref>, p. 5). “Organizational life” is the sum of the socially shared belief systems of the organizational members or their ideologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0021943612446732">van Dijk, 1998</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0021943612446732">van Dijk (2006)</xref> argues that “the primary sources and medium of ideological ‘learning’ are talk and text” (p. 133) and so understanding organizations as discursive formations is appropriate.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0021943612446732">Fairhurst and Putnam (2004)</xref> identify three interrelated approaches to organizations as discursive formations. The <italic>grounded-in-action</italic> orientation where “discourse and organization mutually influence one another across space and time” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0021943612446732">Bisel, 2009</xref>, p. 617) is the most relevant to our study. This orientation seeks to overcome the problematic dualism of focusing solely on structure or agency. However, a dualism is growing in this line of research (Bisel) between scholars who embrace the acted in structure (AIS) approach and those who embrace the structured in action (SIA) approach. Arguing these two positions are not incommensurable, Bisel calls for a dialectical approach. We seek to offer such an approach by examining the mutual influence of text (structure) and talk (action) within the same study. Highlighting different forms of agency allows us to see how nonhuman and human contributions interact and jointly compose and structure our world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0021943612446732">Cooren et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Some scholars “tend to argue for the primacy of texts and their ability to act and encumber, despite the discursive efforts of individuals” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0021943612446732">Bisel, 2009</xref>, p. 622). Indeed, Cooren and his colleagues (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0021943612446732">Caster &amp; Cooren, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0021943612446732">Cooren et al., 2006</xref>) urge researchers to expand beyond human agency to include additional forms of agency (e.g., textual, technological).</p>
<p>In this study we focus on training materials because they can <italic>do things</italic> which can contribute to the emergence of social and organizational processes by potentially making a difference in how employees behave (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0021943612446732">Fairclough, 1992</xref>). Consistent with a <italic>grounded-in-action</italic> orientation, attributing agency to the training materials is simply our way of recognizing the “upstream” activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0021943612446732">Cooren, 2006</xref>) of the humans who actually developed the materials. Management’s goal in supervising the development of the training material is similar to how Watson (1994) defined discourse as constituting “a way of talking and writing about a particular issue, thus framing the way people understand and act with respect to that issue” (p. 113, as cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021943612446732">Alvesson &amp; Karreman, 2000</xref>). Especially in MNCs the “capacity to speak and act on behalf of a collective body is the object of scrutiny [and control] by people in a position of authority” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0021943612446732">Cooren, 2006</xref>, p. 96).</p>
<p>Regardless of management’s goals, due to the ambiguity of the “sustainability” term, the recency of the sustainability initiatives (within the past 3 years prior to our study) in our two focal organizations, and the fact that individual employees have their own attitudes and can exert agency, we do not expect the overlap between comments made by the interviewees and those embedded within the training documents (as a sanctioned representation of management goals) to be particularly strong. The individuals’ own agency more closely aligns with the SIA perspective. SIA scholars “presume organization emerges from within accounting practices accomplished in everyday talk” and “structure is located in the patterned discursive behavior” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0021943612446732">Bisel, 2009</xref>, p. 619). The agency of talk is highlighted and we see organizational agents as being increasingly active. This is consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0021943612446732">Fairclough’s (1992</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0021943612446732">Fairclough &amp; Wodak, 1997</xref>) conceptualization of discourse as “a mode of action, one form in which people may act upon the world and especially upon each other, as well as a mode of representation” (p. 63).</p>
<p>As we seek to understand agency within buyer-supplier conversations, Boden’s (1994, as cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0021943612446732">Fairhurst &amp; Putnam, 2004</xref>) suggestion of an organization emerging in “lamination” is informative. Organizational representatives draw on past circumstances and organizational rationalities, rules, and structures, to select actions and communicative strategies locally relevant to their behavior. The organization that emerges through the discussion of any joint sustainability initiative partly is the product of the interaction of the organizational representatives and their institutional origins. However, representatives also bring in other views from their own individual experiences and attitudes as well as from the broader societal level <italic>Discourses</italic>. Agency is expressed in and emerges from within the resulting interactions between representatives.</p>
<p>Now that we have discussed how organizations are discursive formations composed of nonhuman and human agents, we turn to a discussion of the participants engaged within sustainability-related conversations within the supply chain.</p>

<title>Supply Chain Participants in Sustainability Discourse</title>
<p>During the 1990s, companies increasingly realized that some strategic resources important to their competitive advantage lay outside their boundaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0021943612446732">Cousins &amp; Menguc, 2006</xref>) existing instead within the network of interfirm relationships (e.g., the buyer-supplier dyad). Companies sought to integrate suppliers, manufacturers, and customers into supply chains. The hope was that coordinated information flow would increase trust within supply chain relationships by reducing opportunistic behavior and by increasing opportunities for innovation and operational performance. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0021943612446732">Cousins and Menguc (2006)</xref> found that an increased use of socialization mechanisms (e.g., conferences, meetings, site visits) between the supplier and the buyer enhanced the supplier’s communication and ultimately their operational performance. Scholars (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0021943612446732">Cousins &amp; Menguc, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0021943612446732">Potter &amp; Wetherell, 1987</xref>) also focused on the critical role played by communication and language within supply chain relationships.</p>
<p>Neither study, however, discussed the importance of shared values to the success of these communication encounters. For that we draw on the relationship marketing research (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0021943612446732">Hunt, Arnett, &amp; Madhavaram, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0021943612446732">Sias, 2009</xref>) to understand how supply chain relationships consist of ongoing dyadic entities where partners engage in patterned interactions and carry with them value expectations regarding mutual exchange, fulfillment of promises, personalized service, information sharing, and social support. Given the importance of shared values and trust in supply chain relationships, areas of overlap and divergence between organizational representatives are important to the successful creation and implementation of mutual sustainability initiatives.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0021943612446732">Hunt et al. (2006)</xref> discussed the need to engage <italic>all</italic> employees in the overall marketing process. Arnett, Laverie, and McLane (2002, as cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0021943612446732">Hunt et al., 2006</xref>) wrote, “To implement new marketing approaches successfully, it is often necessary to first alter the culture of an organization to help align employees’ attitude with the new strategy (p. 87).” Managers must ensure that an organization’s fundamental culture is represented within the practices of the company’s employees as they interact with their counterparts in other organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0021943612446732">Winklhofer, Pressey, &amp; Tzokas, 2006</xref>). Management often seek to shape their employees’ environmental worldviews and attitudes through “top down” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0021943612446732">van Dijk, 2006</xref>, p. 134) approaches, such as training programs. Although their focus was not on corporate training, prior to and even after training, employees may have different definitions of sustainability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0021943612446732">Byrch et al., 2007</xref>) partly shaped by their own “culture and experience filtered by their worldview” (p. 30).</p>
<p>The organization that emerges through the discussion of any joint sustainability initiative partly is the product of the interaction of the organizational representatives and their institutional origins.</p>
<p>This study investigates three research questions: How do two large MNCs operating within a supply chain relationship define and/or discuss sustainability in their training materials? To what extent does the sustainability-related content appearing in corporate training materials overlap with how employees discuss sustainability? To what extent do the sustainability-related comments made by representatives of these two organizations overlap?</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section7-0021943612446732">
<title>Organizational Context</title>
<p>The focal organizations were two MNCs engaged in a buyer-supplier relationship. Both had publicly committed to becoming more sustainable. Due to their MNC nature, the decisions these two organizations made regarding sustainable practices and policies had important implications on multiple continents. The first organization, which was headquartered in the United States, referred to hereafter as BUYER, directly employed well over a million people in more than 10 countries and sold its goods to individual consumers. The second organization, headquartered in Europe, referred to hereafter as SUPPLIER, directly employed well over 100,000 people in more than 50 countries. For each organization, the other organization was one of its most important supply chain partners.</p>
<p>Business practices were already changing in both organizations when the data collection occurred. Employees representing both organizations were urged to foreground sustainability in their conversations. Publicly, BUYER top management had articulated that sustainability is critical to the company’s future and, therefore, an important consideration in all future BUYER-SUPPLIER business decisions (e.g., relevant in purchasing decisions). SUPPLIER’s management had dedicated significant resources (e.g., created a management-level sustainability position, provided and encouraged employees to attend sustainability training even though training time was essentially “nonbillable”) to prepare their staff to communicate with their counterparts in BUYER. The training SUPPLIER employees received included examples and arguments to use when communicating with BUYER employees (e.g., persuade BUYER that SUPPLIER has strong sustainability initiatives in place, reinforce that SUPPLIER shares BUYER’s vision regarding sustainability). SUPPLIER’s management hoped that their staff’s ability to articulate a shared interest in sustainability to BUYER’s employees would provide a competitive advantage over other suppliers.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0021943612446732">
<title>Data Collection</title>
<p>Data collection took place in two phases. Initially, the first author and five graduate students analyzed training materials used by both BUYER and SUPPLIER to frame how their U.S. employees understand their company’s approach toward sustainability. The training materials analyzed were first-generation materials; both organizations had started training employees in sustainability initiatives within 36 months of our study. The training materials consisted of two large PowerPoint presentations, one from each company, for a total of almost 200 slides, plus speaking notes associated with the SUPPLIER PowerPoint. Although the slides included pictures, graphics, and text, this analysis was only conducted on textual information.</p>
<p>In Phase 2, 21 face-to-face interviews were conducted at one location in the United States. All interviewees had been or were currently direct participants in BUYER-SUPPLIER sustainability-related discussions. Interviewees had worked for their respective companies from as little as 3 weeks to more than 20 years, most were men (95%), and they held various positions within their organization. Despite repeated requests, fewer BUYER employees (4) responded than did SUPPLIER employees (17). This could be, in part, due to the fact that SUPPLIER employees were asked to participate by a SUPPLIER executive, and in turn they asked their BUYER counterparts to participate.</p>
<p>While the interviews followed an open-ended format and differed slightly from each other, all interviewees were asked the following questions: “When you hear the term ‘sustainability’ what does this mean to you?” “How does sustainability influence your personal life on a daily basis?” “Is sustainability a topic that fits into the role you play within the company?” “How does sustainability influence your professional life?” In the last two questions, respondents were asked to discuss their employing organization: “When you hear ‘(SUPPLIER or BUYER) and sustainability’ what does this mean to you?” “If you could make a difference at (BUYER/SUPPLIER) regarding sustainability, where would you start?” Interview responses resulted in almost 100 pages of double-spaced text.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0021943612446732">
<title>Mapping Method</title>
<p>Four texts were mapped for this analysis: (a) BUYER training PowerPoint material, (b) SUPPLIER PowerPoint materials, (c) combined transcripts for all BUYER interviews, and (d) combined transcripts for all the SUPPLIER interviews. In this descriptive case study conceptual groupings in these various texts were identified using the CRAWDAD Text Analysis System (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0021943612446732">Corman &amp; Dooley, 2006</xref>) to process natural language (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0021943612446732">Lewis &amp; Jones, 1996</xref>) in order to create a network model of text. Communication scholars have used this text analysis system for the past decade (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0021943612446732">Corman, Kuhn, McPhee, &amp; Dooley, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0021943612446732">Kuhn &amp; Corman, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0021943612446732">McPhee, Corman, &amp; Dooley, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0021943612446732">Oliveira, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0021943612446732">Oliveira &amp; Murphy, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The software uses centering resonance analysis (CRA). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0021943612446732">Corman et al. (2002)</xref> describe the theoretical basis and operational details of the approach along with its face and representational validity. They argue for its applicability and utility in modeling organizational knowledge. Therefore, this approach to modeling how organizations and employees articulate their understanding of sustainability appears very appropriate for the current investigation. CRA allows researchers to mine a text not simply for the frequency of words, but more importantly for relationships among words to identify those words most central to the overall structure/meaning of the text. While we are interested in concepts, we understand these through the mapping of words because “language users strategically produce and understand talk and text, in line, word by word, sentence by sentence, turn by turn” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0021943612446732">van Dijk, 2006</xref>, p. 123). CRA uses grammatical rules to understand how words are used in context and focuses only on nouns and noun phrases; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0021943612446732">Corman et al. (2002)</xref> argue that this best “represents the manifest content of texts” and that only nouns “can be unambiguously classified as entities in discourse” (p. 174). CRA then uses betweenness centrality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0021943612446732">Freeman, 1979</xref>) to determine the influence of a word within a given text by identifying its structural influence; a word has greater influence if it is more “influential in channeling flows of meaning. They are literally more meaning-full than other words in the network” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0021943612446732">Corman et al., 2002</xref>, p. 176) because they are the words which create coherence in the text.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0021943612446732">Oliveira and Murphy (2009)</xref> argue that the objectivity provided by CRA is never a substitute for “interpretive judgment: Although the approach exposes word patterns, it is up to the researcher to decode the strategy behind the patterns” (p. 368). In this study, the researchers’ judgment is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0021943612446732">Figure 1</xref> by the boxes we place around word groupings and the arrows inserted between the word groupings. For example, we visually highlight the linkage between packaging and two clusters: one involving the reduced weight of packaging <italic>materials</italic> and the second spotlighting the <italic>energy and waste reductions</italic> associated with the changed packaging. The researchers’ judgment also is evident in how the CRA findings are discussed in the next section.</p>

<title>Centering Resonance Analysis of Training Documents</title>
<p>Given our first research question, we sought to identify the shared and unique language in the training materials regarding sustainability.</p>
<sec id="section12-0021943612446732">
<title>SUPPLIER documents</title>
<p>The SUPPLIER documents revealed a high influence of many words (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0021943612446732">Figure 1</xref>), although the relationships among the words within the documents were not as strongly interconnected (indicated by the darkness of the line) as in the natural language analysis of the BUYER documents (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0021943612446732">Figure 2</xref>). CRA visually represents words hierarchically where the words which are more influential appear at the top of the hierarchy. Four words—<italic>sustainability, SUPPLIER, water</italic>, and <italic>packaging</italic>—were the most influential within the training document. Within this document there is an apparent lack of a single unified “root.” Instead, there are four “roots” to how the SUPPLIER discussed sustainability. Interestingly, these four words are not directly connected to each other.</p>
<fig id="fig2-0021943612446732" position="float">

<p>The connection of “SUPPLIER-partnership-change-climate-corporate” is one important set of linkages for the supply chain relationship, because it denotes that corporate climate change and SUPPLIER is mediated by the word <italic>partnership</italic>. Within the natural language of the documents, it appears SUPPLIER sees organizational <italic>partnerships</italic> as essential to <italic>change</italic>. Another important set of connections is “sustainability-product-design-great-SUPPLIER,” which shows that <italic>SUPPLIER</italic> and <italic>sustainability</italic> are indirectly connected through “great product design.” This mediated relationship reveals one of the SUPPLIER’s strongest sustainability initiatives (i.e., design sustainable products). The word “water” is tied to “world-improvement-health-benefit- program.” This highlights SUPPLIER’s commitment to clean water initiatives around the world. “Packaging” and “waste” are connected terms. “Waste” is connected to “reduced-width-material-weight-%-eliminate” and “reduction-energy-annual-plastic.” Sustainable packaging initiatives, then, are focused on waste reduction leading to eliminated weight, referring to truckloads, and the reduced use of energy and various plastics within these documents.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0021943612446732">
<title>BUYER documents</title>
<p>Within the BUYER documents (refer to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0021943612446732">Figure 2</xref>), clearer connections were apparent between terms, and the “root” term was “sustainability.” The natural language within these documents shows various clusters that surround core concepts. “BUYER-sustainability-goal” is the document’s main focus, but many concepts are connected to and center on terms such as <italic>product, customer, supplier, packaging, material, energy</italic>, and <italic>quality</italic>. These are articulated as central concepts in the BUYER’s sustainability initiatives. “BUYER-sustainability-business-opportunity” is a central connection as well, because it communicates that profitable gain is expected from sustainability initiatives.</p>
<p>One interesting connection that emerged was that of “sustainability-goal-business-plan.” The implementation of business plans are clearly linked to organizational goals. “Goal” was tied to terms such as <italic>supplier, energy</italic>, and <italic>packaging</italic>. This reveals various “sub-goals” within BUYER’s overarching sustainability objectives. This structure highlights BUYER’s intentional business communication strategy of providing clear connections between various concepts, goals, and proposed action within their documents.</p> <p>Sustainable packaging initiatives, then, are focused on waste reduction leading to eliminated weight, referring to truckloads, and the reduced use of energy and various plastics within these documents.</p>

<sec id="section14-0021943612446732">
<title>A comparison of the SUPPLIER and BUYER documents</title>
<p>CRA’s visual comparison of the natural language appearing in the documents proveds informative. Some of the shared terms included <italic>corporate mission, corporate responsibility, corporate performance, sustainable packaging, reduced waste, product price, healthy product, and sustainability product</italic>. Important strategic alignments between the two documents can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0021943612446732">Figure 3A</xref>.</p>

<p>However, there are also unique terms. Several relationships between terms centering on “product” are unique to BUYER’s communication (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0021943612446732">Figure 3B</xref>). BUYER highlighted the “packaging assessment.” SUPPLIER emphasized more complex relationships between terms centered on “water” due to the emphasis on clean water and hygiene in their global sustainability initiatives (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0021943612446732">Figure 3C</xref>).</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0021943612446732">
<title>Centering Resonance Analysis of Training Documents and Interview Responses</title>
<p>The second aim of this study was to identify the shared and unique language appearing in training texts and in interview responses. SUPPLIER’s documents and employee interviews shared many connections centered on “product” (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0021943612446732">Figure 4A</xref>). Some other important shared terms are <italic>brand impact, hygiene, innovation, water use, waste reduction, raw material, world</italic>, and <italic>packaging</italic>. All of these terms are central tenets of SUPPLIER’s sustainability initiatives, and they appear in both the SUPPLIER documents and the SUPPLIER interview responses, which suggest a high level of alignment on important topics.</p>
<fig id="fig4-0021943612446732" position="float">

<caption>
<p>Comparison between training documents and interviews</p>
</caption>
<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0021943612446732-fig4.tif"/></fig>
<p>Some of the most important unique words in the interviews were various value statements (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0021943612446732">Figure 4B</xref>), such as sustainability being the “right thing” or the “good way to do business.” The term <italic>business need</italic> was unique to the SUPPLIER interviews, but they were aligning themselves to the values of BUYER in this regard. For example, one SUPPLIER said, “That’s driven by BUYER. BUYER helps those that are committed to sustainability . . . I guess it is all based on business need.”</p>
<p>Alignment also exists between the BUYER training text and interview comments (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0021943612446732">Figure 4C</xref>). Both use the term <italic>right thing</italic> regarding sustainability. The term <italic>sustainability</italic> itself is also central and tied to <italic>supplier, business, goal, and impact</italic>. BUYER interviewees uniquely highlighted the <italic>sustainability summits</italic> and the notion of a “great supplier” as being a leader in sustainability in their products and practices as well as sharing that information with the industry as a whole (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0021943612446732">Figure 4D</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section16-0021943612446732">
<title>Centering Resonance Analysis of Interview Responses</title>
<p>The final aim of this study was to identify the shared and unique language regarding sustainability emerging from the interviews with employees whose position provided them with the opportunity to discuss sustainability with their counterparts in the other organization.</p>
<sec id="section17-0021943612446732">
<title>Areas of overlap</title>
<p>The comparison between the BUYER and SUPPLIER interview answers demonstrates that employees in both companies discussed sustainability in terms of personal action and the overarching environmental concerns, and they talked about it as the “right thing to do” or a “good way to do business” (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0021943612446732">Figure 5A</xref>). The potential for making a “big impact” was shared.</p>

<sec id="section18-0021943612446732">
<title>Unique to SUPPLIER</title>
<p>An interesting set of word relationships centered on “sustainability” and “conversation” (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0021943612446732">Figure 5B</xref>). “End” is connected to “conversation,” indicating that sustainability-related discussions tended to fall at the end of buyer/supplier conversations, if they appeared at all. These conversations were linked to “business need.” Also, “brand team” is a term unique to SUPPLIER, and it often emerged in the interviews whenever employees discussed how to start making changes toward sustainability in their products. They perceived it as starting with the brand team then working its way down to the suppliers. This is consistent with SUPPLIER employees seeing themselves as “facilitators” or “implementers” of sustainability rather than as idea generators.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-0021943612446732">
<title>Unique to BUYER</title>
<p>BUYER interviews showed unique words that are not as interconnected (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0021943612446732">Figure 5C</xref>). Once again, phrases, such as “road mile” or “empty truck,” refer to the BUYERS discussing what effects various sustainability initiatives, such as a decrease in packaging, had on the “supply chain reaction.” BUYER employees highlighted “sustainability summits” as an example of BUYER doing a good job of driving sustainability, or mentioned the need for more sustainability summits. Employees also highlighted packaging requirements as well as the importance of shareholder profitability as essential to sustainability objectives.</p>
<p>CRAWDAD allows researchers to look at the relative importance of words and word pairs within a text. In order to provide an additional way to understand linguistic terms and their usage during interviews, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0021943612446732">Table 1</xref> provides comparative data on some of the most important terms appearing in the two interview transcripts. The numbers appearing after each word or word pair refer to the centrality/importance of that term or pair within the text. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0021943612446732">Corman and Dooley (2006)</xref>, .01 and above are significant and .05 and above are very significant. For BUYER, <italic>sustainability, supplier, product, company name, good, time, truck</italic>, and <italic>packaging</italic> were very significant terms. The most significant word pairs in the text were <italic>good-product, buyer name-sustainability</italic>, and <italic>supplier-sustainability</italic>. For SUPPLIER, in addition <italic>to sustainability</italic> very significant terms included <italic>product, kind, company name, business, good, people</italic>, and <italic>buyer name</italic>. The most significant word pairs were <italic>sustainability-thing, thing-good, thing-kind, sustainability-company name</italic>, and the term <italic>sustainability</italic> coupled with <italic>buyer name, business, kind, good</italic>, and <italic>product</italic>.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Two organizations engaged in a supply chain relationship were the foci of this study. Essentially, employees at both were asked by their management to include sustainability-related considerations into how they routinely did business. The situation they faced, as articulated during interviews, appeared to be akin to the four embedded narrative phases (manipulation, competence, performance, sanction) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0021943612446732">Cooren (2000)</xref> discussed. Regardless of organization, our interviewees had been given a “having to do” phase (manipulation: they were told to embed sustainability into their conversation with their counterpart) and a “being able to do” phase (competence: they were trained in what to say or what to look for). They were expected to perform the “having to do” (performance: they were told to embed sustainability in their buyer-supplier conversations so as to reach sustainability goals) and were told that their performance would be linked to either punishment or reward (sanction: they were told that those who successfully drive sustainability will be rewarded and those who do not will not succeed either in the company or within the BUYER-SUPPLIER relationship).</p>
<p>The charge the employees were given as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0021943612446732">Cooren’s (2000)</xref> embedded narrative phases necessitated the enactment of strategic business communication on the part of the buyer and the supplier representatives. Toward that end, the training materials were important texts, texts with agency due to their potential to change the content shared within the buyer-supplier employee conversations, and, ultimately to potentially influence business (i.e., purchasing) decisions. Given the importance attributed to shared values within supply chain relationships and the ambiguity that exists in how sustainability is defined, it was important to identify the extent to which the BUYER-SUPPLIER training material overlapped with how employees discussed sustainability.</p>
<sec id="section21-0021943612446732">
<title>Sustainability in Training Texts</title>
<p>Research Question 1 specifically addressed the potential overlap between the two MNCs’ sustainability-related training materials. While differences emerged, we found multiple areas of overlap. Some shared terms included <italic>corporate mission, corporate performance, corporate responsibility, sustainability product, healthy product, price product, sustainable packaging, reduced waste, reduction energy, energy use</italic>, and <italic>carbon emission</italic>. The SUPPLIER training material included, “Corporate responsibility has been critical to our way of doing business since we started out.” Discussion of issues involving the corporate mission and corporate responsibility, and healthy product, suggest that these documents were designed to create and reinforce an organization-wide <italic>Discourse</italic> by articulating the CSR <italic>Discourse</italic>, while mention of performance issues suggest the integration of the broader BSC <italic>Discourse</italic>. Because of the nature of a BUYER-SUPPLIER relationship, a central focus emerged in both documents on the product (i.e., sustainable, healthy) and on product packaging. The BUYER training material instructed employees to “bring sustainability into product specification” (e.g., cost, size) when talking with suppliers. Packaging was identified by both organizations as a realistic, manageable, and cost-effective method for enacting sustainability (reduce material resource in package construction, reduce packaging weight takes less energy to transport, etc.). This discussion seems to reflect the macro-level eco-efficiency <italic>Discourse</italic>. The focus on energy (use and reduction), carbon emission, water, and waste reflect the MNCs’ awareness of key environmental issues which currently influence the global <italic>Discourse</italic> regarding natural resources.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section22-0021943612446732">
<title>Sustainability in Training and Interviewee Texts</title>
<p>While the outcome of socialization/training efforts may enter into work-related decisions, employees also have their own sustainability-related definitions, values, and beliefs. Research Question 2, then, addressed the overlap and distinct characteristics between the organization’s and employees’ discourse. Interview comments indicated that while some employees at both organizations embraced sustainability initiatives as important to human survival, others saw it as a fad that could be capitalized on to influence consumer purchasing decisions, and some consciously did not include sustainability within their buyer-supplier discussions feeling the topic to be less important than profit-related issues. Therefore, our interviewees in both companies illustrated various approaches to and understanding of sustainability.</p>
<p>Because of the nature of a BUYER-SUPPLIER relationship, a central focus emerged in both documents on the product (i.e., sustainable, healthy) and on product packaging.</p> <p>In the SUPPLIER organization, the shared focus between the organization’s and employees’ discourse involved the products and the extent to which they were healthy and sustainable (here we see the CSR <italic>Discourse</italic> emerging). One SUPPLIER interviewee said, “I think it is really making sure we have the right formulations that are sustainable, both from an environmental perspective, but from a health perspective also.” The <italic>brand-impact</italic> term suggests that the employees felt the organization could have an impact. In their training document we read about “measuring the impacts of our brands” and reducing their water footprint to minimize “our impact across our value chain.” One interviewee said,</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>If we are talking about sustainability, as a supplier we almost always mean something [involving] our brand’s packaging or recycling our own wastes and how this is going to impact things when we sell it to the customer—is it going to be friendly for the environment.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In terms of the BUYER organization, two strong roots emerged in both the training and interview texts involving the products they sell (good, healthy) and sustainability (as a business goal, impact, and as important in supplier relationships). One BUYER interviewee said, “It’s [sustainability] not been a personal goal starting out, it’s a business strategy.” The training document discussed how product stewardship was a way to get suppliers on the “right path to innovation.” Employees learned how their CEO believed “protecting the earth’s resources is the right thing to do.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section23-0021943612446732">
<title>Sustainability in Buyer and Supplier Interviewee Texts</title>
<p>Finally, we investigated areas of overlap between how buyer and supplier employees discussed sustainability. We identified shared sustainability-related issues and values emerging within the interview comments of respondents representing the two organizations such as sustainability as the “right thing to do,” or a “good way to do business.” From the similarities shown in the maps, it is clear that the respondents are drawing not only on their organization’s concern for new opportunities and profitability but also on broader sociopolitical <italic>Discourses</italic> arguing for sustainability. A BUYER acknowledged that while [sustainability] is the “right thing to do and that’s probably the overarching theme” what really drives the business decision is how it influences the cost of what they provide to their consumers. While there were shared patterns in the data as indicated previously, there were multiple differences as well. Individuals will always have their own slightly different definitions of sustainability.</p>

<sec id="section24-0021943612446732" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>We investigated the training texts and the interview comments in hopes to better understand factors influencing the ongoing (re)construction of the sustainability initiatives of two organizations involved in a supply chain relationship. The literature indicates that shared values, goals, and understanding are important to the formation of a successful supply chain relationship. It was clear from speaking with interviewees and from reading the corporate training materials that sustainability was becoming increasingly important within the supply chain relationship between these two MNCs. We found evidence of multiple discourses at varying levels in each organization which noted the importance of that specific supply chain partnership. SUPPLIER text and interviews indicated that a successful partnership was essential if any meaningful sustainability-related environmental changes were to occur.</p>
<sec id="section25-0021943612446732">
<title>Contributions to the Literature</title>
<p>This study adds to the limited sustainability-related research focusing on discourse (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0021943612446732">Livesey, 2002</xref>). Our approach differs from most of the prior business communication-related sustainability research, which largely focuses on externally directed, officially created corporate discourse. Consistent with the complexity of organizations as discursive constructions articulated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0021943612446732">Bisel (2009)</xref>, we analyzed multiple discourses surrounding sustainability at multiple levels (i.e., corporate and individual) and how these discourses overlap and differ (i.e., between corporate training materials and individual interview transcripts).</p>
<p>A common methodological problem in organizational analysis is how to move beyond specific linguistic material (i.e., interview comments, written documents) to make broader claims (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021943612446732">Alvesson &amp; Karreman, 2000</xref>). By our simultaneous analysis of talk and text at the individual and organizational levels we can better illuminate the link between <italic>discourse</italic> and <italic>Discourses</italic>. The mapping method used allows us to look at the discourses which appeared in multiple sites articulated in different ways. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021943612446732">Alvesson and Karreman (2000)</xref> write that it is possible to use summaries and syntheses to identify overarching <italic>Discourse</italic> themes and general patterns.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section26-0021943612446732">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>As is true of any study, there are limitations. CRA only looks at nouns and therefore focuses on the <italic>meaning</italic> of sustainability; while an analysis of the verb usage may reveal <italic>how</italic> sustainability is accomplished. However it is notable that many of the noun phrases implied a sense of agency (e.g., <italic>corporate performance, sustainable packaging, reduced waste, healthy product, right thing to do, good way to do business</italic>). Second, although contacted and invited, only 4 representatives from BUYER participated compared with 17 from SUPPLIER; matching each SUPPLIER representative with his or her BUYER counterpart could provide a more complete picture of the overlapping/differing discourses. However, this was a constraint of organizational access, rather than a flaw in the research design. Third, our interviewees were all conducted in one area in the United States. Our small volunteer, geographically narrow sample limits our ability to understand the potential impact of culture on sustainability discourse. We have no way of knowing if interviewees provided us with insight into their own view of sustainability or sought to convey the corporate view. However, we do not see this as a serious flaw if we are interested in seeing how interviewees might engage in representations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0021943612446732">Cooren, 2006</xref>) and reflect organizationally sanctioned ideas. Finally, by aggregating the interview data into two texts (i.e., BUYER and SUPPLIER) and then looking for the most commonly linked themes, we were unable to investigate individual differences or do a nuanced micro analysis of agency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0021943612446732">Cooren, Brummans, &amp; Charrieras, 2008</xref>).</p>

<title>Future Research</title>
<p>This research presents a first step in exploring the relationships among organizations’ and employees’ sustainability discourse. In doing so, it provides one way by which business communication researchers can fruitfully explore the relationship between the AIS and SIA approaches to organizational discourse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0021943612446732">Bisel, 2009</xref>). Future research should investigate the environmental texts of more organizations engaged in supply chain partnerships that foreground shared sustainability initiatives. Research that analyzes actual conversations occurring between buyers and suppliers is needed so we could see what the people are doing with language in a specific encounter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0021943612446732">Potter, 1997</xref>). Only then can we see how “Social reality is discursively constructed and maintained through language” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021943612446732">Alvesson &amp; Karreman, 2000</xref>, p. 1126). Analyzing conversations at a more close-range, micro approach would allow us to focus on the emergent, locally constructed, and negotiated aspects of sustainability-related conversations. Critical ethnographic studies would be useful in identifying how these discourses are being negotiated and how hegemony is created (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0021943612446732">Gramsci, 2001</xref>). Longitudinal analysis is essential if we are to understand what emergent discourses appear within the organizations, within organizational members’ discourse over time, and between members of buyer-supplier interactions. These analyses would also allow us to investigate the past, present, and future orientations of structure and agency.</p>
<p>Like <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0021943612446732">Livesey (2002)</xref>, we argue that the shared sustainability initiatives our two focal organizations created can have transformative effects on the companies themselves. Changing the worldview regarding sustainability, for a corporate culture or an employee, can be a long and difficult process of consensus building (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0021943612446732">Milbrath, 1984</xref>, as cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0021943612446732">Byrch et al., 2007</xref>). Moving forward, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0021943612446732">Livesey and Graham (2007)</xref> write,</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>We do not see sustainable development as a fixed goal or set of technical outcomes. . . . As such, it must (and will) be continually defined and redefined in local skirmishes and political contexts both within and outside the corporation, struggles that have transforming effects on corporate identities, values and modes of operation. We argue that this is how sustainability is actually performed—in other words, how it is made a reality at the level of the corporation [and we would argue to supply-chain relationship], and how it potentially becomes hegemonic (although necessarily contested) at the level of society as a whole. (p. 337)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Many of the articles we reviewed appeared in the <italic>Journal of Business Communication</italic>. Our study extends such research by focusing simultaneously on talk and text, both key elements of business communication research and a major focus of business communication practitioners. Moving forward we suggest business communication practitioners read an article by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0021943612446732">von Kutzschenbach and Brønn (2006)</xref>. They provide a co-orientation model to help practitioners understand and improve interdependent sustainability-related communication situations. Stressing the need for increased understanding among stakeholders regarding the key issues, they provide practitioners with ways to adapt their communication strategy. We suggest that mapping tools such as CRA can help practitioners see the root concepts being stressed in their sustainability-related documents and can be used to support efforts by supply chain partners to create a shared sustainability vision for their employees.</p>
