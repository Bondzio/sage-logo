<p>What role does marketing play in the alteration of climate and the destruction of ecosystems? A central one according to Guy Pearse whose 2012 book, <italic>Greenwash: Big Brands and Carbon Scams</italic>, exposes the spin, scams, and marketing plans by which multinational companies convince consumers that their products are fighting the good fight against carbon emissions. Pearse has spent some years collecting adverts and comparing industry claims to carbon neutrality against measures of environmental performances. The results of these endeavors will be of little surprise to readers of the <italic>Journal of Macromarketing</italic>: companies’ production, investment, and growth figures rarely tally with the promises made by advertising campaigns. More shocking, however, is the scale of the green branding swindle, and the means by which companies portray products and services as eco-friendly consumer solutions to our planetary path of destruction.</p>
<sec id="section1-0276146713476039">
<title>The Bad and the Ugly</title>
<p>
<italic>Greenwash</italic> is arranged by product categories—beer, cars, celebrities, food, electricity, home appliances, banks, pets, sports, even sex. For each of these business sectors, Pearse has traced and evaluated companies’ claims to carbon friendliness against the realities of their production, investment, and growth figures. The reading is generally grim. Nevertheless, it is the carbon neutrality proffered by certain banks and investment bodies that appears to establish the nadir in the green-washing game. For instance, Pearse explains how many banks have invested in fleets of hybrid cars or established partnerships with environmental charities. In so doing, these businesses proffer eco-friendly images. Nevertheless, explains <italic>Greenwash</italic>, the yearly emissions savings won by these actions are often overwhelmed in a matter of days by the emissions from industries that depend on and increase capital investments that are lent by the very same banks.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0276146713476039">
<title>Accounting for Responsibility</title>
<p>The problem that <italic>Greenwash</italic> repeatedly raises is how companies are able to justify claims to eco-friendliness via accounting procedures that fail to represent a full picture of emissions created in the production of products and services. By advertising products and services as “zero-emission” as is the case with Nissan’s “Leaf,” a variety of companies sell products to consumers keen to reduce their carbon footprint. In most cases, however, companies that portray their market offerings in this way fail to factor-in a most important aspect of the carbon equation, namely production and supply chain emissions. The carbon emitted in the manufacture of the materials for your hybrid vehicle, the diesel burned by the trucks and trains that move materials to and from factories, and onward to your nearest dealership, remain unaccounted for in the marketing communications provided to policy makers and consumers.</p>
<p>Once such aspects of products’ life spans are considered, most claims to eco-friendliness and carbon neutrality fail to wash. Other common practices include companies advertising their carbon intensity targets (emissions per square foot of retail space for instance) all the while growing operations or increasing their overall emissions, yet claiming carbon output is “reduced.” Further tricks include firms ignoring the activities of their franchised operations; ignore emissions related to the raw materials needed for their products; fail to calculate the impact of the use of their products; or simply ignore emissions outside their home countries. In exposing these procedures, <italic>Greenwash</italic> is a useful source text for researchers who work in the shadow lands of marketing and accounting. This territory surely provides vital ground for macromarketing scholars and transformative consumer researchers who can uncover further inconsistencies and misinformation not only in relation to carbon accounting but also with respect to other varieties of damaging emissions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0276146713476039">
<title>The Green Brand-Wagon</title>
<p>If climate scientists are correct, then this is the decade in which we must take action if there is to be any chance of rebalancing our fragile carbon accounts. With this urgency in mind, important work needs to be done in examining how accounting procedures should be designed in order to allow both governments and consumers to evaluate company claims with respect to emissions. Is it possible that, just as foodstuffs are packaged with indications of nutritional values in kilojoules or calories, they could also come with a measure of the approximate energy expended in their manufacture and supply?</p>
<p>Collaborative research between the fields of marketing and accountancy seems to be a priority for achieving such a goal. Without clear guidelines and indicators, consumers’ abilities to purchase responsibly will remain limited by lack of credible information relating to the emissions associated with their chosen purchases. Indeed, at present, misinformation is not only a problem for consumers and policy makers, but also a major opportunity for marketers. It is interesting that Pearse notes how rising levels of greenhouse gas emissions have coincided with an explosion in ads for “climate-friendly” products and services. Sure, correlation does not imply causation, but as Douglas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0276146713476039">Holt (2004</xref>) explains, “good” cultural strategies resolve social insecurities by framing consumers’ purchases as stage props for mythological story telling designed to soothe social anxieties. It is hardly surprising then that any marketing manager worth her salt is jumping on the green brand-wagon.</p>
<p>A problem that Holt’s “cultural branding” has not yet fully engaged with, however, is the ethics of offering mythological solutions that make people feel better when the effect generated is illusory and temporary. In his Budweiser case study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0276146713476039">Holt (2004</xref>) explains the mythological solutions offered to North American drinkers fed up with various social and economic ills. In early advertising campaigns, Bud is framed as a storied stage prop for consumers all too ready to live out fantasies of better-days retroscapes in which their labor power is still laudable.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Holt shows that this fantasy solution must alter when social ills are not cured. Indeed, when consumers became cynical with Bud’s heroic-worker advertising, the brand managers quickly moved on to celebrate that cynicism: cue frogs and lizards.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0276146713476039">1</xref>
</sup> In this sense, cultural branding is rather like going to your doctor with a complaint that medicine cannot treat, but he or she sends you home with a sugar pill anyway, hoping that a placebo effect might keep you quiet. Some would agree that the sugar pill is worth taking if you go away feeling better. But what happens when the symptoms return? Worse, what if the relief generated by your myth marketing placebo masks a deeper, underlying cause of your symptoms?</p>
<p>This is the problem with cultural branding in relation to green marketing strategies. Ecological destruction is a problem ripe for mythological branding exercises, and Pearse shows how many companies are buying into this strategy. All the while, however, they continue polluting. Perhaps another issue that <italic>Greenwash</italic> raises, therefore, is the necessity to develop policies for how standards of cultural branding could be evaluated and regulated as accurate or false. Perhaps, it is necessary to apply advertising standards to eco-friendly claims. External standards are currently available, but these are voluntary criteria that may themselves be flawed for the same reasons that <italic>Greenwash</italic> explains. Without such policies, however, the information and propaganda disseminated by practitioners of the cultural branding genre may well divert consumers from engaging with and taking responsibility for their consumption choices, be this through purchase, political action, or lobbying. In any case, <italic>Greenwash</italic> suggests that there are some social ills that myth marketing simply should not leverage.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0276146713476039">
<title>Are Small Wins OK?</title>
<p>A question that Pearse does not fully cover is whether a start in the right direction constitutes a win for the ecological agenda. At times the manner in which <italic>Greenwash</italic> handles companies' claims to eco-friendliness seems a little black and white. Either companies come completely clean or they are swindlers. Because of this, some unexpected names crop up beneath the stones that Pearse turns. The adventure sports specialist Patagonia, for example, is a company that gives 1 percent of sales revenue to environmental causes, recycles used clothing, sponsors conservation projects and offers consumers information about supply chains for each of their products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0276146713476039">Chouinard 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Patagonia has gone further than most, but Pearse points out that they are not guiltless. Perhaps because of the urgency that we now face, Pearse feels that there is little room for grey areas. The work that remains to be done in order to complete Pearse’s project, therefore, is to design models that are able to sort the wheat of companies like Patagonia (whose efforts may bear further fruit if nourished), from the chaff of companies whose efforts are obviously more cynical. To be sure, if the carbon-neutral revolution is to be implemented beyond the worlds of corporate spin or well meaning but essentially powerless householders, we need these kinds of accounting and advertising-management tools right away.</p>
<p>Pearse’s book takes an important step toward greater transparency in this domain of marketing. Nevertheless, much research remains to be done, especially by the marketing and consumer research community. If the situation is as bad as Pearse suggests, then this work needs to be developed further, and fast.</p>
