<p>Social media is now taking centre stage from an information perspective, with the exploitation of social media content in news products and reflections from opinion leaders McKinsey; a survey from Digimind; and a study by the Economic Intelligence Unit which suggests that in reacting to the urgency of social media developments, organizations are failing to stand back and consider how mobile technology can contribute to communications strategies for their customers. For individuals, social media content is a resource for personal development.</p>
<p>Big data continues to be on the agenda – and a survey by Oracle confirms the reality of the data deluge in many sectors – and their lack of preparedness to deal with it. Businesses are losing opportunities as a result and a top priority is to turn data into actionable insight – an opportunity for information professionals as suggested in June’s <italic>Business Information Review</italic> (<italic>BIR</italic>). The growth in competitor and market intelligence functions confirms career possibilities in this field. Reports too from Gartner and AIIM (Association for Information and Image Management) suggest that the information professional career path is a realistic one – organizations need to develop more information skilled leaders and professionals if they are to create value from information.</p>
<p>Significant moves in national information policy by the UK and the EU will establish open data as a principle for public sector data and for publicly funded research. This will greatly enhance the information accessible by citizens and organizations. The Finch report argued that ‘the UK should embrace the transition to open access, and accelerate the process in a measured way which promotes innovation but also retains what is most valuable in the research communications ecosystem’. Its recommendations have been endorsed by the UK government. Increased innovation is one of the potential benefits from open access with business and industry better positioned to take advantage from research output. The UK’s Chartered Management Institute (CMI) is aiming to increase the value of research articles by arranging their review by the management community – in effect creating an online knowledge transfer ‘market place’. In parallel, the stimulus that wider access to ICT services creates internationally to bridging the digital divide is understood as a core approach to expanding the social and economic potential of developing countries. An EIU report highlights the key policy factors which are essential for improving online take-up.</p>
<p>Content industry developments illustrate the dynamism of this sector and the challenges of keeping pace with change. In the area of news information, incorporation of social media (Twitter) content continues and business and TV news services are expanding to become a major resource. For research, enhanced services are available from Gale and BvD, and Bloomberg has launched a real time industry research platform. In the legal sector, Thomson Reuters and Wolters Kluwer have joined forces on current awareness and LexisNexis Legal &amp; Professional, have announced the opening of a state-of-the-art data centre in the UK that will provide comprehensive hosting services for the law firms and in-house legal departments. For managers and leaders, EBSCO’s new learning collection is an important source of learning videos.</p>
<p>No wonder then that enterprise search, federated search, and mobile search and improvements in search technologies are essential areas to foster! And data journalism offers new approaches to information researchers.</p>
<sec id="section1-0266382112460943">
<title>Social media</title>
<p>Those of us who are committed users of social technologies will have our own preferences, the ones we feel easier with and those that align best with our communication needs. Each platform will have its enthusiasts and detractors, numbered in hundreds of millions across the globe. Whilst consumers may flit between these media in the promiscuous style of much online behaviour, to the systems themselves this is a very serious business. This is also true for corporate users who have to make an investment in a presence on one or more of these for direct business purposes.</p>
<p>Whilst Facebook has an enormous lead on competitive social media in terms of size of registered user base, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google+ and other systems are all vying for an increased share of the market. So it is interesting to monitor the approach of corporate users, their shifting preferences and nuances of demand and digital traffic.</p>
<p>Other important items in this section include developments in how Twitter feeds can be integrated into a major news aggregation product, McKinsey’s take on how value can be added by companies’ use of social media, a new social product from Mintel and a reminder about a true professional leader in spreading knowledge about these technologies.</p>
<sec id="section2-0266382112460943">
<title>Twitter trumps Facebook as primary source of social media intelligence</title>
<p>A recent survey of market intelligence decision-makers by US business intelligence company Digimind, reveals that the vast majority (79.2%) monitor social media sites to extract information relating to competitors, industry developments, consumer trends and more. The survey shows that 62.5 per cent of companies monitor Twitter and 69.4 per cent monitor LinkedIn as part of their day-to-day intelligence activities. However, Facebook and Google+ are not regarded as essential sources to monitor, with just 47.2 per cent and 35.2 per cent of companies monitoring these sites regularly.</p>
<p>In an era of near-constant hype about the value of information to be gleaned from social media, it is interesting to note that 21 per cent of companies are not harnessing the benefits of social media as a source of insight and intelligence. This is despite the fact that two-thirds (60.6%) of respondents are currently in the process of planning intelligence projects.</p>
<p>Commenting on the results, Digimind’s Associate Director, Patrice Francois said: <disp-quote>
<p>A small proportion of companies remain cautious about the potential value of social media monitoring but the vast majority see it as a complement to the full spectrum of intelligence gathering. There is a tendency for some people to view social media monitoring as something which solely benefits B2C (Business-to-Consumer) environments but it is fast being adopted by a wide range of businesses and organizations for unearthing valuable intelligence insights.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>In commenting specifically about the use of social media by the legal sector, Francois noted:<disp-quote>
<p>Many law firms and lawyers are apt to say it’s too hard to use social media and social networks for intelligence and to have others do their ‘dirty work’ for them. In the long run those firms and lawyers will find themselves at a competitive disadvantage as compared to those willing to use social media and social networking.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The majority of respondents to the Digimind Survey were those responsible for Competitive or Market Intelligence as well as Marketing Directors, Strategy Planners and Business Development Managers. Most main sectors were represented in the survey, with the majority of respondents belonging to the services industry (28.2%). There was also a representative number of respondents from the IT and telecoms sector (10.7%), manufacturing (10.7%) and pharmaceutical and healthcare industries (11.7%).</p>

<title>Twitter content incorporated into Factiva</title>
<p>Select Twitter streams are now available in Factiva, providing customers with relevant and timely social content alongside its archive of traditional media sources and blogs.</p>
<p>The curated Twitter content in Factiva covers 31 industries, including energy, financial services and technology, with a focus on the most influential tweeters from around the globe. The selection process was done with the assistance of Mass Relevance, working with the Factiva editorial staff. Mass Relevance, describes itself as ‘a social integration platform enabling producers and marketers to aggregate, filter, and integrate real-time social content into virtually any brand or media experience.’</p>
<p>The real time content is available via Factiva Snapshot, a business search tool with news dashboards that help businesses to efficiently gather intelligence and identify trends, opportunities and risks. Factiva’s traditional collection of established business sources, numbering about 27,000, has expanded over the last few years to now include some 8,000 top business blogs. This initial move into integrating Twitter content is just the beginning of expansion into the business news flowing into social networks, according to David Chivers, vice president of Factiva:<disp-quote>
<p>We know that there is real business intelligence available on Twitter. We’ve placed that intelligence in a dashboard alongside our traditional and blog content to give Factiva customers an up-to-the second look at what influential individuals in various industries are talking about. Customers benefit from receiving only the most meaningful industry-specific tweets without all of the noise.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Factiva exploits a combination of technology and editorial staff to curate content from Twitter’s ‘firehose’. The selected Twitter streams complement the wide range of content in Factiva, including more than 35,000 media sources, of which 8,000 are business blogs. Many of these leading sources are not available on the Web.</p>

<title>Companies place too much emphasis on social media relative to mobile</title>
<p>In communicating with their customers, most companies have focused too much on social media and appear to be under-investing in mobile and other new communication channels. That is the conclusion of a new study from the Economist Intelligence Unit, sponsored by Genesys, that examines how companies are responding to the changing dialogue between customers and companies.</p>
<p>This focus on social media at the expense of mobile platforms suggests that many companies are in reaction mode, responding as best they can to the rapid proliferation of social media, rather than developing a coherent strategy that addresses the spread of mobile technology as well. While social media has grown rapidly over the last five years, mobile phone penetration globally is expected to reach 99 per cent this year, according to EIU forecasts.</p>
<p>‘The rapid adoption of social media and the huge growth in the mobile market go hand in hand but companies seem very focused on social media as a singular force and don’t appear to have grasped how interconnected the two trends are’ says EIU deputy editor Annabel Symington.</p>
<p>Other key findings include:<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>Too many companies are reacting to complaints rather than solving the underlying problems. Executives appear focused on responding to customer comments and complaints on social networks rather than addressing the root cause of problems.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>A breakdown in internal communication is the greatest obstacle to a coherent communication strategy. The C-suite and middle management disagree about how to respond to the new communication reality – and who should be, and is, in charge.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Communication efforts are too decentralized. Making a single individual responsible for managing customer communication channels reduces disagreements between senior and middle managers. It also reduces internal confusion and helps companies present a consistent message to customers.</p>

<title>McKinsey on social media and the creation of value</title>
<p>An excellent report from the McKinsey Global Institute (‘The social economy: Unlocking value and productivity through social technologies’ by Michael Chui et al.) describes the growth of social media, examines the sources of their power, assesses their impact in several major sectors of the economy and analyses ways in which social technologies create value. The report also explores social technology risks and barriers to adoption as well as enabling capabilities and the conditions to create value.</p>
<p>In a few short years, social technologies have given social interactions the speed and scale of the Internet. Whether discussing consumer products or organizing political movements, people around the world constantly use social-media platforms to seek and share information. Companies use them to reach consumers in new ways too; by tapping into these conversations, organizations can generate richer insights and create precisely targeted messages and offers.</p>
<p>The report says:<disp-quote>
<p>While 72 per cent of companies use social technologies in some way, very few are anywhere near to achieving the full potential benefit. In fact, the most powerful applications of social technologies in the global economy are largely untapped. Companies will go on developing ways to reach consumers through social technologies and gathering insights for product development, marketing, and customer service. Yet the McKinsey Global Institute (MGI) finds that twice as much potential value lies in using social tools to enhance communications, knowledge sharing, and collaboration within and across enterprises. MGI’s estimates suggest that by fully implementing social technologies, companies have an opportunity to raise the productivity of interaction workers – high-skill knowledge workers, including managers and professionals – by 20 to 25 per cent.</p>
</disp-quote>The key findings:<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>Speed and scale of adoption of social media by consumers has exceeded previous technologies.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Several distinct properties of these technologies make them uniquely powerful enablers of value creation.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Report identifies 10 ways in which social technologies can create value across the value chain.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Two-thirds of these value creation opportunities lie in improving communications and collaboration within and across enterprises.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Companies that rely heavily on consumer insights for product development and marketing purposes have an opportunity to create value by engaging with consumers via social media and monitoring conversations to generate insight and market intelligence.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Individuals and the communities they form will derive much of the benefits of these technologies.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>The risks of these technologies, such as identity fraud, loss of IP, violations of privacy and abuse, need careful assessment and management.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>The benefits of these technologies will likely outweigh the risks for most companies.</p>
</list-item>
</list>The report concludes: <disp-quote>
<p>To reap the full benefit of social technologies, organizations must transform their structures, processes, and cultures: they will need to become more open and non-hierarchical and to create a culture of trust. Ultimately, the power of social technologies hinges on the full and enthusiastic participation of employees who are not afraid to share their thoughts and trust that their contributions will be respected. Creating these conditions will be far more challenging than implementing the technologies themselves.</p>

<title>Mintel launches new social media report series</title>
<p>Mintel has launched a new series of reports examining consumer behaviour with brands both online and offline. Mintel’s Social Media Series is the first of its kind to look at social media from a consumer angle providing in-depth analysis into online behaviour. Using consumer research, Mintel will reveal how people are engaging with brands within the consumer goods and services markets. In addition, they will look at the ways in which people use social media and the internet to influence and inform purchasing decisions.</p>
<p>Alexandra Richmond, Senior Analyst, at Mintel said:<disp-quote>
<p>Social networks have established themselves as integral to the consumer’s digital experience. They not only enrich the brand experience, but also help to integrate real-world brands into users’ digital lifestyles. People are turning to online discussions for product recommendations, listening to the opinions of others and increasingly forming networks based on shared interests and tastes. For brands willing to engage with participants within these networks, social networks present an opportunity to communicate with an audience and establish a position via the medium of the digital environment.</p>
<p>Online consumer reviews, discussions and tweets are just a few of the areas within social media factored into purchasing decisions and therefore need to be understood by organizations wanting to influence the overall decision-making process. It is the motives and behaviours behind online conversations and brand mentions which provide the greatest insights. These reports will help our clients understand not just what their clients are doing on social media, but why they are doing it – helping to guide effective social media and digital strategies.</p>
</disp-quote>The series will encompass one report a month, each focusing on a different sector – with the initial report examining the beauty and personal care industry.</p>

<p>As I reported in <italic>BIR</italic> 29(1) March 2012, one of the best commentators and networkers in social media is Stephen Dale. He tweets, blogs, monitors and writes about all kinds of social and KM issues in an almost bewildering range of web/social resources. I am personally indebted to him for his intelligence and diligence in making this complex world more comprehensible to me. I hope that lots of other IM &amp; KM professionals will follow his contributions too, as well as taking part in the various conversations in these media about this crucial and still emerging field. Follow him on Twitter @stephendale and via his website at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://stephendale.com">http://stephendale.com</ext-link></p>

<title>Big data</title>
<p>There is much talk about ‘Big Data’ but some of us struggle to see significant improvement in the ways corporations manage their vast data resources. Oracle shed light on some of the key issues for chief information officers and strategists.</p>
<sec id="section8-0266382112460943">
<title>Organizations accumulating data but not making it pay</title>
<p>The Oracle Corporation has launched the results of its ‘From Overload to Impact: An industry scorecard on Big Data business challenges’ report which surveyed 333 C-level (i.e. ‘Board level’) executives from US and Canadian enterprises spanning 11 industries to determine the pain points they face regarding managing the deluge of data coming into their organizations and how well they are using that information to drive profit and growth.</p>
<p>Overall key findings:<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>The data deluge is here: 94 per cent of C-level executives say their organization is collecting and managing more business information today than two years ago, by an average of 86 per cent more. Respondents note they see the biggest data growth areas coming from customer information (48%), operations (34%) and sales and marketing (33%).</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Room for improvement: Executives say they are not prepared to handle the increasing amount of data they face. A total of 29 per cent of executives give their organization a ‘D’ or ‘F’ in preparedness to manage the data deluge, and 93 per cent believe their organization is losing revenue opportunities – representing on average, 14 per cent of revenue – by not being able to exploit fully the information they collect. On average, private-sector organizations with revenues of $1 billion or more say they are losing approximately 13 per cent of their annual revenue as a result of not being able to use their information fully. That translates to $130 million each year for a $1 billion organization. Only 8 per cent of executives give their organization an ‘A’ in preparedness.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Managers do not have or cannot get to the timely info they need: Respondents note they are frustrated with their organizations’ data gathering and distribution systems. Specifically, 38 per cent note they do not have the right systems in place to gather the information they need, 36 per cent cannot give their business managers access to pertinent information and need to rely on IT to compile and analyze information and 29 per cent feel they are using systems that are not designed to meet the unique needs of their industry.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Setting a path forward: 97 per cent of respondents note their organization must improve information optimization over the next two years. Top priorities include improving the ability to translate information into actionable insight (43%), acquiring tools to collect more accurate information (38%) and training employees to better make sense of information (38%).</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Vertical application leap: 77 per cent of organizations use industry-specific applications or software to help exploit information to make strategic decisions. The financial services (91%) and healthcare (87%) industries are most likely to use industry-specific applications.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Intelligence is a top priority: 67 per cent of executives say that the ability to draw intelligence from their data is a top organizational priority.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0266382112460943">
<title>Industry findings</title>
<p>Executives in the communications industry are most confident in their organizations’ preparedness for the data deluge, with 20 per cent giving their organization an ‘A’ rating. The communications, manufacturing and retail industries lose the lowest estimated percentage of additional annual revenue because of their current data management processes – 10 per cent.</p>
<p>Senior managers in the public sector, healthcare and utilities industries are least prepared to handle the data deluge – with 41 per cent of public sector executives, 40 per cent of healthcare executives and 39 per cent of utilities executives giving themselves a ‘D’ or ‘F’ preparedness rating. The oil and gas (22%) and life sciences (20%) industries lose the greatest estimated percentage of annual revenue due to their current data management processes.</p>
<p>Oracle President Mark Hurd said:<disp-quote>
<p>This study shows that up to 14 per cent of a company’s revenue is lost because enterprises are challenged to manage and analyze data, which grows exponentially as we speak. Enterprises can get ahead of the game by using these challenges as catalysts for company-wide strategic change. Through industry-specific applications and technologies, enterprises can transform data into measurable business benefits.</p>
</disp-quote>The full report delves extensively into how prepared organizations within each industry are for the data deluge and the resources they need to enhance their ability to use and exploit incoming data.</p>

<title>Market intelligence</title>
<p>We have already referred to US business intelligence company Digimind’s State of Market Intelligence Survey 2012 under the section on social media. The same Survey also sheds interesting light on how the competitive and market intelligence sector is a rapidly growing business function, albeit that it is still at an early stage in its evolution. More than two-thirds of Survey respondents (67%) declared that their intelligence department has been in existence for less than five years. Fewer than 20 per cent of those surveyed are part of an intelligence department that is ten years or older. The Report claims that while competitive and market intelligence is still a relatively new discipline, its influence in shaping strategic thinking and decision-making makes it a mission critical business function for the 21st century.</p>
<p>A majority (79.2%) of intelligence practitioners monitor social media sites to extract information relating to competitors, industry developments, consumer trends and more. A total of 84.2 per cent of respondents said the economic situation had not caused their intelligence team to be downsized. However, three-quarters of respondents indicated that they would not be recruiting within their intelligence team in 2012. Over a quarter (28%) admitted that their intelligence budget had been decreased in the last two years. Two-thirds of respondents have an intelligence budget of less than 50K Euros ($63K). A total of 40.8 per cent of respondents claimed the average salary for intelligence practitioners in their organization was between 35K and 45K Euros ($44K–$57K). Only a small proportion (11.8%) of those surveyed said the average income was more than 75K Euros ($94K).</p>
<p>Lack of human resources and lack of time are the difficulties most often encountered by intelligence teams. Almost three-quarters (70.4%) of respondents would describe the current performance of their intelligence unit as ‘satisfactory’. A total of 89.6 per cent of respondents recognized that monitoring competitors was a key concern relating to intelligence, while two-thirds agreed that acquiring talent was not as important in their intelligence needs. The average number of hours per week an intelligence team spends searching for information online is 15, however some intelligence teams find they spend up to 70 hours per week on this activity alone. Of the companies using intelligence software, half of these tools have been in place for between 1–5 years (52.9%).</p>
<p>The amount of time spent sourcing information online varied greatly among the organizations who participated in the Survey. The average number of hours an intelligence practitioner spends on this activity is 15, but one respondent claimed to spend 70 hours a week on this task alone (this throws some doubt on the authority of the respondents!). Nearly half of all respondents (45.8%) stated that they monitor between 10 and 50 sources. Of these monitored sources, online press and reviews, corporate websites and news aggregators are monitored most regularly – 73.6 per cent of organizations monitor online press every day, 51.4 per cent do the same for corporate websites and 52.8 per cent for news aggregators. Forums and discussion groups are not monitored regularly with 26.4 per cent admitting that their organization never monitors this source. A total of 43.1 per cent of participating companies monitor social networks such as Twitter, Facebook and LinkedIn every day, with just over one in five respondents never monitoring these sources.</p>

</list>This is an impressive diet of business content. Reuters has now added another weekly show, ‘Impact Players’, a 20-minute webcast featuring <bold>Robert Wolf</bold>, the veteran Wall Street executive and ‘outside’ advisor to President Obama. It will include interviews with top policymakers, financiers and thought leaders and it will explore the major concerns surrounding the biggest stories in the news and examine the ways Wolf and his guests address key issues, solve problems and lay out strategies.</p>
<p>‘After 28 years on Wall Street, first as a trader and eventually as the President of a major investment bank and member of President Obama’s Economic Advisory Board, I’ve gotten to know a lot of really smart people and have learned one or two things myself along the way,’ said Wolf. ‘This seems like the perfect time to share some of that insight and get some of the brightest minds in the world to weigh in.’</p>
<p>‘The Reuters YouTube channel is going from strength to strength with its innovative news programming, and this latest show from Robert Wolf will substantively contribute to the online discussion around political and economic issues,’ said Olivia Ma, YouTube’s News Manager.</p>
<p>‘The conversation about the economy and politics is the most important one going on in the United States right now and I can’t think of anyone better than Robert Wolf working with Reuters to bring that to life for the YouTube audience,’ said Dan Colarusso, the Head of Global Programming for Reuters. The show will be produced by Mark White, who most recently was the executive producer of Bloomberg Television’s morning programming. Television news veteran Barclay Palmer is the executive producer of Reuters TV on YouTube.</p>

<title>‘The CMI Management Articles of the Year’ scheme</title>
<p>A key omnipresent challenge is that of transferring academic research into usable industrial applications and knowledge. Business schools have been the focus of criticism of the ‘relevance’ of their research more than most. The Chartered Management Institute (CMI) have launched a new venture to make a contribution to making business research more usable and accessible and to showcase useful knowledge. They have collected some important articles together and published them on the web.</p>
<p>The CMI ‘Management Articles of the Year’ scheme was introduced in 2011 under the oversight of CMI’s Academic Advisory Council:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>We challenged the research community to submit their work in the form of short articles for review by the professional management community. This process can provide valuable ‘real-world’ feedback to researchers and also helps busy managers to be guided by their peers’ reviews to identify the research that is most valuable to them. This creates an online knowledge transfer ‘market place’ to enable academics in UK business schools and universities to share their most accessible and relevant research.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The first batch of five articles is now available:<list list-type="bullet">

<title>BvD enhances its Mint range</title>
<p>Bureau van Dijk (BvD) has added further enhancements to its Mint product range. New features, including the addition of ‘strategic searches’ to help users target companies more creatively, are now available.</p>
<p>BvD’s Mint range offers company information and business intelligence with a streamlined interface and is widely used in the sales and marketing environment. Users can create targeted lists for campaigns and refresh and enrich their in-house data via CRM integration. BvD did a major revamp of the Mint interface at the end of 2011.</p>
<p>BvD has now incorporated searches for more strategic targeting, all with the aim of identifying potential business opportunities. They include options to find companies with consistent growth; by year end and companies who are affected by recent M&amp;A activity. There is also the option to search for companies who are investment backed, suggesting more aggressive growth targets and budget availability. In addition, BvD has further developed its unique ‘SegMintation’ function where users can create fast segmentation reports on their search results to see how they breakdown by SIC code, region and turnover.</p>
<p>‘The response to our new Mint has been extremely positive,’ said Tony Pringle, BvD’s UK managing director,<disp-quote>
<p>… the new interface is fast and easy to use and really popular with users. Some of the new enhancements are a result of feedback – we really appreciate our users suggesting what they’d like to see on our products. We’re seeing an increased interest in international data, especially for CRM integration, and we’ve now launched the new Mint interface on the global and European versions of Mint.</p>
</disp-quote>Mint was originally launched in 2004. The range includes a dedicated Mint for the UK plus global, European and other regional versions. BvD offers a free trial scheme so users can try Mint in their own environment.</p>

<title>Thomson Reuters and Wolters Kluwer join forces on current awareness</title>
<p>Thomson Reuters and Wolters Kluwer Law &amp; Business have linked up to offer select Wolters Kluwer current awareness content on Thomson Reuters Westlaw online legal research platforms. The exclusive agreement will add Wolters Kluwer’s current awareness products – daily awareness of breaking legal developments which have been analyzed and contextualized by attorney-editors – to the comprehensive legal research databases, news and tools on Westlaw. The two businesses will also collaborate on current awareness product development.</p>
<p>The new current awareness products on Westlaw will combine news, primary law such as statutes, judicial opinions and regulations, dockets, court wire content and other sources, and will be enhanced with legal analysis from attorney editors. The first two products launched will include Wolters Kluwer’s unique current awareness dailies, Employment Law Daily and IP Law Daily, and secondary source content across a range of practice areas in law and business compliance will be added to WestlawNext. Other new products that provide analysis and insight into key business topics are already being developed and will be rolled out over the next several quarters. Moving forward, on-point information will be pushed to customers where they are, synthesized into usable formats, with links to deeper sources.</p>
<p>The two businesses see an opportunity to exploit what they see as best-in-class analytical and authoritative Wolters Kluwer Law &amp; Business content; current Westlaw news content, including more than 12,000 databases of news in the Thomson Reuters Newsroom collection and exclusive reporting from Reuters News; and the market-leading primary and analytical content on Westlaw, to bring a new level of market insight to the current awareness marketplace.</p>
<p>According to Leann Blanchfield, vice president of Product Development at Thomson Reuters, current awareness information is a key part of every attorney’s workflow. It helps legal professionals stay up to speed in today’s highly competitive environment, and attorneys also rely on news, analysis and insight to identify clients and create winning pitches. ‘Wolters Kluwer Law &amp; Business current awareness content is unique and indispensable to busy lawyers who require expert analysis and contextualization of rapidly-changing areas of the law,’ said Blanchfield.</p>
<p>Blanchfield also goes on to say:<disp-quote>
<p>Its current awareness products provide original, attorney-authored analysis that puts context around breaking legal developments. They are seen as an essential tool to help busy lawyers stay up-to-date on vital developments in their field. Working together, Thomson Reuters and Wolters Kluwer will create a unique marriage between current awareness and deep research for the legal marketplace.</p>
</disp-quote>Robert Lemmond, vice president of the Legal Markets Group at Wolters Kluwer said:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>Wolters Kluwer’s current awareness legal dailies are all created by attorneys for attorneys, and are an essential tool for lawyers to put breaking legal news, decisions, and rulemaking in broad context and apply the industry’s leading level of analysis to highly complex and rapidly-changing areas of the law.</p>
<p>This collaborative relationship with Thomson Reuters will enable us to deliver breaking news content to the entire family of Westlaw customers, and we are looking forward to working with the Thomson Reuters team to develop new current awareness products for legal professionals that allow them to work more efficiently.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Lemmond said the sweet spot for the market is the convergence of current awareness and deep primary and analytical content. ‘We are uniquely positioned to bring together domain expertise with specialized proprietary content, and add the insights of a seasoned team of attorney editors and analysts,’ he said.</p>
<p>Blanchfield agreed:<disp-quote>
<p>The combination of Wolters Kluwer’s reporting depth and domain expertise, with the breadth of Thomson Reuters news and current awareness capabilities and the insight and content of the Westlaw research service is quite powerful. For customers, it will mean a current awareness offering that promises an entirely new level of insight and foresight. We’re excited to be working together.</p>

<title>Moody’s Analytics expands global economic scenarios for stress testing</title>
<p>Economic forecasting service Moody’s Analytics has announced the global expansion of its Alternative Scenarios economic forecast service, which now covers 49 countries, representing more than 93 per cent of world economic output. The economic forecasts include a baseline, or most likely outcome scenario, and six alternative economic scenarios covering both downside and upside risks.</p>
<p>Portfolio managers and risk professionals use scenario analysis to understand and model the impact of various economic outcomes on the performance of their portfolios, and comply with stress testing requirements for market, credit, liquidity and operational risk.</p>
<p>Moody’s Analytics Alternative Scenarios provide timely access to the most current economic projections to help financial institutions manage their portfolios amid evolving economic conditions. By testing the impact of shocks and differing economic assumptions on their portfolios they can expose potential vulnerabilities in their business model. The six alternative economic scenarios can be applied across single or multiple countries to help multinationals enhance their understanding of the risks in their global portfolios and business operations.</p>
<p>‘Our alternative forecasting methodology is very comprehensive and uses structural models that provide a high degree of accuracy and consistency,’ said Mark Zandi, Chief Economist of Moody’s Analytics. ‘The economic scenarios account for differences in how global economies respond to a wide range of potential shocks – a key factor for regulatory compliance. The models are based on comprehensive historical data that is consistent and comparable across countries.’</p>
<p>The scenarios are updated monthly and consider a range of potential outcomes from a rapid resolution of the European sovereign debt crisis to eventualities such as intensification of the sovereign debt crisis, a disorderly exit of Greece from the European Monetary Union, and increasing pressure on the euro membership of indebted peripheral countries.</p>
<p>‘For example, our baseline assumption – the most likely outcome – currently does not include a Greek exit. However, if we wanted to test the impact of a more severe scenario, such as the impact of a Greek exit on the UK, we would see a 5.1 per cent decline in UK economic output in the third quarter of 2013 and, by early 2014, an unemployment rate of 12.3 per cent,’ said Petr Zemcik, Director of European Research for Moody’s Analytics.</p>
<p>‘In our oil price shock alternative scenario, we model the impact of a weak dollar combined with escalating Middle East tension that pushes international oil prices to a peak over $140 per barrel by mid-2013,’ added Zemcik.</p>
<p>Each scenario is supported with a narrative describing the underlying assumptions and includes a comprehensive set of economic indicators, covering not just headline numbers, but all macroeconomic concepts relevant for portfolio modelling and stress testing. The projections go out 30 years for the US and 10 years for Canada and the major economies in Europe, Asia, and the Americas, and are updated monthly to capture the impact of the latest data and recent economic events.</p>

<title>Publicly funded information: Open government data and open access</title>
<p>The current flavour of the month is ‘openness’. Two major developments characterize this in rather different ways.</p>
<p>A theme to which we return fairly regularly in this column is that of the availability of government data. An increasing cacophonous campaign has been pursued in the <italic>Guardian</italic> newspaper and elsewhere to pressurize the UK Government to be more active and open in the release of publicly funded data. In <italic>BIR</italic> 29(1), March 2012 we reported on the European Union’s Open Data Strategy ‘Turning Government Data into Gold’. Either driven by this initiative or because Government officials and ministers actually believe this is desirable (!), the UK Government, through the Cabinet Office, has published a major White Paper outlining their plans.</p>
<p>‘Open Data White Paper: Unleashing the potential’ sets out how they intend to put data and transparency at the heart of government and public services:<disp-quote>
<p>We’re making it easier to access public data; easier for data publishers to release data in standardized, open formats; and engraining a ‘presumption to publish’ unless specific reasons (such as privacy or national security) can be clearly articulated. From the Prime Minister down, central Government is committed to making Open Data an effective engine of economic growth, social well being, political accountability and public service improvement.</p>
</disp-quote>The intention, according to Minister for the Cabinet Office, Francis Maud is that ‘a tidal wave of new data releases covering health, education and work will help drive improvements in public services, contribute to growth and innovation, and put the citizen at the heart of the open data revolution’.</p>
<p>‘The Open Data White Paper sets out how the government will ensure that everybody can benefit from open data by making data held by the public sector more accessible and usable.’ The paper has been published alongside a series of new commitments from across government to release more data. ‘The data has the ability to change people’s lives for the better and will give businesses the raw material they need to create new products and services, which will in turn create jobs and growth.’</p>
<p>New data release commitments made include:<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>Information showing GP practice performance in handling cancer cases, enabling patients to compare survival rates between neighbouring practices;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Increasing transparency around grant funding by publishing data on which organizations receive public money from Civil Society Programmes;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Data on the management and use of EU funds in the UK to increase accountability and encourage better management of EU funds; and</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>New datasets which show the results of international aid projects and detailed maps of aid projects, so people can see where money is being spent.</p>
</list-item>
</list>As well as marking commitments to new data releases, the White Paper also identifies actions the government is taking to ensure data is as useful as it can be. ‘This will ensure that the full potential of data to empower citizens, foster innovation and growth, and reform public services is unleashed’ says Mr Maud.</p>
<p>People’s access to data will be strengthened and the usability of data will be improved through the following measures:<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>The Public Data Principles, which set out that public data policy will be driven by the public and businesses who want and use the data, will be officially adopted as government policy;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Open data released by government will be marked against inventor of the world wide web Tim Berners-Lee’s Five Star Scheme for data quality and re-usability; and</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>A complete overhaul of the data.gov.uk site to include better search facilities, simpler ways to access information, an advanced GIS data search (including map previewing) and better tools for developers, such as API access to the catalogue holdings.</p>
</list-item>
</list>The Government regards it as essential that Open Data is as re-usable as possible. In 2010, Sir Tim Berners-Lee proposed a Five Star Scheme for assessing the degree to which individual datasets are re-usable. An expanded version of his scheme for free data is as follows:<table-wrap id="table1-0266382112460943" position="float">

<title>Open access – a major report for the UK Government</title>
<p>The issue of ‘open access’ to research findings has been bubbling away for more than a decade. Universities – managers, treasurers, librarians and most of all academics – have become increasingly frustrated at the traditional model of scholarly publication and dissemination. The major difficulties relate to the pricing of journals by publishers and the desire to maximize the availability and use of publicly funded research.</p>
<p>How is there to be a balanced solution between the legitimate interests of the publishers and academic/research community/general users, the maintenance of the peer review quality control system and a more equitable sharing of costs between the stakeholders? University of Manchester Professor of Sociology (and former Vice-Chancellor of Keele University), Dame Janet Finch, was appointed by the UK’s Research Information Network to chair a senior sector review panel to make recommendations to the UK Government. The Report was published in July 2012 and constitutes a very authoritative and sound analysis along with far-reaching policy recommendations.</p>
<p>The Report argues that the UK should embrace the transition to open access, and accelerate the process in a measured way which promotes innovation but also retains what is most valuable in the research communications ecosystem. The process itself will be complex, since as the transition develops over the next few years, no single channel can on its own maximize access to research publications for the greatest number of people.</p>
<p>The specific recommendations are:<list list-type="roman-lower">
<list-item>
<p>A clear policy direction should be set towards support for publication in open access or hybrid journals, funded by article processing charges (APCs), as the main vehicle for the publication of research, especially when it is publicly funded;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>The Research Councils and other public sector bodies funding research in the UK should – following the Wellcome Trust’s initiative in this area but recognizing the specific natures of different funding streams – establish more effective and flexible arrangements to meet the costs of publishing in open access and hybrid journals;</p>

<p>During the period of transition to open access publishing worldwide, in order to maximize access in the HE and health sectors to journals and articles produced by authors in the UK and from across the world that are not accessible on open access terms, funds should be found to extend and rationalize current licences to cover all the institutions in those sectors;</p>
</list-item>

<p>The current discussions on how to implement the proposal for walk-in access to the majority of journals to be provided in public libraries across the UK should be pursued with vigour, along with an effective publicity and marketing campaign;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Representative bodies for key sectors including central and local Government, voluntary organizations, and businesses, should work together with publishers, learned societies, libraries and others with relevant expertise to consider the terms and costs of licences to provide access to a broad range of relevant content for the benefit of consortia of organizations within their sectors; and how such licences might be funded;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Future discussions and negotiations between universities and publishers (including learned societies) on the pricing of big deals and other subscriptions should take into account the financial implications of the shift to publication in open access and hybrid journals, of extensions to licensing, and the resultant changes in revenues provided to publishers;</p>
</list-item>

<p>Universities, funders, publishers, and learned societies should continue to work together to promote further experimentation in open access publishing for scholarly monographs;</p>

<p>The infrastructure of subject and institutional repositories should be developed so that they play a valuable role complementary to formal publishing, particularly in providing access to research data and to grey literature, and in digital preservation;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Funders’ limitations on the length of embargo periods, and on any other restrictions on access to content not published on open access terms, should be considered carefully, to avoid undue risk to valuable journals that are not funded in the main by APCs. Rules should be kept under review in the light of the available evidence as to their likely impact on such journals.</p>
</list-item>
</list>At the launch of the Report, Professor Finch said: ‘In the longer term, the future lies with open access publishing,’ ‘The UK should recognize this change, should embrace it and should find ways of managing it in a measured way.’ The Government formally accepted the report’s recommendations on 14<sup>th</sup> July.</p>

<title>Greater competition and more localized content to avoid digital divide</title>
<p>Competitive markets with strong, transparent regulations and content tailored to regional markets can lower barriers to online access and drive up usage. Policies to measure whether access is being used effectively, innovative partnerships between governments, the private sector and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) are also helping underserved populations go online for the first time. These are among the major findings of a new Economist Intelligence Unit report based on in-depth interviews with experts from more than ten developed and emerging-market countries.</p>
<p>The report ‘Smart policies to close the digital divide: Best practices from around the world’ sponsored by Tele2, presents best practices that have been adopted by governments and the private sector globally to bridge digital divides. The report identifies six areas in which smart policies can improve online take-up, in order to seize the full economic and social potential of the information society.</p>
<p>‘Governments around the world have come a long way in the past decade in opening up access to information and communication technologies (ICT),’ says Jason Sumner, senior editor at the Economist Intelligence Unit and editor of the report. ‘There is still work to do though. In emerging markets it is about continuing to expand basic access, and in developed markets the goal should be to help those already online make the best use of digital channels.’</p>
<p>The other main report findings are:<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>
<bold>Making the case at the highest levels</bold>. Although agreement is nearly universal about the benefits of the information society, the business case must be made at the highest levels of government in order for policymakers to prioritize it and set strategic targets. This is important in ensuring that the digital divide does not also become a next-generation divide as countries introduce enhanced technologies, such as higher-speed access.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>
<bold>Access still comes first</bold>. Developing countries need to focus on providing greater coverage for rural areas as well as faster mobile solutions, while developed countries must better educate users and those remaining offline about the benefits of ICT.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>
<bold>Competition leads to lower costs, more usage</bold>. Competition generally stimulates demand for ICT and online services. In mobile markets, for example, the link between open markets and affordable services shows why some countries and regions have higher adoption rates than others. To bridge divides in this area, policymakers everywhere need to establish competitive markets through strong and transparent regulations.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>
<bold>Measure what matters, especially ‘useful usage’</bold>. Even after countries have achieved high levels of access to ICT, new digital divides await. One is what users do with their access. Measuring productive usage challenges governments to find new ways of assessing progress in closing the digital divide, a necessary element in making it a policy priority. In this regard, some countries have created their own bespoke assessments, whereas most look to international comparisons and benchmarking reports.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>
<bold>There is a role for the private sector and NGOs in enhancing ICT skills</bold>. Lack of education and ICT skills are among the most commonly cited digital divides. To ensure that social divides do not also become digital divides, the public sector must better integrate ICT into education initiatives. However, there are also strong reasons why they should encourage non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and the private sector to provide innovative programmes to bridge the divide.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>
<bold>Stimulate local content creation and consumption</bold>. Even if other divides are overcome, a gap in access to local information and services, which can help to increase usage, remains. Many countries, particularly emerging markets, have seen new local content initiatives but more can be done as this is a future strategic imperative for the public sector and a private sector opportunity.</p>

<title>Information and knowledge professions</title>
<p>Professional information and knowledge organizations continue to vie for roles in the changing landscape. CILIP, SLA and others are all trying to forecast the future and at the same time mount a coherent case why their interpretations of the required professional and business needs are best served by them. There are many different takes on future requirements for skills and knowledge in the information, knowledge and technology arenas.</p>
<sec id="section26-0266382112460943">
<title>The future for ‘Information Leaders'?</title>
<p>IT research company Gartner has produced an important report by Deb Logan and Mark Raskino ‘Prepare to be an Information Leader’. The authors note that the first half of the Information Age was all about building plumbing and making processes more efficient, and that the second half is all about creating value from the information these processes produce. They further note that organizations ‘must acquire new skills to meet these challenges.’</p>
<p>The key issue in the report is their belief that the demand for information professionals will increase by 50 per cent year on year right through 2015. In the UK, TFPL’s 2011 research contained a survey result that showed the industry in a steady state. Before the survey they had expected to find a post-2008 decline and were delighted to see that this was not the case. Our own Business Information Survey 2012 (<italic>BIR</italic> 29(1), March 2012) discovered a modest decline, some 10 per cent, in staff numbers. So Gartner’s predicted 50 per cent increase in demand is fairly extraordinary but these differences could be accounted for by a different population and a professional strand being examined.</p>
<p>TFPL’s Darron Chapman, who is in a very good position to read the runes, said:<disp-quote>
<p>[This forecast increase] does resonate with the growing sense that in the era of Big Data, we will experience a skills gap which translates into a shortage of suitably trained professionals. Just what these professionals will be remains unclear at this point, but we are seeing strong signs of growth in analysis and intelligence roles at the expense of more traditional information management jobs. We'll come back to this topic in the future to test if it’s a consultancy fancy or a weak signal presaging future growth.</p>
</disp-quote>In early 2012, US professional association AIIM (Association for Information and Image Management) conducted a market survey of more than 200 business executives investigating the value of certification for information professionals. AIIM claim that the results show that executives are willing to pay a premium for both internal staff and external consultants with the Certified Information Professional (CIP) designation.</p>
<p>The survey headlines are reported in The Rise of the Information Professional: a career path for the digital economy. AIIM, 2012.<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>64 per cent of business executives would prefer to hire a Certified Information Professional (CIP) versus a non-certified candidate.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>76 per cent of business executives would pay a CIP a salary premium. Of these, 45 per cent indicated that they would pay more than a 10 per cent salary premium.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>61 per cent of business executives would prefer consultants that hold the CIP designation over those who do not.</p>

<p>60 per cent of business executives would prefer CIP-certified IT staff.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>66 per cent of business executives think having CIP-certified staff would improve their ability to find, manage, and exploit their information assets across the enterprise.</p>
</list-item>
</list>AIIM’s John Mancini said:<disp-quote>
<p>We couldn’t agree more with the Gartner findings. Last year, you may recall, we built the body of knowledge that these information professionals need and created a standardized 100 question proctored test of competency. The Certified Information Professional, or CIP. A brand new concept for a brand new profession.</p>
<p>To meet this need, over the past year, AIIM worked with industry experts and focus groups to define the body of knowledge necessary for these new information professionals to be successful, built a certification and test based upon this body of knowledge that is available at locations around the world, and has created a set of free training materials to help information professionals prepare for the examination.</p>

<title>Use of data</title>
<p>One of the trends found in recent annual Business Information Surveys is the drive for information and research staff to add more value to their services. Part of this in many information units is increasingly analytical work. So we were interested in a Euromonitor White Paper showing how to use official statistics in a creative way.</p>
<sec id="section28-0266382112460943">
<title>Quantitative analysis of the downstream value chain</title>
<p>This excellent guide for identifying and prioritizing revenue growth opportunities is by Indre Bajoraite and Giedrius Rudis and looks at ways to locate and prioritize revenue growth opportunities through data-driven analysis of the B2B marketplace. The paper presents publicly available data from National Statistics Offices and explains techniques used in analysing B2B client industries. It focuses on practical applications of available data, such as mapping value chains, sizing revenue potential from target industries, determining enterprise concentration and assessing price sensitivity.</p>
<p>The global recession of 2008 left an indelible mark on business strategists around the world; no longer could one expect to find growth through anecdote or rumour. Instead, accurate and meaningful quantitative methods are required to identify, prioritize and defend the careful alignment of resources with global business opportunities. As part of this process it is crucial for strategists in the areas of sales, marketing, operations and logistics to rigorously analyze their downstream value chain.</p>
<p>The aim of this White Paper is to guide B2B strategists through the copious data available in National Statistics Offices, introducing techniques to effectively use this data and make strategic decisions. It focuses on practical applications such as mapping value chains, sizing revenue potential from target industries, determining enterprise concentration and assessing price sensitivity.</p>
<p>This White Paper has four main parts:<list list-type="order">
<list-item>
<p>Description of available data;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Description of data applications;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Case study: The complete demand picture;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Limitations of data.</p>
</list-item>
</list>Much useful data comes out of national statistical offices, including National Accounts, Industry Surveys and Short Term Statistics (usually including production values/volumes and producer price indices – PPI) and Structural Business Statistics</p>
<p>The paper shows how to apply this data in such tasks as mapping your place in the value chain, sizing your income potential from the target industry, assessing the corporate landscape and assessing opportunities to raise prices. It illustrates this by a worked through case study utilizing this quantitative approach.</p>
<p>The report explains:<disp-quote>
<p>Once this analytical exercise is complete and the business case for resources is granted, firms are in position to execute their expansion strategy. Those who have selected to increase prices may wish to conduct objective trade interviews to uncover the qualitative elements that can be used to shape their value-add offerings and inform their sales and marketing strategy. Those interested in expanding into new industries and markets often wish to quicken the pace of success by conducting on-the-ground research projects to uncover market dynamics and provide the intelligence necessary to avoid common mistakes and effectively compete for market share. It is important to select research partners well-versed in projects such as this that are experienced in conducting research within desired geographies.</p>
<p>Business interactions are the essence of the B2B market; therefore, before making strategic decisions it’s important to understand the relationships between industries in your value chain.</p>

<p>One extremely interesting resource that social media guru Stephen Dale has brought to my attention is The Data Journalism Handbook, an incredibly rich resource for anyone interested in finding information, and a story, from data.</p>
<p>What is data journalism? To quote from the authors: ‘Perhaps it is the new possibilities that open up when you combine the traditional “nose for news” and an ability to tell a compelling story, with the sheer scale and range of digital information now available.’</p>
<p>This valuable handbook has attracted scores of contributors since the European Journalism Centre and the Open Knowledge Foundation launched the project at MozFest 2011. Through a collection of tips and techniques from leading journalists, professors, software developers, and data analysts, readers will learn how data can be either the source of data journalism or a tool with which the story is told – or both.<list list-type="bullet">

<title>Enterprise search</title>
<sec id="section30-0266382112460943">
<title>Enterprise search trends and developments</title>
<p>After a long period of benign neglect the Intranet Focus in their latest Research Note believes that there is a renaissance in enterprise search, with major acquisitions and a number of new application areas emerging. ‘One result of this is to question whether “enterprise search” is the correct description for either the technologies or the outcomes of the process of information discovery and analysis.’ The enterprise search industry, no matter how it is defined, is going through a major structural change as open-source search applications being increasingly adopted for enterprise use (in particular as a replacement for FAST ESP as it moves close to the cessation of main stream support in 2013), cloud-based search services are launched and some of the major vendors are in the process of being acquired and integrated into IT companies with global sales networks and a significant customer base.</p>
<p>At the Enterprise Search Europe 2012 conference there was considerable unanimity that the factors influencing this renaissance were Big Data, mobile search and cloud services. Intranet Focus Ltd Research Note 06/12, the latest in a series of extremely useful documents issued by the Focus, sets out some of the opportunities and issues arising from these and some other factors, and looks at the emergence of Big Data, search-based applications, unified information access, mobile search and federated search. Recent major acquisitions in the search sector are reviewed.</p>
<p>Even so the evidence from the recent Findwise global survey of the adoption of enterprise search is that enterprise search is still not taken seriously by organizations, with evidence of limited budgets, inadequate support teams and a lack of appreciation of the value of effective enterprise search to achieving business objectives.</p>
<p>In such a dynamic environment, the concluding comment in the document is: ‘Never has there been a more important time to have an information discovery strategy that takes a user-centric and task-based approach to finding quality information and data. Finding people and expertise has to be a business-critical component of this strategy.’</p>

<p>Forrester’s Western European Search Engine Marketing Forecast 2011–2016 includes some interesting projections. Growth in European search marketing spend will be somewhat ahead of that of the US. But from 2012 the search spend is growing more slowly, particularly ‘paid search’ advertising than historical averages as mobile and social technologies become increasingly important to aid multi-channel ‘discovery.’</p>
<p>This is not particularly because paid search is less relevant but that search and the process of ‘getting found’ across channels has become more diverse with the advent of social media, growth in mobile search, and shifting budgets to search engine optimization (SEO) in response to rising cost-per-click (CPC) rates in mature European markets. In fact, the authors advise search marketers to shift some paid search budgets to SEO as well as social and mobile channels to create strategies for discovery across channels, not just through search media.</p>
<p>Interestingly, despite huge marketing cutbacks, the troubled euro zone markets – Portugal, Italy, Greece, Spain – maintain growth only just below Western European averages as brands in these markets shift budgets to search and focus on acquisition and return on investment.</p>
<p>Overall, interesting times are ahead for the search agency that can develop multi-channel marketing strategies or the more traditional digital agency which shores up its search and discovery offering.</p>
