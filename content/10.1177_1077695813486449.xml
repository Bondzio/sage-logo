<title>Donald M. Gillmor</title>
<p>Dr. Donald (Don) Gillmor, professor emeritus, former Silha Professor, and founding director of the Silha Center for the Study of Media Ethics and Law at the University of Minnesota, died on February 14, 2013, after being in failing health for some time. He was eighty-six.</p>
<p>Born in Fort Frances, Ontario, Gillmor began his journalism career in 1950 as a reporter and copyreader at the <italic>Winnipeg Free Press</italic> after earning his bachelor’s degree in liberal arts at the University of Manitoba. He obtained his master’s degree in 1950 and his doctoral degree in mass communication in 1961 from the University of Minnesota. He taught at the University of North Dakota for twelve years from 1953 to 1965 before joining the faculty at Minnesota in 1965. He was a part-time copyreader for the <italic>Fargo Forum</italic> and the <italic>Grand Forks Herald</italic> while serving on the faculty of the University of North Dakota. He was the first director there of an all-university honors program.</p>
<p>His book, <italic>Mass Communication Law: Cases and Comment</italic>, which he coauthored with Jerome Barron and Todd Simon, became the classic text in media law courses. In 1970, the first edition received the Frank Luther Mott Research Award from Kappa Tau Alpha, the journalism honor society. His many articles and books include <italic>Power, Publicity, and the Abuse of Libel Law</italic> (1992); <italic>Media Freedom and Accountability</italic> (coeditor, 1989); <italic>Enduring Issues in Mass Communication</italic> (coeditor, 1978); and <italic>Free Press and Fair Trial</italic> (1966). He was a frequent guest on radio and television regarding discussions of media and made dozens of presentations to community groups and academic and professional gatherings. In 1999, he received the Al McIntosh Distinguished Service to Journalism Award from the Minnesota Newspaper Association.</p>
<p>Founder of the Silha Center for the Study of Media Ethics and Law in 1984, Gillmor was named the first Silha Professor of Media Ethics and Law in 1990, a position he held until his retirement in 1998. The late Otto Silha, a former executive with The Minneapolis <italic>Star</italic> and The Minneapolis <italic>Tribune</italic> and their parent company Cowles Media, endowed the Silha Center.</p>
<p>“Gillmor made it a point to take seriously the relationship between freedom and responsibility, automony and accountability, reminding us all that there’s a difference between what we have a right to do and what’s right to do,” Dr. Ted Glasser, a former University of Minnesota professor and former associate director of the Silha Center who now teaches at Stanford University, told the <italic>StarTribune</italic>. Gillmor recognized threats to press freedom and in the 1980s helped save the <italic>Minnesota Daily</italic> when the university was about to cut funding for the campus newspaper after it had published controversial articles.</p>
<p>He was also a gifted instructor. Dr. Phillip Tichenor, who joined the faculty at Minnesota at the same time as Gillmor, has been reported as saying Gillmor valued his students as much as his scholarship and wowed classes with an ability to speak eloquently on just about any topic. “You could hear other faculty listen to his lectures and say, ‘now that’s a teaching model to emulate,’” Tichenor said. His daughter, Vivian Cathcart of Toronto, told the <italic>StarTribune</italic>: “I would go to class sometimes, and he would get a standing ovation for his lectures. He loved to teach.”</p>
<p>Dr. Hazel Dicken-Garcia, professor emerita, University of Minnesota, who codeveloped and team-taught a course on Mass Media in History and Law with Dr. Gillmor had this to say on the Silha Center’s website:
<disp-quote>
<p>Seeing him interact with undergraduate students in that large class, which filled the Murphy Hall auditorium, was an education apart, and uniquely its own—for me as well as for the students. His demeanor alone encouraged class participation and students wanted to ask him <italic>good</italic> questions.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Over his forty-five-year teaching career, he became the nation’s foremost authority on ethics and media law and advised scores of graduate students who became faculty members at some of the nation’s leading universities. Dr. Albert Tims, director of the School of Journalism and Mass Communication at the University of Minnesota, told the <italic>StarTribune</italic>: “He trained some of the finest media law scholars. Don’s contributions brought this institution to center stage nationally and internationally.”</p>
<p>Gillmor received many teaching awards. Students, faculty, and alumni of the University of North Dakota presented him with the first Distinguished Teaching Award in 1959. He received two similar awards from the Minnesota Press Club in 1975 and 1978. In 1993, he received the Horace T. Morse-Minnesota Alumni Association Award for outstanding contributions to undergraduate education. Ball State, Saint Cloud State, and Washington and Lee universities gave him First Amendment awards in 1984, 1992, and 1993, respectively. The University of Minnesota student Alumni Board of Governors cited him for “contributions to student experience” in 1985, and he received the George Hage/Mitch Charnley Award of Excellence from the Minnesota Daily Alumni Association in 1996. That same year, he received the Constitutional Law Award from the Minneapolis law firm of Mansfield, Tanick and Cohen. In 2009, he received the University of Minnesota School of Journalism and Mass Communication Alumni Society’s Award for Excellence.</p>
<p>Gillmor was a founding member of the University of Minnesota’s Ethics Consortium, the Association for Education in Journalism and Mass Communication (AEJMC) Law Division, and the Free Press-Fair Trial Council of Minnesota. He was particularly proud that Lewis Powell, in his inaugural address as president of the American Bar Association, and the U.S. Supreme Court in <italic>Nebraska Press Association v. Stuart</italic> (1976) cited his work.</p>
<p>In 1990, Gillmor was selected as a senior fellow at the Gannett Center for Media Studies at Columbia University and assigned to Columbia’s law faculty. He was also a visiting professor of American Studies and Mass Communication at the University of Munich in Germany and a visiting professor of political science at the University of Lund in Sweden.</p>
<p>He is survived by his wife of sixty-three years, Sophie, St. Paul; his daughter, Vivian Cathcart of Toronto (Francesco Perino); his son, Peter (Barbara), Minneapolis; and grandsons, Steven Cathcart, and Kevin and Geoffrey Gillmor. He is also survived by his brothers, Douglas (Donna Jean), Calgary, Alberta, and Alan (Susan), Ottawa, Ontario.</p>

<title>Nancy L. Harper</title>
<p>Dr. Nancy L. Harper, author of <italic>Human Communication Theory: The History of a Paradigm</italic>, and an administrator at various institutions, died on March 19, 2013.</p>
<p>Harper earned her doctorate at the University of Iowa, then went to Rutgers as assistant professor. She returned to Iowa as assistant professor of journalism and mass communication. At Iowa, she published <italic>Human Communication Theory: The History of a Paradigm</italic> in 1979. She became associate dean of arts and sciences and associate professor of communication studies there.</p>
<p>She left Iowa for Duquesne, where she was professor and department chair. From Duquesne, she went to Grand Valley State University as dean of social sciences.</p>
<p>When she left the deanship, she continued as an administrator of projects to reduce student binge drinking.</p>
<p>She is survived by her husband, Ric Carter, and their son, Galen Harper Carter.</p>

<title>Gilbert A. Maddox</title>
<p>Dr. Gilbert Alan Maddox, a former communications professor and department chair at Morgan State University and the first African American man to earn a doctoral degree in mass communications, died on January 12, 2013, in Washington, D.C. He was eighty-two.</p>
<p>A native of Detroit, Maddox earned his doctorate from Wayne State University in 1970. He taught in the Detroit public schools before holding faculty appointments at Wayne State University, Howard University, the University of Michigan, Michigan State University, the University of the District of Columbia, and Morgan State University.</p>
<p>A trailblazing broadcaster and educator as well as a historian, Maddox was one of the earliest contributors to an ongoing presence of African Americans on Detroit television. His 1959–60 TV series, “Black and Unknown Bards,” explored the contributions of African American authors from the American Colonial Period to 1960. Premiering on Detroit Public Television, the series was rebroadcast on WJBK TV and on fifty-six Michigan radio stations. From 1968 to 1969, Maddox teamed with Tony Brown at DPTV to executive produce “CPT” (“Colored People’s Time”), the predecessor to Detroit Black Journal. From 1969 through 1976, he hosted and coproduced 350 half-hour episodes of “Profiles in Black,” which aired on Channel 4 in Detroit.</p>
<p>“Profiles in Black,” according to Dr. Alice Tait in the <italic>Michigan Academician</italic> (1990), “was an award-wining public affairs program patterned after Edward R. Murrow’s highly successful ‘Person to Person’ series.” Maddox, she wrote, had made predictions about the series in an interview with the <italic>Detroit News</italic>:
<disp-quote>
<p>We, black people, are moving in the direction of establishing identities and of gaining political, economic, and social control of the black community . . . The series will show the full range of people comprising the black population—the professionals who have succeeded, the ADV mothers with their problems and hopes, young students, conservative and militant clergymen.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The series ultimately consisted of 480 programs and received numerous awards.</p>
<p>Maddox is survived by his wife Adelena, and his stepchildren Leslie Williams (Victor), Renee Strong-Terry, Victoria Syphax (Gregory), and Dulaine Harris as well as five grandchildren.</p>

<title>Margaret Morrison</title>
<p>Dr. Margaret Ann Morrison, professor and director of the School of Advertising and Public Relations at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, died at her home on March 13, 2013. She was forty-nine.</p>
<p>Morrison, who joined the University of Tennessee in 1995, became director in July 2012 after serving as interim director since late 2011.</p>
<p>She graduated with a B.S. degree in radio/television from Southern Illinois University–Carbondale in 1985; from Ohio University with a M.A. degree, telecommunications management, in 1987; and from the University of Georgia with a Ph.D. in mass communication in 1996. She had worked as an audience research analyst with MTV Networks and had served as a consultant for the U.S. Department of Justice before embarking on an academic career.</p>
<p>Morrison, who taught courses in media planning, creative strategy, and advertising campaigns, had won the college’s teaching award in 1996 and 1999. She had supervised master’s and doctoral committees and had published numerous scholarly articles in journals that included the <italic>Asian Journal of Communication</italic>, the <italic>Journal of Interactive Advertising</italic>, the <italic>Journal of Broadcasting &amp; Electronic Media</italic>, the <italic>Journal of American &amp; Comparative Cultures</italic>, and the <italic>Journal of Public Policy and Marketing</italic>.</p>
<p>She had served on the editorial board of the <italic>Journal of Advertising</italic> and the <italic>Journal of Website Promotion</italic> and was a reviewer for numerous journals related to advertising and mass communications.</p>
<p>“Margie was a wonderful friend, colleague and teacher in our college,” Dr. Mike Wirth, dean of the College of Communication and Information, told <italic>Tennessee Today</italic>. “Words are inadequate to express the sorrow that we all feel.”</p>
<p>Paul Domingo, a graduate student in advertising who was one of Morrison’s mentees, told the <italic>Daily Beacon</italic>: “She was extremely generous and selfless and truly willing to help . . . There was something about her that was welcoming, really inviting and really down to earth.”</p>

<title>Mark Poster</title>
<p>Dr. Mark Poster, emeritus professor of history and founding chair of the Department of Film &amp; Media Studies at the University of California–Irvine (UCI), where he had served for more than forty years, died on October 11, 2012.</p>
<p>Born in New York on July 5, 1941, he studied at the University of Pennsylvania Wharton School and completed a Ph.D. in history at New York University in 1968. He spent his career at UCI except for the three years from 2005 to 2008 when he was the Centennial Visiting Professor in the media and communications department at the London School of Economics (LSE). He made crucial contributions to two different departments at UCI—history, and film &amp; media studies—and played a central role in having UCI emerge as a leader in critical theory.</p>
<p>During the early part of his career, Poster’s work was in modern European intellectual history. His path-breaking publications included the influential book, <italic>Existential Marxism in Postwar France</italic> (Princeton University Press, 1975), a study of the intellectual world around Jean-Paul Sartre. He became a widely sought-after authority on French critical thought, especially the writings of Michel Foucault, whose work he helped introduce to American audiences. He edited and translated Jean Baudrillard’s <italic>Selected Writings</italic> (1988, 2001).</p>
<p>Poster helped start the Critical Theory Institute at UCI as an informal reading group, but by 1987, it was established as a campus research institute, soon becoming globally recognized for its work in the humanities. In the later part of his career, he became a theorist of media and technology and was the founding chair of the Department of Film &amp; Media Studies. His new focus generated books titled <italic>The Mode of Information: Post-structuralism and Social Context</italic> (1990) and <italic>Information Please: Culture and Politics in the Age of Digital Machines</italic> (2006).</p>
<p>“As a scholar, Poster often pushed the boundaries—first pushing historians to engage more with theory, then pushing theorists to engage more with new media,” Jon Wiener, a professor of history at UCI, told <italic>Times Higher Education</italic>.</p>
<p>He was particularly interested in the potential of post-structuralism for media studies and played a highly influential role in the study of media culture, including television, databases, computing, and the Internet. He commented on the relevance of cultural theory to technology and media. His numerous articles and books have been translated into a number of languages. Reflecting the breadth of his intellectual interests and expertise were his courtesy appointments in the Department of Information and Computer Science and the Department of Comparative Literature. He served on the advisory board for the Center for Digital Discourse and Culture, Virginia Tech.</p>
<p>He is survived by his wife, Annette Schlichter, and two daughters.</p>
