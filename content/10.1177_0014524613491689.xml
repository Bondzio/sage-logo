<p><bold>The Butterfly World</bold></p>
<p>Charles Williams, in his book, <italic>The Descent of the Dove</italic>, reflects on the difficulties of “real” Christianity, of being a “true” disciple of Christ. Who is up to the challenge!? Who really knows what the challenge is? Williams remarks that in relation to the Kingdom of God there are three categories of people discernable. There is the “old” disciple on the old road; there is the “old” disciple on the new road; and there is the “new” disciple on the new road. Most of us in the Church, Williams believes, fall in the middle category. We are on the new way that Christ has taught; but, we exhibit the same selfishness and insecurities as any one else. We are mixed up human beings who only see in a glass darkly; the new road of the Kingdom exists in the mind and has yet to reach the heart. Of course, if the new road were to reach the heart that would be the end of our present existence; personality would be transfigured and relationships revolutionised. It is like the two caterpillars crawling along the ground and a butterfly flutters past. One says to the other you will never get me up there in one of those contraptions. The Kingdom of God is another world; we might say the butterfly world! It is a world of painful endings and joyful beginnings.</p>
<p>In the parable of humility and hospitality Jesus would seem to be speaking of the butterfly world. It is so far above our highest thoughts, that to acknowledge it is too frightening for many. It is much more attractive to admire and to pay tribute to this “other” world, whilst living by the rules and benefits of this world. The old disciple on the new road appears to have the best of both worlds: head in the clouds, at least once a week, and feet on the ground most of the time. The result is sad inconsistencies that give Christianity a bad press and ever present hypocrisies. But still, ours is not a hopeless calling or Christianity would have long since disappeared. The old disciple on the new road can, through the miracle of grace, be transfigured and the new can be born from the ruins of the old. The gospel is that Jesus has walked the walk before us and for us; he has died and risen so that we may be able to die and live with him. The hope of being the new disciple on the new way is the tantalising challenge that Jesus puts before us. We take comfort from the fact that Jesus himself is the pioneer of the new way (Hebrews 12:2); and, because of that, the possibility is there for us, too.</p>
<p>The parable Jesus has given us is also insistent that the new self cannot be discovered apart from others. This is a radical point. In spiritual matters the temptation is to try to save the isolated self. When this is “achieved” we have a fine example of a polished ego, sitting proudly at the top table. Jesus’ teaching, and more so his life and death, cuts across nicely packaged, individualistic spirituality. He makes the audacious claim that the poor and the vulnerable, those with nothing to contribute because of material poverty, or physical poverty, or moral poverty, or all three, are in fact our partners in constructing the new road and they are the new people! What is more, the new way is not really our construction; it is a divine gift waiting to be taken up. The new partners on the new way are a strange conglomerate, a mixed bag of losers, defeated and ashamed, so “dead to the world” that they cannot play by the world’s rules. For that reason, Jesus chides the Pharisees for applying the normal rules of reward, for seeking “pay back” for favours done; the butterfly world is far above self-serving “morality”, “I’ll scratch your back if you scratch mine”. Jesus’ ideals are so high that he seems to counsel an elitist ethic. Be good for nothing! Goodness is its own reward. But such an elitist reading of our text misses the social core of Jesus’ teaching. Jesus, a messianic Jew, is not thinking of the isolated ego shining in its purity; he is thinking of all of God’s children and of how <italic>together</italic> they can be redeemed from pain and suffering. The context may be hospitality in the environs of Jerusalem; but, the bigger picture is the messianic banquet of the Kingdom. Jesus is saying imitate God’s hospitality; show a welcome to those in most need of welcome. Be the Kingdom you hope and pray for; and one day you will find yourselves in a society whose spirit is as generous as your own.</p>
<p>If many of his disciples have failed to rise to the ethic and spirituality of Kingdom living, there have, nevertheless, been wonderful examples of it. At times the Kingdom has broken through the clouds and the butterfly world has beautified the earth. We can think of the Methodist revival with its emphasis on renewal of heart and change of society. We can see how the piety of Mother Teresa led to street charity and service to the poor. One could speak of the Franciscans or the Poor Clares, of the Quakers or Mennonites, or of Mary Slessor’s love for the peoples of Calabar. These manifestations of the Kingdom are leaven to the world; they are like great fires of the Holy Spirit that flame up for a time and die away. Perhaps that is what Paul had in mind when he spoke of the birth pangs of a new creation. The sanctification of the human consciousness is a first step towards the promised new heavens and new earth.</p>
<p>In the teaching of Jesus it is practice that counts; words come cheap in comparison to actions. A simple reading of the parable is that it is a lesson on manners. Let us not pass that simple reading over lightly. The Irish artist John Butler Yeats, father of the poet WB Yeats, grew up in Drumcliff County Sligo, Ireland. His father was the Church of Ireland rector at the middle of the nineteenth century. Father and mother were “much loved by all the people of the countryside, catholic and protestant”. In his letters John Butler Yeats wrote that “as a child he was hardly ever scolded. In those days it was considered bad manners for parents to speak crossly to their children and so I grew up in the discipline of what I may call good manners as contrasted with the discipline of good morals.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0014524613491689">1</xref></sup> The Pharisee in us prefers morals to manners. The saintly parents of John Butler Yeats with their discipline of good manners, illustrate a wholly “other” approach. They were of the butterfly world, a source of blessing to their children, signs of beauty in their environment, whole and entire.</p>
