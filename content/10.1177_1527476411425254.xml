<p>From a Canadian perspective, the phone hacking scandal that has beset Rupert Murdoch’s global media empire casts light on some of the strengths and weaknesses of the Canadian mediascape, as well as offers lessons for democratic media reformers in Canada and elsewhere.</p>
<p>First, the controversy reminds us of the Murdoch media’s corrosive influence on journalism—a highly partisan, tabloid style, characterized by opinionated rightwing punditry, and by politically selective muckraking that targets social change movements, and perceived threats to the established social order from below or outside it, or from “liberal” elements within it. With its long history of a partisan tabloid press, the United Kingdom is familiar with this type of journalism but in Canada, under influence from the United States, journalism has been dominated for much of the twentieth century by a “regime of objectivity,” embodied in regulated television networks and metropolitan dailies that appealed to a broad cross section—albeit within the constraints of the political and economic sensitivities of corporate advertisers and media owners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1527476411425254">Hackett and Zhao 1998</xref>). Murdoch’s brand of journalism, most famously U.S.-based Fox News, has reached Canada via cable and satellite and spearheaded what some see as the return of the partisan press (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1527476411425254">Baum and Groeling 2010</xref>). Most recently, it has been the apparent inspiration for Canadian media giant Quebecor to launch a tabloid-style news channel.</p>
<p>Second, the scandal indicates the continued political relevance of so-called legacy media (including the institution formerly known as “the press”) in the digital era, even as newspapers in the United States (more so than elsewhere) struggle to find sustainable business models. Or, perhaps we should say, it underlines the continued political power of transnational media corporations with roots in the conventional media, and which are expanding into new media formats. Corporate mergers and consolidation in the media sector constitute a concentration of political and symbolic power that will almost inevitably be used and sometimes abused. The current scandal involves various allegations against News International, Murdoch’s British newspaper division, including use of its intelligence-gathering resources to intimidate politicians; its corrupt relationship with police forces; its invasion of privacy, including hacking the phones of murder and terrorism victims; interference with criminal investigations; and attempts to cover up such behavior. In this regard, and in conjunction with the manifest failure of press self-regulation as embodied in Britain’s Press Complaints Commission, the scandal served as a warning against the problems of concentrated media ownership—something successive Canadian governments have been repeatedly warned against by a number of task forces and commissions but have failed to act upon.</p>
<p>At the same time, the scandal highlights the critical democratic role of well-resourced, independent media. Media concentration always carries the risk of self-censorship. Journalists in the Murdoch media did not need explicit instruction to soft-pedal the scandal, but the redlining extended to other heavyweight dailies whose practices were also implicated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1527476411425254">Bland 2011</xref>). Instead, the story was advanced by the <italic>Guardian</italic> and then the <italic>Independent</italic>, two papers that are not owned by conglomerates and are the smallest of Britain’s national dailies; by the offshore <italic>New York Times</italic>, which perhaps not coincidentally has no ownership ties to the British newspapers implicated in the scandal; and to some extent by the public service broadcasters BBC and Channel Four. On one hand, these media organizations are on the margins of the “Fleet Street” inner circle, whose members have observed a longstanding truce about covering each other’s misdeeds. On the other hand, those organizations have the resources for investigative reporting—a role not easily undertaken by first person citizens’ journalism or the opinionated blogosphere.</p>
<p>These considerations bolster the arguments of media reform organizations in Canada, like the longstanding Friends of Canadian Broadcasting, or the more recent OpenMedia.ca. Like Free Press in the United States, or the Campaign for Press and Broadcasting Freedom in the United Kingdom, they have been pointing to the dangers of corporate domination of Canada’s media system, and the need for public service media and a strong public voice in communication policy making.</p>
<p>To a degree, Canadian media markets have been cushioned from the corrosive impact of transnational media conglomerates like Murdoch’s News Corporation, by policies that maintain domestic ownership of Canadian media. On one front, income tax legislation prohibits businesses from writing off advertising expenditures in non-Canadian-owned media that are intended for Canadian audiences—thereby curtailing foreign ownership of advertising-dependent newspapers. On another, both the Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunication Acts prohibit majority foreign ownership of broadcasting and telecommunication companies. These national protections are under threat, however, from several directions. From progressives who feel that the cultural nationalism underlying them reflects too narrow a vision of Canada. From neoliberals who oppose ownership restrictions in principle—a group whose power has been greatly enhanced by the recent election of a Conservative majority government that, in a previous minority position, had already approved takeovers that weaken Canadian ownership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1527476411425254">Mujar 2007</xref>). And from observers across the spectrum who feel that opening Canadian media to foreign ownership would enhance competition and diversity, and break down excessive media concentration (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1527476411425254">Geist 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Moreover, Canadian media markets are heavily concentrated. While patterns of ownership have been in constant flux over the past decade as companies jockey for advantage through building economies of scale and scope through media convergence, as of September 2010 five companies—Postmedia, Quebecor, Torstar, Power Corp., and Woodbridge Co. Ltd—controlled almost 85 percent of daily newspaper circulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1527476411425254">Newspapers Canada 2010</xref>). With thirteen daily newspapers, Postmedia Network Inc. controls more than 30 percent of daily circulation. Convergence strategies—with their promise of repurposing content from one medium to another and/or providing proprietary content for satellite, cable, and internet—have also yielded heavy cross-media ownership. For instance, Quebecor owns both the largest daily newspaper and the largest television broadcaster in the Montreal market, as well as majority ownership in the largest French-language TV network in North America, a cable network that covers 80 percent of the province of Quebec, and an internet service that covers 90 percent of that province. In Anglophone Canada, Bell Media owns both the country’s largest telephone system and its largest national television network. Bell is one of the country’s leading internet providers as well. By and large, six companies—Bell, Rogers, Shaw, Quebecor, Torstar, and Postmedia—control the lion’s share of Canadian cable, satellite, telephone, television, newspaper, and internet markets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1527476411425254">Gasher, Skinner, and Lorimer, forthcoming</xref>).</p>
<p>In our view, however, increased foreign investment or ownership of Canadian media is not a panacea for the problems often associated with concentration of ownership. On one hand, foreign corporations tend to cherry-pick, investing primarily in the most lucrative markets. On the other, they strive to exploit economies of scale through marketing media products and content designed for their home markets in the smaller “foreign” markets in which they invest, such as Canada. Consequently, while in the short term increasing foreign investment might result in lower prices and increased product choice in established Canadian media markets, in the long term such investment would inevitably exacerbate existing inequalities in service and increase the amount of foreign content found within Canadian media systems. Moreover, increased foreign ownership would undermine Canadian sovereignty over domestic media markets and further open the doors to the kinds of journalistic practices that companies like Murdoch’s have brought to different national jurisdictions.</p>
<p>But even with foreign ownership restrictions, Murdoch’s brand of partisan right-wing journalism has had influence in Canada. Since the 1970s, corporate and politically conservative forces have built a “right-wing information infrastructure” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1527476411425254">Taras 1999</xref>) or “echo chamber” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1527476411425254">Gutstein 2009</xref>), one that includes corporate-funded policy institutes, business leaders and trade associations, public relations firms, industry front groups masquerading as grassroots organizations, sympathetic academics, bloggers, journalists and indeed news organizations, such as the CanWest (formerly Hollinger) newspaper chain, especially its flagship daily <italic>The National Post</italic>. While the “information infrastructure” does not act in unison on every issue, generally speaking it has helped to shift public policy to the right in areas ranging from taxation to climate change. Its targets have included alleged left-wing bias in Canada’s public broadcaster, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC). With Conservative politicians and Quebecor’s Sun Media tabloid newspapers echoing that theme, and with a Conservative government holding the purse and making key appointments to its board, some pundits see the CBC as responding with a long-term move to the right, in terms of both programming and news sources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1527476411425254">Taber 2010</xref>; Salutin 2011).</p>
<p>More recently, under the leadership of Kory Teneycke, former Director of Communications for Conservative Prime Minister Stephen Harper, Quebecor announced plans to launch a Fox-style all news channel—Sun News Network. Seeking as large an audience reach as possible for the new station, Sun News lobbied the Canadian Radio Television and Telecommunications Commission—Canada’s broadcast regulator—for special carriage privileges. Led by the activist organization <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://Avaaz.org">Avaaz.org</ext-link>, using an online petition to “Stop Fox News North,” a high-profile public protest ensued (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1527476411425254">Silverman 2011</xref>). Opposition parliamentarians joined the protest and, amidst the twists and turns of the controversy, Teneycke resigned his position with the station (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1527476411425254">Galloway 2011</xref>). In the end, the channel was launched under less favorable carriage terms. But it soon attempted to shift the tenor of political news in Canada. On the eve of the 2011 national election, Sun News ran a story alleging that an opposition leader had once been found by police in a massage clinic that police suspected was a brothel; critics labeled the story a “smear campaign.”</p>
<p>On a more positive note, both the phone hacking scandal in the United Kingdom and the campaign against regulatory privileges for Sun News illustrate that in the face of the growth of such ideologically oriented media, “resistance is fertile.” In the British case, Murdoch’s bid to take over all of B-Sky-B satellite news, which a few months previously had seemed all but certain to be rubber stamped, was withdrawn in the wake of the unfolding scandal. In Canada, the arrogance with which Quebecor’s Sun News pursued its goal of privileged cable positioning, combined with the whiff of the improper use of political connections, helped to catalyze a successful campaign to halt it. These outcomes might be seen to yield several insights for media reformers. First, the phone hacking scandal provides them with fresh evidence for a case against both concentrated and foreign ownership, as well as industry self-regulation.</p>
<p>Second, the above controversies underscore the need to recognize and respond rapidly when political opportunities arise, in order to intervene in policy decisions and to publicly articulate broader media democracy principles. Those opportunities arise not from abstract critiques of media policy alone but from clear abuses of economic or political power that ordinary citizens can readily grasp, and that intersect with other values and concerns—such as the administration of justice, privacy, fairness, and respect for victims of crime and terrorism. Those opportunities are greatly enhanced when there is rivalry or dissension within media, economic, and political elites—Murdoch’s troubles were doubtless exacerbated by previously latent hostility towards him—and when public discontent is given voice within the Parliamentary arena.</p>
<p>In order to capitalize on such opportunities, however, what is primarily needed are networks of progressive activist individuals and groups both ready and able to organize that response. Consequently, working to ensure that such a progressive infrastructure is in place should be a key element of any project that strives to democratize a corporate-dominated media system.</p>
