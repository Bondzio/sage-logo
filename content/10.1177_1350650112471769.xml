<abstract>
<p>Copper–alumina composite materials with improved electrical conductivity and tribological properties were developed. The copper–alumina composite materials were prepared by powder metallurgy using nano-Cu/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> powder. The powders were deoxidized from CuO/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> powder synthesized by coprecipitation using NH<sub>4</sub>HCO<sub>3</sub> as precipitator and CuSO<sub>4</sub> + NH<sub>4</sub>Al(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub> as maternal solution. The wear test against 440C stainless steel was performed at room temperature using a ball-on-flat configuration with 300 µm amplitude at various normal loads ranging from 0.1 N to 1 N. The effects of load and mass fraction of Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> on the friction coefficient and wear loss were investigated. Results showed that the wear loss first decreased and then increased with an increase in the mass proportion of Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> from 1% to 5%. Minimum wear loss was found at 2% proportion, in which the electrical conductivity was 82% of the International Annealed Copper Standard. The friction coefficient of the copper increased slightly with an increase in load. By contrast, it first increased and then decreased for the copper–alumina composite materials. The wear loss of the copper–alumina composite materials is always lower than that of copper. The highest relative wearability is 3.13, indicating better wear resistance. The wear mechanism of copper is oxidation wear, whereas that for the copper–alumina composite materials is adhesive wear.</p>

<p>Copper–matrix composites are widely applied in electrical sliding contacts, such as those in lead frame, spot welding electrode, connector, transfer switch, and other electronic devices because of their unique combination of high strength and conductivity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1350650112471769">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1350650112471769"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1350650112471769"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1350650112471769">4</xref></sup> Recently, ultrafine ceramic particulates are increasingly selected as the strengthening phase because they can attain better properties compared with those obtained using pure copper and precipitation, or solid solution-hardened copper. In particular, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> ceramic particulates have drawn much attention attributed to their cheaper price, oxidation resistance, superior mechanical properties, and the barely degraded electrical conductivity of the metal matrix.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1350650112471769">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1350650112471769"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1350650112471769">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>The most extensively used methods for the production of Cu-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> composite materials (CACMs) are based on casting,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1350650112471769">8</xref></sup> mechanical alloying<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1350650112471769">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1350650112471769">10</xref></sup> and other techniques.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1350650112471769">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1350650112471769">12</xref></sup> However, conventional casting techniques are not practical because of the poor uniformity of dispersed particles. Therefore, CACMs are increasingly produced by powder metallurgy (P/M) method. The composite powder used as the raw material for P/M processing is prepared through high-energy ball milling,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1350650112471769">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1350650112471769">13</xref></sup> internal oxidation,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1350650112471769">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1350650112471769">15</xref></sup> and chemical process.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1350650112471769">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1350650112471769">17</xref></sup> These traditional techniques for the synthesis of such composite powders still have several limitations, such as manufacturing costs, grain size, and the homogeneity of the final product. Studies on the fabrication of nanostructured CACMs have recently drawn scientific interest<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1350650112471769">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1350650112471769">19</xref></sup> because the nanostructured materials are expected to possess several unique physical and mechanical properties. Ultrafine Cu-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> composite powder (20 nm) made via thermochemical process can be produced with a more homogeneous microstructure, electrical conductivity, and hardness in the hot-extruded bulk.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1350650112471769">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1350650112471769">17</xref></sup> However, the method still has many drawbacks which should be resolved, such as a complex operation in which the quality of the products is hard to control.</p>
<p>In our previous study, nano-CuO/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> composite powder was synthesized using coprecipitation method, in which the content of well-distributed ultrafine CuO/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> particles can be precisely controlled.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1350650112471769">20</xref></sup> CACMs were also fabricated in the present work from nano-Cu/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> powder chemically prepared via hydrogen reduction followed by shaping and sintering.</p>
<p>A number of studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1350650112471769">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1350650112471769"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1350650112471769"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1350650112471769">24</xref></sup> on the preparation, corrosion, and the sliding wear behavior of CACMs had been undertaken. However, studies on fretting wear have been less reported, especially operations under a weak load. Electrical contacting fretting, which has a normal load of approximately 0.1 N, may cause a rapid increase in the contacting resistance, and thus result in a decrease in the contact reliability and distortion of electrical signal.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1350650112471769">25</xref></sup> The aim of this study is to investigate the fretting wear behavior of the nano-CACMs obtained using the proposed methodology.</p>

<p>The synthesis of the Cu/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> composite powder was performed as follows:

<list-item><p>The composite precursor was prepared by coprecipitation.

<list-item><p>The composite precursor was dehydrated and dried at 80 °C for 24 h after rinsing by distilled water and ethanol, and then calcined at 500 °C. The composite powder of nano-CuO/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> was obtained.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The composite powder of nano-Cu/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> was finally fabricated from the chemically prepared nano-CuO/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> mixture by hydrogen reduction at 480 °C. The primal particle is approximately 60 nm in diameter.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>To obtain nanosized and uniform composite powder, adequate processing techniques and a strict control of the experimental conditions are required. For a good review on this topic, see Zhou et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1350650112471769">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>The CACM bulk was prepared by hot pressing sintering technique in a vacuum sintering furnace. The nano-Cu/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> composite powder was first thermally compressed into a briquette of Φ30 mm × 6 mm under a pressure of 27.5 MPa. Then, the briquette was sintered at 920 °C for 2 h. To determine synchronously the best mechanical and electronic properties, a series of samples were designed with various mass proportions of Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> powder selected as 0% (copper), 1%, 2%, 3%, 4%, and 5% for the contrastive experiment. The technological process of preparing the CACM bulk is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1350650112471769">Figure 1</xref>.

<sec id="sec4-1350650112471769"><title>Fretting wear test</title>
<p>Ball-on-flat fretting wear tests were performed on the tribometer (UMT-2MT, CETR, USA). Commercially available 440C stainless steel ball of 4 mm in diameter with hardness of 61 HRC was used as the mating ball. It was clamped at the top grip and kept motionless. The CACM sample was screwed on the lower table and moved reciprocally. Being endured high frequency and low load according with the applied background, the frequency was appointed as 20 Hz; and the amplitude was designed as 300 µm. The experiments were conducted at room temperature for 0.5 h under 4 different loads, i.e. 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, and 1 N.</p>
<p>Prior to each wear test, all the specimens were abraded by 800 - to 1500-grit SiC paper step-by-step. The steel ball and specimen were all ultrasonically cleaned in acetone for 10 min and then air-dried for each test.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1350650112471769"><title>Examination and measurement</title>
<p>The microhardness of the CACMs was measured 5 times at 0.98 N for 10 s using a digital microhardness meter (HXD-1000TMC, China). The microhardness value listed in this study was the average. The electrical conductivity was measured by an eddy-current device (7501 type, China).</p>
<p>The friction coefficient was directly obtained from the software of the tribometer. The morphology and composition of the wear scars, material transfer, and wear debris were observed and analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Hitachi 3000N, Japan) equipped with an energy dispersive spectroscope (EDS, EDAX-250, USA). The wear tracks for surface characteristics, such as surface topography, profile curves, and wear volume loss, were further determined using a noncontact optical profilometer (Micro XAM, ADE, USA).</p>

<p>It is well known that, as an electronic material, the value of electrical conductivity should be larger than 80 IACS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1350650112471769">3</xref></sup> Although the electrical conductivity of the CACMs decreases with increasing Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> proportion, the CACMs with 2% Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> exhibit 85 IACS electrical conductivity.

</sec>
<sec id="sec8-1350650112471769"><title>Effect of Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> proportion on friction coefficient and wear loss</title>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1350650112471769">Figure 2</xref> shows the friction coefficient curves of the CACMs with various Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> proportions after fretting at a load of 0.1 N within 0.5 h. All the coefficients stabilized after a short running-in period. The mean friction coefficients, namely, the average of the coefficients during the stable period, illustrate that the friction coefficient of copper has the lowest value of 0.419. The friction coefficient increases with increasing Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> proportion, and its maximum value of 0.538 is obtained at 4%. Then, it decreases to 0.483 at 5%. This result indicates that Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> addition results in the exposure of many asperities to the surface during the fretting wear process. The friction force increases with increasing Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> proportion. The higher the Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> content, the larger the friction coefficient will be. On the other hand, the spherical Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> particles probably flake off and act as bearing balls in the case of higher Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> proportion because of the weak bond caused by the poor wettability between ceramic and metal.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1350650112471769">26</xref></sup> Thus, a decrease in the friction coefficient occurs.

This result proves that the lowest wear-loss point is at 2%, i.e. the composite reinforced with 2% Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> possesses the best wear resistance. This finding is also proven using relative wearability, which presents a tendency of initial increase and subsequent decrease, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1350650112471769">Figure 3</xref> (solid line). The relative wearability reaches a maximum of 3.13 at the peak of 2% Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.

</fig></p>
<p>With increasing Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> proportion, the wearability of the CACMs improves, and the friction coefficient increases. According to the <italic>Orwan Theory</italic>,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1350650112471769">27</xref></sup> the hardness and strength of the composite would be improved with an increase in the proportion of the second phase. The nano-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> particle dispersed in the matrix can remarkably increase the moving resistance of the dislocation and sub-grain boundary. The strengthening effect is not significant with little Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> proportion in the CACMs because the dislocation can easily pass by the second phase. Thus, as the proportion of Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> phase increases, the remarkable pinning effect of dislocation is strengthened, resulting in higher hardness. Consequently, the wearability is improved. Furthermore, the wearability is not proportional to Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> proportion. It decreases when the mass proportion of Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> changes from 2% to 5%. The apparent density of nano-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> particle is lower, so the mass proportion of 5% is equivalent to the volume proportion of 10%. As previously reported, the wettability between metal and ceramic worsens, as well as reuniting the nanoparticle is easier, as the proportion of Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> increases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1350650112471769">26</xref></sup> Thus, the binding force and the strength of the CACMs consequently decreases, especially in terms of wear resistance. The values decline to 0.71 at 5% Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> in our present work, even worse than that of copper.</p>
<p>The wear scars of the CACMs present regular pits, similar to the three-dimensional morphology shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1350650112471769">Figure 4(a)</xref>. The profiles of the different CACMs across their centers are illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1350650112471769">Figure 4(b)</xref>. The approximately U-shaped profiles become wider and deeper as the Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> proportion increases. The CACMs with 2% Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> displays the minimum cross-section, implying the best wearability. The data agrees well with the experimental results discussed above.

</sec>
<sec id="sec9-1350650112471769"><title>Effect of load on coefficient and wear loss</title>
<p>The CACMs with optimum proportion of 2% Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> were selected to evaluate the wear properties at various loads. Control experiment on copper was also conducted in this study. The friction coefficient and wear loss as a function of the normal load are demonstrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1350650112471769">Figure 5</xref>. The friction coefficient slightly fluctuates with an increase in the load, whereas the wear loss rapidly increases. The friction coefficient of the CACMs is larger than that of copper. However, the wear loss of the CACMs is always lower than that of copper at any load. The wear resistance of the CACMs reinforced with 2% Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> is obviously improved.
<fig id="fig5-1350650112471769" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p>Friction coefficient and wear volume-loss at various loads.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1350650112471769-fig5.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p>The hardness of the CACMs is larger than that of copper. Therefore, copper is easier to be worn even at a very weak load. The asperities would also be inevitably worn to pit with an increase in the load. The friction coefficient of the CACMs would become larger than that of copper because the coarse surface and the exposed Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> protrusions can prevent the wear process. When the normal load increases further, the Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> particles would probably flake off and be reserved in the contact zone between the tribo-matches together with the debris. These Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> particles function as bearing balls, thus reducing the friction coefficient once again.</p>

However, the wear surface becomes smoother and exhibits slightly abrasive wear in the wear scar of the CACMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1350650112471769">Figure 6(b)</xref>). The wear mechanism can be further investigated by EDS analysis. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1350650112471769">Figure 7</xref> presents the EDS spectrum of the wear scars in copper and the CACMs with 2% Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> after fretting wear. The two spectra present obvious distinctness, e.g. Fe cannot be found in copper, but Cu and O can be seen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1350650112471769">Figure 7(a)</xref>). Fe, Cr, and O are rich in the wear scars of the CACMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1350650112471769">Figure 7(b)</xref>). The debris can easily flake off from the surface of the sample because of the low hardness even under a weak load. Furthermore, the debris cannot be expelled from the pits and have to be milled quickly and endlessly for oxidation into the fine debris. The proportion of O element in the wear scar is obviously increased after fretting, which implies that Cu has been oxidized. The flash temperature on the contact surface is often sufficiently high to reach the oxidation temperature. For the CACMs, the debris is difficult to flake off from the surface of the sample because of the reinforcement effect of the nano-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, instead of abrading the mating ball. This result may be the reason why we can detect Fe in the scar. Fe must come from the counterpart, i.e. the transfer of material from the mating ball to the CACMs. Therefore, the wear mechanism of CACMs with 2% Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> is abrasive wear.

<p>The following major conclusions can be drawn:
<list id="list2-1350650112471769" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>The wear loss of CACMs first decreases and then increases with an increase in the Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> proportion from 1% to 5%, and a minimum value is obtained at 2% proportion. The maximum relative wearability of the CACMs is 3.13 times as much as that of copper.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The optimum proportion of nano-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> in the CACMs is 2%, which is suitable for electronic materials.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The friction coefficient of the CACMs slightly fluctuates with the increasing load and is larger than that of the copper. However, the wear loss of the composite increases rapidly and is always lower than that of copper at any load. The wear resistance of the CACMs reinforced with 2% Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> is obviously improved.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The wear mechanism of copper is oxidation wear, whereas that of the CACMs is abrasive wear.</p></list-item>
