<p>Suzanne Gordon’s book is a collage of stories by and about nurses. About seventy RNs, mostly from the United States but also other countries around the world, contributed short stories on a variety of topics relevant to health care professionals. The stories are organized by theme, most of which will be familiar to nurses, for example, “Excuse Me, Doctor, You’re Wrong.” Each chapter has a short introduction by Gordon.</p>
<p>For the most part, the stories reflect the challenges and frustrations of the nursing profession: standing up for patients in an increasingly profit-driven health care industry, working in a primarily female profession (about 90 percent of the stories are by women), struggling to overcome stereotypes, or outwitting male doctors and administrators.</p>
<p>In one story, called “Saving Patients from Dr. Death,” Toni Hoffman, an RN from South Queensland, Australia, tells her story about confronting hospital management about the dangerous practices of a newly hired surgeon, Dr. Patel. Even though eighty-seven of Dr. Patel’s patients died, hospital administration refused to believe that he was doing anything wrong. Instead they punished Ms. Hoffman, branding her as a racist and claiming she “had trouble with conflict resolution skills.” Ultimately, a friendly journalist helped Ms. Hoffman to expose Dr. Patel’s history, which included discipline for falsifying records, surrendering his license under pressure, and “being the most sued surgeon in Portland, Oregon.” Once he was exposed, Dr. Patel fled. At the time that story was written, he was awaiting trial. He was subsequently convicted on three counts of manslaughter. In March 2012, Ms. Hoffman received a financial settlement from the hospital that had attempted to silence her.</p>
<p>The stories appear to have been chosen because they all show the value and importance of nurses as health care professionals and as human beings. They vary widely in content and tone, ranging from a straightforward recounting of events to quite personal and very moving stories of sorrow and courage. If there is a common theme, it is one of hope, courage, and inspiration.</p>
<p>One of the nine chapters, called “Sticking Together,” focuses on the struggles to organize RNs and the benefits to nurses (and patients) that can be obtained through collective bargaining. Although the other chapters tend to be more personal and less about collective struggle, even in those stories the value of organized labor is clear. A courageous nurse who speaks up for her patients is protected by her union. The union of a nurse who is attacked on the job stands up for her, even though her hospital doesn’t, and ultimately the union helps to change the law to provide greater protection for nurses.</p>
<p>Suzanne Gordon has written several books about nursing, and there is perhaps nothing in <italic>Chicken Soup</italic> that is new or startling; nevertheless, it may be useful and worthwhile for some readers. This is not the kind of book that most people will want to sit down and read from start to finish. <italic>Chicken Soup</italic> doesn’t have a “plot.” There is no cohesive story or clear theme to carry you through from front to back. It’s meant more for browsing, reading a story here and there over a period of time.</p>
<p><italic>Chicken Soup</italic> may be especially useful to labor educators (and others) looking for short, real-life examples to illustrate a point about the challenges and the successes of nurses, health care workers, or women workers in general.</p>
