<p>Zygmunt Bauman is a phenomenon. The author of over fifty books, many of them highly influential on both sides of the Atlantic, the originality of Bauman’s enterprise lies in its combination of aims: the (re)connection of personal lives with global worlds, of social inequalities with consumer-orientated modernity. The ambition of the enterprise is, significantly and breathtakingly, matched by the imaginative reach and poetic grandeur of the execution.</p>
<p>Bauman’s sociology of modernity has received extraordinary attention in the social sciences. In writings that span over five decades, he has developed a theoretical perspective on the condition and future of world society with which everyone working in the social sciences must now reckon. Most recently, and as a result of his coinage of the term “liquid modernity,” Bauman has come to rank as one of the world’s most influential social theorists and politically-engaged public intellectuals.</p>
<p>In <italic>Collateral Damage</italic>, Bauman turns his attention to growing social inequality in the era of liquid modernity. Extending the term “collateral damage” beyond the world of military interventions, he argues that the poor and unemployed are collateral casualties of liquid, consumer-orientated societies. “Casualties are dubbed ‘collateral’ in so far as they are dismissed as not important enough to justify the costs of their prevention” (p. 8).</p>
<p><italic>Collateral Damage</italic> is replete with references to our “liquid modern times.” Deploying the metaphor of “liquid” to capture the present-day tensions of modernity, Bauman analyzes contemporary social inequalities as the upshot of globalized drift, fluidity, and liquidization at the level of social institutions. This liquefaction springs from, among other social forces, the technological explosion of new information systems; the rise of multinationals and transnational conglomerates; the outsourcing of manufacturing and services from the West to the “developing world”; and the large-scale shift in investment from industrial manufacture to the communications, finance, and service sectors. These developments, according to Bauman, have produced a new “weightlessness of capital” and concomitant “liquidization of life”—in business cycles, employment patterns, family relationships, communal fates, and political horizons.</p>
<p>Like many, I am sympathetic to Bauman’s sociological critique of the age of liquefaction. The theory of liquid modernity is, in my view, one of the most significant theoretical statements to have emerged in the social sciences since Habermas’ sociology of communicative action. That said, I will briefly outline two queries or problems that are likely to occur to sympathetic critics of Bauman’s current work. These include asking, how liquid is the global age? And secondly, what are the possibilities for identity beyond liquidization?</p>
<sec id="section1-0094306112457657">
<title>1. How Liquid is the Global Age?</title>
<p>One criticism sometimes levelled against Bauman’s sociology concerns the adequacy of his sociological diagnosis of liquid modern times. The problem with trying to characterize the contemporary age solely in terms of liquidization, allegedly, is that it comes very close at times to high cliché. Drift, accelerated time, giddying technology, fragmentation and fracture: these are the drearily familiar motifs of world society in much recent social theory.</p>
<p>Within Bauman’s writing, however, there is no such limitation. The complex rhythms of Bauman’s sociological prose—combining a poetic hermeneutics with impassioned introspections that are acutely sensitive to key political issues of the contemporary era—scoop up and absorb various currents of contemporary social thought, providing in turn a kind of <italic>unstructured systematic analysis</italic> of modernity that might otherwise remain elusive or diffuse. Bauman’s sociology itself is concrete—directed at the social and spatial stratifications of power, poverty, persecution, and the public sphere—yet rich in theoretical scope. We are dealing, in short, with a sociologist of extraordinary intellectual power.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding this, sympathetic readers still might wonder whether the notion of a liquidization of lives, loves, bonds, and inequalities adequately captures worldwide social change today? Is growing social inequality really defined <italic>in toto</italic> by liquid modern impulses? Within the terms of Bauman’s sociological hermeneutics—specifically, his aim to unravel, describe, and evaluate what people actually experience in social life—my inclination is to answer these questions with a qualified “Yes.” The qualification to note is that Bauman points out, repeatedly, that today’s liquid modern anxieties and risks of living together, and apart, take the individualizing form they do predominantly in the expensive, polished cities of the West. This does not mean, as some critics have suggested, that Bauman is inattentive to hard social differences of contemporary geopolitical space. He has insisted at various points in his writings, rightly in my view, that various Others—those excluded, marginalized, struggling, or starving across the planet—remain locked out from the new political economy of liquid modernity. For example, the animating impulse of <italic>Collateral Damage</italic> is its dissection of how marginalized individuals, such as unemployed youths and the progressively criminalized poor, are recast as “aliens inside” consumer-orientated, capitalist societies.</p>
<p>Even so, by focusing attention so squarely on the liquidization of self, social relations, and everyday life in the global age, surely Bauman tends to neglect the ongoing significance of more structured, solid forms of sociality? Certainly Bauman’s many examples of increasing social liquidization are drawn from daily experiences familiar to inhabitants of, say, North America or Europe—that is, of life lived in the high divorce and remarriage society, of relationships forged in the time of Facebook, and of intimacy lived in the era of self-help. But notwithstanding the many and varied ways in which our personal and social worlds have been transfigured by the global forces of liquefaction, is it not the case that traditional belief systems are still an integral part of the present age? If the power of tradition has been swept away by the global forces of liquid modernity—with its proliferation of media simulations, celebration of the market, and debunking of the long-term—then why do customs and traditions (such as religious practices) remain a pervasive feature of the twenty-first century? Why, for example, do we find the logics of liquid modernity more at work in some sectors of the economy (say, finance and the communications sectors) than in others? In a nutshell, the query is: might the spread of liquidization be exaggerated in this account of social change?</p>
<p>Whatever the force of these queries, it would be quite misleading to suggest that Bauman himself overlooks or downgrades the inviolable character of tradition as well as the reconstruction of tradition in liquid modernity. For, arguably, the thesis of increasing societal liquidization only makes sense in a rigorously sociological way if it is interpreted against the backdrop of social forces in which traditional elements remain, and of a diversity of trends constantly expanding, changing, and transforming such traditional features of social life. That said, there is no reason why a more comprehensive approach to social theory should not diligently attend to transformations of traditional authority and the traditional grounding of action while still incorporating an account of intensified societal liquidity, the parameters of which have been laid out by Bauman.</p>

<title>2. Identity Beyond Liquid Modernity?</title>
<p>In <italic>Collateral Damage</italic> Bauman pays close attention to the degraded positions of social identity on the inequality ladder. The richest 5 percent of people on the planet today, he notes, receive one-third of total global income—as much as the poorest 80 percent. His focus is on how those afflicted by such a chronic deficit of life chances and the resulting discrimination cope at the margins of liquid modernity. Considering the costs and implications of social inequality from Hurricane Katrina to the operations of the International Monetary Fund, Bauman sees rising casualties of identity as one of the most cataclysmic problems of our time. He writes: “The likelihood of becoming a ‘collateral victim’ of any human undertaking, however noble its declared purpose, and of any ‘natural’ catastrophe, however class-blind, is currently one of the most salient and striking dimensions of social inequality—and this speaks volumes about the already low yet still falling status of social inequality inside the contemporary political agenda” (p. 7).</p>
<p>While centered on the theme of social inequality, the analysis of identity offered by Bauman will be familiar to followers of his sociology. The liquidization of contemporary institutional processes (the continuous fluidity of information, signs, money and people in the global age) reshape and transform the manifold ways that individuals experience and define their identities. Life in a liquid modern world, as Bauman provocatively suggests, means that individuals must work at the never-ending task of shaping fluids, as well as the continuous work of reshaping liquids, in order to ensure an identity fit for purpose in a profit-driven, consumer-orientated society. Failure to do so can only lead to a “collateral casualty” fate.</p>
<p>Yet in conceptualizing liquid lives (and their associated individualization of remedies) as the dominant mode of identity constitution in the current era, Bauman tends to neglect other modes of self-constitution. Liquidized forms of experience and identity, with their emphasis on short-termism and relentless self-transformation, are undoubtedly characteristic of large areas of contemporary cultural life—particularly in terms of flashy media culture, online mediated interaction, and the emergence of jet-setting, transnational lifestyles. Yet there are other kinds of identity that come to the fore in conditions of advanced globalization. Contemporary social life permits the development of various critical, cosmopolitan identities, many of which contain possibilities for transcending the rigid determinations of identity (class, gender, race) associated with multinational capitalism.</p>
<p>The constitution of identity today, however, is arguably still more complex, and certainly cannot be reduced to an either/or logic, contrasting for example the narcissistic identities of liquid modernity on the one hand with the cultivation of more critical, cosmopolitan forms of subjectivity on the other. For the analysis of identity, even accepting the main parameters of Bauman’s account of key institutional transformations associated with liquid modernity, demands a more critical approach. Such an approach, working from the inside out, needs to be attentive to the contours of private life—to the psyche, emotions, memories, and desire. The flipside of this, working from the outside in, requires attention to institutional changes associated with globalization, neo-liberalism, processes of social exclusion and the like. While Bauman’s analysis is finely honed on the latter of these concerns, the adequacy of his conceptualization of the former is open to question.</p>
<p>Let us consider these points in a little more detail. Recent research in the social sciences highlights the extraordinary diversity of modes of identity-constitution in the global age (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0094306112457657">Elliott 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0094306112457657">Elliott and du Gay 2009</xref>). How might such complex forms of identity-constitution in the current age be best approached? Is there a way in which personal, affective, social, and cultural differences might be better apprehended from within the theory of liquid modernity? Bauman’s account provides a subtle appreciation of the ambivalence of modernity as it operates through identities, and yet the responses of subjects and especially alternative and non-conformist subjectivities are sometimes downplayed or disowned in this sociological approach. For example, is “liquid life” only a means of adjusting narcissistic individuals to the dictates of late capitalism? Is this liquidization of identity always a defensive closure at the level of private life, against the range of possibilities and perils inaugurated by globalization? What of identities resistant to the short-term temper of liquid modernity, of those individuals who reject cultural pressures towards change and flexibility? Due to the generality and sweep of the theory of liquid modernity, what threatens to recede into the shadows is the point that all of us have multiple identities, some overlapping, some contradictory, and that at any moment these identities are interacting with (incorporating, resisting and transforming) broader social values and cultural differences, shaping and being reshaped by modernity. Following from this point, we might also ponder the location of the sociological critic, and of those readers who adopt a similarly critical stance, toward the episodic nature of liquid life. Given the sharply critical dimension of Bauman’s analysis, and given the wide influence of the theory of liquid modernity within and beyond the discipline of sociology, why have individuals not decried the corrosive character of liquefaction in a more systematic and widespread way?</p>
<p>Whatever the merits of these analytical concerns, <italic>Collateral Damage</italic> represents a formidable achievement. In his exquisitely heterodox and imaginatively capacious sociology, Bauman’s influence on the direction of the social sciences remains significant.</p>
