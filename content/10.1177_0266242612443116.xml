<p><bold><italic>Reviews in Small Business Management &amp; Entrepreneurship: in celebration of 30 years of the International Small Business Journal (ISBJ)</italic></bold></p>
<p>Guest Editors: Erno T. Tornikoski Robert A. Blackburn Susan Marlow</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>As part of the celebrations of 30 years of publishing, the ISBJ invites scholars to submit high quality, state-of-the-art reviews that critically examine the relevant academic literature related to small businesses and entrepreneurship.</p>
<p>Given the broad scope of the small business and entrepreneurship fields, topics for submission are not prescribed for this Special Issue. As such, a review paper can focus on a particular theory, concept, methodology, or policy that has relevance to the field of small business and entrepreneurship. These may derive from within the field itself or indeed demonstrate linkages with other disciplinary areas highlighting the permeability and dynamism of the field. Interesting reviews for this Special Issue will share, however, the following common objectives: present the state of the art, contribute to theory development, and outline implications for practice. In other words, a manuscript submitted to this Special Issue needs to (i) identify relations, contradictions, gaps, or inconsistencies, in a body of knowledge, and (ii) suggest the most promising lines of inquiry for addressing those gaps in future scholarly work. When such gaps are identified, an important aspect of the review paper is also to (iii) reflect upon what kind of effects such gaps might have for practice, and how future scholarly efforts could help improve such practices.</p>
<p>When submitting review papers to the 30<sup>th</sup> Anniversary Special Issue, the Guest Editors emphasise the methodological rigor of manuscripts. A convincing review paper pays attention to the following:</p>
<list id="list1-0266242612443116" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Organising around a specific, interesting, and contemporary subject area related to small business and entrepreneurship;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Detailing the timeframe within which the academic literature was selected, the methods used to access, select, evaluate and synthesise the findings of the literature/studies in question;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Exercising critical thought and judgment and therefore, going beyond simply reviewing and/or describing the existing academic literature (e.g. identifies areas of controversy) + Identifying an agenda for future research based on the critical analysis.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Manuscripts that do not follow well-defined and justified literature search strategies, will be automatically rejected from further consideration. It must also be borne in mind that the ISBJ is 30 years old and scholars are encouraged to take a long view of specific subject areas when developing submissions.</p>
<p>Timescale and anticipated date for publication.</p>
<list id="list2-0266242612443116" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Abstracts to be submitted by email to Special Issue Editors: by 31st December 2012.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Decisions on abstracts notified to authors: by end of January 2013.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Deadline for submission of full papers to ISBJ via Sage Track for refereeing: by 30th May 2013.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Publication is planned for late 2014 – early 2015.</p></list-item>
