<p>The stated intents of this edited work are to offer a critical perspective on occupational science and to stimulate critical reflection of what occupational science might become and the influence it might have. This is a significant and scholarly departure from disciplinary rhetoric celebrating visions and visionaries. Almost a quarter century since occupational science was first envisioned, this important book examines the assumptions that originally informed—and currently limit—the development of occupational science and that restrict its potential contribution to occupational justice. </p>
<p>Drawing from diverse theoretical perspectives and a wide range of scholarly resources, the contributors challenge, for example, habitual dualistic assumptions about people and environments. Critical reflections are followed throughout this book by thoughtful suggestions for future work, outlining, in this instance, the merits of a transactional perspective for understanding the contextual nature of occupation. Various contributors contend that current understandings of occupation are informed by Western, Anglophone, middle-class perspectives that have little relevance in cultures underpinned by different values. Hocking’s reflection on ontological assumptions is noteworthy, highlighting the female gender bias pervading the occupational science research literature, the preoccupation with studying individuals (even when engaged in collective occupations), the fact that the existing literature base reflects the reality of a tiny proportion of the global population, and the implications of all this for the science of occupation. Several chapters draw from critical social theory to foreground, for example, the failure of occupational science to engage with macrolevel issues, such as power, politics, and economics; others address research methodologies and knowledge paradigms. Complex theories and ideas are presented clearly throughout and with ample references to encourage further reading. The book not only offers critiques but also ideas and examples of how occupational science might be done differently.</p>
<p>The cover blurb asserts that this is “the must-have resource for occupational therapists, occupational scientists, students and researchers,” and the book does not disappoint. My only complaint is that the book is slim and thus leaves many occupational science assumptions unchallenged.</p>
