<p>At the opening of an exhibition entitled ‘Famine’ by the Irish artist Pádraic Reaney in Galway 2010, historian Gearóid Ó Tuathaigh remarked on the presence not only of individual figures framed in Reaney’s Connemara landscapes, but of family groupings in many of the paintings and sculptures that formed the exhibition on ‘The Great Famine’ of 19th-century Ireland.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-204382061200200103">1</xref> </sup>In a recent documentary, fellow historian Joseph Lee also noted the impact of the famine on family life. In particular, Lee stressed that social historians have not even begun to really consider or examine the psychic trauma and impact that the famine had on individuals at the time (who rationed food in the family household?) and its legacy with regard to the shaping of Irish society and the diaspora today.<sup>

</p>
<p>In the Irish language, the famine period of the 1840s is referred to as An Gorta Mór, which is translated as ‘The Great Famine’ or ‘The Great Hunger’. The adjective ‘mór’ here translates, and is more culturally resonant with, the concept of the ‘abysmal’, ‘desperate’ or ‘terrible’, rather than ‘great’ (as with the Burkean concept of the terror of the sublime). ‘Gorta’ in Irish means famine, but the term is also closely related to the word ‘gort’, a piece of land, garden, park or, more commonly, a field. Another cognate term also comes to mind – ‘gortaithe’, from the verb ‘gortaigh’, which translates as ‘to hurt’, ‘to injure’ or ‘to inflict pain’. Indeed, all of these concepts from the Irish are melded into the expression ‘féar gortach’ (hungry grass), which was the widespread belief that if one stepped on a field of grass associated with the famine one would become immediately stricken by hunger. The individual would die if the hunger was not satiated, and so the concept implies a logic of communal contagion and transmission, and of certain places being inextricably bound to the past and local memory.</p>
<p>The title of David Nally’s book, <italic>Human Encumbrances: Political Violence and the Great Irish Famine</italic>, succinctly captures this double articulation of the Great Irish Famine/Great Hunger, both in terms of the political violence that occurred to the inhabitants of the land and to the land itself. As defined by the <italic>Oxford English Dictionary</italic>, an encumbrance is ‘a burden or impediment’, ‘a mortgage or other claim on property or assets’, or, in a rare usage, ‘a dependant or child’. The dependency of the majority of the population of Ireland on a single crop and the concept of that population as being a burden (both to the land, and to the body politic) illustrate two key ways in which the land and people were regarded during this time. As he outlines in the introductory chapter, the history of famine and the role of British colonial administration in its management have been controversial both in terms of the writing of history and the critical interrogations of Irish historiography. From Edmund Spenser to Victorian travel literature, the commentary on famine in Ireland has a long and contested genealogy. In Irish Studies’ scholarship, interpretations of the famine have emerged primarily from the disciplines of history and economics, and in more recent times folklore scholars have been examining oral and folklore archives for non-elite narratives of the famine experience. Since the 150th anniversary and commemoration of the famine in 1995 many local history societies and community groups have taken ownership over their community’s historical experience, with the local narratives adding to, or at times contradicting, the dominant national narrative.<sup>

</p>
<p>The contribution that this book makes to a wide constituency of Irish Studies’ scholarship is that it manoeuvres the focus away from the Scylla and Charybdis of nationalist and revisionist debates, and places the narrative of the Irish famine squarely in the geographical frame of political ecology and colonial biopolitics. One can hear the echo of Naomi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-204382061200200103">Klein’s (2007)</xref> work on the overt opportunism of modern-day disaster capitalism as Nally states that ‘[d]isasters do not happen; they are designed’ (p. ix). The book then is also a critique of reason, more properly a critique of Enlightenment instrumental reason as housed within the language of political economy. Nally’s concern with spatializing the famine, and in particular his focused discussion on the Poor Law Unions, foregrounds the idea that geography matters and that control over space necessarily entails control over bodies that occupy and inhabit such spaces. For this reviewer, workhouses could be seen as the sites of memory par excellence, as sites that articulated the physical architecture of hunger in this period, and interestingly many would later become transformed into, or associated with, county psychiatric institutions in the following century.</p>
<p>Nally outlines synergies between violence and mass starvation and writes that ‘the multifaceted and compound nature of political violence often renders its operations opaque’ (p. ix). It would be difficult to map such violence, and that is why recent mappings of population change during the Famine can be inherently problematic. The concern overall, however, is not just a historical re-examination of facts and figures (how many people died and/or emigrated, how many births were ‘averted’), but rather the focus is on the impact of a particular form of political economy on the body politic. As Peter Gray has noted, the concern here was not how to refine political theory, but how to translate it into government policy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-204382061200200103">Gray, 1995</xref>). <italic>Human Encumbrances </italic>clearly outlines the serious problems (moral, political, ideological) that the Irish famine posed for a distinctly English discourse of political economy. The opposite, as Nally highlights, also holds true. Not only did political economy change and shape the course of the famine in Ireland, but the famine in Ireland in turn changed and shaped the course that political economy would take after the 1850s, when a more overtly moral critique would come into play.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-204382061200200103">4</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>One area that the book touches on, but does not have time to go into detail about, is the Irish nationalist response to an alternative form of political economy, one more suited to the Irish context. Thomas A. Boylan and Timothy P. Foley discuss the debate that raged particularly from 1840s onwards on a need for a kind of ‘new historicism’, a historically sensitive and contextualized form of political economy that would best suit Irish conditions, society and culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-204382061200200103">Boylan and Foley, 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-204382061200200103">1997</xref>). Far from being universal, the laws of political economy were based on ‘English experience and ideas’, to quote the economist John Elliot Cairnes writing in 1865. A new version of political economy for Ireland that challenged the ingrained strategies of moral avoidance would later be espoused by Cairnes, Cliffe Leslie and John Kells Ingram, and two other lesser-known critics of orthodoxy, Fintan Lalor and William Dillon. As John Stuart Mill wrote in 1865, ‘I am sure that no one is at all capable of determining what is the right political economy for any country until he knows the circumstances’.</p>
<p>One key contribution that Nally makes in the discourse surrounding contemporary responses to the Famine is his extended discussion of contemporary reports by primarily English travel writers and observers of the time. While there have been edited book collections on travel writing as a genre (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-204382061200200103">Hooper, 2005</xref>), or more extended books on English writing on Ireland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-204382061200200103">Hadfield and McVeagh, 1994</xref>), there has not yet to date been an extended examination and critique of this kind of writing on Ireland during the famine period. Nally’s chapter therefore makes a significant contribution to our understanding both of this genre of writing but also, more importantly, the kinds of responses and contestations of state power that were being elicited from Victorian travellers during the famine. Writings from Henry Inglis, Walter Scott, Thackeray and William Bennet bring to life the living conditions of the poorest of the poor in this period, as do the writings of women travellers (a very welcome inclusion) such as Asenath Nicholson, Anne Plumptre and Charlotte Tonna.</p>
<p>One area, however, that could have been discussed to some degree is the question of language and representation. It is still the norm for many scholars writing on historical travel literature in Ireland to represent the encounters or ‘dialogues’ they have with the native Irish population unproblematically in the English language. However, following the work of translation scholars and in particular the work of Mary Louise Pratt, the ‘zones of contact’ between the traveller and the native inhabitant were fraught with the twin poles of fear and desire. In addition to this, the ‘creative’ retellings (and misunderstandings) of encounters that happened in another language and written up from notes and memory in the safe distance of the study, also opens up questions of representation and ‘authenticity’. The apparent transparency of the dialogue that ensues only further serves to domesticate the Irish population through its anglicization, and such moves towards Victorian paternalism further remove the lens of difference in making Ireland much like England in such narratives. Nally might have made more of the issues of translation and the politics of language and representation, but that may be work for another book at some time in the future.</p>
<p>The book concludes with a set of timely questions for the contemporary reader, and poses one question regarding how far we are comfortable in making judgements upon the past, but also need to think about questions of violence and the institutionalized hungers of the present. The measure of any book that challenges established modes of thinking about a subject is that it compels the reader to ask more questions when she is finished reading it, rather than sitting back comfortably secure in the knowledge that she has been given the last word. With this in mind, <italic>Human Encumbrances</italic> demands that we explore new directions while also critically re-examining old ‘truths’ about An Gorta Mór of 19th-century Ireland.</p>

<p>What is interesting is that while there has been a proliferation of small, local famine memorial sites dotted around the countryside, there is yet no national famine memorial site to mark the famine or its legacy on the island of Ireland, and the first time in which a national famine day was inaugurated was 2009.</p>

<p>One is drawn to the etymology of political economy, where the <italic>oikos</italic> of economy refers to the ancient Greek word for household, so the political economy of the nation most properly, and logically, begins in the domestic sphere. Political economy, particularly in a colonial context, therefore also encompasses specific power relations and is highly gendered.</p>
