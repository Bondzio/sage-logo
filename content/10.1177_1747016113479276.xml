<p>Following the publication of the UK concordat on research integrity, <italic>The concordat to support research integrity</italic>, with a striking foreword by David Willetts, Minister for Universities and Science, those who sponsor and support research in the UK universities, as well as those across the European Union, are beginning to respond, usually setting up working groups to discuss the implications of this new document and to form new policies for research practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1747016113479276">Universities UK, 2011</xref>). The concordat purports to apply to all fields of research, being relevant to all disciplines within which research is undertaken, whether or not it involves humans or animals as its ‘subjects’ explicitly. This statement of scope itself raises interesting questions about research in those fields that have traditionally fallen outside the interest of bioethicists, from engineering and astrophysics to media studies. But what seems particularly interesting is why the Minister felt that this document was necessary to write and publish as new policy at all, given that most universities have already set up ethics committees to govern academic research not captured by longstanding and now fairly robust structures within the National Health Service (NHS), and that most disciplines are albeit self-guided by professional societies or associations which publish codes of conduct. What seems new politically is the emphasis on researchers themselves rather than on systems of oversight.</p>
<p>To make sense of this new emphasis, however, we need to spell out exactly to what the quality of ‘integrity’ should refer. Just as members of the newly convened university working groups are doing, we will probably spend some time scratching our heads. The word ‘integrity’ could refer to either a quality of the research or the researchers engaged in the said research. The concordat seems ambiguous here, covering both qualities of scientific rigour or of completeness (a feature of research) and of honesty (a human virtue or moral imperative for human action − a capacity of researchers, as human agents, not of research in the abstract or the activity. While holding on to the old (if not failsafe) systems of oversight, the concordat recognizes that any system of oversight has limits and that in the last (or perhaps in the first) analysis, we can do nothing else but trust researchers not to contravene the rights and welfare of others no matter how many examples of poor practice we encounter, or how important they believe their research to be. Following Onora O’Neill’s ground-breaking observations on trust and accountability, which display the dangers of increasing layers of regulation designed to protect the public but which turn out to erode public trust in the professions, this emphasis on researchers as moral agents, capable of personal and professional integrity, seems welcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1747016113479276">O’Neill, 2002</xref>). Indeed, the Minister calls for universities to strengthen training provision for researchers, particularly in law and ethics, and to offer discretion over local policies of support for researchers to reflect certain institutional freedoms. This policy thus seems like a genuine effort to encourage researchers to think about what they are doing and to expose themselves to the values of others outside their immediate environment for a common purpose.</p>
<p>A more sinister interpretation (perhaps for the paranoid) would be that the new focus on researchers is, in fact, designed to mask cuts in resources for government agencies which currently oversee research, such as UK National Research Ethics Service (NRES). While we have, indeed, seen such resources diminish, the concordat states firmly that it includes and complements existing rules and regulations to guide the way. So the concordat presupposes rather than sets standards of practice (which reflects the organizational distinction in the United States, from where the term originates, between the Federal Offices of Human Subjects Research Protection, which sets standards, and of research integrity, which oversees their implementation and manages misconduct).</p>
<p>Instead of jiggery-pokery to hide budget cuts, UK researchers are identified in the concordat as the most productive of all the G8 countries and, in a repeatedly faltering economy, they are now thought to shoulder the burden of political expectation and social hope of technological advance and economic recovery. However, with new political protection of academic freedom and much coveted resources dedicated for science itself come weighty responsibilities which might pull in opposing directions. The researcher’s potential conflict of interests to individuals participating in their work and to society to increase health and now wealth has only become more pronounced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1747016113479276">Edwards, 2009</xref>). Thankfully, the Minister sees fit to suggest strengthening the reviewing process as well as the researchers’ skill set. How this can be done without extra resource, and should be done without detracting from the trust newly invested in researchers themselves, is now the real, substantive problem for each devolved working group to fathom.</p>

<title>Editor’s Choice</title>
<p>Following the resumption of research at the Erasmus University in Rotterdam into developing an airborne strain of H5NI (bird flu) this month, the article in this issue of <italic>Research Ethics</italic> by Frida Kuhlau, who discusses the ethics of disseminating dual use knowledge, is particularly timely. For the sake of security, it seeks to put limits on the drive to make health research increasingly open to public scrutiny and to require researchers to share their data with regulators, each other, and the public. One way in which sharing data has become easier and more common is, of course, through the internet and, in another article, Stine Lomborg explores the ethics of research into internet archives, which raises issues of privacy as well as possibilities for increased surveillance of internet users perhaps for security purposes.</p>
<p>The Topics section we will henceforth call Review, and in this issue Scott Fleming examines the practice of informed consent in social research in sports. There is also a new case study to think about as well as a commentary on the case published in the last issue to digest.</p>
