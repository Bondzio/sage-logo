<abstract><title>Summary</title>
<p>After rapidly scaling up HIV/AIDS-related health services, the Zambian Defence Force (ZDF) has become concerned with assuring their quality. This evaluation assesses provider performance at eight ZDF facilities based on direct observations of 191 antenatal care (ANC) consultations and 175 follow-up consultations for antiretroviral therapy (ART). In addition, 43 ZDF health providers were interviewed about the work environment and service quality. On-the-job performance varied widely: providers completed as few as 0% and as many as 100% of tasks associated with each performance standard. Overall scores averaged 66% (range: 47–93%) for ANC consultations and 60% (range: 37–100%) for ART consultations. Perceptions of the work environment were generally positive, but 57% of providers lack confidence in their clinical skills and 42% think staffing is insufficient. These findings, which point to the unique opportunities and challenges in the military setting, will be used to guide a quality improvement initiative.</p>

<sec id="sec1" sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title>
<p>The AIDS epidemic poses a special threat to military populations because of their demographic make-up and conditions of deployment. Young, sexually active military personnel are frequently posted away from home for long periods, separated from their partners. The value placed by military culture on risk-taking and masculinity also encourages casual, unprotected sex, as does the growth of sex industries around military camps.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0956462412472811">1</xref></sup> This results in high rates of sexually transmitted infections. A meta-analysis of data from 21 African countries confirmed that HIV prevalence is significantly higher in the military than in the general population and can be as much as 10-fold higher than in young civilian men.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0956462412472811">2</xref></sup> Elevated infection rates in the military population pose a threat to the surrounding community, as military personnel may transmit HIV to family members and local sexual partners.</p>
<p>African militaries have long recognized the threat posed by HIV/AIDS, and they are actively developing a consensus on best practices for its prevention, treatment and care.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0956462412472811">3</xref></sup> The Zambian Defence Forces (ZDF) have dramatically expanded HIV/AIDS-related services, including prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV (PMTCT) and access to antiretroviral therapy (ART) under its HIV and AIDS Strategic Plan for 2009–2014.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0956462412472811">4</xref></sup> There is widespread recognition that the time has come to shift attention to improving the quality, not just the quantity, of these services. To that end, the ZDF introduced Jhpiego's Standards-Based Management and Recognition (SBM-R<sup>®</sup>) approach to quality improvement in 2006.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0956462412472811">5</xref></sup> SBM-R relies on a set of detailed and comprehensive standards based on international best practices that list all essential tasks performed by health-care workers. Assessments based on these standards identify weaknesses in service delivery. Health-care workers analyse the root causes of these weaknesses and develop an action plan to address the gaps and meet the standards. Repeated assessments measure their progress and prompt additional rounds of quality improvement interventions.</p>
<p>This article presents data collected in 2010 to serve as a baseline for an evaluation of the impact of SBM-R at eight ZDF facilities. These data serve as a situation analysis of the quality of PMTCT and ART services in the ZDF. Jhpiego conducted the assessment with technical assistance from ZDF and Ministry of Health (MoH) staff, and with financial support from the United States Department of Defense (DOD).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>METHODS</title>
<sec id="sec2a"><title>Sampling</title>
<p>The ZDF operates a network of 54 health facilities, including three hospitals, which represent 16% of all health services in Zambia and serve military personnel and their families as well as surrounding civilian communities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0956462412472811">6</xref></sup> Sixteen of these facilities implemented SBM-R prior to 2010 and were excluded from this study. We purposefully selected eight of the remaining 38 facilities: four were scheduled to initiate SBM-R in June or July 2010 and four were selected as comparison sites, based on ZDF branch, service volume, number of beds and catchment population. All eight sites are clinic-level health facilities.</p>
<p>We invited all health-care providers responsible for delivering PMTCT and ART services at these facilities to participate in the study. Forty-three were interviewed and had their consultations observed. Half provide both PMTCT and ART and could have been observed offering both services. Assessors observed as many antenatal care (ANC) and ART consultations as possible during one- or two-day site visits. Consent was obtained from both providers and patients prior to observing consultations. The study was approved by the University of Zambia Biomedical Research Ethics Committee and the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health Institutional Review Board.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2b"><title>Data collection</title>
<p>Assessors were third-party staff from the MoH who did not work at the facilities being assessed, which reduced possible biases. Two medical doctors assessed ART services, and two nurses assessed ANC services. All had considerable experience with SBM-R assessments. Assessors visited each facility between August and October 2010.</p>
<p>The assessors approached all ART and ANC patients aged 18 years or older, using a specially designed recruitment script. Before the consultation, assessors gathered some background information, including details about the pregnancy for ANC patients and about the duration of therapy for ART patients. During the consultation, assessors completed an observation checklist based on the Zambia SBM-R assessment tools. The goal of SBM-R is for providers to complete all of the tasks in the checklist, which are referred to as verification criteria; this is defined as good quality care. The verification criteria were derived from the Zambian National HIV Guidelines, which are based on best practices set forth by the World Health Organization.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0956462412472811">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0956462412472811">8</xref></sup> The assessors noted whether each verification criterion was observed or not observed or, on occasion, was not applicable.</p>
<p>Assessors interviewed participating providers individually in a private space, using a structured questionnaire. In addition to gathering information about providers’ professional background, the questionnaire included 25 items on various aspects of the work environment, such as job expectations, compensation, safety and fulfilment; seven items on the frequency and content of supervision; and 11 items on service quality and quality improvement. The instrument was based on the Workplace Climate and Job Satisfaction Survey developed to assess Kenya's Emergency Hiring Plan<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0956462412472811">9</xref></sup> and was pretested before data collection began.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2c"><title>Data analysis</title>
<p>Observation data were collected on 116 verification criteria during ANC consultations and 48 verification criteria during ART consultations. These criteria were grouped into the SBM-R performance standards listed in Tables <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0956462412472811">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0956462412472811">3</xref>; each focuses on a specific skill set, such as HIV/AIDS counselling and testing or the obstetric exam. For example, finalization of an ART consultation includes the following five verification criteria: asking if the patient has questions and addressing them, determining the time frame for the follow-up visit, showing the patient where to go next, completing the registration, and completing an adverse drug reaction report or other applicable forms.</p>
<p>Providers’ performance was assessed by calculating the percentage of verification criteria achieved for each standard. Summary scores divide the number of tasks observed by the total number of tasks required to meet each performance standard; the maximum possible score is 100%. We also examined the data for individual verification criteria.</p>
<p>During the interviews, providers responded to statements about the work environment using a five-point Likert-type scale that ranged from strongly disagree to strongly agree. The analysis grouped these statements into the six components listed in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0956462412472811">4</xref>. The mean score was calculated for each component of the work environment. A higher score indicates better perceptions of the work environment.</p>
<p>Providers were also asked to rate the quality of HIV/AIDS-related services at their own facility on a five-point scale, ranging from very poor to very good. Mean scores on this scale proved to be misleading, because high and low ratings were averaged out. Therefore, the analysis presents the percentage of providers who rated each service as good or very good. This is considered a proxy for acceptable quality of care.</p>
</sec>

<sec id="sec3"><title>FINDINGS</title>
<sec id="sec3a"><title>Provider characteristics</title>
<p>Most of the 43 providers were men (54.8%), aged 30–39 (56.1%). About three-fifths were nurses or midwives (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0956462412472811">1</xref>). Forty-four percent had served as a health-care provider in the ZDF for a decade or longer. Because of regular reassignments by the military, about one-third of providers had worked at their current facility for less than three years.

<p>Nearly half (48.9%) of providers offered four or five key services (ANC, PMTCT, labour and delivery, postnatal care and ART) at their current facility; 9.2% offered two or three of these services (not shown). Fourteen percent offered related services, such as laboratory, pharmacy and counselling services.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3b"><title>Observations of ANC/PMTCT consultations</title>
<p>A total of 191 ANC patients agreed to have their consultations observed. On average, they were 25.6 years old (range: 15–45 years) and 26.2 weeks pregnant (range: 12–38 weeks). Forty-four percent of ANC consultations were the woman's first visit to the facility with the current pregnancy. Only 24% had never been pregnant before.</p>
<p>On average, providers completed 66% of verification criteria during ANC consultations (range: 47–93%). The mean ANC score at each facility ranged from a low of 49% to a high of 77%. Mean scores were highest for interpersonal communication and lowest for family planning and STD counselling. However, summary scores for all performance standards varied widely between consultations (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0956462412472811">2</xref>).

</table-wrap-foot>
</table-wrap></p>
<p>A close examination of the findings for individual verification criteria reveals that low summary scores on various performance standards reflected two distinct patterns with different implications for quality improvement efforts. On some standards, all providers shared the same strengths and weaknesses. During obstetric exams, for example, providers nearly always performed an abdominal inspection, listened to the fetal heart rate and determined the fetal lie when appropriate, recorded all relevant findings and informed the patient of key findings. However, they very rarely examined the external genitalia or took actions to prevent infection, so the summary score for obstetric exams was only 57%. In this situation, raising the summary score only requires improvement on a few verification criteria. On other standards, such as ANC history-taking, there was no clear pattern of tasks completed or tasks omitted. Rather, different providers exhibited different weaknesses. When performance is inconsistent, raising the summary score – and the quality of care – requires attention to many verification criteria.</p>
<p>We also found that providers tend to perform key elements of PMTCT – such as adherence counselling – only once, when they test women for HIV, and do not repeat them at subsequent visits as recommended by guidelines. The mean score for HIV counselling and testing was 82% (range: 0–100%) during the woman's initial visit for ANC (<italic>n</italic> = 82), but fell to 17% (range: 0–100%) during subsequent visits (<italic>n</italic> = 99). The score for HIV/AIDS management in pregnancy was 64% (range: 0–100%) during consultations with an HIV test (<italic>n</italic> = 91), but only 6% (range: 0–50%) during other consultations (<italic>n</italic> = 84).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3c"><title>Observations of ART consultations</title>
<p>A total of 175 ART patients agreed to have their consultations observed. Most were men (56.1%); 29.9% were aged less than 30 years, while 32.1% were aged 40 or older. All had already initiated ART and were returning to the clinic for follow-up care; 11% were observed during their first or second follow-up visit. Forty-five percent had been on ART for less than a year; 27.5% had been on ART for three years or longer.</p>
<p>On average, providers completed 60% of all verification criteria during ART consultations (range: 37–100%). The mean score at each facility ranged from 51% to 79%. Providers performed best on finalizing the consultation (mean: 100%) and the initial assessment (mean: 85%; range: 50–100%). They performed worst on assessing issues identified during the consultation (mean 38%, range 0–100%) and nutrition counselling (mean: 3%; range: 0–100%), which was a relatively new addition to service guidelines. Providers performed inconsistently on every standard except finalizing the consultation (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0956462412472811">3</xref>).

<p>Providers’ perceptions of the work environment at their facility were generally positive (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0956462412472811">4</xref>). With the exception of adequacy of resources, mean scores were at least 3.9 for all components, out of a maximum possible score of 5. Scores varied widely among providers and also between facilities. For example, provider scores for resources ranged from 2.1 to 4.9, while the mean score at each facility ranged from a low of 2.8 to a high of 4.2.

<p>Individual items suggest that problems exist at some facilities: 25.6% of all providers find the job stressful, 34.9% feel overworked, 56.8% lack confidence in their clinical skills and 76.7% feel isolated in their work (not shown).

<p>On average, providers were supervised 1.8 times (range: 0–6) in the six months before the interview.

<sec id="sec4" sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title>
<sec id="sec4a"><title>Quality of services</title>
<p>This study assessed the quality of ANC and ART services at ZDF facilities in order to guide quality improvement efforts. Observations of consultations found extremely wide variations in providers’ on-the-job performance, with summary scores for some standards ranging from less than 10% to almost 100% in different consultations. Average scores also varied widely between facilities. This confirms the importance of the SBM-R approach for this setting, since its comprehensive performance standards are designed to ensure that every provider at every facility consistently meets acceptable standards of care. The assessment may also serve as a wake-up call for providers, whose perceptions of the quality of care were generally more favourable than the observed reality.</p>
<p>By identifying specific tasks that providers perform irregularly or not at all, the assessment shows where interventions should be targeted and suggests what kinds of interventions may be needed. For example, we found that providers rarely counsel ANC patients on family planning issues or discuss nutritional guidelines with patients receiving ART. They also generally do not meet standards for hand hygiene and use of gloves during obstetric exams, placing patients at risk of infection. A further analysis of the root causes of these performance gaps is needed in order to design an effective intervention.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0956462412472811">5</xref></sup> For example, depending on whether weaknesses stem from lack of knowledge, motivation or supplies and equipment, an appropriate response might be refresher training, supportive supervision or improvements in the logistics system. However, the current findings do suggest that broad interventions addressing a wide range of verification criteria will be needed to meet ANC and ART performance standards at ZDF facilities. The data show that, with a few notable exceptions, providers did not consistently make the same mistakes, which would permit more narrowly focused interventions.</p>
<p>In addition, we observed that providers performed differently on HIV-related tasks during ANC consultations, depending on whether or not it was a woman's first visit with that pregnancy. It is possible that providers also perform differently during initial and return visits for ART, but assessors were not able to observe initial ART consultations during their brief facility visits. Although national guidelines call for providers to repeat tasks during each ANC and ART visit, providers may not feel the need to do so. This perception may have contributed to some of the low scores recorded, given that most patients were observed during return visits. By sharing the results of periodic assessments, discussing progress at every staff meeting, and tying incentives to the routine delivery of key tasks, the SBM-R process can encourage providers to follow guidelines during repeat visits, as demonstrated by the impact of SBM-R initiatives in other countries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0956462412472811">10</xref></sup> However, it is not clear whether this is the best way to improve the quality of care at ZDF facilities. Experience in family planning programmes suggests that it is important to adapt services to meet the special needs of returning patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0956462412472811">11</xref></sup> The ZDF should consider creating different guidelines and job aids for first-time and returning clients in order to help providers understand which tasks need to be repeated and which messages need to be reinforced at subsequent visits.</p>
<p>Finally, our findings suggest that some challenges originate from the integrated service model common in Zambia. Almost half of the providers interviewed offered at least four key services, including ANC, PMTCT, labour and delivery, postnatal care, and ART. As a result, they are responsible for achieving hundreds of verification criteria across dozens of performance standards. The challenges of integrated service delivery for providers are well-established: the more services providers offer, the harder it is to master all of the needed knowledge and skills.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0956462412472811">12</xref></sup> Providers may need additional support – in the form of supervision, job aids, on-the-job training or even new technologies like mobile phones, which can provide updated service delivery guidelines and SMS reminders – to perform so many services to a high standard.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4b"><title>Work environment</title>
<p>Findings on provider motivation and satisfaction in the ZDF health workforce were unexpectedly positive, compared with past studies of public sector providers in Zambia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0956462412472811">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0956462412472811"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0956462412472811">15</xref></sup> Like many sub-Saharan African countries, Zambia is dealing with a severe shortage of health workers due to high rates of attrition, emigration and HIV-related deaths.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0956462412472811">16</xref></sup> The resulting stress and overwork contribute to high levels of dissatisfaction, occupational burn-out and turnover among MoH employees, which undermines the quality of care. Low salaries and limited opportunities for career development are also common complaints.</p>
<p>In contrast, most of the ZDF providers in our study reportedly found their work personally fulfilling, enjoyed a sense of recognition and were satisfied with compensation and work relationships. Their relatively high ratings may be linked with the military setting as ZDF providers are accustomed to and selected for their ability to take orders, respect the chain of command, and endure harsh environments. The high ratings may also reflect the military's <italic>esprit de corps</italic>. However, it is also possible that more tangible elements of the work environment, such as salaries, caseloads, job security and opportunities for promotion, account for higher satisfaction among ZDF providers. Further investigation is warranted to determine what lessons the MoH could learn from the ZDF to improve the low levels of motivation and job satisfaction among its providers.</p>
<p>With the rapid scale up of HIV/AIDS services, providers across Zambia are dealing with growing workloads.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0956462412472811">17</xref></sup> The findings indicate that the ZDF is not exempt from this trend. Levels of stress and overwork suggest a potential for burn out if the ZDF does not address staffing shortages. In addition, three-quarters of providers feel isolated in their work, while over half lack confidence in their clinical skills. By its very nature, the SBM-R process may help address these concerns; it builds a team atmosphere in which facility staff work together, with the active support of supervisors, to meet challenges and make improvements.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0956462412472811">5</xref></sup> Heightened interaction with and support from peers and supervisors has the potential to overcome providers’ sense of isolation and strengthen their skills.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4c"><title>Study strengths and limitations</title>
<p>The study offers an objective and reliable assessment of provider performance because it relies on direct observations (rather than interviews and self-reports) conducted by experienced health professionals without ties to the ZDF or Jhpiego, using tools that reflect international best practices for low-resource settings. However, interpretation of the findings is subject to certain limitations. Because facilities were not chosen randomly, the study sample may not be representative of all ZDF facilities; in fact, half the sites were deliberately selected for the SBM-R intervention because they were considered to be in greater need of quality improvement. The results also are not generalizable to facilities that are not associated with the ZDF. Since providers try harder when under observation (the Hawthorne effect), observations likely overstate providers’ actual performance on the job. Also, providers’ assessments of the work environment and service quality were subjective and may reflect the reluctance of military personnel to complain about their situation.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5" sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSION</title>
<p>While previous research has examined the quality of HIV/AIDS-related services in Zambia, this study is the first to do so in a military setting. Improving the quality of these services is a priority for both the military and the MoH, and there is an effort underway to harmonize approaches to quality assurance across the nation. These findings can help guide the ZDF's quality improvement initiative by identifying specific weaknesses in service delivery and the work environment that need to be addressed. They also hold potential lessons for the larger civilian health system, which shares some of the same problems.</p>
