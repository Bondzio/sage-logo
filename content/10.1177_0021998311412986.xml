<p>The objective of this work is to determine the effects of metal mesh heating element size on resistance welding of thermoplastic composites. The materials to be resistance-welded consisted of carbon fiber/poly-ether-ketone-ketone (CF/PEKK), carbon fiber/poly-ether-imide (CF/PEI) and glass fiber/PEI (GF/PEI). Four different metal mesh sizes were used as heating elements. The samples were welded in a lap shear joint configuration and mechanically tested. Maximum Lap Shear Strengths of 52, 47 and 33 MPa were obtained for the CF/PEKK, CF/PEI and GF/PEI specimens, respectively. The ratio of the heating element’s fraction of open area and wire diameter was shown to be the most important parameter to be considered when selecting an appropriate heating element size.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0021998311412986" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Continuous fiber-reinforced thermoplastic composites are increasingly being used as structural components in automotive, marine and aerospace industries because of their commonly cited advantages over thermoset composites. As the complexity of the parts made of these materials increases, development of efficient joining methods is becoming essential. Among the various joining methods available for thermoplastic composites, fusion bonding or welding has attracted most attention in the past few years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021998311412986">1</xref></sup> Fusion bonding makes use of the thermoplastic polymers’ ability to be melted and subsequently cooled to regain their initial physical and mechanical properties. The interest for this joining method resides in its advantages over conventional joining methods, such as adhesive bonding, in which extensive surface preparation and long curing times are involved and mechanical fastening, in which stress concentrations are induced by holes drilling.</p>
<p>The welding principle can be described as heating the surfaces of two adherends above their glass-transition temperature <italic>T</italic><sub>g</sub> (amorphous polymers) or melting temperature <italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub> (semi-crystalline polymers), fusing the polymer at the weld interface and cooling the polymer under the application of pressure for solidification and consolidation purposes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021998311412986">1</xref></sup> Heat can be applied to the interface using direct heat sources, such as an infrared lamp or hot plates (thermal welding), frictional work such as linear, rotational or ultrasonic vibrations (friction welding) or electrical current or electromagnetic field (electromagnetic welding). Resistance welding is one of the electromagnetic welding techniques that showed a high potential to be implemented in industry due to its short processing times and the simplicity of the required equipment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021998311412986">2</xref></sup> In this technique, an electrical current is applied to a heating element, which is placed between the surfaces of two adherends. As the current passes through the heating element, the temperature rises due to the Joule heating effect and the adjoining polymer softens (amorphous polymer) or melts (semi-crystalline polymer). The softening or melting of the polymer is followed by a consolidating step in which the weld interface is cooled, under the application of pressure. The heating element remains trapped in the joint after the welding operation.</p>
<p>Recent investigations of resistance welding of thermoplastic composites include experimental and modeling works. The modeling works mainly focused on heat transfer, consolidation and crystallization analyses, while the experimental works investigated the effects of the welding parameters, such as the input power level and heating element type, on the weld quality and performance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021998311412986">2</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0021998311412986">8</xref></sup> More recent studies about the long-term durability of the resistance-welded joints led to encouraging results that should attract the interest of the researchers for this welding method.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0021998311412986">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0021998311412986">10</xref></sup> Three methods of applying the input power to the heating element were reported. In the first method, called constant input voltage, a fixed input voltage is applied to the heating element and kept constant over the entire welding process. The second method, proposed by Arias and Ziegmann,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0021998311412986">11</xref></sup> is called the impulse power technique. In this method, power is applied in the form of intense pulses, followed by a pause of between one and three seconds. It was claimed that this method could provide a better temperature homogeneity over the weld area, as the heat can dissipate in the weld during the pauses. In the last method, called ramped voltage, the voltage applied to the heating element is increased at a fixed rate in such a way that it generates an almost linear heating rate, which in turn facilitates the process control. The reported ramping rates vary from 1.5 to 9 V/min.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0021998311412986">12</xref></sup> This method was used to weld unidirectional and quasi-isotropic 16-ply APC-2/AS4 (carbon fiber/poly-ether-ether-ketone) adherends.</p>
<p>The heating element type is another resistance welding parameter that has been investigated in recent years. Since it is responsible for generating heat at the weld interface and as it remains embedded in the weld after the welding operation, the heating element is one of the most important parameters in the resistance welding process. In the 1980s and 1990s, carbon fiber prepreg plies were used as heating elements because of their compatibility with carbon fiber adherends.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0021998311412986">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0021998311412986">4</xref></sup> They consisted of a single unidirectional or fabric carbon fiber prepreg ply. In general, the unidirectional prepreg led to non-uniform heating due to the low thermal conductivity in the direction perpendicular to the fibers. In addition, the brittleness of the carbon fibers reduced the connection efficiency with the power supply for both the unidirectional and fabric heating elements.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0021998311412986">4</xref></sup> This connection is assured by copper electrical connectors that are clamped on the heating element. In many cases, the clamping pressure was high enough to damage the carbon fibers of the heating element, leading to a poor electrical connection. All these problems reported for carbon fiber heating elements aroused the interest of the researchers for a new type of heating element, which consisted of a stainless steel mesh. The stainless steel mesh heating element improved the temperature homogeneity over the weld area and was more resistant to the pressure applied by the connectors, leading to an overall better weld mechanical performance, wider processing window and better process control and repeatability.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021998311412986">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0021998311412986">13</xref></sup> Stainless steel meshes are available in various grades, with different wire diameters and open gap widths. In order to achieve a good mechanical performance, the effects of these two parameters on the quality of the joints need to be investigated. While previous studies have shown the advantages of stainless steel meshes over carbon fiber heating elements, none has focused on the size of the stainless steel heating element. This investigation of the effects of the mesh size is not straightforward, as the wire diameter and open gap width affect the weld quality in a number of ways. They have a direct impact on the electrical resistance of the meshes and, consequently, on the heat generation at the weld interface. They also affect the polymer diffusion, weld thickness, residual stresses, stress concentrations around the wires, etc.</p>
<p>The objective of the present study is to investigate the effects of the metal mesh heating element size on the weld interface quality and mechanical performance of the welded joints. Four different stainless steel mesh heating elements were used to weld semi-crystalline (poly-ether-ketone-ketone – PEKK) and amorphous (poly-ether-imide – PEI) polymer composites. The specimens were welded in a lap shear joint geometry and mechanically tested to failure. The overall quality of the weld interface was assessed using optical microscopy and the fracture surfaces were observed under scanning electron microscopy (SEM).</p></sec>

<sec id="sec3-0021998311412986"><title>Adherends</title>
<p>The laminates used in this work consisted of 16-ply unidirectional carbon fiber/PEKK (CF/PEKK), 16-ply unidirectional CF/PEI and eight plies of eight-harness satin weave glass fiber fabric (GF/PEI). PEKK is a semi-crystalline polymer with a melting temperature of 310°C and PEI is an amorphous polymer with a glass-transition temperature of 218°C. The 2.2 mm thick CF/PEKK and CF/PEI laminates were supplied by Cytec Engineered Materials Inc. and were compression molded under the PEKK and PEI standard molding conditions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0021998311412986">14</xref></sup> They had a fiber volume fraction of 61%. The GF/PEI material was provided by Ten Cate Advanced Composites and was compression molded in 2.0 mm thick laminates. The fiber volume fraction was 50%. In order to perform lap shear weld specimens, 101.6 mm long and 25.4 mm wide adherends were cut off from the laminates.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec4-0021998311412986"><title>Heating elements</title>
<p>Four plain weave stainless steel meshes were used as heating elements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0021998311412986">Figure 1</xref>). A description of the meshes is presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0021998311412986">Table 1</xref>, along with the materials that were welded with each heating element. All four heating elements were used to weld the GF/PEI specimens. Since a much lower performance was obtained with the first heating element (mesh A), only the remaining three heating elements were used for the CF/PEI and CF/PEKK materials. The heating elements were cut to dimensions of 12.7 mm wide and 50.0 mm long. A neat polymer film of the same polymer type as the adherends was placed on each side of the heating element in order to provide a resin rich region at the weld interface and reduce the number of voids due to entrapment of air in the mesh. All meshes were cleaned with acetone prior to the resistance welding operation.

<sec id="sec5-0021998311412986"><title>Resistance welding</title>
<p>The resistance welding set-up consisted of a direct current (DC) power supply with a maximum output of 40 A and 80 V, a computer/data acquisition system, a pressure system and a resistance welding rig. The resistance welding rig was specifically designed to weld a single lap shear sample. It consisted of a fiberglass plate on which ceramic block insulators were installed to provide thermal insulation against heat losses in the environment and apply the welding pressure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0021998311412986">Figure 2</xref>). Copper electrical connectors were used to apply the current to the heating element. The heating element was clamped between the connectors over the 12.7 mm wide side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0021998311412986">Figure 3</xref>). The ramped voltage method with an initial voltage of 2.0 V and a ramping rate of 9.0 V/min was used for all welds. A constant welding pressure of 1.0 MPa, which is within the recommended range from previous studies,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0021998311412986">15</xref></sup> was applied during the process. The pressure was applied at the beginning of the heating, i.e., when current was applied, and controlled using a hydraulic piston. The temperature was monitored using a K-type thermocouple located at the center of the welds, between one of the two polymer films and the adherend. No thermocouples were used for the welds that were to be tested in order to avoid putting a defect at the interface. When the monitored temperature reached a pre-determined welding temperature of 420°C for PEKK and 400°C for PEI, the current was stopped and the weld interface cooled down, under the application of pressure. The overall processing cycle from the time at which current was applied and the time at which the temperature was low enough for the specimens to be taken off from the rig varied between 70 and 90 seconds.

<sec id="sec6-0021998311412986"><title>Mechanical testing and characterization methods</title>
<p>Some of the welded specimens were examined using optical microscopy to evaluate the quality of the weld interface. The samples were cut, polished and observed along both the length and width directions. The static lap shear tests were conducted according to the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) D1002 standard test method. The lap shear specimens were 190.5 mm long and 25.4 mm wide, with an overlap width of 12.7 mm. The free length between the grips was 140.0 mm. The specimens were tested at 23°C and at a relative humidity of 50% under a crosshead speed of 1.27 mm/min. Many replicated specimens were welded and tested in order to obtain at least five valid test results for each material type and heating element size. The fractured samples were observed visually and using SEM to determine the failure modes.</p></sec></sec>

<sec id="sec8-0021998311412986"><title>Thermal behavior</title>
<p>The wire diameter and density in the mesh control the heating element electrical resistance which, in turn, controls the input power and heating rate. For a given ramped voltage rate, the higher the electrical resistance of the mesh is, the lower the input power is and the longer the welding time is. This behavior is depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0021998311412986">Figure 4</xref> for the GF/PEI specimens. The other welded materials presented the same behavior with longer welding times for the finer meshes. These variations in the thermal behaviors of specimens welded with each mesh were suspected to have an influence on the microstructure of the polymer. However, looking carefully at the temperature profiles, one can see that the heating time, i.e., the time between the start of the welding process and the time at which current is switched off, was very short. It varied from 14 seconds only (heating element A) to 26 seconds (heating element D). Furthermore, the time spent above <italic>T</italic><sub>g</sub> varied from 14 to 16 seconds only. The difference between the times above <italic>T</italic><sub>g</sub> was so short that its effect on the microstructure of the polymer was neglected. It should also be noted that although the PEI polymer was heated well above its glass-transition temperature, the time spent above that temperature was short and no polymer degradation was noticed.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec9-0021998311412986"><title>Weld interface quality</title>
<p>Previous studies have shown that the weld quality is generally not uniform over the weld area.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0021998311412986">3</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0021998311412986">5</xref></sup> Therefore, microscopic observations were made both at the center and edges of the welds. An example is given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0021998311412986">Figure 5</xref> for a CF/PEKK specimen welded using type B heating element. At the center of the specimen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0021998311412986">Figure 5</xref>(a)), a good weld interface quality was observed without voids or porosities and complete mesh impregnation was evident. On the other hand, the existence of some voids was revealed at the edges of the weld, i.e., the edges where the heating element was clamped between the copper electrical connectors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0021998311412986">Figure 3</xref>). The voids were located both in the heating element and in the first plies of the adherends (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0021998311412986">Figure 5</xref>(b)). The creation of these voids was attributed to two phenomena: polymer squeeze out, which was observed during the welding operation, and lack of pressure at the edges of the weld. Polymer squeeze out was the result of polymer melting and flow. As the polymer viscosity decreased, the polymer flowed out of the weld, leaving unfilled gaps in the heating element. The lack of pressure at the edges was also created by the polymer flow. After the polymer squeezed out of the weld, only the remaining polymer, i.e., the polymer located at the center of the welds, could sustain the applied welding pressure. The pressure at the edges was thus reduced, which explains the existence of voids in the first layers of the adherends (lack of consolidation pressure). The same behavior, that is, a good weld interface quality in the center but some voids at the edges, was observed for the other heating elements used for the CF/PEKK specimens. Observations of the CF/PEI and GF/PEI samples revealed a different weld quality. While voids were observed at the edges of the welds, some other voids were also present in the center of the joints (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0021998311412986">Figure 6</xref>), especially for the specimens welded using the type A heating element. These voids could not be avoided, even for the high welding pressure of 1.0 MPa. Ageorges et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0021998311412986">15</xref></sup> came to the same conclusion for resistance welding of CF/PEI and GF/PEI materials. They showed that pressures below 0.2 MPa led to reduced Lap Shear Strength (LSS), while pressures higher than 1.6 MPa led to excessive laminate deformations and much greater polymer flow. Nevertheless, some deconsolidation always occurred, even in the proper pressure range. Other explanations for this deconsolidation in the laminates, as well as the voids observed at the weld interface, include the lower environmental resistance, and possible higher humidity absorption, of the PEI polymer, compared to the PEKK polymer. The other phenomena explained above, i.e., polymer squeeze out and reduced pressure, were responsible for the voids located at the edges of the welds.

<p>Resistance welding studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0021998311412986">12</xref></sup> conducted on other polymers, for example PEEK, showed some voids at the edges as well but, as was observed here for the PEKK polymer, good quality in the center. Finite element heat transfer analyses have shown that the change of heat mechanism from conduction in the adherends to convection in the surrounding air was responsible for the ‘edge effect’. This edge effect creates a higher temperature at the edges of the welds, which can explain the lower quality at this location.</p></sec>

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0021998311412986">Figure 7</xref> presents the LSS of the tested specimens. For all three materials, metal mesh C led to the highest LSSs: 52, 47 and 33 MPa for CF/PEKK, CF/PEI and GF/PEI, respectively. The reasons for this best mechanical performance reside in the metal mesh C wire diameter and open gap width. The metal meshes with larger wire diameters (A and B) reduced the LSS because the wires acted as inclusions (defects) in the weld. By looking at the heating elements properties (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0021998311412986">Table 1</xref>), one can see that the main difference between heating elements A, B and C was the wire diameter. As the wire diameter decreased (from heating element A to heating element C), the LSS increased. The much lower LSS obtained using heating element A is also in agreement with the lower weld interface quality that was noted in this case, where more voids were seen than for the other heating elements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0021998311412986">Figure 6</xref>).

<p>Another important parameter affecting the LSS is the open gap width. The effect of the open gap width was assessed by comparing the LSS of the specimens welded using heating elements C and D. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0021998311412986">Table 1</xref>, the main difference between those heating elements is the open gap width. As the open gap width decreased (from heating element C to heating element D), the LSS was reduced.</p>
<p>The results of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0021998311412986">Figure 7</xref> suggest that open gap width and wire diameter are the two heating element parameters affecting the weld strength. It is believed that increasing the open gap width, thus increasing the fraction of open area in the weld (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0021998311412986">Table 1</xref>), should increase the LSS, as more polymer could sustain the applied load. On the other hand, a larger wire diameter should reduce the weld strength, as a larger inclusion would take place at the weld interface. Therefore, maximizing the ratio of fraction of open area and wire diameter should be a good way of optimizing the weld strength. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0021998311412986">Figure 8</xref> shows a plot of the LSS versus the ratio of the fraction of open area/wire diameter. Increasing this ratio is shown to increase the LSS. This result was expected, as maximizing the ratio of the fraction of open area and wire diameter leads, at the limit, to a weld interface without any wire in it, which is the case of a compression-molded laminate. The aforementioned ratio should be the most important parameter to be considered when selecting an appropriate metal mesh size. Of course, other considerations, such as uniform heating over the weld area, should be considered.

<p>The average LSS of the CF/PEKK and CF/PEI welds were similar when considering the standard deviations. However, the load-displacement curves and the fracture behaviors of the two materials were quite different. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0021998311412986">Figure 9</xref> shows a linear load-displacement curve for the CF/PEI material up to the maximum load. A brittle fracture follows the maximum load. The CF/PEKK specimens exhibited a different behavior with a non-linear curve after 40% of the maximum load was reached. A short plateau was then observed just before the maximum load was reached. This plateau was due to a higher polymer ductility and damage progression in the weld. The excellent toughness properties of the PEKK polymer meant that more energy was required to break those specimens. The GF/PEI welds exhibited a lower strength and a much larger displacement to failure than the CF/PEI samples, even though the same heating element and polymer were used. The different nature and architecture of the reinforcing fibers (woven eight-harness glass fiber fabric as opposed to unidirectional carbon fibers), i.e., 50% less fibers in the loading direction and lower Young’s modulus of the glass fibers, were responsible for this lower strength and larger displacement to failure.

<p>The observation of the fracture surfaces gave insight on the failure modes of the specimens. As explained by Stavrov and Bersee,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021998311412986">2</xref></sup> the failure modes of resistance-welded thermoplastic composites lap shear specimens are classified into two categories: interfacial or interlaminar failure modes. Interfacial failure occurs at the interface between the heating element and adherend and leads to low LSS due to imperfect welding. No damage to the adherend or heating element is involved in this case of interfacial failure. The interlaminar failure mode, on the other hand, may involve: (1) damage in the adherends; (2) damage in the heating element; or (3) damage within both of them. This generally leads to high LSS, especially if damage to the adherends is involved. Both the interfacial and interlaminar failure modes were observed in this investigation. For the GF/PEI specimens, the heating element A led to interfacial failure with clear debonding between the heating element and adherend. On the other hand, heating elements B and C led to interlaminar failure modes, involving tearing of the heating element and no laminate damage (heating element B) and a full layer of the adherend ripped off (heating element C). The latter failure mode is an example of interlaminar failure without heating element tearing, but with a lot of laminate damage. Heating element D showed interlaminar failure mode with weld interface debonding and some damage to the laminates. The same observations were made on the CF/PEI specimens. Examples of the various failure modes are given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0021998311412986">Figure 10</xref> for the GF/PEI specimens.

<p>The CF/PEKK specimens revealed the same failure modes as the PEI specimens. Debonding between the heating element and polymer interface was observed for heating element B. Tearing of the heating element was also observed but no damage to the laminates was noticed. Heating element C led to an interlaminar failure with damage to both the heating element and adherend, leading to a higher LSS. This failure mode is shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0021998311412986">11</xref>, where damage to the laminate can be seen as well as heating element tearing. <?accolade "acc3"?><?accolade?>It can also be seen in this picture that good fiber wetting of the first plies of the adherends was obtained during the resistance welding. However, the polymer does not seem to adhere very well to the stainless steel heating element. It is believed that the mechanical performance of the welds could be further improved by using an appropriate coating on the stainless steel mesh in order to improve the adherence with the polymer.

<p>The heating element is a critical factor in resistance welding of thermoplastic composites as it affects the heat generation at the weld interface and the mechanical properties of the weld. In this work, various stainless steel mesh heating element sizes were used to weld semi-crystalline (PEKK) and amorphous (PEI) thermoplastic composites. It was found that the wire diameter and open gap width had a great influence on the weld quality and performance. A metal mesh with a wire diameter of 0.04 mm and open gap width of 0.09 mm led to the best mechanical performances, for all tested materials. LSSs of 52, 47 and 33 MPa were obtained for the CF/PEKK, CF/PEI and GF/PEI specimens, respectively, using this optimum mesh size. The ratio of the fraction of open area and wire diameter was shown to be the most important parameter to be considered when selecting a metal mesh heating element size. Tested lap shear specimens exhibited interfacial or interlaminar failure modes, the latter leading to the best mechanical performance.</p>
<p>Although the LSS of the CF/PEKK and CF/PEI specimens were similar, different mechanical behaviors were observed. The CF/PEI and GF/PEI samples showed a linear load-displacement curve, followed by a brittle fracture. The CF/PEKK specimens exhibited a non-linear behavior, more ductility and a certain damage accumulation before the complete rupture of the specimens. SEM observations revealed a lack of adherence between the stainless steel mesh heating elements and the polymers. Future studies should focus on the development of a heating element coating that could improve the adherence with the polymer.</p></sec>
