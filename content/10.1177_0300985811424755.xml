<abstract>
<p>The pregnant guinea pig is an effective model for studying abortifacient <italic>Campylobacter</italic> spp, and previous experiments have demonstrated that <italic>C. jejuni </italic>IA3902 has a marked predilection for the subplacenta while sparing the placental disc in this species. In the study described here, the growth and chemotaxis of IA3902 and a reference strain (NCTC 11168) are compared in the presence of subplacental and placental factors, as well as bile and plasma, from pregnant and nonpregnant guinea pigs. Both strains grew better in subplacental versus placental disc tissue extracts at 24 hours; however, only IA3902 maintained this enhancement at 48 hours. Histochemistry and lectin histochemistry were used to localize mucin, iron, and <sc>l</sc>-fucose within the placental unit. Mucin was most abundant in subplacental lacunae, the junctional zone, and visceral yolk sac placenta, while iron was most abundant in the placental disc, and <sc>l</sc>-fucose-containing surface glycans were limited to the visceral yolk sac placenta. These 3 individual factors, along with progesterone and estradiol, were evaluated for effects on growth and chemotaxis of <italic>C. jejuni</italic>. Mucin, iron, and <sc>l</sc>-fucose were growth promoting, while <sc>l</sc>-fucose was also chemoattractive for both strains. Progesterone, estradiol, and pregnant guinea pig plasma did not affect growth or chemotaxis, and no difference was observed when bile from pregnant and nonpregnant animals was compared. These findings demonstrate the presence of specific factors within the guinea pig placental unit that drive chemotaxis and enhance growth of <italic>C. jejuni</italic>, shedding light on potential mechanisms underlying the fetoplacental tropism observed with this strain.</p>

<p>Campylobacteriosis is a significant cause of ovine abortion worldwide, with abortion rates ranging from 5% to 50% in affected flocks.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0300985811424755">31</xref>
</sup> In a 2001 survey by the US Department of Agriculture, campylobacteriosis ranked first among infectious causes of abortion in domestic sheep.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0300985811424755">34</xref>
</sup> Recent studies have revealed that <italic>Campylobacter jejuni</italic> has become the predominant species associated with ovine abortions in the United States,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0300985811424755">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0300985811424755">30</xref>
</sup> and further analysis using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis has demonstrated that within these <italic>C. jejuni </italic>isolates, a single tetracycline-resistant clone (named <italic>clone SA </italic>for “sheep abortion”) has emerged as the predominant cause of ovine abortion in Iowa, South Dakota, Idaho, California, Oregon, and Nevada.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0300985811424755">30</xref>
</sup> The identification of this single clone recovered from abortions in different regions and during different lambing seasons is significant in that <italic>Campylobacter</italic> spp traditionally exhibit marked genetic and antigenic heterogeneity.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0300985811424755">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0300985811424755">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0300985811424755">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0300985811424755">35</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>The chemotactic behavior of <italic>C. jejuni</italic> has been described in response to specific chemical elements, with strong chemoattraction observed toward mucin, <sc>l</sc>-fucose, and bile.<sup>15</sup> Additionally, not only is <italic>C. jejuni </italic>drawn toward specific environmental stimuli, but these stimuli also support its growth; therefore, this response is a form of energy taxis driving the organism toward optimal conditions for growth.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0300985811424755">36</xref>
</sup> To our knowledge, the effects of the sex hormones progesterone and estradiol on the growth and chemotaxis of <italic>C. jejuni</italic> have not been described; however, significant in vitro growth enhancement in the presence of both chemicals has been reported with <italic>Campylobacter rectus</italic>,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0300985811424755">38</xref>
</sup> and no effect was noted in the presence of progesterone with <italic>Campylobacter</italic> fetus subsp <italic>venerealis</italic>.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0300985811424755">37</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>The marked virulence of clone SA has been demonstrated using oral inoculation of <italic>C. jejuni </italic>IA3902, a field isolate of clone SA, in pregnant guinea pigs, which induced abortion at a rate of 60%, whereas oral inoculation with <italic>C. jejuni</italic> NCTC 11168 or a sheep fecal isolate did not induce abortion in any inoculated animals.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0300985811424755">4</xref>
</sup> In this previous study,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0300985811424755">4</xref>
</sup> <italic>C. jejuni</italic> IA3902 was recovered from the blood, bile, feces, uterus, and placenta of aborting animals, while NCTC 11168 and the sheep fecal isolate were recovered from only the feces. This finding strongly indicates that IA3902 is highly invasive and causes systemic infection in pregnant animals. Based on immunohistochemistry, localization of <italic>C. jejuni </italic>organisms has been described primarily within subplacental trophoblasts, the lateral aspects of the subplacental/decidual junctional zone, and surrounding maternal arteries in the decidua while the main placenta was spared,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0300985811424755">4</xref>
</sup> suggesting that <italic>C. jejuni</italic> IA3902 is differentially localized in the placental unit. Despite these advances in understanding the pathogenesis of clone SA, the factors influencing its pathogenicity and differential localization in infected tissues are still unknown. The aims of this current study were fourfold: (1) to compare the growth and chemotaxis of IA3902 versus NCTC 11168 in tissue extracts from the guinea pig subplacenta and placenta, (2) to characterize the spatial distribution of putative growth-promoting factors in various regions of the guinea pig placental unit, (3) to evaluate the effects of these potential factors on the growth and chemotaxis of IA3902 and NCTC 11168 in vitro, and (4) to compare the effects of pregnant versus nonpregnant guinea pig plasma and bile on the growth and chemotaxis of both strains. These studies were undertaken in an effort to shed light on potential mechanisms that may underlay the fetoplacental tropism and spatial localization of <italic>C. jejuni </italic>IA3902 during septic abortion in guinea pigs.</p>

<title>Bacterial Strains and Growth Conditions</title>
<p>
<italic>C. jejuni </italic>IA3902 is a clinical isolate belonging to clone SA, which is commonly isolated from sheep abortions in the United States.<sup>

</sup> The isolates were grown routinely on Mueller-Hinton (MH) agar plates at 42°C under microaerobic conditions (5% O<sub>2</sub>, 10% CO<sub>2</sub>, 85% N<sub>2</sub>). Only second passages on MH agar (grown for about 20 hours; hereafter, <italic>fresh overnight culture</italic>) of frozen stock cultures were used to provide consistency for inoculation and avoid damage to the bacterial cells due to multiple laboratory passages. For inoculation, fresh cultures were adjusted to OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.1, which gives approximately 1 × 10<sup>

<sec id="section4-0300985811424755">
<title>Animals</title>
<p>Twenty female Hartley guinea pigs were obtained from a commercial source (Elm Hill Labs, Chelmsford, Massachusetts). Upon arrival, 10 of the animals were pregnant at approximately 35 days of gestation (midterm), and 10 were nonpregnant. Pregnancy was confirmed by abdominal palpation. Guinea pigs were group housed, provided wood chip bedding, fed a commercial pelleted guinea pig diet ad libitum, and allowed to acclimate for 5 days.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0300985811424755">
<title>Euthanasia and Necropsy Sampling</title>
<p>All animals were euthanized 5 days after arrival via intraperitoneal injection of sodium pentobarbital (approximately 150 mg/kg) and necropsied immediately. At necropsy, the entire uterus was removed intact using sterile surgical technique. In a laminar flow hood, the uterus was incised with a sterile surgical blade, and each placental disc (along with its associated subplacenta) was carefully removed as a unit. Each placental unit was then cut in half longitudinally and one part placed into 10% neutral buffered formalin while the other half was prepared for use in the in vitro growth and taxis assays. In preparation for these assays, careful aseptic technique was used to separate the subplacenta from the placental disc using sterile curved surgical scissors. The separated subplacenta and placental disc were placed into separate sterile specimen bags (Whirl-pak, Nasco, US) and then pooled for pairs of guinea pigs to yield a total of 5 samples for analysis. For both pregnant and nonpregnant animals, heart blood and bile were collected using sterile needles and syringes; blood samples were placed in anticoagulant tubes; and plasma was separated for analysis. Due to small sample volumes, plasma samples were also pooled for each pair of guinea pigs (5 samples total), and bile samples were pooled for groups of 2 or 3 guinea pigs (4 samples total). Placental samples taken for histopathology remained in neutral buffered formalin for 24 hours and were then embedded in paraffin and processed routinely for histochemical staining.</p>

<sec id="section6-0300985811424755">
<title>Histology and Histochemistry</title>
<p>Serial sections from each placenta were cut to 5 μm and stained with Perl’s iron stain, Alcian blue pH 2.5, and the periodic acid–Schiff (PAS) reaction, with and without diastase pretreatment. Sections were evaluated to determine the presence or absence of material with staining characteristics consistent with iron, acid mucin, and neutral mucin within the different aspects of the placental unit (placental disc, visceral yolk sac placenta, parietal yolk sac placenta, subplacenta, and decidual junctional zone). Each area of each placenta was then quantified subjectively per the amount of positive staining in a random 40× field: negative, if no staining was observed; low, if &lt; 10% of the field stained positively; moderate, if 10% to 25% of staining was observed; and abundant, if &gt; 25% of the field stained positive. Staining was also evaluated for distribution within each tissue type and classified as intracellular or extracellular and multifocal or diffuse.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0300985811424755">
<title>Lectin Histochemistry</title>
<p>Serial sections from each placenta were cut to 3 μm, placed on aminoalkylsilane-coated glass slides, and placed in a 56°C oven for 2 hours. Sections were routinely deparaffinized in xylene and rehydrated in graded alcohol and water baths. To inhibit endogenous peroxidase, sections were immersed (2 immersions, 10 minutes each) in 3% hydrogen peroxide in water. For antigen unmasking, sections were treated with Tris-EDTA (pH 9.0) in a stream bath for 20 minutes, allowed to cool to room temperature, and then rinsed 3 times in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) prior to placement in an automated cell staining system (BioGenex, US). Lectins employed consisted of commercially available biotinylated <italic>Ulex europaeus </italic>agglutinin I (UEA-I; Vector, US) and biotinylated <italic>Lotus tetragonolobus </italic>lectin (LTA; Vector) applied to sections at 20 μg/ml and incubated at 22°C for 30 minutes, followed by rinsing in a bath of PBS solution for 5 minutes. Lectin binding was visualized using a commercial kit (Vectastain Elite ABC, Vector) and chromogen (NovaRED, Vector) per the manufacturer’s instructions; the sections were then counterstained with hematoxylin and mounted routinely. Specificity of lectin binding was confirmed by preabsorbing lectins in 250mM of <sc>l</sc>-fucose prior to application to serial sections. Complete elimination of binding was observed after preabsorption with UEA-I, and completely to markedly reduced binding was observed with LTA. Negative controls were prepared from serial sections in which the lectin was omitted and the dilution buffer was applied in its place. Sections were evaluated to determine the presence or absence of binding within the different aspects of the placental unit (placental disc, visceral yolk sac placenta, parietal yolk sac placenta, subplacenta, and decidual junctional zone). Lectin binding in each area of each placenta was then quantified subjectively per the distribution and intensity of positive staining in a random 40× field: negative, if no staining was observed; low, if mild scattered cytoplasmic staining was observed; moderate, if mild to moderate cytoplasmic and multifocal apical membrane staining was observed; and abundant, if moderate to marked cytoplasmic and strong diffuse apical membrane staining was observed.</p>

<title>Growth Assays</title>
<p>Subplacental and placental tissues were placed in PBS (10% w/v), crushed aseptically using bare hands, and centrifuged at 1000 <italic>g</italic> for 5 minutes to remove large tissue fragments, and the resultant supernatants were collected for use in the growth assays. Plasma samples were heat treated at 56°C for 30 minutes before use to inactivate complement, and bile samples were used directly.

<p>Commercially available mucin (porcine gastric), <sc>l</sc>-fucose, progesterone, estradiol (Sigma, US), and iron were obtained for use as substrates in the growth assays. Progesterone and estradiol were dissolved in DMSO:PBS (1:4), while other chemicals were dissolved in PBS. Mucin was autoclaved at 121°C for 15 minutes before use, and all other chemicals were filter sterilized with a 0.45-μm filter. Each substrate was added to MEM to obtain the following solutions separately: mucin (0.1%); iron (40μM); <sc>l</sc>-fucose (0.05M) + iron (40μM); progesterone (50 ng/ml) + iron (40μM); and estradiol (50 ng/ml) + iron (40μM).

<p>Staining with Alcian blue pH 2.5 revealed moderate amounts of globular extracellular material within subplacental lacunae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0300985811424755">Fig. 1b</xref>), consistent with acid mucin. Similar material was present in moderate amounts within the junctional zone, most often along the lateral aspect and frequently surrounding the maternal arteries. There was a low level of positive staining in the apical cytoplasm of cells lining vascular channels in the placental labyrinth and along the apical membrane of the parietal yolk sac endoderm. Cells of the visceral yolk sac endoderm were characterized by diffuse, strongly positive apical cytoplasmic and membrane staining (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0300985811424755">Table 1</xref>).</p>
<p>Perl’s staining revealed low to moderate amounts of scattered intracellular and extracellular iron in the placental disc along the junction of the interlobium and the labyrinth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0300985811424755">Fig. 2</xref>) and surrounding large maternal blood lacunae. Lesser amounts of scattered intracellular and extracellular iron were noted along the basal and, less often, lateral margins of the junctional zone. No iron was noted in the subplacenta or either layers of the yolk sac in the sections evaluated (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0300985811424755">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Lectin Histochemistry</title>
<p>To characterize the spatial distribution of <sc>l</sc>-fucose within the guinea pig placental unit, lectin histochemistry was performed using 2 lectins with affinity for l-fucose-containing surface glycans (UEA-I and LTA). For both lectins tested, significant binding was observed in only the visceral yolk sac endoderm. In sections treated with UEA-I, marked diffuse apical membrane binding was present in the endodermal cells in all sections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0300985811424755">Fig. 3a</xref>) with lesser amounts of granular cytoplasmic staining noted occasionally. The underlying mesenchymal cells did not stain.

For both lectins, the membrane binding was completely inhibited following preincubation of the lectin with <sc>l</sc>-fucose solution. Neither lectin reacted with vascular endothelium in any of the sections evaluated, consistent with previous studies in guinea pigs and other rodents (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0300985811424755">Table 1</xref>).<sup>

<p>The incidence of bacterial survival was higher in nonpregnant plasma versus pregnant plasma for both strains at 24 hours; however, statistical significance was not attained in the analysis by strain due to low sample numbers associated with sample pooling. CFU counts were generally low overall at this time point and considerably lower than the estimated 0 time value of 5 × 10<sup>5</sup> CFU/ml, suggesting an antimicrobial effect of the plasma. CFU counts ranged from 0 to 2.48 × 10<sup>4</sup> CFU/ml (mean, 3.95 ± 2.69 × 10<sup>3</sup> CFU/ml) for nonpregnant plasma, and the single positive sample in pregnant plasma yielded 3.75 × 10<sup>3</sup> CFU/ml.

<p>While there are significant differences between placentation in the guinea pig and the cotyledonary epitheliochorial placentation of sheep, the immunohistochemical localization of <italic>C. jejuni </italic>within trophoblasts, leukocytes, and perivascular tissues of guinea pigs<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0300985811424755">4</xref>
</sup> is consistent with the results of another study<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0300985811424755">14</xref>
</sup> of placentas from aborting sheep infected with <italic>C. jejuni. </italic>Taken together, these findings suggest that pathogenic strains of <italic>C. jejuni</italic> are capable of infecting trophoblasts regardless of placentation type, and they provide further support for the use of pregnant guinea pigs as a method for investigating pathogenic mechanisms of <italic>Campylobacter-</italic>associated septic abortion and for the marked fetoplacental tropism observed with strain IA3902.</p>
<p>In the study reported here, the effects of whole tissue extracts from 2 separate regions of the guinea pig placenta were compared, as well as various subcomponents within each region, on the growth and chemotaxis of 2 strains of <italic>C. jejuni</italic>: IA3902 and NCTC 11168. These 2 strains were demonstrated to have markedly different abortive capacity following oral inoculation.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0300985811424755">4</xref>
</sup> Both strains responded similarly to all in vitro tests, with the exception of the 48-hour growth assay in whole tissue extracts. While both strains grew to higher numbers in the subplacental extracts at 24 hours, only IA3902 maintained this preferential growth at 48 hours, suggesting a potential difference between the 2 strains in their ability to grow within various regions of the guinea pig placenta. This is significant in that previous immunohistochemical studies have shown that IA3902 colonizes the subplacenta and junctional zone while the main placenta is spared.</p>
<p>Previously published studies on the growth and chemotaxis of <italic>Campylobacter</italic> spp provided potential target compounds to evaluate within the placenta, including mucin, <sc>l</sc>-fucose, iron, estrogen, and progesterone.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0300985811424755">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0300985811424755">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0300985811424755">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0300985811424755">38</xref>
</sup> In an attempt to further explain the fetoplacental tropism observed with IA3902, histochemical techniques were performed to localize these potential growth-promoting substances within the guinea pig placenta. Experimental studies have revealed that both swine gastric and bovine gall bladder mucin support the growth of <italic>C. jejuni</italic>.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0300985811424755">15</xref>
</sup> Accordingly, moderate to abundant amounts of acid and neutral mucin were identified within subplacental lacunae and the junctional zone, consistent with previous immunohistochemical localization of <italic>C. jejuni</italic> in tissues from aborting guinea pigs,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0300985811424755">4</xref>
</sup> while the main placenta contained only scant amounts of acid mucin. Previous studies have demonstrated that <italic>C. jejuni </italic>has the capacity to utilize iron from host sources,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0300985811424755">26</xref>
</sup> and acquisition of iron appears important in the pathogenesis of <italic>Campylobacter </italic>infection, as reduced growth of <italic>C. jejuni </italic>has been demonstrated in low-iron environments.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0300985811424755">11</xref>
</sup> In the study reported here, low to moderate amounts of scattered intracellular and extracellular iron were observed in the junctional zone and the placental disc.</p>
<p>The results of the 24-hour growth assays revealed that mucin significantly enhanced growth of both strains of <italic>C. jejuni </italic>versus controls and that for IA3902, this growth was also significantly greater than that in the presence of iron or <sc>l</sc>-fucose + iron. Additionally, growth in the presence of iron at 24 hours was significantly greater than that of controls for IA3902. Enhanced growth in the presence of iron and mucin versus MEM control was evident for both strains at the 48- and 72-hour time points. The demonstration of strongly growth-promoting substances in the same location where <italic>C. jejuni</italic> has been previously identified by immunohistochemistry suggests energy taxis as an underlying mechanism for this localization rather than simple dissemination subsequent to bacteremia, which is consistent with previous studies whereby <italic>C. jejuni </italic>underwent energy taxis toward conditions most favorable for growth.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0300985811424755">36</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>
<sc>l</sc>-fucose + iron was also strongly growth promoting for both strains tested, particularly at the 48-hour time point, where growth in <sc>l</sc>-fucose + iron was also significantly greater than that in iron-supplemented MEM alone. These results suggest that the <sc>l</sc>-fucose component of this substrate was responsible for the markedly increased growth observed at this time point. This finding is intriguing: Not only has <italic>C. jejuni </italic>been shown to utilize <sc>l</sc>-fucose as a growth substrate in a strain-specific manner, but both IA3902 and NCTC 11168 harbor the operon responsible for this utilization.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0300985811424755">24</xref>
</sup> The lectin-binding assays described in this report revealed <sc>l</sc>-fucose-compatible residues in only the visceral yolk sac placenta, a site where <italic>C. jejuni </italic>organisms have not been described by immunohistochemistry; however, the yolk sac placenta was not evaluated in these previous works, and initial organism localization in this region of the placenta cannot be definitively ruled out.</p>
<p>Bacterial survival in plasma and bile from pregnant and nonpregnant guinea pigs was compared to determine if a pregnancy-related factor present in these fluids, such as the hormones progesterone and estradiol, might enhance the growth of either strain of <italic>C. jejuni</italic>. For both strains, the incidence of bacterial survival was higher in plasma from nonpregnant versus pregnant guinea pigs at 24 hours, and neither strain showed enhanced growth in the presence of either progesterone or estradiol in the individual factor assays, suggesting that these hormones do not stimulate the growth of either bacterial strain. This is in contrast to a previous report of enhanced growth in the presence of both hormones with <italic>C. rectus</italic>
<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0300985811424755">38</xref>
</sup> and in agreement with previous findings of no growth enhancement in the presence of progesterone with <italic>C. fetus</italic> subsp <italic>venerealis</italic>.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0300985811424755">37</xref>
</sup> Both strains survived well in the presence of bile regardless of pregnancy status, again suggesting that soluble factors of pregnancy in the guinea pig and their metabolites do not directly enhance the growth of either <italic>C. jejuni </italic>IA3902 or NCTC 11168. These findings are of particular note with regard to progesterone, as pregnant guinea pigs have markedly elevated midgestational plasma progesterone levels, with a roughly 56-fold increase versus nonpregnant controls.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0300985811424755">2</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>
<italic>C. jejuni </italic>responds to its environment, undergoing chemotaxis toward a variety of specific chemical substrates<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0300985811424755">15</xref>
</sup> and ultimately toward areas that will enhance its growth.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0300985811424755">36</xref>
</sup> The potential chemotactic effects of progesterone were of interest, as guinea pigs and sheep both have increasing placental synthesis of progesterone as pregnancy advances,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0300985811424755">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0300985811424755">33</xref>
</sup> which might serve to explain the late gestational incidence of ovine campylobacteriosis and the marked tropism of this organism for the placenta; however, chemotaxis was not observed for either strain toward progesterone, pregnant plasma, or extracts from the placental disc, suggesting that neither strain responds directly to the presence of progesterone. Marked chemotaxis was observed for both strains toward <sc>l</sc>-fucose, consistent with a previous study involving 2 strains of <italic>C. jejuni.</italic>
<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0300985811424755">15</xref>
</sup> This finding is significant in that the lectin-binding assays in this report detected the presence of both UEA-I and LTA reactive residues along the apical membrane of the visceral yolk sac placenta, consistent with α-<sc>l</sc>-fucose-containing surface glycans.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0300985811424755">7</xref>
</sup> The apical surface of the visceral yolk sac epithelium is in direct contact with the endometrium as gestation progresses,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0300985811424755">19</xref>
</sup> and as the yolk sac is thought to serve in fetomaternal exchange,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0300985811424755">17</xref>
</sup> it may serve as another potential entry point for <italic>C. jejuni </italic>into the guinea pig placenta during episodes of bacteremia. At the very least, the presence of abundant <sc>l</sc>-fucose residues within the fetoplacental unit suggests that chemotaxis toward this particular chemical may play a role in the fetoplacental tropism in this species.</p>
<p>Previous chemotaxis studies involving <italic>C. jejuni </italic>have revealed chemoattraction toward several types of mucin,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0300985811424755">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0300985811424755">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0300985811424755">36</xref>
</sup> which was not confirmed in the present study using swine gastric mucin by either the saturated filter disc or hard-agar plug procedure. While chemotaxis of <italic>C. jejuni </italic>toward hog gastric mucin has been demonstrated using a hard-agar plug procedure,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0300985811424755">15</xref>
</sup> the strains tested in that study did not include either IA3902 or NCTC 11168, thereby raising the possibility of strain-related differences in chemotaxis. Additionally, 2 recent studies have raised concern about the potential for false-positive results in chemical-in-plug chemotaxis assays, as apparent chemotaxis has been observed in motility-deficient mutant strains of <italic>C. jejuni</italic>
<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0300985811424755">18</xref>
</sup> and other bacteria.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0300985811424755">21</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Gall bladder colonization and fecal shedding may be important in the maintenance of <italic>Campylobacter</italic> spp in an animal population. In previous studies, IA3902 was isolated from the bile of pregnant and nonpregnant guinea pigs, and <italic>C. jejuni</italic> was recovered from the bile of healthy sheep at slaughter.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0300985811424755">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0300985811424755">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0300985811424755">10</xref>
</sup> Interestingly, in the present study, bile, regardless of pregnancy status, was strongly chemorepellent for IA3902 and NCTC 11168, and the diameter of the zones of chemorepulsion was concentration dependent where larger diameters correlated with more concentrated bile. This is in contrast to a previously published study where diluted bovine and chicken bile was described as chemoattractive for <italic>C. jejuni </italic>strains of chicken fecal origin;<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0300985811424755">15</xref>
</sup> however, in the same study, the residual bile components after removal of the mucin fraction were strongly chemorepellent for all tested strains. Taken together, these findings suggest that the observed chemorepulsive effect of bile in the present study is due to differences in the composition (eg, mucin) of guinea pig bile relative to that of bovine or chicken origin or due to strain-specific responses of <italic>C. jejuni</italic>.</p>
<p>In summary, this study demonstrates the presence of specific elements within the guinea pig placenta that enhance growth (iron, mucin, <sc>l</sc>-fucose) and drive chemotaxis (<sc>l</sc>-fucose) of <italic>C. jejuni</italic>. Furthermore, 2 of these elements (iron, mucin) were identified within the interface between the subplacenta and the decidua, consistent with previous immunohistochemical localization of <italic>C. jejuni</italic> in these same areas in aborted tissues following inoculation with <italic>C. jejuni </italic>IA3902. These findings suggest a potential underlying mechanism for the marked placental tropism observed with this strain; however, as similar in vitro effects were observed with a known abortifacient strain (IA3902) and a reference strain (NCTC 11168) that did not induce abortion following oral inoculation,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0300985811424755">4</xref>
</sup> differences in response to particular placental or pregnancy-associated factors alone do not appear to be responsible for the differing abortifacient potential of these 2 strains. Further work is required to better elucidate mechanisms underlying the marked difference in abortive capacity observed between <italic>Campylobacter</italic> strains following oral inoculation, including intestinal invasive capacity, virulence gene expression, level of bacteremia, and evasion of the host immune response. While a guinea pig model was used in this report to identify potential host factors that may underlie the extensive fetoplacental tropism observed in vivo, additional studies are required to determine if similar factors are present in the late gestational ovine placenta, as this is the target species and the time during which the preponderance of <italic>Campylobacter</italic>-associated abortion occurs.</p>
