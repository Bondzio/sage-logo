<p>By 1980, I had already been in behavioral/developmental pediatrics for 2 years when the most common behavioral disorder in children, then called hyperkinetic reaction, emerged from the nosological primordial ooze of the <italic>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</italic> (2nd ed.; <italic>DSM-II</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1087054711425773">American Psychiatric Association [APA], 1968</xref>) as ADHD in <italic>DSM-III</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1087054711425773">APA, 1980</xref>). At that time, Michael Gordon, the author of <italic>ADHD on Trial</italic>, was just beginning his own impressive body of research on ADHD. But his mentor, Russell Barkley, along with experts like Keith Connors, Denny Cantwell, and Jim Swanson (among others), was instrumental in developing the first modern criteria for children with problems of attention, impulsivity, and hyperactivity. Virginia Douglas must also be mentioned here for her seminal work on the inattentive/nonhyperactive form of ADHD, now colloquially referred to as ADD and first included in the <italic>DSM-III</italic> as well.</p>
<p>These pioneers, who set the standards for the diagnosis in 1980, were operating in the twilight of the psychodynamic/Freudian hegemony of child psychiatry. Their goal, in part, was to define the condition behaviorally and to strongly suggest biological/neurological—as opposed to conflictual/environmental—etiologies for the disorder. None of them could have imagined the wild success their conception has had since—if “success” means the professional and public acceptance of their ideas—as measured by the number of children and adults diagnosed with ADHD and the concomitant enormous rise in the use of prescription stimulant drugs in our country.</p>
<p>Indeed, by the mid-1990s, the popularity and “gentrification” of the diagnosis led John Werry, an internationally noted child psychiatrist, also present at the birthing of ADHD in <italic>DSM-III</italic> to remark, “Those of us who helped start it (the ADD boom) look at their out-of-control American progeny with something akin to the horror of the creator of Frankenstein” (J. Werry, personal communication, September 8, 1996).</p>
<p>Russell Barkley, to his credit by the mid-1990s, had taken an unpopular stand in some circles by supporting limits on the use of the diagnosis for special services and accommodations when medical students attempted to gain disability status on the basis of ADHD for taking their medical licensing exams (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1087054711425773">Gordon, Barkley, &amp; Murphy, 1997</xref>). Michael Gordon has subsequently taken up this gauntlet, and in <italic>ADHD on Trial</italic>, he details his involvement in the specific case of <italic>Jonathan Love v. the Law School Admission Council</italic> (LSAC), which took place in 2006 and 2007.</p>
<p>Why bother limiting the conditions of a disorder? The obvious answer is that without limitations it becomes unclear what precisely one is studying or treating. But beyond the science, issues of fairness and common sense are prominent. If a test has a time limit and one can obtain extra time to take the test on the basis of a disability, it becomes unfair to the nondisabled when the person is not truly impaired or if margins between normalcy and disability are very unclear or very open-ended.</p>
<p>A broad interpretation of a disorder also trivializes the condition especially to those who have an extreme, easily recognizable case. This has already happened with ADHD to some extent. To the general public, ADHD has become more of a personality type than a true disorder. Another way of expressing the same sentiment goes as follows: If everyone has the disorder, then no one has the disorder.</p>
<p>Enter Michael Gordon as a consultant to the LSAC. Their adversary in the trial representing Mr. Love was the organization Disability Rights Advocates (DRA), which had had a string of victories expanding the rights of the disabled. In a case quite relevant to ADHD, DRA succeeded in getting the college board to remove the dreaded “asterisk,” which alerted colleges when test takers took the SAT under nonconforming conditions (especially extra time).</p>
<p>Mr. Love’s request for ADHD disability status and extra time for the LSAT in retrospect seems almost absurd, but the DRA’s readiness to represent him indicated just how far they were ready to push the definitions of the ADHD disability. Mr. Love had successfully attended and graduated elementary through high school and college, and even obtained a graduate master of business administration (MBA) degree without any accommodations or special services and without the use of any medication. He had even taken the LSAT once before without extra time and obtained average scores.</p>
<p>However, Mr. Love’s complaint was that it had taken extraordinary efforts and time on his part to achieve such success because of his ADHD. He, his mother, and a number of hired consultants, some with specific expertise in diagnosing ADHD, purportedly were able to state the history of this effort and document specific psychometric weaknesses in his current testing to justify the diagnosis.</p>
<p>Gordon, in his, at times, scathing deconstruction of Love’s history creates considerable doubt and uncertainty as to the plaintiff’s veracity and sincerity. His critical analysis of the experts’ ADHD testing is quite damning of the common neuropsychological evaluation of today. One wonders given this case and others like it, as with the old Rorschach inkblot test of yore, whether anyone ever tests as normal in an extensive neuropsychological evaluation.</p>
<p>But critical to the judge’s ultimate decision against Love and for the LSAC denial of accommodations was Gordon’s interpretation of impairment as defined by Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA). Gordon holds that ADA defined individual impairment <italic>compared with the average person</italic>—not to some individual’s possible potential or based on an obscure subtest score on a psychoeducational test. The medical students in the previous case failed to convince the judge that they were impaired even though they had not been successful in passing the medical licensing exam. The mere fact that they had managed to successfully complete medical school without any prior accommodations or interventions indicated that they were not impaired compared with the average citizen who likely could not even gain admission to a medical college.</p>
<p>Similar reasoning held the day in <italic>Love v. LSAC</italic>. Love might have had to work very hard for his achievements, but the average American might not be able to obtain an MBA or might be considered impaired without another advanced graduate degree. Gordon successfully argues that if one granted disability status because one could not achieve one’s goal, then anyone who is not by talent or temperament suited for a particular achievement, occupation, or degree might claim they had a disorder. Nonetheless, the notion that disability can be defined simply as the failure to achieve one’s potential as determined by one’s desires or by psychometric testing continues to hold sway at lower educational levels.</p>
<p>Even though judges have now ruled consistently using the impairment criteria compared-with-the-average-person standard, many college students today seek the ADHD/ disability status because they feel they cannot concentrate or complete their work <italic>only</italic> within an academic setting of their choosing. Perhaps, a college-level education has become such a standard pathway for the average American that if challenged, a judge may decide that such a struggling person is impaired. However, in my mind there remains considerable difference between the impairment associated with compulsory education up to age 16 and the impairment of older students who have the choice to attend school or choose an alternative available noneducational pathway.</p>
<p>Gordon does not address the implications of using the same criteria of impairment for college students. He is wise in that he is probably unpopular enough in the educational disability world. In <italic>ADHD on Trial</italic>, he frequently attacks Love’s history and presentation as not consistent with the combined form of ADHD. Love’s complete lack of impulsivity and hyperactivity make him an easy straw man in that regard. It would have been much more difficult if Gordon’s challenges of Love had been limited to only the symptoms of the inattentive form of ADHD. Also, there are moments in <italic>ADHD on Trial</italic> where the degree of detail and Gordon’s own personal feelings about the case border on pettiness or vindictiveness that take away from his otherwise highly professional and thoughtful arguments.</p>
<p>Even though Gordon was successful with this case in plugging the leaking dike of the ADHD flood, he acknowledges that there have been subsequent legislative efforts to change the definition of impairment to include the within-the-individual or according-to-one’s-potential standards. The renaissance of individual civil rights—which began over racial injustice during the Jim Crow years, ignited the feminist and gay rights movements of the 1970s and 1980s, and led to a legitimate opening of opportunities for the physically and developmentally disabled in the 1990s—has the potential of becoming a mockery engendering a conservative backlash. In the end, it may not be judges or legislation after all, but the flagging American economy that limits the extent of disability rights in our country. But until then, we need sensible passionate advocates and experts on disability like Michael Gordon who are willing to take unpopular stands for common sense and justice.</p>
