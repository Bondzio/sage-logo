<abstract>
<p>I investigated eight preservice teachers’ understandings about culturally responsive pedagogy as they tutored children in writing from different ethnic, socioeconomic, cultural, and linguistic backgrounds in an afterschool program at a local community center. I utilized an embedded case study and chose constant comparison, within-case analysis and cross-case analysis. I recommend effective aspects of the field experience, which facilitated preservice teachers’ development of deeper understandings about culturally responsive pedagogy: one-on-one student teacher interaction and scaffolding critical reflection.</p>

<p>Teacher educators must offer preservice teachers the guidance and resources to become highly effective and qualified teachers. This study focuses on one particular aspect of teacher preparation, the development of culturally responsive pedagogy. Culturally responsive teaching is multifaceted and complex and consists of various approaches, characteristics, and effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0042085912452155">Gay, 2010</xref>). Culturally responsive pedagogy is not the same as culturally relevant pedagogy, yet the two pedagogies interconnect and share commonalities that are necessary for teacher preparation. Therefore, I use the terms interchangeably because teacher educators must prepare teachers to create curricula that empower students socially, intellectually, emotionally, and politically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0042085912452155">Gay, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0042085912452155">Ladson-Billings, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Researchers need to determine variables and best practices related to culturally responsive pedagogy. It is necessary to look at current teaching methodology to reach culturally responsive teaching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0042085912452155">Barksdale, &amp; et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0042085912452155">Gay, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0042085912452155">Ladson-Billings, 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0042085912452155">2009</xref>). Several researchers assert field experiences foster an increase in affirmative beliefs toward students from diverse backgrounds and an improved definition of diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0042085912452155">Adams, Bondy, &amp; Kuhel, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0042085912452155">Castro, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0042085912452155">Conaway, Browning, &amp; Purdum-Cassidy, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0042085912452155">Wiggins, Follo, &amp; Eberly, 2007</xref>). However, the research fails to address specific components of field experience that nourish the development of cultural responsiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0042085912452155">Castro, 2010</xref>). This field setting afforded me with the opportunity to investigate these ideas.</p>
<p>As a teacher educator, I strive to prepare preservice teachers to become culturally responsive and to contribute further understandings to the field of education. Therefore, I examined the effective and ineffective facets of field experience that contribute to developing understandings about culturally responsive teaching. In this case study, eight preservice teachers tutored elementary age students from different racial, socioeconomic, linguistic, and cultural backgrounds than their own. I chose the term ‘developing’ to describe the preservice teachers’ changes or transformations in their understandings about culturally responsive teaching. Preservice teachers progressively transform from experiences, and their understandings do not occur in one instance or during one semester long course but gradually over time. One course does not provide an adequate amount of time for a person to cultivate an in-depth understanding of culturally responsive teaching. The terms effective and ineffective refer to whether the facet facilitated the preservice teachers changing or transforming in regards to their understandings about culturally responsive teaching.</p>

<title>Culturally Responsive Pedagogy</title>
<p>Culturally responsive teachers not only connect class lessons to home, sociocultural, and school experiences, but they create a community of learners with empathy and understanding. Culturally responsive teachers embrace an attitude to support diversity and knowledge and skills to incorporate content with culture relevant to individual students to facilitate learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0042085912452155">Irvine, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0042085912452155">Ladson-Billings, 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0042085912452155">2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0042085912452155">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0042085912452155">Gay, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0042085912452155">Mysore, Lincoln, &amp; Wavering, 2006</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0042085912452155">Ladson-Billings (1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0042085912452155">2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0042085912452155">2009</xref>) purports teachers who develop cultural competency in knowledge, awareness, and understanding experience success as teachers and facilitate low-income and minority students’ success.</p>
<p>This research explores culturally responsive pedagogy through a lens of three tenets identified with culturally relevant pedagogy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0042085912452155">Grant &amp; Ladson-Billings, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0042085912452155">Ladson-Billings, 1992</xref>). The three principles are as follows:</p>
<list id="list1-0042085912452155" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Teachers recognize conceptions of self and others.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Teachers understand the significance of social interaction and promote social engagement in the classroom.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Teachers consider the conception of knowledge.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The first belief suggests teachers consider teaching as an art by understanding and empathizing with students; teachers do not use a set script or technique to teach. Culturally relevant teachers hold high expectations and believe all students can succeed.</p>
<p>The second principle states that teachers develop connections and sustain meaningful relationships with the students. Culturally relevant teachers appreciate the value of community and social interaction within the classroom for students’ success, a community of learners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0042085912452155">Ladson-Billings, 1992</xref>). The last belief proposes teachers consider the conception of knowledge. Culturally relevant teachers connect learning to the students’ lives with enthusiasm to facilitate and scaffold development from personal schema, knowledge, and skills to more difficult and bigger ideas. Through learning communities, culturally influenced instructional techniques develop for diverse student populations, and positive teacher connections, students develop empowerment, and culturally responsive teaching is achieved.</p>
<sec id="section2-0042085912452155">
<title>Multicultural Education</title>
<p>Pertinent terms to discussions of culturally responsive teaching are multicultural issues or multicultural education, which also provides a lens for this research. The purpose and goal of multicultural education is to revolutionize schools and educational institutions to ensure all students from various ethnic, racial, and socioeconomic groups receive an equal education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0042085912452155">Banks, 2001</xref>). Multiculturalism maintains that gender, ethnic, racial, and cultural diversity should be reflected in all educational institutions across staff, administration, and students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0042085912452155">Grant &amp; Ladson-Billings, 1997</xref>). Multicultural education embraces the notions of equality, social justice, and equity. The purpose of multicultural education is to encourage equality in schools and educational institutions through the elimination of stereotypes and creation of tolerance and unity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0042085912452155">Leistyna, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Students and teachers continue to form stereotypes, misconceptions, assumptions, and negative attitudes about individuals from different ethnic, racial, socioeconomic, religious, and linguistic backgrounds from their own (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0042085912452155">Banks, 2006a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0042085912452155">Stephan &amp; Stephan, 2004</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0042085912452155">Banks (2006b)</xref> suggests interventions are essential in schools to develop positive attitudes toward diverse populations. He asserts teachers must provide equal opportunities for all students, teach prejudice reduction strategies, and promote social inclusion. Teachers not only need to understand Banks’ theory but also develop more empathy and positive attitudes toward students from different cultural backgrounds than their own.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0042085912452155">Banks (2001)</xref> identifies and describes five dimensions of multicultural education needed to achieve equity in educational institutions, which interconnects with the tenets of culturally responsive teaching: (a) content integration, (b) knowledge construction, (c) prejudice reduction, (d) equity pedagogy, and (e) empowering school culture. These dimensions evolve from simple integration to a deeper, more complex dimension of the need for social change and reform. Content integration is the use of information from diverse cultures integrated into the curriculum and the inclusion of various perspectives. Knowledge construction refers to teachers who help students understand how knowledge is impacted by race, ethnicity, and social class. Prejudice reduction helps students develop positive attitudes toward racial groups different from their own. Equity pedagogy is when teachers help diverse students experience success academically through differentiated instruction if needed. Empowering school culture provides an environment free of inequities and injustices, an environment in which all students feel empowered as agents of their learning, the ultimate goal of multicultural education. However, many teachers are ill equipped to incorporate these five dimensions of multicultural education.</p>

<title>Cultural Immersion and Field Experience</title>
<p>Cultural immersion through field experiences provides opportunities for in-service and preservice teachers to develop a better understanding of issues related to multicultural education and culturally responsive pedagogy. In these contexts, they benefit professionally, socially, and individually. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0042085912452155">Irvine (2003)</xref>, a significant factor that contributes to changes or transformations in the development of culturally responsive teachers is cultural immersion experiences. These transformations extend beyond surface level knowledge to deeper understandings that translate into their classroom environment and instruction. For instance, the teachers reflect on the diversity of their students and differentiate instruction to meet the individual’s needs versus an assimilation model in which instruction is the same for all students. Therefore, cultural immersion facilitated transformation in the effectiveness of the teachers’ instruction.</p>
<p>Participation and full immersion in field experiences with diverse populations has provided deeper connections between course material regarding culturally responsive pedagogy from the college and practical application in the classroom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0042085912452155">Fang &amp; Ashley, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0042085912452155">Morton &amp; Bennett, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0042085912452155">Sleeter, 2001</xref>). Through field experience and cultural immersion programs, preservice teachers begin to understand why students struggle and from this knowledge scaffold and individualize instruction to meet their students’ needs. Preservice teachers make personal connections to the students, adapt lessons to meet their instructional needs, and allow students to have some choice and responsibility. Field experiences benefit preservice teachers’ professional growth and enhance their learning.</p>
<p>Through the cultural immersion, individuals benefit from learning about their own cultural identity and an increased self-awareness. Preservice teachers claimed field experiences provided challenges to their own beliefs and improved their understandings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0042085912452155">Adams, Bondy, &amp; Kuhel, 2005</xref>). Culturally responsive teachers demonstrate awareness of differentness of self and others and relatedness to other people and cultures; they must know the self to teach and understand others (Howard, 2006). Culturally responsive teachers who recognize the differentness of self and others possess self-awareness. Individuals can know the self and others, and through their own awareness see connections to others. Preservice teachers who tutor students within cultural contexts acquired a heightened awareness of cultures different from their own and awareness of their own biases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0042085912452155">Barton, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0042085912452155">Boyle-Baise, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0042085912452155">Sleeter, 2001</xref>). Therefore, cultural immersion programs facilitate these deeper transformations and benefit individuals involved.</p>
<p>In-service and preservice teachers gain valuable experiences through cultural immersion programs. Through shared interactions, they increase their cultural sensitivity and awareness and develop heightened empathy toward individuals from backgrounds different than their own (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0042085912452155">Cordero &amp; Rodriguez, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0042085912452155">Nero, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0042085912452155">Robinson, Wolffe, Hunt, &amp; Hoerr, 2002</xref>). The relationships lead to emotional and personal connections and to deeper awareness of students’ needs. In addition, they demonstrate more positive attitudes toward students and the profession. However, more research is needed on the influence of specific facets of field experience on preservice teachers’ understandings about culturally responsive teaching.</p>

<title>The Necessity of Culturally Responsive Pedagogy</title>
<p>While the minority population increases in schools in the United States, without culturally responsive instruction, schools will continue to contribute to the marginalization of minority and lower socioeconomic populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0042085912452155">Kozol, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0042085912452155">Orfield, Frankenberg, &amp;, Lee 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0042085912452155">Rosenberg, 2003</xref>). The teaching population is still predominately middle class, English-speaking, and White and remains ill equipped to meet the needs of their students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0042085912452155">Boutte, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0042085912452155">Castro, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0042085912452155">Ladson-Billings, 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0042085912452155">2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0042085912452155">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0042085912452155">Sleeter, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0042085912452155">2008</xref>). Many teachers lack experiences with students from ethnic, linguistic, socioeconomic, and cultural backgrounds different than their own, yet they will instruct these students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0042085912452155">Lazar, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0042085912452155">Mysore, Lincoln, &amp; Wavering, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0042085912452155">Ukpokodu, 2003</xref>). Therefore, teachers often fail to meet the needs of students from diverse backgrounds, are not prepared to teach in lower socioeconomic areas, and fail to sustain their students’ cultural heritage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0042085912452155">Banks, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0042085912452155">Delpit, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0042085912452155">Irvine, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0042085912452155">Richards, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0042085912452155">Sleeter, 2001</xref>). These teachers often have low expectations for academic abilities, hold misconceptions, possess negative attitudes, and have unconscious preconceptions about their students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0042085912452155">Banks, 2006b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0042085912452155">Castro, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0042085912452155">Lazar, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0042085912452155">Song, 2006</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0042085912452155">The No Child Left Behind Act (2001)</xref> might be another reason diverse students’ needs are not being met because this decree has produced an environment concerned with high stakes testing and accountability that often results in a limited, prescriptive curriculum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0042085912452155">Au, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0042085912452155">Kaplan, 2004</xref>). Consequently, an academic achievement gap between these populations and white middle class students lingers and possibly could be widening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0042085912452155">Boutte, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0042085912452155">Richards, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0042085912452155">Sanchez, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>In attempt to close this academic achievement gap, teacher education programs need to better prepare teachers in their instruction and to be culturally responsive. It is essential that teacher education programs provide learning experiences in which preservice teachers achieve the understanding and knowledge necessary to teach students diverse student populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0042085912452155">Milner, 2006</xref>). Students and teachers must participate in meaningful interactions. In order to develop these meaningful interactions, teachers must share conversations about diversity in teacher education programs and experience cognitive dissonance, the psychological friction that occurs as prior knowledge does not match new knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0042085912452155">McFalls &amp; Cobb-Roberts, 2001</xref>). This dissonance provides an opportunity for teachers to challenge their prior beliefs, such as low expectations of students from cultures different than their own, and develop more positive beliefs about their students.</p>

<title>Situated Learning and Sociocultural Theory</title>
<p>Situated learning theory and sociocultural theory informed my inquiry. Situated learning and sociocultural theorists contend understanding and knowledge develops through social situations and interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0042085912452155">Lave &amp; Wenger, 1991</xref>). Noted educational theorists, from the past, believed problem solving, social interactions, and intercultural experiences provide opportunities for students to develop and learn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0042085912452155">Dewey, 1963</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0042085912452155">Vygotsky, 1978</xref>). In this investigation, four preservice teachers in two groups tutored four to six elementary students as a group in writing at the community center. I investigated eight preservice teachers in two groups as they learned through the interactions with their peers and elementary students about their writing instruction, themselves, and the elementary students. The situated learning environment places emphasis on the idea that knowledge learned is specific to the situation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0042085912452155">Anderson, Reder, &amp; Simon, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0042085912452155">Lave &amp; Wenger, 1991</xref>). The goal was to provide the situation for culturally responsive pedagogy to emerge.</p>
<p>Preservice teachers gain valuable understanding within this social context of learning through shared experience, collaboration, and problem-solving opportunities and experience better quality development in a community environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0042085912452155">Richards, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0042085912452155">Richards, Bennett, &amp; Shea, 2007</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0042085912452155">Shor (1992)</xref>, situated teaching centers on the problem-solving pedagogy and neglects a traditional curriculum by incorporating preservice teachers and elementary students’ culture. This situated teaching contributes to the development of critical thinking skills as it facilitates empowerment of the elementary students and preservice teachers. The novice preservice teachers become experts as they increase their knowledge, skills, and understandings through immersion in sociocultural situations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0042085912452155">Billet, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0042085912452155">Lave &amp; Wenger, 1991</xref>). Therefore, situated learning theory and sociocultural theory guided my inquiry as I investigated the preservice teachers in a social learning environment.</p>

<title>My Method</title>
<p>As a teacher educator, I wanted to contribute to the field on how to better prepare teachers to meet the needs of students from cultures different than their own. Therefore, I investigated the facets of field experience that influence preservice teachers’ understandings about culturally responsive pedagogy, as the preservice teachers tutored elementary students in writing at a local community center. The following questions guided the inquiry:</p>
<list id="list2-0042085912452155" list-type="simple">

<list-item><p><italic>Research Question 2</italic>: While preservice teachers tutor diverse student populations, what ineffective facets of field experience provide limited contributions to developing understandings about culturally responsive pedagogy?</p></list-item></list>
<p>To answer the research questions and gain insight into the preservice teachers’ understandings, I chose a qualitative design.</p>
<sec id="section7-0042085912452155">
<title>Qualitative Design</title>
<p>I utilized a qualitative design to examine in detail and depth sociocultural aspects of teaching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0042085912452155">Patton, 2002</xref>). I chose a case study because it was bounded by time and place with detailed data collection through multiple sources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0042085912452155">Creswell, 1998</xref>). I could not observe all aspects of the entire case (the community center, elementary students, 35 preservice teachers) and could not achieve in-depth insight into the whole case because of its vastness. In attempt to investigate the smaller part of the entire case and gain deeper insight, I chose an embedded case study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0042085912452155">Stake, 2005</xref>). For this reason, the case study only included eight preservice teachers.</p>
<sec id="section8-0042085912452155">
<title>Community Center</title>
<p>At the time of this study, I taught at a university that maintains a partnership with a nearby community center, which is where this research took place. Partnerships between the community and university offer beneficial opportunities and transformative experiences for all stakeholders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0042085912452155">Anyon &amp; Fernandez, 2007</xref>). The university instructors and professors prepare preservice and in-service teachers through field experience at the community center while they tutor the students during afterschool programs and summer camps. The community center also provides activities, programs, and services free to the area community members, which focus on cultural arts, health, education, and crime prevention.</p>
<p>The community center is located in an urban, impoverished area, and ninety percent of the children living in the area receive free and reduced lunch. The children who attend the community center are approximately 70 % African American, 20% Hispanic, and 10% White or from other racial and linguistic backgrounds. Tutoring sessions with preservice teachers occurred at this community center during this study as part of an afterschool program, and the children were elementary age, ranging from ages five to twelve.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0042085912452155">
<title>Participants and Sampling</title>
<p>Thirty-five preservice teachers were enrolled in the required elementary education methods course, entitled Teaching Writing. I utilized convenience sampling to choose eight preservice teachers because the participants were accessible and willing to participate in my study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0042085912452155">Onwuegbuzie &amp; Collins, 2007</xref>). Preservice teachers formed groups of four or five the second week, and these groups tutored four to six elementary students throughout the semester; the elementary students’ attendance of the tutoring sessions varied weekly. Two groups of four preservice teachers volunteered to participate in this study. I gave all participants pseudonyms to protect their identity.</p>
<p>The preservice teachers were all White, English-speaking, middle class, and ranged from ages 19 to 24 (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0042085912452155">Table 1</xref>). They attended a large, southeastern university, and six of the preservice teachers grew up in the same southeastern state as the university. One preservice teacher moved around as a child, but she lived a majority of her life in a Northwestern state. One preservice teacher resided in a Southwestern state her entire life and desired to return after graduation. All of these participants grew up in two-parent homes.</p>

<p>During their course work at the university, the preservice teachers had taken one diversity course. In addition, preservice teachers previously were enrolled in one or two courses in their program that contained an English Language Learner component. However, different course instructors and professors taught these courses with assorted knowledge and expertise in diversity issues.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0042085912452155">
<title>The Researcher</title>
<p>I served as a participant observer because I was “immersed in the culture under study” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0042085912452155">Patton, 2002</xref>, p. 81). I am a White, English speaking woman in my forties who grew up in a Midwest, middle class home. As an elementary teacher, I taught in Ohio, Florida, and New Mexico. In New Mexico, I taught on the Navajo Reservation, and in Ohio and Florida, I taught in urban, low-socioeconomic schools with high African American and Hispanic populations. During the time of the study, I was teaching undergraduates who were elementary education majors in a southeastern state. My courses consisted of literacy, including writing methods, supervision of interns, and creative arts. Although I was not teaching the course, the preservice teachers knew me and would sometimes seek advice when the course instructor was not available.</p>
<p>Maya (pseudonym), a colleague, was the course instructor of a writing methods course. Maya also grew up in a middle-class home in Canada and was White. She met five times with the preservice teachers for three hours prior to the initiation of the tutoring component of the class and continued to meet with the students for an hour prior to and thirty minutes after each tutoring session. The purpose of the course was to learn how to teach writing, which had a component for English language learners. Maya conducted the course at the community center to provide students the opportunities for preservice teachers to work with diverse learners. She taught this course for three years and had been a research assistant for two other professors who taught this course.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0042085912452155">
<title>Data Sources</title>
<p>Data included various course documents such preservice teachers’ reflections, which were critical task questions they answered each week (see <xref ref-type="app" rid="app3-0042085912452155">Appendix C</xref>), written field notes, and a reflexive journal that was maintained throughout the research to triangulate data and explore deeper interpretations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0042085912452155">Alvesson &amp; Sköldberg, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0042085912452155">Janesick, 1999</xref>). I also conducted three individual and two focus group interviews (see <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0042085912452155">Appendices A</xref> and <xref ref-type="app" rid="app2-0042085912452155">B</xref>). The preservice teachers checked the interview transcripts for accuracy. This type of feedback is known as member checking in which the data are checked for accuracy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0042085912452155">Creswell, 1998</xref>). Member checking allowed for feedback from the participants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0042085912452155">Stake, 1995</xref>) and provided credibility and descriptive validity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0042085912452155">Onwuegbuzie &amp; Leech, 2007</xref>). Therefore, I ensured the data represented the interviewees’ perceptions.</p>

<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>At the center, qualitative researchers are “making sense of the world but also in making sense of our relationship of the world and therefore in discovering things about ourselves even as we discover things about some phenomenon of interest” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0042085912452155">Patton, 2002</xref>, p. 432). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0042085912452155">Spradley (1979)</xref> states, “Analysis of any kind involves a way of thinking. It refers to the systematic examination of something to determine its parts, the relationship among parts, and their relationship to the whole” (p. 92). In qualitative research, themes and patterns sometimes emerge during data collection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0042085912452155">Patton, 2002</xref>). Therefore, data analysis begins as soon as the questions are created and takes place throughout the study. Through the collection and organization of data for analysis, I reflected upon the research questions and the themes and patterns I noticed and documented while in the field.</p>
<sec id="section13-0042085912452155">
<title>Constant Comparison Analysis</title>
<p>I wanted to unearth the essence of the experiences of the study, not just variables within the case, to understand the preservice teachers’ experiences as they tutored diverse populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0042085912452155">Miles &amp; Huberman, 1994</xref>). Therefore, I utilized the constant comparison methods of analysis of the data to discover the central themes and categories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0042085912452155">Strauss &amp; Corbin, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0042085912452155">Leech &amp; Onwuegbuzie, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>I had to become more than just acquainted with the data and completely familiarize myself with the data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0042085912452155">Dye, Schatz, Rosenberg, &amp; Coleman, 2000</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0042085912452155">Strauss and Corbin (1990)</xref> contend it is essential to ask questions and make comparisons throughout the process. During the initial step of constant comparison, I read the data completely a minimum of three times, which included everything: all interview transcripts, a reflexive journal, field notes, and course documents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0042085912452155">Leech &amp; Onwuegbuzie, 2007</xref>). I categorized the data into chunks beginning with interview transcripts and labeled the chunks with codes. I then checked the new chunks emerging in the reflexive journal, continuing through the rest of the data. Related chunks were labeled and sorted according to similarity with codes previously identified. I identified categories conflating codes from the data and attributed meaning to these categories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0042085912452155">Constas, 1992</xref>). Constant comparison method expands and transforms throughout the process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0042085912452155">Glaser, 1965</xref>). I identified categories throughout the progression, an iterative approach, which allowed me to revise, elaborate, or cancel as segments of data were reviewed. I read and reread the data throughout analysis, coding, and comparisons to previously identified categories. After a complete analysis with the constant comparative process, I utilized within-case analysis to further understand themes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0042085912452155">
<title>Within-Case Analysis</title>
<p>I wanted to examine and describe a single case, each preservice teacher, within a particular context; therefore, I employed a within-case display to examine themes and relationships within the context of this study that confirm and disconfirm the evidence toward changes in understandings toward culturally responsive teaching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0042085912452155">Miles &amp; Huberman, 1994</xref>). Within-case analysis provides descriptive cases to gain insight and helps to make the data more manageable with the aim of analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0042085912452155">Eisenhardt, 1989</xref>). Through analysis of the data, I realized modifications to the design and analysis might arise as new information enters the study. In this case, I documented all emergent details and provided evidence of developments and discoveries to ensure credibility and trustworthiness for each of the eight cases.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0042085912452155">
<title>Cross-Case Analysis</title>
<p>As the researcher, I wanted to examine and describe multiple cases of preservice teachers’ understandings about culturally responsive teaching. To gain deeper understanding and to enhance the possibility of these discoveries being relevant to other cases, I decided to employ a cross-case analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0042085912452155">Miles &amp; Huberman, 1994</xref>). Individuals’ experiences vary from case to case; therefore, cross-case analysis was an appropriate choice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0042085912452155">Patton, 2002</xref>). A cross-case analysis groups together responses to common questions from different participants. While looking through similarities and differences among cases, the cross-case analysis allowed me to find negative cases that enhanced the discoveries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0042085912452155">Miles &amp; Huberman, 1994</xref>). Through the utilization of the cross-case analysis, I examined the data to gain a deeper understanding and find meaning to be generalized to other cases.</p>

<sec id="section16-0042085912452155">
<title>Findings</title>
<p>After multiple readings of the data, carefully analyzing the data through coding and categorizing, I offer insights to the research questions about effective and ineffective facets of field experience for developing understandings of culturally responsive teaching. I offer direct quotes from the preservice teachers’ reflections, weekly critical task questions they answered (see <xref ref-type="app" rid="app3-0042085912452155">Appendix C</xref>), and interviews (see <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0042085912452155">Appendices A</xref> and <xref ref-type="app" rid="app2-0042085912452155">B</xref>) to reveal insight into their understandings. I also supply observational notes and entries from my reflexive journal. Although I cannot generalize to all populations, I found significant discoveries that suggest implications and practical applications for teacher education as it pertains to culturally responsive pedagogy.</p>
<sec id="section17-0042085912452155">
<title>Effective Facets of Field Experience</title>
<p>In response to the first research question, effective facets of this field experience are one-on-one student-teacher interactions and scaffolding critical reflection through questions and conversations. Maya, the instructor, offered field experiences, which provided hands-on and real life experiences to the preservice teachers in which they tutored elementary students from different backgrounds. Seven of the eight preservice teachers identified this field experience component as one of the course instructor’s influences on their understandings about culturally responsive teaching because it provided a valuable learning opportunity to work with students from different backgrounds.</p>
<p>For example, Rebecca stated, “I mean having us come here [community center]. She didn’t have to do that. I mean I have a couple of other friends who took writing, and they didn’t have any experience with kids at all.” Katherine shared how the field experience benefitted her, “I guess I’ve learned a lot about how to approach kids in a way that’s respectful towards their cultural background, um which is sometimes hard to determine.” All preservice teachers proposed similar ideas about the field experience, which helped the preservice teachers to recognize how the elementary students came from many different backgrounds. This field experience resulted in an increased awareness and valuable training to teach students from diverse backgrounds. From the data, the most valuable facet of the field experience was one-on-one student-teacher interaction.</p>
<sec id="section18-0042085912452155">
<title>How to Define Effective</title>
<p>Through the interviews, reflections, and observations, it was evident one-on-one student-teacher interactions and scaffolding critical reflection were effective facets of the field experience. Effective or ineffective facets refer to whether the preservice teachers demonstrated a significant change or transformation in their understandings about culturally responsive teaching because of a particular aspect of the course. After within case analysis, I conducted a cross-case analysis and discovered Group A made deeper connections, increased their self-awareness, and demonstrated understandings of differentness to others. Therefore, I compared Group A and Group B’s experiences.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p><italic>From my notes</italic>. After listening to the preservice teachers’(in my study) comments, I think they learned how to self-reflect more, increase their self-awareness, through the questions and the consistency of time to analyze and discuss culturally responsive teaching with their peers. In particular, Group A seemed to make greater changes than Group B. They said I was the influence, but it was not me because I never taught anything about culturally responsive pedagogy. I facilitated through the conversations and interviews.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<sec id="section19-0042085912452155">
<title>Initial understandings</title>
<p>The eight preservice teachers’ initial responses in the individual interviews and reflections demonstrated a modest understanding of culturally responsive teaching. They stated culturally responsive teachers integrate the culture of students into the academic curriculum and offered no elaboration of the definition. Preservice teachers proposed they should acknowledge the different cultural backgrounds of their students and utilize those cultures to integrate into lessons, such as through the use of multicultural literature or creative arts. For example, they thought “using books printed in both Spanish and English,” “using the students’ experiences and heritage, such as studying Black and Latino scientists or inventors,” or “read[ing] a multicultural book” illustrated culturally responsiveness. Following is an example of a preliminary response that mirrored other preserice teachers’ responses:
<disp-quote>
<p><italic>Lisa.</italic> Culturally responsive teaching involves incorporating the views of other cultures within the classroom. A teacher should also be aware of various cultures that exist in his or her classroom as well as others that live in our society. A fun activity to use with our community center group could be a multicultural fair. Students can either choose a culture that they are from or one that they are interested in. Food is a large part of any culture and if included in this activity would bring interest to it. Literature that has a theme about diversity would be good to use.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>I found these definitions of culturally responsive teaching simplistic, which entails the incorporation of their students’ cultural background into the academic content areas including holidays, food, and heritage.</p>
<p>Culturally responsive teaching is more complex than just incorporating culture such as holidays, food, and heritage. Although, this initial understanding of cultural awareness and integration correlates to one of Gloria Ladson-Billings’ tenets of culturally relevant pedagogy, the conception of knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0042085912452155">Ladson-Billings, 1992</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0042085912452155">Banks’(2001)</xref> dimension of multicultural education, content integration. The conception of knowledge and content integration are characterized as teachers link learning to the students’ lives, such as their cultural background, and utilize the connection to facilitate and scaffold their learning and knowledge to more difficult and bigger ideas. As a result, culturally relevant teachers employ students’ cultures to empower the student and provide opportunities for the student to critically analyze their learning and create meaning and understanding of the world. Preservice teachers did not share any information that suggests scaffolding learning or providing opportunities for students to critically analyze or make meaning of the world, just incorporating the culture into the curriculum.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section20-0042085912452155">
<title>Changes in understandings</title>
<p>To identify whether the field experience was effective, I examined changes in the preservice teachers’ understandings about culturally responsive teaching. Each preservice teacher shared that they developed better understandings from the field experience and the scaffolding critical reflection, which I present in the next sections. Therefore, these facets were effective for the preservice teachers. Although all preservice teachers changed in their understandings, Group A developed deeper understandings about culturally responsive pedagogy. Group A became more self-aware, noticed some of their assumptions were false, and made connections with their elementary students. I suggest the one-on-one interaction as the effective facet that impacted Group A about their understandings of culturally responsive pedagogy. Group B found getting to know students as significant but did not demonstrate connecting with their elementary students. Group B still made assumptions and their definition of culturally responsive remained the same as their initial understandings, cultural awareness and integration.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section21-0042085912452155">
<title>Group A</title>
<p>Group A demonstrated making connections with their students as a significant influence in their understandings about culturally responsive. For example, Katherine’s definition of culturally responsive teaching no longer just included cultural awareness and integration. She said,
<disp-quote>
<p>I think culturally responsive teaching is about a teacher’s ability to connect on a deeper level with each student and to have a better understanding of the student is as a person, um…not strictly based on personality, and whether they’re good at one subject or another subject. But, what makes them who they are . . .</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Rebecca also noted a change in her definition and understanding of culturally responsive teaching. She stated,
<disp-quote>
<p>. . . and it still is that you do need to connect with your students in your classroom too, but I feel like more now that even if the students aren’t of a different culture, it’s still important to be culturally responsive because it effects how they view other people in the future . . .</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Rebecca showed some understanding of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0042085912452155">Banks’ (2001)</xref> dimension of prejudice reduction. These examples of Katherine and Rebecca demonstrate how the preservice teachers in Group A increased their understanding and thought culturally responsive teaching incorporated the development of relationships, such as making personal connections with the students.</p>
<p>Group A also developed a deeper self-awareness and awareness of the differentness of others. Preservice teachers in both groups mentioned their surprise that students at-risk were well behaved or enjoyed learning, but Group A realized their assumptions were wrong.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p><italic>Kelly</italic>: When I heard that these children were “at risk,” I assumed that they would have tons of negative attitudes about teachers and that they would be hard-core anti-learning. I was extremely surprised at the soft smiles and diligent answers that the two in my group provided me with. They were extremely enthusiastic about reading and writing.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In another example, Lisa expressed, “I think I was really scared because I thought . . . because they were at-risk students; they were labeled as at-risk students. I thought, I thought they would be like really bad students.” It is quite possible that initially the preservice teachers did not believe these students were at-risk because the elementary students enjoyed learning, listened to the preservice teachers, and stayed on task. After working with the students, the preservice teachers altered some assumptions they previously held about students at-risk.</p>
<p>The preservice teachers in Group A began to notice ways in which they previously had made assumptions about others, increased their self-awareness, and how they now considered more than physical appearance as a cultural determinant. They assumed people, such as in the college of education, who looked like them (also White) held similar ideas. Katherine shared thoughts of assumptions she made about other preservice teachers in her education courses:
<disp-quote>
<p>. . . so you just can’t assume that just because the student comes in or that just because it’s . . . just because I’m Caucasian that if I have, you know, fifty percent of my class are Caucasian that they are all going to be just like me.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Rebecca then responded to Katherine’s comments that physical appearances do not determine a person’s culture:
<disp-quote>
<p>. . . I just never really thought about it like that. Is that just judging by how a person looks, or judging by what they say or how they act . . . like you have no idea what kind of background their home life is.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The preservice teachers in Group A began to recognize they assumed people who looked like them, White, were similar, whether an adult or child. However, they realized not everyone who is White practices the same religion or has the same morals and passions. The preservice teachers in Group A increased their self-awareness, awareness of different cultures, and their understanding of relationship building because of the one-on-one student-teacher interactions and the scaffolding critical reflection.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section22-0042085912452155">
<title>Group B</title>
<p>Preservice teachers’ initial definition about culturally responsive teaching remained as cultural awareness and integration. They commented that they developed better understandings through field experience and scaffolding critical reflection. However, preservice teachers in Group B still made assumptions and held misconceptions about their students and did not develop the deeper connections with their students. They focused their attention about the students on their home life, in particular family makeup and financial situations. For example, Julie suggested assumptions about the elementary students and their socioeconomic status because they were labeled students at-risk. She stated,
<disp-quote>
<p>I think they’re all like from different backgrounds especially. At first, she made it sound like they were all like underprivileged children, but then one of the girls like . . . isn’t at all. Her Mom drives a nice car; she has a nice house; she has like a great family.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Julie commented that the girl had a nice car and house, but it contradicted her initial understandings when she thought the students would be underprivileged. Julie also stated she had a great family, and it appeared Julie connected the family with a nice car and house as if only great families provide nice things for their children. The preservice teachers never had contact with any of the students’ families.</p>
<p>Christy also mentioned the family structure in their interviews. The stories this group shared about family structure suggested assumptions about nontraditionally structured families. In the first focus group interview, Christy said,
<disp-quote>
<p>Our one girl, she’s like I’m about to have a baby brother. I’m like Oh is that your first sibling? She’s liked Oh, no I have like 3 step siblings. I’m like, Oh, okay. So, like you see that’s the type, not that there’s anything wrong with that. But that automatically, you know like having a step dad or mom, you know it is a different type of family to grow up in . . .</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Christy discovered the elementary students came from homes with step relatives, which was different than her life. Christy also shared,
<disp-quote>
<p>I don’t want this to come stereotypical or discriminatory at all, but I just feel like a lot of times, the kids who go to afterschool programs are people…like their parents are working an extra job or like they’re coming from a single parent household.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>She made the assumption that parents need to send their children to afterschool programs because they are from a lower socioeconomic background or from a single parent home. Christy never spoke with the parents or knew why the parents were sending their children to the community center. These are the types of assumptions Group B continued to make because they did not develop the deeper relationships with the students through the effective facet, one-on-one student-teacher interaction.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section23-0042085912452155">
<title>One-on-One Student-Teacher Interaction</title>
<p>Preservice teachers developed understandings of the elementary students through their interaction while tutoring at the community center, which facilitated personal connections and relationships. Personal connections and relationships suggest preservice teachers valued the chance to learn more about the elementary students and to get to know the individual elementary students. In addition, preservice teachers believed personal connections to the elementary students demonstrated an aspect of culturally responsive teaching. The preservice teachers suggested talking with the students, being a good listener, and connecting with the students on a personal level contributed significantly to culturally responsive pedagogy. I noticed in observations differences in the Group A and B’s interactions with students.</p>
<sec id="section24-0042085912452155">
<title>Observations</title>
<p>I detected different significant student-teacher interactions of the preservice teachers with the elementary students as they built relationships. Four preservice teachers in Group A interacted one-on-one with students more than the other four preservice teachers. These behaviors corresponded to the responses of the preservice teachers in the interviews. From my notes I reflected, <italic>I noticed Group A (Katherine, Rebecca, Kelly, and Lisa) would sit or stand on one side of the table during the first sessions of the tutoring at the community center</italic>. Meanwhile Amy, Christy, Julie, and Sam (Group B) <italic>would huddle together while one teacher worked with the fifth graders</italic>. I noted dissimilarities; Group A <italic>interspersed among the third grade students, made eye contact, and talked with them</italic>. I recognized, <italic>As the semester progressed, all the preservice teachers began to become part of the community of learners as they built relationships with the elementary students</italic>.</p>
<p>As I observed the preservice teachers, I noticed more one-on-one tutoring experiences with Katherine, Rebecca, Kelly, and Lisa (Group A) than the other four preservice teachers in Group B. They interspersed among the elementary students and always physically positioned themselves at the same level as the elementary students. Group A (Katherine, Rebecca, Kelly, and Lisa) moved close to the students and divided into preservice teacher/student pairings. They interacted, sat with the students, asked questions about the students’ writing, and became part of the community. Katherine, Rebecca, Kelly, and Lisa emphasized the importance of conversations such as when Katherine in an interview said, “Most students want to talk about themselves and their experiences.” Group B (Amy, Christy, Julie, and Sam) observed and hovered over the elementary students. They stood and huddled with each other rather than placing themselves near the elementary students. They stood clustered together while one preservice teacher tutored the group of three to four fifth grade girls. The preservice teachers who made the attempt to interact one-on-one with the students seemed to illustrate deeper understandings of culturally responsive teaching.</p>

<title>Interviews and reflections</title>
<p>The preservice teachers developed awareness that the students were different from them. In an interview, Katherine (Group A) stated,
<disp-quote>
<p>Some of them [students at the community center] haven’t had the best experiences at home, and some of them have had wonderful experiences as well, but still different from my own. So, I’ve learned um . . . t . t . . . to understand and to acknowledge their differences and understand they’re not always going to have to understand my perspective, and I’m not always going to understand theirs. But I need to work hard on trying to understand their perspective.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Kelly also shared the significance of the one-on-one interactions and how she realized differences:
<disp-quote>
<p>I think it would better help facilitate with the kids here because each child comes in with a different perspective than what I normally see . . . so just interacting with them and working with them one on one it kind . . . it showed me something different than what my little world.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This increased awareness illustrated deeper understandings about culturally responsive teaching.</p>
<p>Seven of the eight preservice teachers discussed the significance of getting to know the elementary students through one-on-one interaction at the community center.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p><italic>Sam</italic>. And you can tell that they want to learn, and they like enjoy the fact that we’re giving them like our time to [be] here with them, even though they know that we’re in class and stuff and that’s why we’re here, but they still appreciate us being here.</p>
<p><italic>Christy</italic>. So, I just think that like getting to know them, more about them and like you know regardless . . . their background, like what they like to do, helped me with like to figure out how to teach them day-by-day</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Rebecca alleged she developed a relationship as time progressed throughout the semester. She commented,
<disp-quote>
<p>I really had no understanding of them at first because it was just kind of like a, you know, like a thrown together, like this is who you’re going to be with, and I didn’t really have any background knowledge of them. <italic>So, I think I’ve learned a lot about them, definitely in the last couple of weeks</italic>. And . . . I mean it’s more so every week because every week you hear something different or something new about them.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Preservice teachers discussed how the tutoring experience influenced their understandings to incorporate building relationships with the students. They noticed how the elementary students seemed to become more reassured as they developed relationships with each other. The preservice teachers recognized one-on-one interactions with students as an important aspect of culturally responsive teaching.</p>
<p>Although the eight preservice teachers increased their understandings about culturally responsive teaching, four preservice teachers in Group A seemed to develop deeper understandings. Group A (Katherine, Rebecca, Kelly, and Lisa) appeared to have genuine one-on-one conversations with the elementary students. Through conversations with the elementary students, the preservice teachers developed relationships and learned more about them. In an interview with Kelly, she stated, “So you really have to work hard in getting to know the kid,” and “when you sit down and you work with them a little bit, you ask them questions and find out about them.” Rebecca suggested, “You do need to connect with your students in your classroom.” Lisa believed as a teacher you should not only provide support and interest, but she thought the interest should be authentic and not bogus. Lisa said, “But you want the interest to be genuine. You can’t have fake interest.” These preservice teachers recognized how a teacher needs to make connections with their students.</p>
<p>Group B (Amy, Christy, Julie, and Sam) mentioned similar ideas of ‘getting to know the students’ and identified relationships with the elementary students as significant within culturally responsive pedagogy, but they were not able to provide specific examples related to the elementary students. They would share that all of the girls liked peace signs or talked about hippies. They rarely mentioned explicit cases of individual personal connections with the elementary students. For example, Christy stated, “I just kind of picked up” information about the elementary students’ home life as compared to engagement of conversations to find out more about the elementary students. These preservice teachers disclosed information such as “the one girl was shy,” but they never shared anything detailed about her.</p>
<p>Even though (Group B) Amy, Christy, Julie, and Sam detached themselves from the community of learners, they discussed how teachers need practice and have to consider the situations of the students. Sam stated, “I think you really just have to, as far as cultural responsive teaching goes, I think you just really have to consider what their situations are.” Julie shared, “I just think like just more practice with students and like being more aware.” These preservice teachers suggest culturally responsive teaching requires a practical skill and is not a complex, multifaceted theory with deeper meanings. In addition, preservice teachers view the students as coming from situations and not as individuals with agency. The limited one-on-one student teacher interactions restricted these four preservice teachers development of deeper understandings about culturally responsive teaching.</p>
<p>Each preservice teacher revealed that the elementary students became more comfortable and shared further information about themselves. Through more one-on-one interaction, Group A (Katherine, Rebecca, Kelly, and Lisa) formed deeper relationships with the elementary students and began to recognize how getting to know the elementary students helped form a community of learners. They discovered more specific individual information about the elementary students than Group B (Christy, Amy, Julie, and Sam). Group B still did not totally grasp the theoretical framework for culturally responsive pedagogy because they still lacked in-depth understanding in their responses during interviews and illustrated limited connections with the elementary students.</p>

<title>Scaffolding Critical Reflection: Questions and Conversations</title>
<p>An additional facet of the field experience that influenced the developing understandings of the preservice teachers was scaffolding critical reflection through questions and conversations. For the final individual interviews with the preservice teachers, I decided to inquire how I might have influenced the preservice teachers’ understandings and instruction. The rationale for this query stemmed from a reflexive journal because as a participant observer I situated myself with the participants in the context of the study and during this time noticed the preservice teachers in my groups seemed inexperienced.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p><italic>From my notes</italic>. I wonder if the preservice teachers feel inhibited, anxious, self-conscious, or nervous because I observe them every week. They do not seem confident in their teaching and only demonstrate novice understandings in their instruction. Therefore, I think their experience as a teacher or tutor has been limited. I remember during the participants’ first interview they shared experiences they had with children, but they primarily had experience as a counselor or babysitter.</p>
<p>Many preservice teachers in this course seem to trust me and value my knowledge and expertise of teaching because they come to me and seek advice when Maya is not available. They inquire about behavior management, the best way to handle a situation, or instructional techniques to meet the students’ needs. Therefore, I needed to understand if my observations or involvement of the preservice teachers limited my discoveries.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The eight preservice teachers indicated the questions I asked influenced their understandings about culturally responsive pedagogy the most. The preservice teachers noted the questions I raised provided an opportunity for them to reflect on how they might have demonstrated culturally responsive teaching in their writing instruction.</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Amy:</speaker>
<p>. . . but since I knew you like . . . you were asking about it in the interviews over and over, it made me think more about it when working with the kids then anything um writing did. You know what I mean, it made me think more about it because of your interviews then versus what I was being taught in class.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Christy:</speaker>
<p>I think that you definitely forced me to like think about things a lot deeper than I probably would have, which is a good thing. Because it . . . I literally would have come here, work with them, and then probably not like have thought in much depth about it ever again, but like having the interviews and having you ask me like you know what is culturally responsive teaching to you? And just all the questions really like made me think, oh well what is it to me? . . . And how can I implement it, like in my teaching. So, I think it’s definitely like a benefit to have like interviewed because I think that it’s . . . you know . . . led me to think a lot more about it than just having been in the classroom.</p></speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Katherine:</speaker>
<p>Wow! The questions you asked . . . the . . . cause generally I would think of it more after, obviously, after the interview. And I remember just working with kids, and like wow, I didn’t realize I was doing that. Or I should do that more . . . So definitely, um you were a big part of affecting [change] . . . and the fact that you keep . . . you’ve continued . . . it wasn’t just one group interview, then a second group interview. It was the individuals, and it was consistent throughout the whole time that really . . . made me continue to think of it.</p>
</speech>
<p>Preservice teachers noted the questions I asked offered them opportunities to critically reflect and discuss their understandings in collaborative groups and consequently impacted their understandings about culturally responsive teaching. Throughout the semester, I provided an avenue to scaffold their reflections as I asked questions about culturally responsive teaching.</p>

<title>Ineffective Facets of Field Experience</title>
<p>In response to the second research question, the ineffective facets of this field experience are lack of explicit instruction and limited student-teacher interaction. Preservice teachers neglected to identify understandings of culturally responsive teaching that Maya (pseudonym), the course instructor, demonstrated. In addition, the preservice teachers with limited student-teacher interaction displayed fewer significant changes in their understandings about culturally responsive teaching.</p>
<sec id="section28-0042085912452155">
<title>Lack of Explicit Instruction</title>
<p>Maya was not obligated to teach culturally responsive pedagogy, as it was not part of the writing methods course curriculum. The course did, however, contain an English language learner component. I noted through observations during the semester how she demonstrated culturally responsive pedagogy without explicitly teaching about it. She utilized many strategies in her instruction that illustrated culturally responsive pedagogy throughout the semester. For example, she taught the preservice teachers how to create “all about me” activities and lessons, where the elementary students could discuss their culture. She also incorporated technology in many lessons such as movies or digital stories that the students made, which allowed for diverse learners. Maya spent an entire class session on how to meet the needs of English language learners in writing, which impacted linguistic diversity. In addition, she posted reflective questions for the preservice teachers to answer specifically related to culturally responsive pedagogy such as define culture or diversity, what are your understandings of your students, or discuss your experiences at the community center. Although Maya provided how to practice aspects of culturally responsive teaching, she never explicitly discussed the definition of culturally responsive pedagogy or how to become culturally responsive.</p>
<p>Maya’s goal of the semester was to “expose new people because we may find really good teachers that can work within this environment.” Maya thought preservice teachers learn best in an authentic context and “make a connection with kids” at the community center. She thought the preservice teachers “learn to either be able to work with them [urban children]” or the preservice teachers “decide they don’t want to work with them.” Maya said, “Everyone doesn’t have to work with urban kids.” She believed she provided an experience that would help preservice teachers choose where they may teach best. Maya thought “immersion” into this field experience at the community center was the “best way of learning” how to teach students from diverse populations.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>From my notes: I observed Maya teaching for one semester prior to this study, and I have been to the community center for the past three years for other research projects as well. I now teach a course at the community center. I also agree with Maya and believe this experience provides preservice teachers with an authentic context to learn about teaching and learning and utilize exemplary strategies and approaches they have learned in class. In particular, the community center offers preservice teachers experience to work with diverse populations.</p>
<p>I conducted my research as a part of Maya’s class. I was interested and excited to investigate her class for multiple reasons. I believe strongly in the need to prepare teachers to become culturally responsive because I recognize teachers fail to meet their diverse students’ needs. I think preservice teachers benefit from field experiences to practice literacy instruction and to develop culturally responsive pedagogy because it offers opportunities to experience cognitive dissonance, where preservice teachers notice ideas different from their own.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Increased diversity along with continued predominance of White, middle-class teachers creates an urgency to broaden pedagogical knowledge of different ways of learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0042085912452155">Allen &amp; Hermann-Wilmarth, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0042085912452155">Castro, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Five out of the eight preservice teachers in their final individual and focus group interviews thought the course instructor influenced their understandings about culturally responsive teaching, while four replied, “No,” or “Not directly” (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0042085912452155">Table 2</xref>). They failed to connect Maya’s teaching to culturally responsive teaching because she did not explicitly discuss it. Amy in her last interview stated, “It was mainly about writing, not necessarily writing culturally.” Even though the preservice teachers did not think Maya influenced their understandings about culturally responsive teaching, they noticed the field experience of tutoring at the community center as an impact on their understandings. One preservice teacher thought, “just working with a very diverse group of kids and their personalities, and their cultural background and their home life,” increased her understandings. Another preservice teacher shared a similar connection: “Well, I think that’s [being at the Community center] helped a lot because before this I really didn’t have any consistency with culturally different students.” Maya chose to conduct the course at the community center, but preservice teachers did not identify this component as an influence of the instructor.</p>

<p>Most of the preservice teachers offered vagueness about how course content influenced their understanding about culturally responsive teaching. When asked directly in the focus groups whether course content influenced their understandings, two preservice teachers stated yes; two declared no; and the other four said not really, broadly, somewhat, or a little (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0042085912452155">Table 2</xref>).</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>From my notes: The preservice teachers do not think Maya provided any information or at least an in-depth discussion about diversity. I agree Maya did not teach about culturally responsive teaching, but I do believe she provided some essential information on diversity. First, Maya spent almost an entire class session on cultural diversity, but it was in the beginning of the semester at the University before the tutoring experience. In particular, that class focused on ESOL strategies for their lesson plans and instruction. I believe they failed to remember because it was so early in the semester. Cultural diversity also was mentioned throughout the semester but not necessarily emphasized. They neglected to apply their critical thinking skills.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The preservice teachers did not believe the instructor or course content influenced their understandings about culturally responsive pedagogy, but they did identify aspects of the course that influenced their understandings, such as field experience. Some of the preservice teachers might have developed even deeper understandings about culturally responsive teaching if there had been more explicit instruction and connections to the writing methods course content.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section29-0042085912452155">
<title>Limited Student-Teacher Interaction</title>
<p>Another ineffective facet of this field experience in attempt to develop culturally responsive teachers was limited student-teacher interaction. As I noted in the effective facets, preservice teachers in Group B participated in limited interaction with the elementary students: Amy, Christy, Julie, and Sam. They did not take initiative to intersperse with the elementary students as the other four preservice teachers did. From my notes, <italic>It almost appeared as if they</italic> [elementary students] <italic>were in control not the preservice teachers</italic> [Amy, Christy, Julie, and Sam], <italic>like they were just hanging out with their older buddies</italic>. Katherine, Rebecca, Kelly, and Lisa (Group A) maintained eye contact, sat or stood at the students’ physical level, and engaged in authentic conversations with the elementary students at the community center. They also offered detailed information about their elementary students, whereas Amy, Christy, Julie, and Sam (Group B) did not provide specific details about their elementary students.</p>
<p>The preservice teachers with limited one-on-one student-teacher interactions demonstrated less growth in their understandings about culturally responsive pedagogy. It might be the lack of maturity from the preservice teachers as professional teachers and adults, the limited teaching experiences, or possibly the preservice teachers enjoyed the social aspect of the experience. Therefore, their ability to critically reflect about and enact culturally responsive instruction was inhibited.</p>

<title>Conclusions and Implications</title>
<p>Cultural immersion programs facilitate deeper understandings in preservice teachers, but it is essential to create programs that also incorporate explicit instruction and scaffolding critical reflection. The student population continues to change, yet teachers still maintain deficit attitudes toward individuals who come from different cultures than their own (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0042085912452155">Hill, 2009</xref>). Teacher educators must find the best way to prepare their teachers to create meaningful curricula that develops from the culture and lives of students in their classrooms, otherwise culturally responsive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0042085912452155">Bergeron, 2008</xref>). The question then focuses on how to prepare teachers to be culturally responsive.</p>
<p>As I have mentioned, culturally responsive pedagogy and multicultural education are multifaceted and complex. This research can contribute insights, but there is not a prescription to produce a culturally responsive teacher. Otherwise that idea would contradict the theory, if everybody changed in same ways. However, I propose the one-on-one student-teacher interaction as a cultural immersion experience and scaffolding critical reflection through questions and conversations produced a greater impact on the preservice teachers’ understandings about culturally responsive teaching. Consequently, I suggest one-on-one student-teacher interaction, explicit instruction, and scaffolding critical reflection throughout preservice teachers’ coursework.</p>
<p>Field experiences offer opportunities for preservice teachers to expand their definition of diversity and to cultivate increased positive beliefs toward students from diverse backgrounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0042085912452155">Adams, Bondy, &amp; Kuhel, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0042085912452155">Castro, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0042085912452155">Conaway, Browning, &amp; Purdum-Cassidy, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0042085912452155">Wiggins, Follo, &amp; Eberly, 2007</xref>). Scholars have previously noted the significant impact of field experience on preservice teachers’ understandings about diversity but omitted specific aspects of field experience that produce more affirmative beliefs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0042085912452155">Castro, 2010</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0042085912452155">Sleeter (2001)</xref> contends field experience needs to be connected to university coursework, and additional scholars suggested university course content does not always become implemented into the field experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0042085912452155">Adams, Bondy, &amp; Kuhel, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0042085912452155">Fang &amp; Ashley, 2004</xref>). Field experience offers advantages for culturally responsive teaching, but preservice teachers cannot reach their full potential with field experience alone. Therefore, it is necessary to make direct connections from the course material to the field experience and scaffold critical reflection in attempt to achieve deeper understandings about culturally responsive teaching in preservice teachers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0042085912452155">Fang &amp; Ashley, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0042085912452155">Hedrick, McGee, &amp; Mittag, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0042085912452155">Tang, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>In attempt to connect course material to field experiences, I believe it is essential to explicitly instruct students about culturally responsive pedagogy, while immersed in a field experience. In the field experience, preservice teachers should engage in one-on-one student-teacher interactions as in this research preservice teachers gained more insight into their understandings about their diverse students and instruction. The preservice teachers in my study failed to see how the instructor provided significant aspects of culturally responsive pedagogy. Therefore, explicit instruction should be implemented throughout teacher education programs. In addition, the preservice teachers with more one-on-one student teacher interaction developed more in-depth understandings about culturally responsiveness. This phenomenon is also revealed in additional studies in which the field experience of one-on-one tutoring benefited preservice teachers as they adapted their instruction to meet the needs of students cognitively, physically, and affectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0042085912452155">Hedrick, McGee, &amp; Mittag, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0042085912452155">Morton &amp; Bennett, 2010</xref>). Teacher educators must also provide questions and conversations throughout the preservice teachers’ education to facilitate and scaffold their critical reflection.</p>
<p>Since <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0042085912452155">Dewey (1933)</xref>, it has been implied that critical reflection should be applied to teaching practices. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0042085912452155">Adams, Bondy, and Kuhel (2005)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0042085912452155">Sleeter (2001)</xref> assert preservice teachers must reflect critically about experiences with students from diverse ethnic, linguistic, and cultural backgrounds. Scaffolding critical reflection seemed to be another effective facet of the field experience in the development of culturally responsive teachers. During the final interviews, the preservice teachers in both groups claimed the questions I posed during the interviews significantly impacted their understandings about culturally responsive pedagogy. For example, Katherine shared, “The questions you asked . . . cause generally I would think of it more after, obviously, after the interview.” The preservice teachers also reported the questions promoted an extension of the conversation with their group members. For instance, Sam said after the interviews with me, “like in our group, we’d talk about what we said in the interview, and then we’re like yeah that was a good point.” The preservice teachers appeared to need explicit scaffolding to facilitate critical reflection about field experience and to apply it to their understandings about culturally responsive teaching.</p>
<p>Reflective practice plays a significant role in teaching and learning processes as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0042085912452155">Dewey (1933)</xref> emphasized the importance of integration of experiences with problem solving, reflection, and theory connected with practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0042085912452155">Harford &amp; MacRuairc, 2008</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0042085912452155">Pithers and Soden (2000)</xref> found preservice teachers demonstrated limited initiatives to critically think or reflect because they had not been taught how to think critically. However, critical thinking and reflection are necessary for teaching, in particular for culturally responsive teaching because one must possess an awareness of oneself and move beyond one’s own subjectivity to enhance students’ learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0042085912452155">Harford &amp; MacRuairic, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0042085912452155">Howard, 2003</xref>). The development of culturally responsiveness stems from various experiences as it is multidimensional and complex. Some scholars encourage critical self-reflection and analysis to further generate sociocultural consciousness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0042085912452155">Gay &amp; Kirkland, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0042085912452155">Ladson-Billings, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0042085912452155">Villegas &amp; Lucas, 2002</xref>), and additional researchers emphasize cognitive dissonance (Lea &amp; Sims, 2008; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0042085912452155">McFalls &amp; Cobb-Roberts, 2001</xref>) as a way to promote increased understandings.</p>
<p>As I analyzed the preservice teachers’ developing understandings, I believe this lack of cognitive dissonance and superficial self-reflection early in the semester contributed to their nominal growth. The preservice teachers in Group A slowly progressed because they began to notice some assumptions they made about people who had similar appearances as them. The preservice teachers then experienced cognitive dissonance (Berlak, 2008; Lea &amp; Sims, 2008; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0042085912452155">McFalls &amp; Cobb-Roberts, 2001</xref>) but still failed to recognize other assumptions they possessed about the elementary students. The preservice teachers in Group B continued to make assumptions with minimal change. These assumptions could cause the preservice teachers to focus on students’ weaknesses instead of their strengths, and therefore, not practice cultural responsiveness. Both groups mentioned how the interview questions impacted their understandings about culturally responsive teaching, but Group A with the cognitive dissonance that occurred during one-on-one student-teacher interaction and the scaffolding of the critical reflection generated deeper growth.</p>
<p>The preservice teachers also learned through collaborative discussions that originated from the interview questions I raised throughout the semester. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0042085912452155">Ladson-Billings’ (1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0042085912452155">2009)</xref> tenet, conception of knowledge, involves knowledge as shared and constructed and teachers scaffold to facilitate students’ learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0042085912452155">Villegas &amp; Lucas, 2002</xref>). This principle also mirrors sociocultural and situated learning theories as knowledge is socially constructed, shared, and recreated within a community of learners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0042085912452155">Dewey, 1963</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0042085912452155">Lave &amp; Wenger, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0042085912452155">Nasir &amp; Hand, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0042085912452155">Rogoff, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0042085912452155">Vygotsky, 1978</xref>). Preservice teachers learned not only from each other but also from the one-on-one interaction with the elementary students.</p>

<title>Recommendations for Teacher Education</title>
<p>The challenge of teacher educators is to produce effective qualified teachers to meet the needs of diverse student populations. This endeavor is not easy but complex, and teacher education programs must provide multiple experiences and knowledge for preservice teachers to become successful, culturally responsive teachers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0042085912452155">Bergeron, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0042085912452155">Milner, 2006</xref>). Multicultural education and culturally responsive pedagogy should become intertwined into curriculum throughout teacher education programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0042085912452155">Hill, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0042085912452155">Villegas &amp; Lucas, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0042085912452155">Zeichner &amp; Hoeft, 1996</xref>). Preservice teachers progressively transform from experiences, and their understandings do not occur in one instance or during one semester long course but gradually over time, as ascertained in my research. Field experience needs to also be connected to coursework along with explicit modeling of instruction about culturally responsive teaching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0042085912452155">Sleeter, 2001</xref>). Even though the preservice teachers recognized the questions I provided in the interviews facilitated self-reflection, the preservice teachers needed more in-depth conversations and discussion to increase their understandings; they needed scaffolding to assist in their critical reflection. In addition to the field experience and explicit instruction, I think college of education courses should include various strategies and interventions, such as film, to assist the preservice teachers’ developing understandings of culturally responsive pedagogies.</p>

<title>Recommendations for Future Research</title>
<p>Continued research about culturally responsive pedagogy is necessary to gain insight and understandings on how to better prepare teachers to teach students from diverse backgrounds. My study was limited with time and a small number of participants from similar backgrounds. Consequently, my discoveries could not be further generalized. Therefore, I suggest a larger number of participants with various linguistic, ethnic, racial, socioeconomic, and cultural backgrounds. I also recommend more longitudinal studies that examine preservice teachers throughout an education program (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0042085912452155">Ladson-Billings, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0042085912452155">2009</xref>) and then follow them as they begin their first years of teaching.</p>
<p>I observed these preservice teachers gradually advance in their understandings about culturally responsive teaching as they tutored in an authentic context. I attribute their increased understandings to the effective facets of the field experience during this course and research that included one-on-one student-teacher interaction and scaffolding critical reflection. These effective facets provided opportunities for these preservice teachers to develop relationships and understandings about students from different ethnic, racial, socioeconomic, linguistic, and cultural backgrounds from themselves.</p>
