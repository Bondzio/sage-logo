<p>With the increase in life expectancy, the increasing number of elderly has contributed to seven per cent of India’s population. The paper here discusses the important health issues of the elderly with some authentic data available and the possible reasons for the same.</p>
<p>Studies regarding geriatric psychiatry show that improved health care promises longevity but social and economic conditions like poverty, break-up of joint families, neglect from family members and poor health services posses a potential threat of depression which ultimately has a high risk for various chronic diseases. A cross-sectional study was conducted in Primary Health Centre Areas in Ahmednagar district of Maharashtra during 2003–05 to assess the prevalence of depression among elderly people and the factors influencing it. The Goldberg and Bridges’ scale was used to diagnose depression among 494 randomly selected study subjects who were above 60 years of age. The result was analyzed on variables like age, sex, literacy, and marital, socio-economic and working status. Overall depression among the elderly was 31.4 per cent, among those who needed assistance for daily need was 47.6 per cent and those with-out it was 29.6 per cent (P &lt; 0.05). The aged who had been neglected by family had depression as high as 48.7 per cent, as compared to those who had been cared for (19.7 per cent). Amongst the elderly, the most depressed were in the age group 60–65 years (39.9 per cent), more females (37.4 per cent) as compared to males (24.6 per cent) and among females, widows (36.6 per cent) and divorced (66.6 per cent) women were found to be at higher risk. Literate persons have better mental health condition than the illiterate, in whom depression is the highest (37.9 per cent). There is a slight controversy related to depression in working status. While this study shows that depression in working persons is 33.5 per cent and in the retired 30.6 per cent, another study by Venkoba Rao et al. claims the opposite.</p>
<p>Well, whatsoever be the reasons for depression, the study hopes India will finally wake up to the needs of the country’s elderly soon.</p>
