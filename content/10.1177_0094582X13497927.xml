<p>As Latin American countries grow more intertwined in the increasingly globalized world economy, rapid and profound changes are sweeping across the hemisphere. Formerly remote regions are now integrated with systems that are spread throughout the world but directed by a narrow group of powerful actors imposing conditions beyond the control of those most affected. A complex set of economic, social, and political shifts is reshaping the hemisphere and giving rise to new forms of resistance. At the same time, advocates for human rights and workers’ dignity are challenged by formidable new forces that require whole new strategies for survival. This issue offers 10 articles that approach these themes from various viewpoints.</p>
<p>The contributions to this issue represent English- and Spanish-language scholarship across the social sciences. They begin with assessments of structural change in the hemisphere in many countries and include theoretical discussions on social class formation and changing dynamics in the patterns of foreign investment. Empirical studies of local forms of resistance serve as cases with which contributors illuminate theoretical discussions on large questions such as consciousness, democratic empowerment, and political change. Three articles discuss the forces that determine capitalist growth in the region. Three others provide a wide view of changing neoliberal economics and the political economy of migration. An important contribution on the philosophical concepts embodied in human rights arguments places those macro forces in the context of protracted violence such as that in Colombia. One discusses the role of law in the student strikes in Puerto Rico, one the Other Campaign of the Ejército Zapatista de Liberación Nacional, and one the underresearched phenomenon of armed struggle in Mexico.</p>
<p>The article that begins this issue is a contribution from two Mexican scholars on the critical role of outsourcing in contemporary investment patterns and labor market formation. Dídimo Castillo Fernández and Adrián Sotelo V. delve into the political economy of outsourcing in Latin America. This phenomenon, whereby corporations restructure their production systems by contracting with producers in the Global South, commands the most significant change in manufacturing and provision of services. The article examines the restructuring of capital and the international division of labor in the later twentieth and early twenty-first centuries and points out that outsourcing changes the dynamics of foreign direct investment.</p>
<p>Modern subcontracting chains are integral to the bold globalism of the neoliberal model. Productive activities are transformed in an economic geography of flexibility and footloose capital, freer than ever to move about the world. Corporations shed their own workers to contract with other companies that provide the cheap labor for new systems of production and provision of services. The neoliberal adjustments imposed on debt-burdened Latin American countries have brought waves of privatization, deregulation, and lowering of trade barriers. Castillo and Sotelo examine the deregulation that deprives workers of protection and argue that it has its origin in delocalization. The result is high labor turnover, increased precariousness, transience, and fragmentation.</p>
<p>The Latin American case follows the pattern in which management retains control from the country of origin. Outsourcing in Mexico has resulted in the reversal of hard-won gains for organized workers. The maquilas are a well-established example of the expansion of production by the move of capital to the periphery. Labor recruitment is carried out through subcontracting. The consequences for workers in these sectors have been stagnant wages in the context of increases in productivity, with workers locked out of its benefits. Today the jobs move where the workers are, reversing the pattern of migration.</p>
<p>The movement of capital or even the expression of the intent to move also functions to depress labor gains in the countries of origin. Corporations give communities the stark choice of accepting deteriorating labor conditions or seeing the company move production overseas. Once it moves, there is a direct impact on the subsistence rural sector, today plagued by neglect and out-migration. Mexico, Brazil, and Chile are key in the new offshoring. The discussions of Mexico and of Brazil during the Lula years show what the growth of employment actually looks like. The impact of outsourcing on the labor market has met with a new wave of organization that is hemispheric. Ecuador is an interesting case in which new laws take a critical view of investments made in the context of outsourcing. Ecuador sees outsourcing as corporate behavior, not economic development.</p>
<p>Globalization also means financial restructuring. In the search for a new architecture of regional finance, countries like Brazil (a major proponent) have brought back the objectives and language of the era of developmentalism. This throwback to previous decades has been the implicit objective of the Banco del Sur. Antulio Rosales examines this new regional architecture with a critical eye toward its structural role. The left-leaning governments in South American countries, where democracy has advanced progressive causes and produced a broad range of populist and progressive regimes, are proposing a new developmentalism. Paradoxically, these are regional development efforts made by the countries of the South in direct response to the imposition of the neoliberal model. They have sought a realignment that would tip the balance away from the dependent links to Northern financial centers. Realignment is not the advancement of socialism, but Argentina, Venezuela, and Brazil are committing to it.</p>
<p>The bank would be the largest development lender in the hemisphere if it succeeded. Up to US$60 billion could be built on an initial fund of US$2 billion were other countries to join in. Proponents are ready to make reference to the Quito Agreement<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0094582X13497927">1</xref></sup> on poverty alleviation and environmental protection, as well as support for projects that contribute to increased regional independence from the current North-South axis, but there are paradoxes and difficulties. Argentina, Brazil, Ecuador, and Venezuela are considered in turn with respect to their positions regarding the bank. The common ground is the new developmentalism, regional investment, and even the hint of a common currency. The new architecture of finance looks askance at the free-market ideology that makes the market the allocator of resources. It reflects new thinking in the hemisphere that emerges from the assertion of a new identity. Latin America has redefined its role and objectives. While such defiance of the status quo may seem salubrious, it is also an affirmation of a new geometry of capital formation and movement. For example, the new developmentalism takes extractive industries as poles of development and repositions the state as active in the direction of economic growth. However, the emergence of linkages with extractive industries can hardly be called developmentalist; they are hallmarks of underdevelopment. The region’s new democracies are intertwined with this neo-developmentalist approach, creating the social participation that strengthens democracy but also considers new problematics. The idea of the Banco del Sur has raised, according to Rosales, three issues: the need to recover control over the region’s resources and harness them in the service of the region; the crisis of legitimacy of the international financial institutions and the need for a regional alternative; and the inability of the subregional leadership to achieve an extraordinarily visionary political objective.</p>
<p>Another face of the hemispheric response to the neoliberal model is the emergence of popular movements in support of reformist candidates. In Honduras Manuel Zelaya’s electoral victory was only later seen as part of the hemispheric resistance to the Washington Consensus. But Zelaya’s removal by a military coup harked back to the days of direct intervention by imperial powers to remove reformist governments. An underresearched aspect of that imperial intervention is addressed here in an article by Tyler Shipley that looks at the role played by Ottawa in the imposition of North American influence over the region. This article offers insight into Canadian federal politics and the Harper program for the Americas.</p>
<p>We are accustomed to seeing Canada as a benign force in hemispheric affairs. The Lester Pearson legacy (1963–1968) is the basis for the myth of peaceful and constructive influence in the region. But things have changed in very significant ways since Harper won office in 2006. Canada is a major investor in countries like Honduras. The Canadian role in the region has shifted to a more directly imperialist one, and the Honduran case serves as a pivotal case study. Shipley’s argument is bound to be controversial in Canada, but the specifics used to make the case are compelling. Capital transforms the conditions of production as it finds them. Alliances are made with local elites. This then gives imperialism a local character. Politics and geography regulate the competition between capitals that propels the system forward. The intricate systems of integration of capital with local social structures are reflected in current Canadian foreign investment in Honduras. These have reshaped Canadian foreign policy to one more subservient to Washington.</p>
<p>This is not to say that Canadian capital is subservient to U.S. capital; it is in competition with U.S. capital. Canada has its own independent capitalist class. The Honduran case for arguing that Canada plays a new imperialist role is based on the emergence of its capitalist class as relatively independent of its U.S. counterpart. Ottawa negotiated a free-trade agreement with the illegitimate Lobo regime even before it was recognized as the de facto government of Honduras by the United States. The pursuit of new trade agreements made the Tegucigalpa regime more attractive, allowing Canada to sidestep the existing regional investment coalition (Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua), and it is the mining and maquiladora sectors that have benefited. Mining has led to the poisoning of land, water, and people in the region and the garment maquilas to sweatshop conditions for precarious workers. But any resistance by social movements in Honduras can now be called “terrorism.” The policies in place since the coup are very favorable to Canadian capital. Privatization has allowed Canadian investors to buy up coastal properties to build resorts on land that had belonged to the Garifuna people of the Caribbean coast. Indeed, this is the new order imposed by an aggressive neoliberal model tailored to the needs of the most exploitative capitals.</p>
<p>In a world of footloose capital, labor often votes with its feet. Migration and remittances are now major parts of Central American economies. Faced with decades of internal warfare and more recently the military coup, the disenfranchised, often rural population joins the stream of migrants making the dangerous trek to the United States, where they become major contributors to the economies of Guatemala, El Salvador (in particular), and Honduras. Three contributions to this issue are grouped here for the unique insights that they present on the issue of migration and survival. Alisa Garni and Frank Weyher look at the profound impact of alienation on uprooted people in El Salvador. Olga Sanmiguel-Valderrama examines border enforcement in the United States and its impact on families of Mexican and Central American manual laborers, laying bare the features of the “get tough” policy that has characterized the past decade of U.S. immigration policy. Adriana Paola Palacios Luna describes the Mexican community of Tlaucingo, where women have organized to meet their food needs and challenge the forces that are reshaping class relations and the nature of the working class. Taken together, these articles provide empirical arguments that inform theoretical discussions on capitalist class relations and their fundamental aspects of alienation, separation, and proletarianization. Each describes a struggle for survival, dignity, and security.</p>
<p>Garni and Weyher argue that migration, often seen as an opting out of class struggle, is instead a dissipation of that struggle. This does not change the relation of working Salvadorans to the national elites. Remittances from Salvadorans working in the United States are captured by the elite class as a source of investment capital, given that the productive base at home has been depleted by these same elites. Class struggle changes its location but not its impacts, regardless of the regime in power. What has changed is the constitution of capital and the mode of extraction of surplus value. The immigrant diaspora is exploited by the ruling class of El Salvador in the domestication of remittance dollars. Today these remittances account for most of El Salvador’s foreign exchange, displacing agro-exports as the main source, and so the financial sector becomes key in the dollarization of the Salvadoran economy—all this in the wake of free-trade agreements that have opened the Salvadoran economy to a new wave of direct foreign investment. This is not a shift from primary to secondary economic sectors. Manufacturing has not absorbed displaced rural workers. It is a leap from agriculture to financial services. But Garni and Weyher’s focus is alienation, and this provides a timely refreshing of the Marxist concept of class formation. They challenge the idea of immigration as merely an exporting of people and a capturing of remittances and seek to provide a clearer view of the ways in which this appropriation is incorporated into a national development policy. Dollarization, liberalization, and migration work together in El Salvador and benefit the country’s elites. From this the authors predict that the agenda of the national elite will engender a new form of organization whereby Salvadorans can plot a new course toward dignity and a humane society.</p>
<p>The formation of the working class implies its social reproduction. For Salvadorans, Mexicans, and other hemispheric migrants in the United States this means a precarious life that, regardless of the time spent on the northern side of the border, is never very far from law enforcement that has come to mean a sharp increase in deportations. Olga Sanmiguel-Valderrama looks at the precarious informal and undocumented labor market in the United States as its social reproduction is threatened by the breaking up of families. She points to the policy of taking U.S.-born children from their deported parents in what is alleged to be “best for the child.” Her research identifies a new racism with regard to the language and legal status of Central American migrant parents and their U.S.-citizen children. This article is timely given the reform being implemented at the federal level in an effort to avoid breaking up families. We find in reading this piece that very few have benefited from this new directive.</p>
<p>Sanmiguel-Valderrama has looked at legal cases and interviewed migrants in order to make the case that the categorization of people by the criteria established in the immigration laws is a new form of racism. She adopts a multifaceted approach to the structure of race, gender, status, family, culture, and the economics of wages for female immigrants. Today’s migrant families face the same ideology that justified the state’s taking of children for boarding schools as experienced by native peoples in the United States, Canada, and Australia. Today foster homes take the place of boarding schools, but the “racialization” of the “alien” implies a similar mind-set.</p>
<p>New local laws go beyond federal enforcement and apply a number of exclusions to undocumented migrants. They have been challenged by the federal government as lacking a constitutional basis, but the experience of migrants in the states in question remains even harsher than elsewhere. Sanmiguel-Valderrama focuses on social reproduction, at the center of which is the family, and therefore she takes a particularly close look at the impacts of these policies on migrant children and parents. Dehumanized as “illegal” and “without transnational relations,” they are perceived by most Americans as not being entitled to protection or civil rights. Yet, as she notes, there is no legal form of migration for the manual laborers feeding that particularly large labor market. The issue for her is one of human rights. She makes a strong argument for a shift in policy in favor of the dignity and integrity of families and communities. The U.S. Congress has yet to acknowledge the need for a migrant-based manual labor market.</p>
<p>The third migration study focuses on the movement of people and the remittance economy. The strategies of the communities from which migrants travel are also affected by the neoliberal model. Paola Palacios writes about such a community, looking at social class formation and the forces that produce proletarianization. The women of the Mexican community she studies are resisting that process in their effort to maintain some control over their food sources. Palacios adopts an ethnographic approach that allows her to see the centrality of a social movement mostly directed by women. She conducted local interviews on repeated visits to learn how local resistance took shape. The organized women she studied have understood and acted in the fissures of the neoliberal model. Remittances from relatives on the U.S. side of the border have played a role in their strategies.</p>
<p>The women of Tlaucingo are resisting proletarianization and the commodification of markets that have a direct impact on their right to eat. Indeed, this is an important case of people fighting for food security with a series of strategies including seed banking to preserve local varieties of cultivars and avoid genetically modified ones. Food sovereignty, according to the 2007 World Economic Forum a right of agricultural people, implies a direct government role in instituting egalitarian exchange in the rural sector, but in fact the role of government is quite the reverse, aiding the process of capital “accumulation through dispossession.” Food security is the daily assurance that the nutritional needs of the whole family will be met and is required for the social reproduction of the community.</p>
<p>The survival strategies in Tlaucingo are not in themselves alternatives to the economic system that has created resistance. This is not a utopian view of resistance to the system; it is an instrument that can increase food security in its social and cultural components. Palacios finds that this strategy has allowed women to think beyond their relation to the region’s political and administrative bodies and apply the lessons of their resistance to other areas of struggle. For example, they have used remittances to build cement tanks to store water for the community. Housing has improved, as has education. People’s diets have improved with the raising of chickens and fish and the production of dairy products. Citing Scott’s concept of the moral economy of the peasant, Palacios provides us with a fresh view of the role of that moral economy in the broader class struggle in an era of profound proletarianization.</p>
<p>Resistance to neoliberal policy is common to the center and the periphery. One of its features is the privatization of public education, particularly higher education. From Chile to Puerto Rico, students are out on the streets to protest massive fee hikes and policies that block or cut short the aspirations of modest-income people to get a degree or achieve some level of university education. José M. Atiles-Osoria studies the very recent case of Puerto Rico, where the government’s neoliberal policies have been used to repress and criminalize the student movement. The University of Puerto Rico strike took place in the context of the structural adjustments being forced upon Puerto Rico, a reflection of the colonial status of its government and economy. Atiles-Osoria is therefore interested in the refinement of the juridical instruments designed to control resistance to the neoliberal model. The students are the most active in articulating that resistance, and certain laws brand them as terrorists. The case serves to call into question the view that Puerto Rico can address social-political conflicts through legal reform. Finally, the article looks at the role of the media both in creating a public attitude hostile to the students and accepting of repression and in facilitating their organization through cyberactivism.</p>
<p>The thread of concern for human rights that runs throughout this issue reflects a debate on what constitutes human rights that we often overlook. Critical approaches to understanding foreign policy and international relations require that we engage with notions of human rights that may be contradictory. Liberal and radical notions of rights differ in important areas such as free expression and community rights such as access to resources. Paul Chambers provides a well-informed discussion on human rights as the notion is expressed in discussions about Colombia’s civil war. For reference in this discussion, he focuses on the work of Alasdair MacIntyre, the Scottish Catholic philosopher of ethics whose work challenges the notion of impossibility in moral philosophy. If rights are to be enshrined in constitutions, then a discussion of rights must examine moral philosophy. Chambers sees the problem as one rooted in the historical reliance of liberal notions of morality, which work to dampen the debate. In the Colombian case, social science has failed to provide a space for such discussion for that very reason. Many Colombian scholars have turned to an “ethical response” to the “moral crisis” of the war. MacIntyre provides the critique of liberal ethics and its ideology that Chambers uses to argue for a less “emotive” discourse in moral philosophy. The discourse of philosophical liberalism had to be adopted by the various human rights nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) in repudiating the guerrillas’ tactics for violating the code of international human rights. They were forced to take a position embracing the liberal notion of rights in order to maintain their legitimacy. As these organizations became more professionalized and adopted language that treads lightly on the state and neutralizes an oppositional agenda, this was a necessary condition for securing international funding.</p>
<p>Chambers brings an abstract discussion of moral philosophy to the material and historical reality of Colombia under Álvaro Uribe (2002–2010) and since. Domestic and international NGOs such as Amnesty International were targeted by the Uribe attack on human rights. Colombia was seeing ideas in the 1991 Constitution rolled back. The major human rights NGOs became partial in their Western definition of rights. In moving toward a vision of human rights that does not abstract or reduce their meaning, Chambers looks to a Colombian case in which former guerrillas influenced by liberation theology and the work of Paolo Freire attempted a nonviolent form of conflict with local landed interests in the Tarso Municipal Assembly. The arc of discussion that Chambers initiates with his critique of liberal moral philosophy is completed in his exploration of a Freirean model of organization of the oppressed. Here the stark contrast in the concepts of rights can be readily appreciated. Landed interests see all assertions of community rights as an affront to individual rights. The people of Tarso empowered themselves in these discussions led by former guerrillas and learned to resist that ideological manipulation. Chambers sees this as a step away from the country’s moral crisis.</p>
<p>Resistance movements in many places in the Americas have moved from armed struggle to nonviolent strategies based on political engagement. The Ejército Zapatista de Liberación Nacional (Zapatista Army of National Liberation—EZLN) in Mexico’s state of Chiapas can be seen to have followed that trajectory. Francisco Gómez Carpinteiro looks at the strategy that emerged in 2006 in the Lacandón jungle, where the Other Campaign was launched. This was an innovative effort to provide a voice to subaltern groups. EZLN leaders traveled through the country listening to the wide diversity of social and political groups in an effort to understand their stories of oppression and exclusion. Gómez sees knowledge production as an outcome of the large-scale consultation that the Other Campaign began. This timely article provides a context for the emergence of I Am Number 132 (#Yo Soy 132) and the Justice and Dignity Campaign against the violence of the drug war. These spontaneous campaigns reflect a challenge to what is meant by citizenship. The Other Campaign contributed to the formation of a nonstate subject that is shaping a new idea of the citizen.</p>
<p>The authoritarian state in Mexico is gone, but the contemporary crisis of Mexican institutions has opened space for a reconfiguration of political power. Gómez’s research included touring with Subcomandante Marcos and having access to detailed journalistic notes, so his observations about the impact of this campaign are made from extensive participation in the consultations. The Other Campaign went beyond the national elections to foster the emergence of a new subjectivity based on daily struggles for dignity, autonomy, and survival. It brought an extremely broad cross section of Mexican society to a place where people could articulate their grievances and describe their experiences. Citizenship is institutionalized in mainstream society; the “good citizen” has no confrontation with the status quo. The Other Campaign redefined the role of citizen. The response to the campaign, from the electoral left to electoral right, was to dismiss it. The right saw instability, the left competition for the electoral campaigns. But Gómez argues that it influenced the subsequent movements of students and the marches of Javier Sicilia.</p>
<p>The terrain of struggle in Mexico is marked by very distinct regional and social intersections. Guerrero has been home to more than one significant armed form of resistance. Carlos Figueroa Ibarra and Lorena Martínez Zavala describe the various organizations that have appeared there in direct armed struggle with the Mexican state and take Guerrero’s Ejército Popular Revolucionario (Popular Revolutionary Army—EPR) in the 1990s as a case study. Their sources include many communiqués from the EPR that will be valuable to scholars in this field. Their analysis leads us to ask what it is that drives people in some regions to armed struggle and those in others to citizen mobilization. Do these different forms of resistance speak to each other? Figueroa and Martínez explain why armed struggle emerges at all in a system known throughout the hemisphere as stable and procedural. They argue that a regional crisis of hegemony is also a national crisis and it is this crisis that makes guerrilla warfare in Mexico a recurrent theme.</p>
<p>Inequality in Mexico is uneven. State hegemony is weaker in some regions than in others. In Guerrero, guerrilla movements have emerged in conflict with regional powers. But the slaughter of students by the government in 1968 spawned armed resistance that took on a national character. All of this resistance has had a Marxist-Leninist theoretical base (prolonged popular war and a vanguard theory of political power). The drug wars that have militarized the country have pushed the EPR to a more political approach that will allow it to survive this period of intense and recurrent violence. Armed struggle is not an option in the context of widespread public fatigue with the death toll of murders and kidnappings. People are seeking a different path for confronting neoliberalism and repression. The campaigns of the EZLN and López Obrador are examples of the alternatives to armed violence that they are considering. But the conditions for rebellion remain acute in Guerrero, elsewhere in Mexico, and in Latin America as a whole.</p>

<p>The presidents of Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Venezuela gathered in Quito, Ecuador, on July 12, 2004, to sign an agreement that sought to harmonize large areas of policy in order to facilitate greater Andean integration. It targeted areas such as poverty alleviation and environmental protection but also foreign policy and political unity. The major focus of the agreement was on economic integration and agricultural policy.</p>
