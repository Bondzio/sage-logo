<p>Books are invitations to conversations; too infrequently does the author have the opportunity to participate. I am truly thankful to the three commentators for reading my book with such care and sharing their reactions to it, and to Anssi Paasi for arranging this book review symposium and inviting me into the conversation. I very much like the way that Patricia Price locates herself as a participant in the project of the book, as part of an extended conversation about the politics and ethics of temporary labour migration and the narrative and methodological possibilities of intimate geographies. As much as I appreciate the generosity of the reviewers’ comments, I am most interested in the moments when they felt unconvinced by aspects of the argument, puzzled by peculiar silences or uncertain about their reactions. These are the points where we really have something to discuss! As Nicole Constable rightly notes, feminist solidarity not only admits but demands invested debate across differences of opinion, judgement and strategy.</p>
<p>Patricia Price is uncertain about whether, in a chapter that puzzles about how best to represent the testimony of migrant domestic workers, my experiment of inserting my son’s photographs into the testimony of a domestic worker (in lieu of pictures of the domestic worker’s own son) is productively disruptive or insidiously re-inscribes long-standing tendencies within western feminism. I am not sure either, but I do know that the experiment has provoked strong reactions and intense and very thoughtful discussions around the politics of representation. I am convinced that it is well worth risking failure if the result is to prompt response-able discussion. If we take performative writing seriously, it seems to me that the importance of our writing is less in what it is in itself than in what it does.</p>
<p>The reviewers rightly point to key silences in the text. The first that Nicole Constable asks about seems to be at odds with the intentions and substance of the text. She asks why I claim sole authorship when the book is so obviously the result of a long collaboration with the Philippine Women Centre of British Columbia (PWC) and incorporates previously co-authored work. It is a good question that I cannot fully answer, and it is an outcome that I certainly would not defend. My understanding until very late in the production process was that the book was co-authored. However, the press insisted that they had contracted only with me. They pointed out that the copyright page would indicate that the PWC receives half of the royalties. The PWC was extremely gracious as we debated whether and how to force the point. Nicole Constable’s question prompted me to check the copyright page; I can report that the statement about shared royalties will appear in a second printing of the book. The decolonization of knowledge production challenges all of us; it is my failure that in this instance I could not persuasively argue the case.</p>
<p>Nicole Constable also probes for specifics on how my perspective on the LCP differs from that of the PWC and how the position of the PWC deviates from Migrante BC (another Filipino-Canadian migrant activist organization based in Vancouver). Her question is propelled by her deep and extensive knowledge of migrant domestic workers in Hong Kong and other parts of Asia; from these locations Canada looks like a dream destination because of the possibility it offers to domestic workers for (eventual) permanent immigration. Despite the problems associated with the LCP, is it reckless to advocate its end? Why do I pose the difficulty of deciding this issue as a political challenge without being entirely explicit about where I stand or clearly delineating the issues that divide activist organizations? (The PWC advocates scrapping of the program and Migrante supports extensive reform.) In part, my reticence to parse the disagreements between PWC and Migrante BC in print reflects a concern not to solidify their apparent differences and my deep desire that our research occasions productive conversations between these groups. To my knowledge, they (and we) agree on many fundamentals: for example, that the live-in requirement be removed; that domestic workers be allowed to bring their families; that Filipino skilled migrants such as trained nurses be admitted as permanent immigrants under their proper job classification as they were in the 1970s (rather than first deskilled as domestic workers); and that LCP temporary visas be tied to occupation rather than employer (easing the transition from one employer to another and allowing migrants to complete the required time in the program as quickly as possible). If these reforms were made, the LCP would in effect no longer exist; to my mind (and here I am not speaking for the PWC or Migrante BC) the distinction between scrapping and fundamental reform is to some extent a matter of rhetoric.</p>
<p>The task of radical reform is formidable, and strategizing has to be specific and nimble because each reform invites new forms of exploitation. In Quebec, for instance, where there developed a tendency to turn a blind eye to the live-in requirement, agents began to warehouse domestic workers in appalling housing conditions. Limiting the program to single and childless women, as Nicole Constable seems to be suggesting, is not an attractive option: it is discriminatory and the likely outcome is that married women will misrepresent their marital status with the hopes that they can later rectify their marital designation and sponsor their families – an unlikely prospect. My book is an invitation to have these kinds of complicated and contextualized discussions about policy; dispelling the illusion that the LCP is a model program is just a first step. In the spring of 2012, Denise Spitzer and Sara Torres of the University of Ottawa initiated a Canada-wide consultation among academics and NGOs working on this issue to review options to replace or revamp the LCP. The research that informs <italic>Families Apart</italic> is just one part of this larger discussion, ever more pressing with the extraordinary expansion of temporary labour programs.</p>
<p>But the options certainly do look different from the perspective of the Philippines, and Nicole Constable is right to insist on this. Kim England also asks for more from this location, arguing that this would provide more ‘connective tissue’ between the discussion of Filipino migrants in Canada and the penultimate chapter on state violence in the Philippines. Reflecting a desire to better understand the issue from this location, we are currently in the process of taking our testimonial play to Manila to generate different political discussions there. More to come.</p>
