<abstract>
<p>Experimental studies showing that servers’ nonverbal behaviors are associated with variation in customers’ tipping have not tested the effect of interpersonal distance between the server and the customer. Five waitresses in three restaurants were asked to stand erect at varying distances from patrons, who were alone at their table, when taking orders. Short interpersonal distance was associated with both a greater frequency in tipping and an increased amount of money given. The results highlight the importance of proxemic behavior and the role of social interaction between customers and restaurant employees.</p>

<p>In many countries, whether in bars or in restaurants, servers’ wages are low and most of their income derives from tips (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1096348010388660">Lynn &amp; Lynn, 2004</xref>). Therefore, for these servers and for the managers, knowledge about the factors that affect customer tipping becomes important. Tips are supposed to be an incentive/reward for good service and to be related to consumers’ evaluations of service and the dining experience, but research found that these relationships are weak (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1096348010388660">Lynn &amp; Graves, 1996</xref>). Social psychologists have identified numerous factors not related with service quality that increase servers’ tips. Previous research has shown that servers earn larger tips when they</p>

<p>These experimental studies clearly show that servers are able to influence customer tipping behavior by varying their own verbal and nonverbal behaviors.</p>
<p>One nonverbal aspect that is yet to be tested in this context is interpersonal distance between the server and the customer when taking orders. Some researchers have reported specific proxemic effects on compliance with a request. Passersby in the street agree more favorably with a request for change when physical distance is less (2 ft) than when the distance is larger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1096348010388660">Ernest &amp; Cooper, 1974</xref>). Group membership and interpersonal distance also affect compliance with a small request, as shown in a field experiment by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1096348010388660">Glick, Demorest, and Hotze (1988)</xref>. People seated alone in public areas were approached by one of two female confederates: an in-group member or an out-group member. Three different interpersonal distances were assumed by the confederates: near, medium, and far. It was found that the out-group confederate obtains less compliance than the in-group confederate in near and medium interpersonal distances but not in the far-distance condition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1096348010388660">Glick et al., 1988</xref>). The authors suggested that out-group members educe greater interpersonal anxiety with small interpersonal distances, which, in turn, elicits less compliance. With greater distance, anxiety is reduced and leads participants to comply more favorably with the out-group confederate.</p>
<p>These studies suggest that close distance is an important factor facilitating compliance, but the methods used limit the appreciation of the role social distance plays in engendering helping behavior. Experimentation with social distances has either been combined with eye contact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1096348010388660">Ernest &amp; Cooper, 1974</xref>), which in itself is a factor that influences helping behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1096348010388660">Kleinke, 1977</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1096348010388660">1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1096348010388660">Valentine, 1980</xref>), or has tested only verbal solicitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1096348010388660">Glick et al., 1988</xref>). As is the case with tipping, helping requests are not necessarily solicited verbally and some of them are implicit, requiring that participants help someone else without any explicit demand. The objective of our study was to test the effect of interpersonal distance on tipping. According to previous studies, we hypothesized that short distance between servers and patrons would enhance customer tipping.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section2-1096348010388660">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>A total of 478 restaurant customers (287 males and 191 females) acted as participants and were randomly assigned to three groups. All were seated alone at a table in one of three restaurants located in one of two medium-sized cities (both with about 75,000 inhabitants) in an attractive spot in France. The restaurants proposed a menu composed mainly of seafood.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1096348010388660">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>Five regularly employed, certified, and naive waitresses were trained by the experimenter to act similarly under experimental conditions, where the physical distance between themselves and their customers was varied. On arrival, a patron was selected by the waitress and invited to sit down. Once the customer was seated, the employee said, “I am coming back with the menu. Would you like a drink before eating?” The waitress waited for the customer’s response before leaving the table. About 1 to 3 minutes later, the waitress returned with the menu in hand, saying “Here is the menu Sir/Madam. I’ll give you some time for your choice. I will be back in a few minutes.” After five minutes, the waitress returned to take the customer’s order. According to a random distribution, the waitress was instructed to stand erect at a distance of 0.75, 0.45, or 0.15 m (ca. 0.5, 1.5, or 2.5 ft) from customers, when taking the order. In France, servers are formally trained to respect an appropriate distance of 0.4 m ± 0.1 m (ca. 1.5 ft) when taking orders from customers. This distance was used by the waitresses during the initial exchange or when they returned to clear the table. They were instructed to vary their proximity to the customer only when taking the food order. Given this convention, we used the distance of 0.45 m (1.5 ft) as the control distance for our study. The waitresses recorded in a notebook how the customers behaved, namely, whether or not they left a tip (Dependent Variable 1 or DV1) and the amount of money that was given (Dependent Variable 2 or DV2).</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>In France, tipping is not expected because French legislation stipulates that a 12% service charge be included in the prices listed on a menu. Thus, in our experiment, the number of patrons who left a tip was defined as the first dependent variable and the amount of the tip left was defined as the second dependent variable. No differences were observed between waitresses with respect to tipping, χ<sup>2</sup>(4, <italic>N</italic> = 478) = 7.26, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .10, or when examining the amount of money left by tippers, <italic>F</italic>(4, 144) = 3.63, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .15. Similarly, there was no difference between the three restaurants: χ<sup>2</sup>(2, <italic>N</italic> = 478) = 5.12, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .10, for tipping; and <italic>F</italic>(2, 145) = 2.24, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .20, for amount of tips. Thus, data were combined across restaurants and waitresses.</p>
<p>A log-linear analysis of tipping frequency using a multiway frequency table with a 2 (customer gender) × 3 (experimental condition) × 2 (compliance) design was performed using the data from the number of customers who left tips. This method enables us to test the different factors in our cross-tabulation (gender, proxemic distance) and their interactions for statistical significance. A significant interaction effect between experimental conditions and customer behavior was observed, χ<sup>2</sup>(2, <italic>N</italic> = 478) = 14.83, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, <italic>r</italic> = .17. Additional analysis revealed (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1096348010388660">Table 1</xref>) that the 0.15-m distance condition was associated with greater tipping than the 0.45-m condition, 42.9% versus 31.1%; χ<sup>2</sup>(1, <italic>N</italic> = 312) = 4.59, <italic>p</italic> = .03, <italic>r</italic> = .12, and the 0.75-m condition, 42.9% versus 22.8%; χ<sup>2</sup>(1, <italic>N</italic> = 319) = 14.55, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, <italic>r</italic> = .21, whereas 0.45- and 0.75-m conditions were not significantly different: 31.1% versus 22.8%; χ<sup>2</sup>(1, <italic>N</italic> = 309) = 2.73, <italic>p</italic> = .10, <italic>r</italic> = .09. Furthermore, an effect of experimental condition was found with male, χ<sup>2</sup>(1, <italic>N</italic> = 287) = 6.56, <italic>p</italic> = .04, <italic>r</italic> = .15, and with female, χ<sup>2</sup>(1, <italic>N</italic> = 191) = 10.82, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .005, <italic>r</italic> = .23, patrons.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our findings show that a short distance between waitresses and patrons was associated with greater tipping. Although the magnitude of this effect was modest, we found that men and women patrons gave tips more favorably to a waitress when she stood erect at a short distance from the patron while taking orders. These results substantiate the effect of close distance on helping behavior previously described in other contexts <bold>(</bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1096348010388660">Ernest &amp; Cooper, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1096348010388660">Glick et al., 1988</xref>) and confirm that the effect can be generalized to tipping. Our results also suggest that restaurant servers could have an important effect on customer behavior. Of course, good service is usually expected in a reputable restaurant and often rewarded with a gratuity, but our data show that specific social interaction between a customer and an employee can also be important in influencing customers’ propensity for tipping.</p>
<p>How can we explain this positive effect of short distance between waitresses and their customers on tipping behavior? Congruent with the social impact theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1096348010388660">Latané, 1981</xref>), normative pressures or influence coming from the server are conceivably dissipated and become weaker with increased physical distance between the waitress and her customer. It is also possible that short physical distance leads diners to perceive that the waitress has a greater need for assistance, which, in turn, leads them to give more frequently or more generously. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1096348010388660">Baron and Bell (1976)</xref> found that close distance between a confederate who requested help from a participant is associated with a higher rating, made subsequently, of the need for assistance. By manipulating the distance between two chairs (2, 4, 6, and 8 ft) where a confederate and a participant were seated, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1096348010388660">Patterson and Sechrest (1970)</xref> found that the confederate is perceived as more friendly when the physical distance is short. Although these studies suggest that an improved perception of the waitresses’ friendliness or their perceived needs could affect higher tipping frequencies, such explanations remain speculative in our case because we did not test explicitly for these factors in our experiment. Future studies will need to examine the effects of these and other possible factors on the relationship between physical distance and compliance in a service context.</p>
<p>Our findings have clear practical interest for restaurant managers. Of the 14 identified ways for servers to increase their tips (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1096348010388660">Lynn, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1096348010388660">Lynn &amp; McCall, 2009</xref>), only 3 are related to nonverbal behavior displayed by the server, namely, touching customers briefly on the arm or shoulder; wearing big, open-mouthed smiles; and squatting down next to the table when introducing themselves. Our results suggest that there is a fourth, nonverbal behavior to be associated with increased tipping. We found that the average rate of tipping was higher when the physical distance between the servers and the patrons was short. Therefore, by reducing the distance at which they place themselves when taking customers’ orders, servers can effectively influence their customers’ behavior and increase the tips they receive. The systematic use of this technique could therefore potentially increase employee income. Managers, then, should encourage these methods by giving permission for servers to experiment with these and other innovative methods. By doing so, they may also create an improved working atmosphere with increased performance and a greater state of fulfillment for their employees, with the work becoming far more interesting owing to better earnings. Furthermore, exploiting these methods would likely generate increased contentment and satisfaction for the customers, which encourages them to praise and, ultimately, to return to the restaurant. In France, in particular, a short distance is unusual, even uncomfortable, for servers, because their training stipulates that the appropriate distance should be about a foot and a half. Our results clearly show that this typical distance is not the best for increasing tips. Restaurant managers, in France especially, will have to resolve this ambiguity between training specifications and data from a real-life setting.</p>
<p>Of course, this experiment has limitations: We included only women as confederates, and the experiment was conducted in only three different restaurants. Thus, examining whether our findings hold true for male employees would be a natural next step for further research. In addition, only lone diners were tested in this experiment, and the generalization to group diners is yet to be evaluated, especially when examining the behavior of married couples. In such circumstances, standing close to the husband could have adverse effects on customer tipping behavior. Further studies that examine the combined effects of employee gender, diner gender, and diner group size will no doubt help clarify the importance of proxemic behavior and elucidate the role of social interaction between customers and restaurant employees.</p>
