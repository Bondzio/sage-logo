<p>This paper reviews two main strategies for dealing with the threat posed by radically enactive/embodied cognition to traditional cognitive science. Both strategies invoke action oriented representations (AORs). They differ in emphasizing different features of AORs in their attempt to answer the REC threat – focusing on their contents and vehicles, respectively. The first two sections review the central motivations and rationales driving the ‘content’ and ‘format’ strategies in turn and raise initial concerns about the tenability of each. With respect to the ‘content’ strategy, these worries ought to make us suspicious about the explanatory value of positing AORs. Although the ‘format’ strategy has a way of answering this concern, it raises a more fundamental worry about the motivation for even believing in AORs in the first place. Although these worries cast doubt on the feasibility of invoking AORs as a means of dealing with the REC threat, they do not constitute conclusive reasons for eliminating AORs altogether. There are other, stronger reasons for supposing that we should. The third section provides a sketch of a master argument, developed elsewhere, which makes that case in full dress fashion. The final section – ‘Resurrection?’ – considers and rejects the possibility that AORs might be resurrected, even if it is agreed that the master argument cited in the third section succeeds.</p>

<title>1 Introduction: the REC threat</title>
<p>The news is that ‘embodied cognition is sweeping the planet’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1059712313482684">Adams, 2010</xref>, p. 619). It is now recognized that ‘Embodied cognitive science has become an industry’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1059712313482684">Alsmith &amp; de Vignemont, 2012</xref>, p. 1). Even those who most regret the growing popularity of embodied or enactive cognition (hereafter EC) are prepared to admit this.</p>
<p>Radicals insist that EC requires nothing short of a root and branch reform of our thinking about the nature of basic minds. They contend that basic minds do not represent conditions that the world might be in. To think otherwise, as many do, is to ascribe features and characteristics to basic minds that belong only to enculturated, scaffolded minds that are built atop them.</p>
<p>This assessment is in tune with the ambition of the original version of EC. It was offered as an antidote to those approaches to mind that ‘take representation as their central notion’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1059712313482684">Varela, Thompson, &amp; Rosch, 1991</xref>, p. 172). Pressing for revolutionary reform, defenders of the most radical variants of EC – hereafter REC – argue that the most basic kinds of activity do not depend upon individuals retrieving informational content from the world – content that is then processed and manipulated – in order to attribute properties to the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1059712313482684">Hutto, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1059712313482684">Hutto &amp; Myin, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1059712313482684">Ramsey, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1059712313482684">Thompson, 2007</xref>). As a result, REC denies that fundamental forms of cognition, which include some of its most interesting varieties, require individuals to construct representations of their worlds.</p>
<p>Proponents of REC argue that the standard characterizations of cognition and cognitive processes, in terms of representation and computation, are misguided. Representation and computation do not lie at the heart of all cognition and do not form its basis. Basic cognition – at least – is not content involving.</p>
<p>Dynamic interaction, exploration and engagement with the environment, as opposed to forming passive representations of that environment looks best placed to explain a wide range of findings relating to active perception and sensory substitution. It has led to impressive successes in artificial intelligence stemming from the creation of behaviour-based robots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1059712313482684">Beer, 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1059712313482684">2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1059712313482684">Brooks, 1991a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1059712313482684">1991b</xref>). Citing these sorts of developments it has been noted by the opposition that fans of REC ‘claim that embodiment-related empirical results support sweeping, negative conclusions: that there are no amodal symbols; that there are no arbitrary symbols; that functionalism is false; that computationalism is false; and more’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1059712313482684">Rupert, 2011</xref>, p. 99).</p>
<p>REC has long been thought to pose a serious threat to business-as-usual cognitive science (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1059712313482684">Mandik, 2005</xref>, p. 290). Nor has the threat diminished over time. Quite the opposite: more and more phenomena now <italic>seem to</italic> call out for EC treatment and explanation. Even traditional opponents of EC now acknowledge that it is widespread if not ubiquitous – that ‘there is substantial evidence in support of the pervasive occurrence of embodied cognition’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1059712313482684">Goldman, 2012</xref>, p. 80).</p>
<p>Taking embodied cognition seriously now seems unavoidable, but many still seek to resist REC’s revolutionary claims. This has led to the latter’s being negatively compared with communism; its spectre is said to haunt ‘the laboratories of cognitive science’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1059712313482684">Goldman and de Vignemont, 2009</xref>, p. 154). It is not so much the Red Threat that we need fear but the REC threat.</p>
<p>Many in the cognitive science community are convinced that the REC threat can be dealt with fairly easily and that ‘a rather minor revision of the representational theory will suffice to ward off the threat’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1059712313482684">Mandik, 2005</xref>, p. 290). Others hold that dealing with REC will require more substantial revisions to current thinking but they hold, nevertheless, that any such revisions will fall short of a wholesale revolutionary rethink. There are two main strategies for dealing with REC:</p>
<list id="list1-1059712313482684" list-type="alpha-upper">
<list-item><p>Reject and defeat REC and EC outright – by positing representations with special kinds of contents.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Embrace and tame a moderate EC, while rejecting REC outright – by positing representations with special kinds of formats or vehicles.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Both of these strategies invoke Action Oriented Representations (AORs) to do their dirty work. AORs are unlike ordinary, detached representations in that they are specially geared to drive specific sorts of actions. AORs are assumed states or processes, local or distributed, whose functional role is to indicate the presence of, and sometimes to ‘stand in’ for, states of affairs in order to guide and drive certain kinds of action.</p>
<p>Strategies A and B differ in emphasizing different features of AORs in their attempt to answer the REC threat – focusing on their contents and vehicles, respectively. The first two sections review the central motivations and rationales driving the ‘content’ and ‘format’ strategies in turn and raise initial concerns about the tenability of each. With respect to the ‘content’ strategy, these worries ought to make us suspicious about the explanatory value of positing AORs. Although the ‘format’ strategy has a way of answering this concern, it raises a more fundamental worry about the motivation for even believing in AORs in the first place. Although these worries cast doubt on the feasibility of invoking AORs as a means of dealing with the REC threat, they do not constitute conclusive reasons for eliminating AORs altogether. There are other, stronger reasons for supposing that we should. The third section provides a sketch of a master argument, developed elsewhere, which makes that case in full dress fashion. The final section – ‘Resurrection?’ – considers and rejects the possibility that AORs might be resurrected, even if it is agreed that the master argument cited in the third section succeeds.</p>

<sec id="section2-1059712313482684">
<title>2 Dealing with the REC threat – the ‘content’ strategy</title>
<p>Sometimes belief in representationalism is sponsored and made compelling by certain, deeply rooted philosophical assumptions. For example, when <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1059712313482684">Nanay (2013)</xref> argues for the existence of AORs, which he calls pragmatic representations, he makes a familiar move. He insists that contentful representations are what make actions actions. The existence of contentful mental states as the immediate cause of an action is, he holds, what distinguishes an action as an action, as opposed to, say, a mere bodily movement, such as a reflex. More precisely, it is the representational component of such states of mind, in particular, that must be present in the immediate mental antecedents of basic actions if they are to be actions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1059712313482684">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Accordingly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1059712313482684">Nanay (2013)</xref> assures from the armchair, that it is true ‘by definition’ that pragmatic representations are required if there are to be goal-directed actions. Pragmatic representations have content in that they represent the world as being in a certain way – and their content is what is thought to guide agents in the performance of actions. Considerations of this sort aim to justify the idea that representational content of some kind <italic>must</italic> lie behind any intelligent activity. There can be no action without representational content.</p>
<p>When transferred to cognitive science, this philosophical credo usually inspires explanatory proposals in which motor commands, intentions or plans – contentful instructions – are claimed to enable successful engagement with the environment. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1059712313482684">Goldman (2009)</xref> tells us that motor plans or intentions are the sorts of mental states or events that are instantiated in the activity of an agent’s brain when that agent engages in manual actions, such as reaching or grasping. For him, such mental states are:<disp-quote>
<p>propositional attitudes with contents of the form ‘let [my] effector E perform motor act M with respect to goal-object G’ … If something like this construal is right then premotor activation in the execution mode has representational content. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1059712313482684">Goldman, 2009</xref>, p. 238)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>But if representational contents are being posited in order to meet a philosophical demand about what is required for any bit of behaviour to count as an action then there is a serious risk that such invocations will be explanatorily hollow. Consider <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1059712313482684">Nanay’s (2013)</xref> example of the complexities of trying to kill a mosquito in a hotel room. He recognizes that <italic>whatever representations</italic> guide the agent’s bodily movements they will have to be very sensitive to the momentary changes in the mosquito’s whereabouts. Moreover, their contents will have to be updated; a result of a direct feedback loop between what the agent sees and does. Yet it is clear that if we posit representational contents in this made-to-order way, tailored to the specific need of each case solely in order to satisfy certain philosophical demands then this will be wholly empty as a means of addressing the explanatory needs of cognitive scientists.</p>
<p>This would amount to providing ‘just so’ stories about representational contents of just the right kind and grain – contents that are conveniently postulated, which have just the right properties to do the explanatory work. To insist that cognitive scientists have no choice but to assume the existence of such representational contents on purely analytic grounds is to engage in a sort of ‘jerry-mandering’. Making sport with Jerry Fodor, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1059712313482684">Dennett and Steglich-Petersen (2008)</xref> define jerry-mandering as the art of tailoring one’s metaphysics to produce results convenient for the demands of one’s philosophy of mind. The only difference, in this case, is that ‘metaphysics’ is replaced by ‘cognitive science’.</p>
<p>Positing representational contents on the cheap cannot serve the explanatory needs of cognitive scientists. This is why ‘there are profound problems … with the standard ploy invoked by movement physiologists [that of assuming] ‘calculations’ that the brain (or part of it) ‘does’ … permit customisation of the programmes to the singularities of the individual action’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1059712313482684">Tallis, 2003</xref>, p. 65). In a nutshell, scientists recognize that:<disp-quote>
<p>The problem is to ascertain [A] how the many degrees of freedom of the human motor system … can be regulated by an internally represented algorithm … and [B] how the motor plan copes with the ongoing interaction between the motor system and [environmental factors]. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1059712313482684">Araújo &amp; Davids, 2011</xref>, p. 12)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The cry lately, from many quarters, is not how else – other than positing representations (e.g., motor plans and commands) – could we possibly explain human manual activity? Rather the question is how can such appeals provide illuminating explanations of basic manual activity – e.g., reaching and grasping for objects?</p>
<p>This is hardly surprising given that all that supports the conviction that there must be mental states with contents is a philosophical stipulation about what makes actions actions. This is what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1059712313482684">Nanay (2013)</xref> thinks provides ‘a clear and conclusive reason’ for attributing pragmatic representations. In line with this rule, an agent’s behaviour <italic>cannot</italic> be explained without assuming such representations guide action. If this is all that fans of Strategy A have to offer it explains why ‘despite the fact that one can cook up a representational story once one has the dynamical explanation, the representational gloss does not predict anything about the system’s behaviour that could not be predicted by dynamical explanation alone’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1059712313482684">Chemero, 2009</xref>, p. 77).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1059712313482684">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>In sum, this version of Strategy A acerbates rather than addresses the worry that ‘talk of representations [at least in] coupled systems may be too cheap, or too arbitrary, and thus adds little or nothing to an explanation of how these systems work’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1059712313482684">Shapiro, 2011</xref>, p. 147).</p>
<p>But all is not lost. There is a more substantial and empirically more credible AOR proposal that avoids some of the problems that face the version of Strategy A cited above. It has been posited that online interactions involve emulator mechanisms – devices that use information about a system’s plans and commands, combining it with other information – e.g., about positions and trajectories of limbs – in order to provide predictions that inform and guide actions. In the standard versions of emulator theory, the information about a system’s plans or commands is thought to come in the form of efference copies of the content of motor commands or plans.</p>
<p>So, on this sort of account, AORs are playing a much more interesting and empirically credible explanatory role. Efference copies are AORs because they are ‘representations that include in their contents commands for certain behaviours’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1059712313482684">Mandik, 2005</xref>, p. 285). Moreover, ‘Efference copies <italic>inherit their representational contents from</italic> the <italic>motor commands</italic> that they are copies of’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1059712313482684">Mandik, 2005</xref>, p. 293, emphasis added).</p>
<p>Positing AORs as part of forward models in this way goes some way to address concerns about how representational content might play a genuine role in guiding behaviour as well as putting some meat on the bones in explaining how the motor system manages its complex interactions with the environment. Yet, even assuming that this constitutes progress, there is yet another, much more fundamental and general problem with Strategy A. For even if we allow that representations might play a relevant explanatory role how could such contents <italic>qua</italic> contents ‘guide and direct’ motor activity?</p>
<p>Strategy A lays stress on the explanatory value of special AOR <italic>contents</italic>. This approach takes seriously the idea that the explanatory work is being done by descriptive or imperative contents (or some combination of the two, namely pushmi-pullyu representations – see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1059712313482684">Clark, 1997</xref>). Such contents are understood to be analogues of the content of linguistic utterances. This is to lean on the seemingly unproblematic idea that ‘Information <italic>encoded</italic> by [sensory systems] can be <italic>relayed</italic> to and <italic>decoded</italic> by motor systems responsible for steering the creature’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1059712313482684">Mandik, 2005</xref>, p. 291). Crucially, according to this story it is the message not the medium that matters.</p>
<p>This is to take for granted that contents can play a causal part in informing and guiding action. But the contents of representations do not make a causal difference, only formal or vehicular properties do. Let us assume, for the sake of argument, that representationalism and computationalism are true. Even so, this version of the AOR story runs into deep trouble because: ‘Computers are formal machines, in the sense that they operate on symbols in virtue of the form of the symbol, not in virtue of how the symbol may be interpreted’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1059712313482684">Churchland &amp; Churchland, 1990</xref>, p. 303). Content does not matter since ‘the machine goes from one state to another because it is caused to do so … without reference to whatever semantic properties our cognitive states may or may not have’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1059712313482684">Churchland &amp; Churchland, 1990</xref>, p. 303). Thus, as noted long ago, it seems that ‘the honest answer is the one Stich gives: [Content] doesn’t do any work, so forget it’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1059712313482684">Cummins, 1991</xref>, p. 124). The same verdict will apply, <italic>mutatis mutandis</italic>, even if one assumes non-computational vehicles and processes. If this is correct, then informationally sensitive but contentless interactions will turn out to be both necessary and sufficient to explain how behaviour is guided. No ghostly contents need apply.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1059712313482684">
<title>3 Dealing with the REC threat – the ‘format’ strategy</title>
<p>Again, all is not lost. Strategy B also posits AORs. The difference is that Strategy B focuses on the special vehicular properties of AORs in order to acknowledge ‘the profound contributions that embodiment and embedding make’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1059712313482684">Clark, 2008a</xref>, p. 45). This avoids the problem of mental causation – that of having to explain how content could play a causal role – which cripples all Strategy A approaches. Doing so is, however, consistent with acceptance of the general idea that inner states bear contents.</p>
<p>So, it turns out that AORs are not easy to kill off. Indeed, like the Nazgûl – the undead monsters of Tolkien’s <italic>The Lord of the Rings</italic> – they (and their contents) are able to survive by finding new shapes to wear and new vehicles to ride. EC would cease to be a threat if it involves special representational or information-carrying or content-generating vehicles or formats. Such vehicles may be thought to reach across brain, body and environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1059712313482684">Clark, 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1059712313482684">2008a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1059712313482684">2008b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1059712313482684">Wheeler, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1059712313482684">2008</xref>). Or they might be wholly neural. Taking up the latter idea, a number of theorists now posit body-formatted representations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1059712313482684">Gallese &amp; Sinigaglia, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1059712313482684">Goldman, 2012</xref>). Either way, this is an attempt to provide a moderate EC – a conservative enactive/embodied cognition (CEC). For example, as its proponents see it, to accommodate EC important adjustments must be made to current thinking about the nature of representational vehicles (and not just contents), hence this requires developing a new set of theoretical tools. Proponents of CEC are motivated to posit AORs with special vehicular properties as a way of addressing the ‘real danger’ that ‘the explanatory utility of representation talk may evaporate altogether’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1059712313482684">Wheeler, 2005</xref>, p. 200).</p>
<p>Although the worries raised in what follows applies to all Strategy B AORs across the board, I focus on B-formatted representations as the representative case. This is because <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1059712313482684">Goldman (2012)</xref> claims that not only can AORs of this sort make EC safe from the REC threat, he also believes that they hold the promise of unifying EC. By his lights ‘it is time to converge on a single approach – the B-format approach – as a unifying and comprehensive one, rather than persist with the dispiriting balkanisation of embodiment theory’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1059712313482684">Goldman, 2012</xref>, p. 85). Goldman assumes B-formatted representations operate with a special code, yet he admits that ‘There is no generally accepted treatment of what it is to be such a mental code, and little if anything has been written about the criteria of sameness or difference for such codes. Nonetheless, it’s a very appealing idea, to which many cognitive scientists subscribe’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1059712313482684">Goldman, 2012</xref>, p. 73).</p>
<p>Gallese and Sinigaglia adopt a similar view. Laying stress on the way bodily formatted representations are encoded they tell us that ‘a representational format is typically associated with characteristic processing profiles. These profiles (motor, viscero-motor and somatosensory) characterize a bodily formatted representation, distinguishing it from, say, a propositional representation, even in the presence of (partially) overlapping content’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1059712313482684">Gallese &amp; Sinigaglia, 2011</xref>, p. 100).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1059712313482684">Goldman (2012)</xref> restricts the notion of a B-formatted representation further. For him, not only do they have special formats, they have a particular subject matter too.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Many codes in the mind/brain represent states of the subject’s own body, indeed, represent them from an internal perspective. Proprioception and kinesthesis give the brain information – couched, presumably, in distinctive formats – about states of one’s own muscles, joints, and limb positions. These interoceptive senses are the basis for B-formats of representation. One’s own body, or selected parts thereof, is what they primarily, or fundamentally, represent. (p. 73)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>According to Goldman B-formatted representations have a specific kind of content and a distinctive format for interfacing directly with certain machinery of mind. His idea is that special vehicles – namely vehicles that can only be used by particular kinds of mental machinery – carry special contents. But this avoids the worry raised at the end of the previous section because it is the vehicular properties that do the explanatory heavy lifting. B-formatted representations stand out precisely because they cannot be used by just any cognitive systems. Apparently, this explains why there is such a pervasive phenomenon of neural re-use; recruiting neural circuits to new types of uses. Cases of this include the family of mirroring phenomena (motor mirroring, mirroring of emotions and sensations) in which motoric formats are redeployed for social cognition tasks. But there is also the re-use of circuits associated with motor control functions in higher-level tasks of language comprehension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1059712313482684">Pulvermuller, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1059712313482684">Glenberg &amp; Kaschak, 2002</xref>) and, also, the re-use of motor control circuits for memory tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1059712313482684">Hubbard et al., 2005</xref>). Neural redeployment or re-use occurs because it is the only way that certain representational contents can be effective in cognition. This is because those contents cannot be separated from their special kinds of vehicles or formats.</p>
<p>Despite it being impossible to separate these special contents from their special vehicles, this proposal nevertheless retains the idea that there is a logical distinction between B-formatted contents and vehicles. Presumably, B-formatted contents could be decoded and re-formatted, in principle if not in practice. Yet if we accept that contents cannot, as a matter of fact, ever be separated from their special formats or vehicles, what motivates drawing the vehicle/content distinction any longer? After all, it was originally motivated by the capacity to samesay in language – expressing the same content – using different linguistic vehicles. The claim that contents exist is traditionally motivated by noting that when one says ‘It is snowing’ in English and ‘Il neige’ in French, one says the same thing. Making an ontological head count, based on this simple observation, it looks as if we have three things here: two well-formed, complex linguistic utterances – each hailing from different natural languages – and one meaningful propositional content that is expressed by both.</p>
<p>Imagining the vehicles of mental content to be some sort of sentence preserves the idea of samesaying, but positing B-formatted representations brings it into question. In doing so, it questions what could motivate us to continue assuming that these special formats or vehicles bear contents at all? Although it is logically possible to insist that they do, there is no compelling reason to imagine this to be the case any longer. Of course, not doing so has consequences. For if we abandon the idea that such vehicles carry content then the vehicle/content distinction collapses and we are led into the arms of REC. Can we force this result?</p>

<title>4 The master argument</title>
<p>In light of the analyses of the previous sections it appears that the only plausible way to resist REC on today’s market is to adopt some version of the AOR ‘format’ strategy. Although that strategy renders contents explanatorily hollow and superfluous, it does not surrender the idea that there are contents. But what justifies and motivates retention of the general idea of representational vehicles that bear contents? Apparently the anodyne assumption that ‘minds are basically processors of information; cognitive devices [for] receiving, storing, retrieving, modifying and transmitting information of various kinds’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1059712313482684">Branquinho, 2001</xref>, p. xii–xiii). Call this the Informational Assumption.</p>
<p>Not only does the Informational Assumption provide a rationale for retaining a notion of content it appears to provide the basis for raising a formidable problem for REC. Some have held that REC’s rejection of the idea that basic minds are contentful commits the cardinal sin of leaving it without a tenable ‘mark of the cognitive’. REC fails, so it is claimed, to recognize that cognition is, essentially, ‘grounded in processes of information extraction, transformation and use’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1059712313482684">Clark, 2008b</xref>, p. 19). Call this the Information-Processing Challenge. Note that it turns, crucially, on the further assumption that information entails content.</p>
<p>The only way for REC to avoid this counter threat and rid cognitive science of its Nazgûl, once and for all, is to make the ultimate move; to undermine any justification for believing in informational content of the sort needed by REC’s opponents. This is the equivalent of throwing the one ring into the fires of Mount Doom. If successful, this move changes everything. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1059712313482684">Hutto and Myin (2013)</xref> attempt just such a masterstroke, offering an argument – which goes beyond establishing that we ‘don’t need’ content to explain many forms of basic cognitive activity.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1059712313482684">Hutto and Myin (2013)</xref> identify a crippling problem, the Hard Problem of Content, that confronts anyone hoping that the mainstream naturalized theories of content might justify believing in non-linguistic mental content. Explanatory naturalists with this ambition seek to explain how it is that mental representations possess their contentful properties by appeal to nothing but undisputed natural phenomena, e.g., causation, nomic dependencies or biological functions.</p>
<p>Understanding the challenge the Hard Problem of Content presents requires getting clear about what drives the naturalist’s project of explaining content and the conditions imposed on it. That enterprise requires that mental content be explained without making any appeal to features of our linguistic activities and practices. This is because the major philosophical motivation for seeking to naturalize content is the assumption that linguistic contents derive wholly from and are explained by properties of the mental representations that underwrite them. In this light, the naturalistic task becomes the restricted one of explaining how, and not merely presupposing that, mental representations possess their contents. For the reason just given, this must be done by appeal to wholly non-linguistic factors.</p>
<p>Most mainstream naturalized theories of representational content assume the existence of informational content as a starting point (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1059712313482684">Dretske, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1059712313482684">Fodor, 2008</xref>). Proponents of these theories acknowledge that informational content does not suffice to explain full-fledged representational content. Nevertheless, the existence of such content plays an important part in these theories, serving as a platform for their representational accounts to build upon.</p>
<p>So as not to violate naturalism the hypothesized informational content is conceived in terms of covariance. Setting aside complications about scope and context, the notion of information relied upon is understood strictly by appeal to the following bi-conditional: s’s being F ‘carries information about’ t’s being H iff the occurrence of these states of affairs lawfully covary.</p>
<p>This notion of information is assumed wholly innocent because it is accepted ‘in many areas of scientific investigation as when it is said that a footprint or a fingerprint carries information about the individual whose footprint or fingerprint it is. In this sense, it may also be said that a fossil carries information about a past organism. The number of tree rings in a tree trunk carries information about the age of the tree’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1059712313482684">Jacob, 1997</xref>, p. 45). The following quotation from Dretske makes clear the foundational role that information is meant to play in such theories:<disp-quote>
<p>In the beginning there was information. The word came later … information (though not meaning) [is] an objective commodity, something whose generation, transmission and reception do not require or in any way presuppose interpretative processes. One is therefore given a framework for understanding how meaning can evolve, how genuine cognitive systems – those with the resources for interpreting signals, holding beliefs, acquiring knowledge – can develop out of lower-order, purely physical, information-processing mechanisms … Meaning, and the constellation of mental attitudes that exhibit it, are manufactured products. The raw material is information. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1059712313482684">Dretske, 1988</xref>, p. vii)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The Hard Problem exposes that presupposing the existence of informational content is at odds with explanatory naturalism. The root trouble is that, by itself, covariance does not constitute, entail or suffice for the existence of content. Content has special features – for there to be content there must be specified conditions of satisfaction such that there is true or accurate content wherever the conditions specified are, in fact, instantiated. If this is correct, and covariance is the only scientifically respectable notion of information that can do the work required by explanatory naturalists, then it follows that we have no explanation of how informational content exists in nature (or how it could do so independently from and prior to the existence of certain linguistic practices). Thus to the extent that explanatory naturalists rely on the notion of informational content as a platform for their theories, their project is doomed from the start. For without a naturalistic theory of informational <italic>content</italic> such accounts have no basis upon which to build, supplementary, naturalized theories of representational content.</p>
<p>By challenging the idea that covariance is any kind of informational content, the Hard Problem of Content shows that because they conflate information-as-covariance with informational-content many explanatory naturalists in fact lack the basic resources even to begin explaining non-linguistic mental content. Moreover, it can be shown that abandoning the idea that such content is needed as a platform and sticking to accounts that appeal only to the existence of devices that have the biological function of responding to non-contentful covariances supports non-representationalism, not representational theories of mind (for full details, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1059712313482684">Hutto &amp; Myin, 2013</xref>, ch. 4).</p>
<p>There are, of course, various ways of responding to the dilemma posed by the Hard Problem of Content. One move is to try to avoid the dilemma’s horns by demonstrating that covariance does – in fact – constitute content. This would justify assuming the existence of informational content that comes before and below the existence of systems that use it in a way that is consistent with explanatory naturalism after all. Failing that one might hope to defuse the threat posed by the Hard Problem by locating another, equally credible scientific candidate for understanding informational content – a notion other than covariance – in order to show the idea of such content is in good naturalistic standing. There is reason to suspect neither move will be successful (for further discussion of this point, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1059712313482684">Hutto &amp; Myin, 2013</xref>, ch. 4).</p>
<p>In the face of this, one might bite the bullet and simply posit the existence of informational content while foregoing the explanatorily naturalistic project. This might take the form of assuming, without explanation, that facts (including correspondences between facts) just are informational contents. Thus it might be assumed that contents are somehow identical with their own conditions of satisfaction. Perhaps they somehow both specify and realize their conditions of satisfaction in the absence of thinkers. Accordingly, informational contents might be assumed primitive, unexplained features of reality itself. However, there is a price to pay for taking this sort of line. It is not obvious that this proposal is compatible with physicalism. Still, it might be compatible with some kind of unexplanatory naturalism. For example, informational content might be an irreducible property of fundamental reality, having a status similar to that of qualia in Chalmers’ system. While logically possible, there is a high price for making this move.</p>
<p>Yet another option – the least costly one – is simply to acknowledge that states of affairs that lawfully co-vary are not, by themselves, informational contents and to accept that such covariance does not suffice for, or otherwise entail the existence of, informational contents. This is entirely consistent with accepting that the only scientifically respectable notion of information is the notion of information-as-covariance. If this is accepted then it follows that sensitivity to information, understood in terms of covariance alone, is not sensitivity to informational contents. Accordingly, basic cognition need not be content-involving.</p>
<p>Adopting this last option does not mean giving up on the idea that basic cognition takes the form of systems engaging in informationally sensitive interactions with environmental offerings. Rather it is to understand such engagements in terms of systems being sensitive to covariant information that is not itself contentful. Nor does basic cognition involve picking up and processing informational contents. Cognitive systems cannot ‘pick up’ or ‘take in’ any informational contents if there are no informational contents there in the world, independent of systems, to take in.</p>
<p>In all, it seems there is no scientific justification for thinking that informational or representational contents exist in nature – or rather there is no justification for thinking that they exist in nature independently from, and prior to, the existence of certain social practices. If there is no scientific justification for thinking that informational content exists in nature (in the qualified sense), then there are no compelling grounds for thinking that cognitive systems literally traffic in informational contents or are otherwise content-involving.</p>
<p>Thus the Hard Problem of Content at once defuses the counter threat to REC and presents its opponents with a serious challenge. If the master argument, only presented here in the most basic sketch, works then it should encourage us to set cognitive science free of monsters of its own making.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1059712313482684">
<title>5 Resurrection?</title>
<p>As with all good horror stories, the apparent end of the tale is never usually the actual end. So isn’t there a chance that mental representations might still return – even if the master argument described above is assumed to work?</p>
<p>Consider the emulator theory version of the AOR proposal once more. Its fans have argued against REC that ‘physical actions are often guided by representation of feedback … so even simple actions cannot be explained without positing representations’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1059712313482684">Machery, 2009</xref>, p. 222). Indeed, its originators make a direct criticism of REC in recent writings, insisting that ‘the enactive approach … is unworkable unless it makes appeal to representations’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1059712313482684">Foglia &amp; Grush, 2011</xref>, p. 36). The key to this objection is the idea that according to emulation theory agents must be making use of internal models of some sort, where a model is ‘something, M, is a model of X (for some agent A) if A can use M as a stand-in for X’ (Foglia &amp; Grush, p. 42). On this view, it is the manipulation of models that, at least in part, enables off-line cognition.</p>
<p>Suppose this turns out to be right, as looks likely; there is strong empirical support for the existence of feed forward models in human cognition (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1059712313482684">Chemero, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1059712313482684">Mandik, 2005</xref>). Yet even if some version of emulator theory turns out to be true this would not be an unqualified problem for REC. For on close inspection this would only license the conclusion that ‘the enactive approach … is unworkable unless it makes appeal to representations, <italic>understood in a particular way</italic>. Not understood as pictures, to be sure. Or sentences for that matter. But those aren’t the only options’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1059712313482684">Foglia &amp; Grush, 2011</xref>, p. 36, emphasis added).</p>
<p>The need to expand beyond the standard analogies has been stressed by other fans of model theory too. Thus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1059712313482684">Ryder (2006)</xref> writes: ‘Rather than taking indicators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1059712313482684">Dretske, 1988</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1059712313482684">1995</xref>), or pictures, or words to be the analogue of mental representation, I believe that neuroscience and psychology recommend that we adopt the representational paradigm of <italic>models</italic>’ (p. 121). But what might this involve? Ryder explicates:<disp-quote>
<p>… representation in models is a functional property – mere isomorphism is insufficient. A rocky outcrop that happens to be isomorphic to the <italic>Spirit of St. Louis</italic> does not represent the <italic>Spirit of St. Louis</italic> because the isomorphism in question is not a normative one – the rock is not supposed to be isomorphic to the <italic>Spirit of St. Louis</italic>. A model represents because it has the function of mirroring or being isomorphic to some other structure. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1059712313482684">Ryder, 2006</xref>, p. 122)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>This looks plausible enough but it raises crucial questions: Do these so-called model ‘representations’ have content? What would it mean to say they do? Do the elements of the model ‘stand for’ something, or do they only ‘stand in for’ something, or ‘stand in relation to’ something? Do they exhibit ‘reference’, ‘aboutness’ or merely ‘ofness’? Can the relational properties of such models, should there be any, be explained by covariational properties playing a special kind of teleologically defined functional role? If so, REC can easily accommodate models under its auspices as being officially contentlesss in the relevant sense of that notion.</p>
<p>Wouldn’t such models – even if contentless in the relevant sense – still count as representations? <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1059712313482684">Rupert (2011)</xref> thinks so. He proposes that:<disp-quote>
<p>One might best treat a mental representation as an element in a psychological model that can be paired with another element in the model, such that (1) the former is mapped onto a state internal to the target cognitive system, (2) the former bears, according to the model, <italic>some kind of privileged relation to the latter</italic> (e.g., the latter reliably causes the activation of the former or the former tracks the presence of the latter), and (3) the relation referred to in (2) plays a role in successful applications of the model to target (psychological) systems (that is, in the explanation of the intelligent behavior of the target system). (p. 101, emphasis added).</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Why not simply accept this diluted notion of representation? Couldn’t we just go along with Rupert and call anything that meets the minimal criteria he cites a representation? Well, we could. We could just say that representations are a label for <italic>whatever</italic> best characterizes and explains cognition – just as we might say that ‘perceptual representations are whatever psychologists of perception say perception involves’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1059712313482684">Machery, 2009</xref>, p. 110). But, we should beware vacuous scholasticism.</p>
<p>To adopt some kind of teleofunctional account is probably the way of explicating much basic online cognition, even where this involves emulation processes. But making this move is too weak to yield a robust account of contentful representation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1059712313482684">Hutto, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1059712313482684">Hutto &amp; Myin, 2013</xref>). Defending representationalism by diluting it and abandoning its stronger commitment to semantic content risks making the debate between representationalists and their opponents insubstantial and scientifically uninteresting. So it looks like even if we accept that cognition involves some kind of model making this is not enough to resurrect or bring back representational contents, and cognitive science remains safe from such monsters. At least, that seems the right conclusion for now.</p>

<p>Adding a specific proposal about the source of such content, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1059712313482684">Mandik (2005)</xref> makes a similar proposal defining action oriented representations as ‘any representation whose content is determined, in whole or in part, by involving states whose teleofunction is to be the causal antecedents of actions’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1059712313482684">Mandik, 2005</xref>, p. 293).</p>
