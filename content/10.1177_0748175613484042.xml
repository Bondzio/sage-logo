<p>The current study developed an 18-item scale measuring individuals’ social expectations in relationships related to their efficacy expectations (Subscale 1) and outcome expectations (Subscale 2) based on Bandura’s self-efficacy theory. Results from exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses, using an undergraduate sample (<italic>N</italic> = 486), revealed strong psychometric evidence for this scale.</p>

<p>Understanding individuals’ abilities to engage in social relationships continues to evolve throughout the field of psychology. Furthermore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0748175613484042">Bandura’s (1977</xref>, 1997) theory of self-efficacy is one of the most extensively researched areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0748175613484042">DeWitz &amp; Walsh, 2002</xref>) and has been applied to examine social relational tasks by investigating social self-efficacy’s influence on various constructs. Surprisingly, little research has been generated on the concept of social self-efficacy within the adult population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0748175613484042">Fan, Meng, Gao, Lopez, &amp; Liu, 2010</xref>), especially on strong measurement in this domain of self-efficacy. Research in this area thus far has found that social self-efficacy has been positively related to college satisfaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0748175613484042">DeWitz &amp; Walsh, 2002</xref>), life satisfaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0748175613484042">Wright &amp; Perrone, 2010</xref>), self-esteem, and negatively related to loneliness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0748175613484042">Hermann &amp; Betz, 2006</xref>). However, there is a lack of scales that adequately measure social self-efficacy and there is a need to develop a psychometrically valid measure for this domain of self-efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0748175613484042">Fan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0748175613484042">Wright &amp; Perrone, 2010</xref>), which may be used to assess social relational tasks and social expectations in relationships. Therefore, we have set out to develop a new scale that measures individuals’ social relational beliefs by assessing both social self-efficacy and social outcome expectations in order to align well with the theoretical underpinnings of self-efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0748175613484042">Bandura, 1977</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0748175613484042">1997</xref>). Particularly, individuals’ self-efficacy and outcome expectations both influence their goals and their behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0748175613484042">Bandura, 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0748175613484042">2012</xref>), and there is a need to provide researchers and counselors with a single scale to assess these areas in social relationships. It is also our hope that this scale will offer researchers additional information and a more complete way to test the theoretical underpinnings of self-efficacy theory, as well as other related theoretical models that include both variables of self-efficacy and outcome expectations (e.g., Social Cognitive Career Theory; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0748175613484042">Lent, Brown, &amp; Hackett, 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>Based on Social Cognitive Theory’s (SCT; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0748175613484042">Bandura, 1986</xref>) triadic reciprocal model of determinism, the concept of self-efficacy is an essential cognitive factor that relates to people’s behavior within their environment. Specifically, self-efficacy is concerned with judgments of personal capabilities and is “a belief about what one can do under different sets of conditions with whatever skills one possesses” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0748175613484042">Bandura, 1997</xref>, p. 37). Furthermore, it is individuals’ self-efficacy beliefs that motivate them through adversity and influence their outcome expectations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0748175613484042">Bandura, 2012</xref>), which is viewed as “a person’s estimate that a given behavior will lead to certain outcomes” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0748175613484042">Bandura, 1977</xref>, p. 193). Thus, self-efficacy relates to a belief in one’s capability to perform, whereas outcome expectations are beliefs about the outcome from carrying out a performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0748175613484042">Bandura, 2006</xref>). Accordingly, individuals who believe that they have the required abilities to complete a task will often expect a desired outcome from completing the task. Similarly, the expected outcome of a situation is highly influenced by one’s perceived ability related to the situation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0748175613484042">Bandura, 2006</xref>). For instance, individuals who are confident in talking with others (i.e., social self-efficacy) will likely believe that talking with others will also enhance their social relationships (i.e., social outcome expectations). Accordingly, both constructs relate to one’s cognitive judgment that influences behavior and do not operate independently of each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0748175613484042">Bandura, 2012</xref>). Subsequently, including both constructs in a single scale may offer researchers and counselors a more complete theoretical understanding related to individuals’ behavior, given that outcome expectations are influenced by self-efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0748175613484042">Bandura, 1989</xref>).</p>
<p>Both self-efficacy and outcome expectations are theorized to be domain specific (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0748175613484042">Bandura, 1997</xref>) and can be applied to individuals’ expectations in social relationships. In accordance with theory, social self-efficacy is defined as peoples’ beliefs about their level of ability to successfully perform a given task or behavior in social relationships. Social outcome expectations are viewed as individuals’ beliefs and expectations that their engaging in social activities will result in specific outcomes related to social relationships. Understanding these two areas are of particular importance for college-aged adults, who are often in what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0748175613484042">Arnett (2000)</xref> conceptualized as the emerging adulthood developmental stage, given the formation and importance of relationships when encountering transitions such as entering college or the workforce. Furthermore, exploring relationships at a more intimate level in ways that align with a person’s evolving emerging adult identity is a primary focus of emerging adulthood development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0748175613484042">Arnett, 2000</xref>). Consequently, the current lack of measures assessing social self-efficacy prevents researchers from sufficiently investigating relationship formation based on perceived tasks abilities and social expectations.</p>
<p>In previous research on social self-efficacy, researchers have used the Social Self-Efficacy subscale from the longer Self-Efficacy Scale (SES; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0748175613484042">Sherer et al., 1982</xref>), despite scores on this subscale lacking strong psychometrics (i.e., Cronbach’s α = .71; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0748175613484042">Sherer et al., 1982</xref>). In response to the need for a strong psychometric scale measuring social self-efficacy, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0748175613484042">Smith and Betz (2000)</xref> developed the Perceived Social Self-Efficacy scale (PSSE), and to date this is the only scale measuring social self-efficacy that aligns with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0748175613484042">Bandura’s (1997)</xref> self-efficacy theory. However, the PSSE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0748175613484042">Smith &amp; Betz, 2000</xref>) only measures social self-efficacy and does not examine social outcome expectations, which is an important aspect of the theory underpinning self-efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0748175613484042">Bandura, 1997</xref>). As a result, there is a gap in the literature examining self-efficacy and outcome expectations in social relationships and warrants further investigation. In addition, the combination of a scale that measures both self-efficacy and outcome expectations in the social and relational domains will enable researchers to more thoroughly assess the various aspects of individuals’ beliefs about their capabilities and outcome expectations of interpersonal relationships. This may also enable a better understanding of the types of interventions needed to improve and enhance relationships given our relational nature and need for healthy relational patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0748175613484042">Teyber &amp; McClure, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Prior research has linked positive outcomes with social relationships. For instance, in an adult sample, social self-efficacy was positively related to prosocial behaviors, which included sharing, helping, caring for others, and feeling empathetic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0748175613484042">Caprara &amp; Steca, 2007</xref>). It has also been found that individuals’ self-efficacy to regulate and manage both positive and negative emotions was positively related to social self-efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0748175613484042">Caprara &amp; Steca, 2005</xref>). In addition, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0748175613484042">DeWitz, Woolsey, and Walsh (2009)</xref> concluded that college students perceived social self-efficacy was positively related to their sense of having a purpose in life. Other researchers have found social self-efficacy to have a positive relationship with life satisfaction among college students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0748175613484042">Wright &amp; Perrone, 2010</xref>). Furthermore, social self-efficacy has been negatively related to shyness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0748175613484042">Smith &amp; Betz, 2002</xref>), as well as loneliness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0748175613484042">Hermann &amp; Betz, 2006</xref>), which may explain why college students with increased levels of social self-efficacy also indicated higher levels of social connectedness as suggested by experiences of closeness in interpersonal contexts and being able to maintain closeness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0748175613484042">Williams &amp; Galliher, 2006</xref>). Although the study was conducted with high school students, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0748175613484042">Matsushima and Shiomi (2003)</xref> found that higher social self-efficacy scores were negatively related to interpersonal stress and positively related to expectations of support, which was a form of outcome expectations.</p>
<p>Clearly, social self-efficacy is an important construct with consequential interpersonal roles and continues to be a major focus of research in psychology with clinically relevant implications. However, there is limited research on outcome expectations with regard to relationships, which may be due in part to the lack of adequate measures of social outcome expectations. In addition, a lack of strong measurement for this construct may currently limit the scope of related study. Thus, we sought to develop a scale with strong psychometrics and validity evidence that measures both self-efficacy in relationships and outcome expectations related to relationships in order to expand the research in this area.</p>

<title>Purpose of the Study</title>
<p>Being relational by nature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0748175613484042">Teyber &amp; McClure, 2011</xref>), individuals desire to engage in relationships yet there is a lack of strong psychometric scales that are domain specific to relationships that measure individuals’ self-efficacy and outcome expectations specifically in social relationships. Aside from the PSSE scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0748175613484042">Smith &amp; Betz, 2000</xref>) that only measures social self-efficacy, the scales that are currently available do not appear to be based on a comprehensive conceptualization of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0748175613484042">Bandura’s (1997)</xref> self-efficacy theory. Specifically, including both social self-efficacy and social outcome expectations on a single scale may enable researchers and counselors to more fully understand social relational behaviors, given that both areas influence ones’ goals and behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0748175613484042">Bandura, 2012</xref>). In addition, more research has been generated on self-efficacy than outcome expectations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0748175613484042">Sheu et al., 2010</xref>), which may be due in part to a lack of scales related to outcome expectations and developing a measure for this area may further research on the topic. Moreover, sophisticated research designs are continually calling for the use of multiple instruments to measure the same construct (e.g., structural equation modeling). Therefore, the purpose of this study was to develop a scale that will accurately measure individuals’ social expectations in relationships by assessing both their confidence in their abilities to perform tasks in social relationships, as well as their outcome expectations for engaging in relational tasks. In the present study, we developed a novel scale called the <italic>Social Efficacy and Outcome Expectation Scale</italic> (<italic>SEOES</italic>) with a college-aged population, conducted psychometric analyses, and presented preliminary validity evidence.</p>

<title>Participants and Procedures</title>
<p>We recruited 486 participants from a medium-size university in the Rocky Mountain region for the current study; institutional review board approval was granted for this study’s protocol. Participants ranged in age from 18 to 44 years (<italic>M</italic> = 19.17, <italic>SD</italic> = 2.36), and 291 were female and 195 were male. The participants reported identifying as 76% Caucasian, 14% Hispanic, 5% African America, and 2% Asian American; 3% did not indicate ethnicity. The majority of participants were classified as freshman (76%), followed by sophomores (19%), juniors (7%), and seniors (3%). Undergraduate participants were recruited from introductory psychology courses, and course credit was provided for participating in the study. Data were collected individually from the host university’s online survey system after the study was approved by the institutional review board.</p>

<title>Instruments</title>
<p>The SEOES was developed in the current study by the authors to measure individuals’ social expectations in relationships by assessing both their confidence in their abilities to perform tasks in social relationships, as well as their outcome expectations from engaging in relational tasks. The authors generated items by reviewing other scales that assessed relationship confidence (e.g., PSSE, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0748175613484042">Smith &amp; Betz, 2000</xref>; SES, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0748175613484042">Sherer et al., 1982</xref>). We also followed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0748175613484042">Bandura’s (1997)</xref> guidelines in that “self-efficacy scales should measure people’s beliefs in their abilities to fulfill different levels of task demands within the psychological domain selected for study” (p. 44). Having viewed the definition of self-efficacy, the authors generated a list of 20 items that did not contain any item overlap with prior published scales of social self-efficacy (e.g., PSSE, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0748175613484042">Smith &amp; Betz, 2000</xref>; SES, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0748175613484042">Sherer et al., 1982</xref>). Participants were instructed to respond to the items using a 5-point Likert-type scale ranging from 1 (<italic>Strongly disagree</italic>) to 5 (<italic>Strongly agree</italic>), with higher scores indicating greater levels of social self-efficacy and social outcome expectations (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0748175613484042">Table 1</xref>). Subsequent analyses generated the final scale that has 18 total items and consist of two subscales: Social Self-Efficacy Expectations (12 items) and Social Outcome Expectations (6 items) with Cronbach’s α coefficients of .97 and .91, respectively, for data in the present study (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0748175613484042">Table 2</xref>).</p>

<p>We used the PSSE scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0748175613484042">Smith &amp; Betz, 2000</xref>) to provide convergent validity evidence by calculating bivariate correlations between the mean scores from the PSSE and mean scores from our new measure. The PSSE consisted of 25 items measuring individuals’ confidence in their ability to engage in social interactional tasks needed to initiate and maintain interpersonal relationships. The items focused on six areas of social interaction, which include making friends, pursuing romantic relationships, social assertiveness, performance in public situations, groups or parties, and giving or receiving help. Participants responded to items using a 5-point Likert-type scale ranging from 1 (<italic>No confidence at all</italic>) to 5 (<italic>Complete confidence</italic>), with higher scores indicating greater perceived social self-efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0748175613484042">Smith &amp; Betz, 2000</xref>). Smith and Betz reported a Cronbach’s alpha for the total score of .94 in the original sample, and in the present study our alpha coefficient for the total score was .96. Concurrent validity evidence for the PSSE was established by demonstrating a positive correlation with a measure of SES (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0748175613484042">Sherer et al., 1982</xref>), and discriminant validity evidence was established by negative correlations between PSSE total mean scores and mean scores on measures of social anxiety and shyness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0748175613484042">Smith &amp; Betz, 2000</xref>). This validity study also used a sample of undergraduate psychology students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0748175613484042">Smith &amp; Betz, 2000</xref>), which is consistent with our sample.</p>

<title>Data Analyses</title>
<p>All 20 potential items were submitted to an exploratory factor analysis (EFA) using maximum likelihood extraction method and a promax (oblique/correlated) rotation (<italic>k</italic> = 4) with Kaiser normalization using IBM SPSS Statistics (Release 19). Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0748175613484042">Mundfrom, Shaw, and Ke’s (2005)</xref> recommendations of minimum sample size for an EFA with a variables-to-factors ratio of 8, wide communality (ranging from .567 to .825 in our data), and a coefficient of congruence <italic>K</italic> &gt; .98 (“excellent” criteria), we selected a random subset of 130 participants from our total sample to form a calibration sample, with the remaining 356 participants forming a hold-out sample for later confirmatory factor analyses (CFA). For the EFA, items were excluded if they displayed pattern coefficient loadings of less than .45, or if they double-loaded on two factors with pattern coefficients greater than .32 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0748175613484042">Tabachnick &amp; Fidell, 2001</xref>). Retention of factors was determined using multiple criteria, including a visual inspection of the Scree plot, eigenvalues greater than 1, Parallel Analysis following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0748175613484042">O’Connor’s (2000)</xref> guidelines (1,000 computed data sets, 95th percentile for the generated data), and the clarity and interpretability of the factor solution.</p>
<p>The factor model that this EFA yielded was subjected to a CFA using EQS software (Release 6.1) with data from the hold-out sample (<italic>n</italic> = 356) for these same scale items. Given our purposes in developing a novel scale, we used <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0748175613484042">Jöreskog’s (1993)</xref> Model Generating approach to structural equation modeling (SEM) in order to test our proposed model’s fit to the data, and then use results from these data to respecify the model until reaching a practically meaningful and useful model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0748175613484042">Byrne, 2006</xref>). This hold-out sample of 356 for the CFA met <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0748175613484042">Kline’s (2011)</xref> recommended minimum criteria of 200 for most SEM applications with larger samples always recommended (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0748175613484042">Weston &amp; Gore, 2006</xref>). A unit loading constraint was used for model identification purposes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0748175613484042">Kline, 2011</xref>) on the indicator with the highest pattern coefficient from the EFA analysis for each latent variable. Squared multiple correlations were analyzed (values greater than .9 were interpreted as evidence of potential collinearity), and standardized residuals greater than |3.3| were considered potential outliers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0748175613484042">Tabachnick &amp; Fidell, 2001</xref>). Skew and kurtosis statistics greater than the absolute values of 2 and 7, respectively, were considered problematic for the multivariate normality assumption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0748175613484042">Hoyle, 1995</xref>); homoscedasticity and linearity assumptions were evaluated by reviewing scatter plots of standardized residuals.</p>
<p>Given that the data were approximately normally distributed, maximum likelihood (ML) estimation methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0748175613484042">Bentler &amp; Chih-Ping, 1987</xref>) were used with the adjusted Satorra–Bentler χ<sup>2</sup> statistic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0748175613484042">Satorra &amp; Bentler, 1988</xref>). As the test for exact model fit using the χ<sup>2</sup> statistic has been shown to be biased by a number of model characteristics and overly sensitive to model misspecification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0748175613484042">Kline, 2011</xref>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0748175613484042">Iacobucci’s (2010)</xref> revised criteria of χ<sup>2</sup>/<italic>df</italic> &lt; 3 was used as well. Following published guidelines for evaluating approximate fit indices, the cutoff criteria of close to .06 for the root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) and &lt;.08 for the standardized root mean square residual (SRMR) were used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0748175613484042">Hu &amp; Bentler, 1999</xref>), as well as &gt;.95 for the <italic>nonnormed fit index</italic> (NNFI) and comparative fit index (CFI; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0748175613484042">Beauducel &amp; Wittmann, 2005</xref>). These approximate fit statistics were chosen given the potential for nonnormality in these data, as well as considerations of the sample size and model complexity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0748175613484042">Hutchinson &amp; Olmos, 1998</xref>). Any potential differences in SEOES subscale mean scores were evaluated simultaneously using a multivariate analysis of variance (Bonferroni adjusted α level .05/2 = .025) to determine differences by gender (male and female) and ethnicity (aggregated into Caucasian and non-Caucasian given the low number of people of color in this sample). We examined plots of standardized residuals, as well as skew and kurtosis statistics to assess for deviations from the assumptions of homoscedasticity, independence of observations, and multivariate normality.</p>

<p>All skew and kurtosis statistics for these items fell within acceptable ranges, and there was no evidence of collinearity in these data. The factorability of the data was clearly supported by both the Kaiser–Meyer–Olkin measure (.929) and Bartlett’s test of sphericity (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0748175613484042">Tabachnick &amp; Fidell, 2001</xref>). An EFA performed on all 20 items with data from the 130 participants in the calibration sample yielded two factors, with agreement among the multiple methods of determining components (e.g., parallel analysis), that demonstrated a clear and interpretable rotated factor structure. We named Factor 1 “Social Efficacy Expectations,” which had an eigenvalue of 11.331 and explained 56.655% of the variance, and named Factor 2 “Social Outcome Expectations,” which had an eigenvalue of 2.340 and explained 11.699% of the variance. The pattern coefficients for these items were all greater than .45 with no large double loadings (none &gt; .32) and are displayed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0748175613484042">Table 2</xref>. Cronbach’s α reliability estimates for the total scale, Subscale 1’s items and Subscale 2’s items calculated from these data were .957, .960, and .904, respectively; the interfactor correlation was <italic>r</italic> = .613. We then forced the maximum likelihood procedure to extract only one factor from the same 20 items, and the factor matrix loadings were all greater than .45 (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0748175613484042">Table 3</xref>).</p>

<p>Based on these results, the 20-item, two-factor model of the SEOES’s factor structure was subjected to a CFA using data from the 356 participants in the separate hold-out sample (<italic>n</italic> = 356). There was no evidence of collinearity in these data, all skew and kurtosis statistics fell within acceptable ranges, and the largest standardized residual was .167; one case (Case 108) was removed because of its unusually high relative contribution to normalized multivariate kurtosis. All unstandardized parameter estimates were statistically significant and practically meaningful, suggesting good component fit.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Addressing the need for more scales that measure social self-efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0748175613484042">Fan et al., 2010</xref>), our new 18-item scale appears to measure the construct of social self-efficacy in relationships by assessing both social self-efficacy expectations and social outcome expectations based on the final two-factor solution that was supported by our CFA. This new scale demonstrated strong psychometric properties (i.e., Cronbach’s alpha and convergent validity) with our college sample and also aligns conceptually with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0748175613484042">Bandura’s (1997)</xref> self-efficacy theory. Self-efficacy theory specifically incorporates two components, efficacy expectations and outcome expectations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0748175613484042">Bandura, 1997</xref>). Accordingly, the final 12 items that loaded on the first identified factor appear to measure individuals’ confidence in their abilities to successfully complete relational tasks, and the remaining 6 items that loaded on the second factor appear to measure outcome expectations based on tasks in relationships.</p>
<p>The present study’s data support that scores on both the PSSE and the social self-efficacy subscale are measuring a similar construct because of being correlated at a moderately high level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0748175613484042">Sattler &amp; Hoge, 2006</xref>), which provides support for the convergent validity of this new social self-efficacy subscale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0748175613484042">Kline, 2011</xref>). However, scores on the PSSE and on the outcome expectations subscale were moderately low (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0748175613484042">Sattler &amp; Hoge, 2006</xref>), which suggest that the outcome expectations subscale is measuring somewhat of a different, yet related, construct. From Bandura’s theoretical perspective, both self-efficacy and outcome expectations relate to approach behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0748175613484042">Bandura, 1977</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0748175613484042">2012</xref>) and self-efficacy does influence outcome expectations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0748175613484042">Bandura, 2012</xref>). Therefore, it is understandable that both of our subscales were significantly correlated with the PSSE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0748175613484042">Smith &amp; Betz, 2000</xref>) but at different levels.</p>
<p>There are important outcome factors that relate to social efficacy. Specifically, social self-efficacy has been shown to be positively related to college satisfaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0748175613484042">DeWitz &amp; Walsh, 2002</xref>) and life satisfaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0748175613484042">Wright &amp; Perrone, 2010</xref>) and has been negatively related to relational behaviors, such as shyness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0748175613484042">Anderson &amp; Betz, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0748175613484042">Smith &amp; Betz, 2002</xref>), social anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0748175613484042">Anderson &amp; Betz, 2001</xref>), coping, interpersonal stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0748175613484042">Matsushima &amp; Shiomi, 2003</xref>), and insecure attachment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0748175613484042">Wright &amp; Perrone, 2010</xref>). However, a lack of sufficient measures may have limited the exploration of social efficacy and it is our hope that our new scale will aid in this matter.</p>
<p>Furthermore, self-efficacy also influences the important determinant of outcome expectations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0748175613484042">Bandura, 2012</xref>) and is why we included both aspects of social expectations in relationships when developing our new scale. Researchers have also substantiated the claim that social efficacy and social outcome expectations are positively related by finding that individuals with increased scores on social self-efficacy also report higher scores of expectations of support from others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0748175613484042">Matsushima &amp; Shiomi, 2003</xref>) and increased social connectedness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0748175613484042">Williams &amp; Galliher, 2006</xref>), which may be a result of the outcome expectations in relationships. Subsequently, additional research is needed to better understand the link between social efficacy and social outcome expectations, as both are related to social relationships. By examining both of these important areas, our new scale provides additional information beyond <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0748175613484042">Smith and Betz’s (2000)</xref> social self-efficacy scale. Specifically, the advantage of our new scale also measures individuals’ outcome expectations in relationships, which may provide more detailed information related to individuals’ self-efficacy expectations in relationships that is congruent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0748175613484042">Bandura’s (1997)</xref> self-efficacy theory.</p>
<sec id="section8-0748175613484042">
<title>Practice Implications</title>
<p>It should be noted that our study only supports initial evidence for the psychometric properties of the SEOES and it is essential that further research be conducted on our scale before it is put into use. Therefore, after additional research has been conducted and construct validity continues to be established on the SEOES, counselors may be able to use this scale as an outcome measure assessing individuals’ social efficacy and outcome expectations in relationships. Given the importance of incorporating research-based measures into clinic practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0748175613484042">Ogels, Lambert, &amp; Fields, 2002</xref>), counselors could use this measure to provide feedback at the specific relational level to help them plan and augment treatment interventions accordingly. Subsequently, it may be helpful to focus interventions based on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0748175613484042">Bandura’s (1997)</xref> four sources that influence self-efficacy: performance attainments, vicarious learning, affective states, and verbal persuasion. For example, counselors could help individuals identify others that have demonstrated a strong sense of social efficacy and expect positive outcomes in their relationships. As a result, these individuals may learn vicariously from the identified person, which in turn may help them increase their social efficacy expectations and outcome expectations in relationships. Counselors may also find it helpful to examine subscale score differences in the early stages of treatment, which may offer more directed insight about individuals’ social expectations in relationships. Specifically, individuals may not believe that they have the abilities needed to effectively perform tasks in relationships but perceive positive outcome expectations from engaging in relational tasks. Therefore, counselors could focus their interventions on improving individuals’ social efficacy.</p>

<title>Limitations and Research Implications</title>
<p>Although we found robust reliability and validity evidence with data from our current sample of emerging adults in college with no gender or ethnic differences, further research is needed to validate our scale with more diverse samples. Specifically, our results were limited to a sample that consisted largely of Caucasian freshman students, and additional research is warranted to help generalize our findings. Given that only one scale has been published that was specifically designed to measure social self-efficacy in adults (i.e., PSSE, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0748175613484042">Smith &amp; Betz, 2000</xref>), our convergent validity evidence was limited and warrants further investigation.</p>
<p>Knowing that additional validity studies need to be conducted using our new scale, researchers need to specifically explore the convergent validity of the social outcome expectations subscale with similar scales measuring individuals’ expectation from engaging in relational tasks. Moreover, discriminant validity studies also need to be conducted with our scale to demonstrate that the constructs measured with our scale are not highly correlated with different constructs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0748175613484042">Heppner, Wampold, &amp; Kivlighan, 2008</xref>). For instance, researchers could examine the correlation coefficients between scores on the social efficacy subscale and social outcome expectations subscale with scores on scales that measure loneliness (e.g., UCLA-3, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0748175613484042">Russell, 1996</xref>), career barriers (POB-MV; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0748175613484042">Luzzo &amp; McWhirter, 2001</xref>), or other scales that measure any unrelated constructs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0748175613484042">DeVellis, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Similarly, more research is needed to help establish the construct validity of our measure and other related scales may aid in this process. For example, it may be helpful for researchers to use measures related to the perceived skills needed to maintain effective relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0748175613484042">Lopez, Morua, &amp; Rice, 2007</xref>), as well as measures of perceived outcomes expectations from relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0748175613484042">Foran &amp; Slep, 2007</xref>). Furthermore, researchers could also use outcome measures, such as relationship satisfaction and life satisfaction scales, along with the SEOES to assist in their understanding of the importance of social expectations in relationships. Given the cross-sectional design of our scale development, additional research is needed that employs longitudinal methods. Particularly, we did not collect data at another time point to examine the test–retest reliability of our scale and future research is desired to establish this form of reliability. The predictive validity of our measure could also be explored to help determine the effectiveness of predicting individuals’ actual abilities with effectively engaging in social relational tasks that lead to positive outcomes that they may be expecting.</p>
<p>Another limitation that warrants further research is the factor structure of our scale. Specifically, it is possible that the content of the items on our scale measures just one construct, social self-efficacy. However, a one-factor solution did not adequately fit our data and a two-factor solution demonstrated a good fit to that data with our sample. Nevertheless, researchers should continue to investigate our new scale and the factor structure across various conditions and different samples, which could be done through measurement invariance studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0748175613484042">Kline, 2011</xref>). An additional possible limitation to our scale is the number of items that comprise each subscale. Consequently, this pattern is not balanced and future research may want to explore ways to balance the items across both subscales, such as removing or adding six items to the social efficacy subscale or outcome expectations subscale, respectively, using proper scale development procedures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0748175613484042">DeVellis, 2003</xref>).</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Our new scale based on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0748175613484042">Bandura’s (1997)</xref> self-efficacy theory assesses individuals’ social self-efficacy in relationships by measuring both social efficacy expectations and social outcome expectations. However, further investigation is warranted to establish the construct validity of our scale, as well as examining the psychometric properties of data obtained from other samples. Thus, our results are limited to college students and further examination is warranted with more diverse samples. Hopefully, this novel measurement scale based on Bandura’s self-efficacy theory will enable researchers to examine the domain-specific areas of social self-efficacy and outcome expectations in relationships.</p>
