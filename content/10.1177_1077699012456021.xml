<abstract>
<p>This study tests hypotheses regarding the distribution of beliefs and knowledge about health care reform. The <italic>belief gap hypothesis</italic> suggests that in an era of political polarization, self-identification as a Democrat or Republican would be a better predictor of knowledge and beliefs about politically contested issues than would one’s educational level. Findings show that gaps in beliefs and knowledge regarding health care reform between Republicans and Democrats grew, and gaps based on educational levels disappeared.</p>

<p>The authors of the knowledge gap hypothesis raised concerns about the impact of intense media coverage in both reinforcing and increasing status inequalities among social groups.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1077699012456021">1</xref></sup> The concern was that, over time, the highly educated “information haves” would gain disproportionate amounts of knowledge relative to “information have-nots.” The knowledge gap hypothesis challenged traditional views in which the news media were seen as promoting democracy and self-government through the equal distribution of public affairs and science knowledge.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1077699012456021">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>One of the central interests of Donahue, Olien, and Tichenor’s research program was the deliberate use of knowledge distribution as a basis for the development and maintenance of power.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1077699012456021">3</xref></sup> The present study tests hypotheses consistent with assumptions in the original knowledge gap study: that media, in the service of competing elite social groups, tend to reinforce or increase existing disparities in power.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1077699012456021">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>These ideas are particularly relevant in a social environment in which political power is closely divided between competing elite political groups.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1077699012456021">5</xref></sup> When political elites are divided, media coverage of the disputed issues tends to be intense.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1077699012456021">6</xref></sup> Under conditions of political polarization and intense media coverage of disputed issues, disparities in knowledge and beliefs among political groups about the issues would be reinforced.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1077699012456021">7</xref></sup> The concern is that authoritative, nonpartisan groups are excluded from politicized debates about social problems.</p>
<p>Specifically, the present study builds and tests hypotheses about the predictive power of status group (educational attainment) versus political group identification (Republican, Independent, or Democrat) in explaining beliefs and knowledge about a heavily publicized and politically contested issue: the Affordable Care Act of 2010.</p>
<p>This article begins by reviewing the knowledge gap hypothesis and evidence regarding how well the hypothesis has held up over time.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1077699012456021">8</xref></sup> Individual-level studies designed to explicate causal relationships among indicators of socioeconomic status, motivation, and knowledge are reviewed and are then recast in terms of social organization, the approach that was anticipated by the original authors in articles tracing the evolution of the hypothesis from an emphasis on status-based knowledge differentials to an emphasis on power-based knowledge differentials among social groups.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1077699012456021">9</xref></sup> The discussion then turns to the process by which social groups and political parties became ideologically based rather than status-based collectives. This provides one explanation for why educational attainment is not predictive of knowledge gaps regarding politically contested issues. The process that links media coverage and the distribution of beliefs and knowledge among social groups is reviewed: social identification.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1077699012456021">10</xref></sup> How individuals can come to hold beliefs that are contrary to the conclusions of nonpartisan authoritative sources is then explained by reviewing studies demonstrating the biased processing effects of group affiliation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1077699012456021">11</xref></sup> Finally, the distinctions and commonalities among the concepts of beliefs and knowledge are outlined, leading to a statement of the belief gap hypothesis: its contingent conditions and assumptions. Belief gap hypotheses are then tested using national polling data with indictors of both beliefs and knowledge about health care reform.</p>
<sec id="section1-1077699012456021">
<title>Knowledge Gap Hypothesis</title>
<p>Tichenor, Donohue, and Olien originally stated the knowledge gap hypothesis as follows:
<disp-quote>
<p>As the infusion of mass media information into a social system increases, segments of the population with higher socioeconomic status tend to acquire this information at a faster rate than the lower status segments, so that the gap in knowledge between these segments tends to increase rather than decrease.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1077699012456021">12</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Although the authors defined the main independent variable as socioeconomic status, the emphasis in much of the early knowledge gap research has been on the one component of socioeconomic status that is thought to be most closely related to questions of knowledge: educational attainment. The other elements commonly viewed as components of SES—occupation and income—have not received the same degree of attention. For those studies that made the comparison, most concluded that education was more closely associated with knowledge than was income.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-1077699012456021">13</xref></sup> However, for tests of disparities in health-related knowledge among vulnerable groups, income may be more relevant than educational achievement or ethnicity.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-1077699012456021">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>In a meta-analysis that provided a quantitative test of the findings of thirty-five years of previous knowledge gap studies, Hwang and Jeong showed a consistently positive correlation between educational level and knowledge, but a nonsignificant relationship between educational attainment and the two types of knowledge gaps: interactions between education and time, and one-time differences between the strength of the knowledge–educational attainment relationship on more versus less publicized topics.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-1077699012456021">15</xref></sup> In other words, the cumulative “gap” component of the knowledge gap research has received the least support in both published and unpublished studies. This raises questions about the robustness of the “gap” portion of the knowledge gap hypothesis when educational attainment is used as an indicator of status, even though Hwang and Jeong’s meta-analysis showed that the correlations were in the hypothesized direction across all of the studies.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-1077699012456021">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>Contingent conditions, such as type of topic and type of knowledge, explained some of the differences in Hwang and Jeong’s meta-analysis. Knowledge gaps regarding social and political topics showed the highest correlations with education, while gaps in health and science knowledge showed the lowest; factual knowledge showed the strongest correlations with education, and “belief knowledge” (the number of arguments respondents listed, regardless of supporting evidence) showed the weakest correlations.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-1077699012456021">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>These findings raised intriguing questions regarding the utility of the knowledge gap hypothesis, as originally stated, in accounting for the role of the media in reinforcing and extending existing knowledge differentials among groups with different levels of socioeconomic status. These doubts can be traced back to the earliest days of the knowledge gap hypothesis when researchers sought alternative explanations for the phenomenon.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1077699012456021">
<title>Involvement, Motivation, and Interest</title>
<p>To explain inconsistent findings in previous knowledge gap research, political communication researchers shifted from a macro-level social realist perspective, in which interests were viewed as collective concerns leading to social action, to an individual voluntarism perspective that focused on individual-level agency.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-1077699012456021">18</xref></sup> Researchers turned to “internal barriers” of involvement, motivation, and interest to explain knowledge acquisition.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-1077699012456021">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>For example, Ettema and Kline suggested potential causal explanations for knowledge gaps. They hypothesized that those with greater motivation to acquire the information will do so at a faster rate than others, and that message-related factors such as ceiling effects might explain evidence of narrowing gaps.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-1077699012456021">20</xref></sup> McLeod and Perse empirically tested some of these conjectures by positioning SES (combined education and income) at the front of a structural model predicting public affairs knowledge. SES had both direct effects on knowledge, as well as indirect effects through indicators of political interest, news use, and community involvement.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-1077699012456021">21</xref></sup> In subsequent studies, motivation, interest, and involvement similarly showed interactions with education and direct effects on knowledge.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-1077699012456021">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>Interest and motivation can also be conceptualized as indicators of social organization relevant to macro-level approaches to knowledge gap research.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-1077699012456021">23</xref></sup> In this view, interest and motivation are social conditions that lead to action in the form of involvement with a political party, interest group, protest group, or other social collective.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1077699012456021">
<title>Social Status versus Social Organization</title>
<p>Donohue, Tichenor, and Olien had earlier signaled that status-based differences in knowledge acquisition regarding heavily publicized topics were but one of the ways in which media both mirror and enhance existing differentials in the social system.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-1077699012456021">24</xref></sup> Community structure and community conflict, for example, were also shown to be associated with the size of knowledge gaps in urban versus rural communities. The general finding was that media coverage of conflict involving less specialized topics in smaller communities tended to narrow knowledge gaps.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-1077699012456021">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>Knowledge gap research turned from an emphasis on social status to a broader conception of social organization. Accordingly, in a social environment characterized by political polarization, party affiliation would be particularly relevant to questions of the distribution of beliefs and knowledge about heavily publicized political controversies.</p>
<p>In this environment, social status per se becomes less important than does social group affiliation. This is because party affiliation is less associated with social status than it might have been in the past. Political parties have built coalitions by bringing disparate interest groups under the parties’ “big tents” based on ideological commonalities rather than class-based interests. For example, the Nixon administration’s “southern strategy,” in which white southerners were attracted to the Republican Party via appeals to states’ rights, and the Reagan administration’s use of policies to woo religious conservatives marked the turn toward parties coalesced on ideological interest groups rather than on socioeconomic status.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-1077699012456021">26</xref></sup></p>
<p>Of particular interest for the present study is the role of national-level partisan conflicts in activating individuals’ group-centered belief systems.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-1077699012456021">27</xref></sup> The question is, how does this linkage between media coverage and the distribution of beliefs occur?</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1077699012456021">
<title>Media, Social Identification, and Biased Processing</title>
<p>The processes by which the partisan social environment affects the distribution of beliefs are multilevel phenomena that, although not tested in the current study, are outlined in prior studies. In one scenario, misperceptions of issues backed by a scientific consensus, such as global warming or the link between cigarettes and cancer, would begin with powerful industry or trade groups mobilizing to counter the perceived threat of unfavorable policies.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-1077699012456021">28</xref></sup> Lobbyists engage political leaders and media advocates to challenge the scientific consensus and to frame the issue in partisan terms.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-1077699012456021">29</xref></sup> News media reinforce partisan frames and provide audience members with cues regarding the groups lining up on each side of the issue.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-1077699012456021">30</xref></sup> Individuals who identify with one of the groups in the controversy become more involved with the issue and interpret the message in terms of their group affilations.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-1077699012456021">31</xref></sup></p>
<p>An important part of the process by which lobbyists and politicians contest unfavorable facts is through the use of belief statements rather than claims to knowledge.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-1077699012456021">32</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1077699012456021">
<title>Beliefs versus Knowledge</title>
<p>The use of beliefs—stated opinions without corroborating evidence—as dependent variables in place of knowledge began with evidence presented in the original 1970 knowledge gap study.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-1077699012456021">33</xref></sup> In that study, the dependent variable for two of the tests was respondent acceptance of a stated belief. The assumption was that beliefs that corresponded with expert opinions (a link between cigarette smoking and cancer) or history (that man would reach the moon in the foreseeable future) were counted as equivalent to knowledge.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-1077699012456021">34</xref></sup> Hence, there is precedent for using beliefs as a stand-in for knowledge, particularly when those beliefs are corroborated by knowledge claims from nonpartisan authoritative sources.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-1077699012456021">35</xref></sup></p>
<p>Also in the original knowledge gap study, knowledge was viewed in a positivistic way as existing independent of the observer, as accumulating over time, and as being irreversible.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-1077699012456021">36</xref></sup> According to this view, knowledge results from the systematic observation and logic-based analysis of evidence.</p>
<p>The positivistic view of knowledge can be challenged based on individual- and social structural-level processes that systematically affect the perception and construction of knowledge. At the individual level, for example, evidence relevant to a controversial topic is often perceived in ways that are consistent with individual biases, thus bolstering the opinions of opposing sides and resulting in polarized opinions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-1077699012456021">37</xref></sup> At the social structural level, scientists and academics working within dominant paradigms have more influence in truth claims than those outside the mainstream.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-1077699012456021">38</xref></sup></p>
<p>Beliefs have lower standards of proof than does knowledge, but are nevertheless influential in opinion formation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-1077699012456021">39</xref></sup> Beliefs are claims about reality that are not based on evidence, but are instead based on value systems, loyalties, reference groups, social institutions, elite opinions, and ideological predispositions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-1077699012456021">40</xref></sup> Statements of both beliefs and knowledge are intrinsically cognitive processes in that each involves an individual’s claim regarding reality. In the case of beliefs, however, the statement is a subjective proposition about the attributes of some aspect of reality. Beliefs and knowledge become attitudinal when the statement of belief or knowledge claim is coupled with evaluative and behavioral components.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-1077699012456021">41</xref></sup></p>
<p>Truth claims regarding politically contested issues, even those issues on which the scientific community has come to a consensus, such as the link between human activity and climate change or the link between cigarette smoking and cancer, can be referred to as beliefs, particularly when those beliefs are congruent with the political agendas of groups with which one identifies.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-1077699012456021">42</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is plausible to expect that party affiliation would be a strong predictor of politically contested beliefs, regardless of contradictory evidence. The question being raised here is whether awareness of facts that are easily verifiable, such as specific components contained within proposed legislation and, later, laws, will also be associated with partisan predispositions. In other words, is one’s knowledge of the contents of a bill or law mediated by one’s self-identification as a Republican or Democrat? The hypothesis is that the public’s knowledge of the issue will also be shaped more by one’s identification with a political party than by the basic facts being debated. This raises serious questions about the public’s ability to understand issues on their own terms rather than in terms preferred by elected officials and their powerful constituents.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1077699012456021">
<title>Belief Gap Hypothesis</title>
<p>Building on the issues outlined above, belief gap hypotheses are (a) a higher positive correlation between partisanship and beliefs than the correlation of educational level and beliefs, and (b) a positive divergent interaction between time and partisanship in the rate of belief acceptance. The effects are expected to be observed in the aggregated opinions of individuals represented in a public opinion poll for hypothesis (a) and in independent polls fielded over time, but using the same questions, for hypothesis (b).</p>
<p>These hypotheses are assumed to be applicable under conditions of political polarization and ideologically based party consolidation, nonpartisan authoritative sources supporting one set of beliefs and not another, and heavy and sustained media coverage of an issue that identifies elite representatives of political parties taking sides on the issue.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-1077699012456021">43</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although the present study does not test all elements of this model, the following processes are assumed to be necessary for belief gaps to occur: intense and sustained media coverage, which serves to activate partisan sentiments through group identification processes, and biased processing effects of group identification, which lead to partisanship becoming a stronger predictor of beliefs and knowledge than educational attainment.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-1077699012456021">44</xref></sup></p>
<p>Evidence in support of the first part of the belief gap hypothesis, that partisanship is a better predictor of beliefs than is educational attainment, has been shown for beliefs about climate change,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-1077699012456021">45</xref></sup> abstinence-only sex education,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-1077699012456021">46</xref></sup> the religion and nationality of President Obama, whether taxes have been raised on the middle class,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-1077699012456021">47</xref></sup> homosexuality, smoking, and the safety of handguns.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn48-1077699012456021">48</xref></sup></p>
<p>The second component of the belief gap hypothesis—a positive divergent interaction between partisanship and time—was shown for beliefs about climate change.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn49-1077699012456021">49</xref></sup> A study demonstrating that beliefs contrary to evidence were as likely to be held by Democrats as Republicans showed that during the Bush administration, Republicans had higher opinions of the nation’s economy than did Democrats. When Barack Obama became president in 2008, respondents identifying with the Democratic Party switched places with Republicans in viewing the nation’s economy favorably. The study showed that group affiliations were stronger predictors than educational level of beliefs about the national economy.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn50-1077699012456021">50</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1077699012456021">
<title>Hypotheses</title>
<p>The present study uses items representing beliefs and knowledge about health care reform in national polls as the evidence by which to test the belief gap hypothesis.</p>
<p>In keeping with the <italic>belief gap hypothesis</italic>, the following are stated for testing:</p>
<list id="list1-1077699012456021" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><bold>H1a:</bold> Party identification will be a better predictor of beliefs about the value of health care reform than will education.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><bold>H1b:</bold> The relationship between party identification and beliefs about the value of health care reform will strengthen over time.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Questions about whether or not health care reform legislation would be good for one’s family or for the nation as a whole are necessarily defined as beliefs, subjective propositions about the attributes of some aspect of reality.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn51-1077699012456021">51</xref></sup> Evidence might be gathered to demonstrate that a particular family would benefit from health care reform if the family is without basic health care insurance, or if family members have preexisting health conditions that might result in being denied health insurance. Furthermore, evidence provided by nonpartisan and authoritative sources that the health care reform legislation would result in a reduction in the federal deficit might suggest that the legislation would be good for the country. Yet one could argue that one’s family is worse off if it is denied the freedom of refusing to purchase health care insurance, and the nation would be worse off if it has to pay the costs of administering a new health care bureaucracy.</p>
<p>A measure of knowledge is not an opinion about reality: It implies that facts supporting the knowledge claim are verifiable, such as whether or not proposed legislation or a law contains various components. Yet one can still claim to have a belief that the legislation or law contains a component, regardless of the facts. Contrary to the knowledge gap hypothesis, the hypothesis that is being advanced here is that party identification will be a stronger predictor of knowledge about the components contained within health care reform legislation than would educational levels.</p>
<p>Hence, the following hypotheses can be stated:</p>
<list id="list2-1077699012456021" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><bold>H2a:</bold> Party identification will be a better predictor of knowledge about the contents of the health care reform legislation and law than will education.</p></list-item>

<title>Method</title>
<p>This study used five tracking surveys sponsored by the Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF) that were fielded by Princeton Survey Associates before the health care reform legislation passed and two tracking surveys fielded after the bills were signed into law.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn52-1077699012456021">52</xref></sup> Predictor variables included age, sex, race, income, education, party, issue interest (for <bold>H1a</bold> and <bold>H1b</bold>), education × time, and party × time.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn53-1077699012456021">53</xref></sup></p>

<title>H1a and H1b Dependent Variables</title>
<p>An indicator of beliefs about the value of the legislation for family/nation was constructed by adding two items (<italic>r</italic> = .76) resulting in a scale ranging from 2 to 6 (<italic>M</italic> = 4.3, <italic>SD</italic> = 2.6): “Do you think—you and your family—would be (better off) or (worse off) if the president and Congress passed health care reform, or don’t you think it would make much difference?” (item was recoded so that 1 = <italic>worse off</italic>, 2 = <italic>don’t think it would make much difference</italic>, and 3 = <italic>better off</italic>) and “Do you think—the country as a whole—would be (better off) or (worse off) if the president and Congress passed health care reform, or don’t you think it would make much difference?” (item was recoded so that 1 = <italic>worse off</italic>, 2 = <italic>don’t think it would make much difference</italic>, and 3 = <italic>better off</italic>). Although this scale measuring the value of health care reform has not been subject to psychometric tests of validity, it has face validity as an indicator of beliefs about the value of health care reform.</p>

<title>H2a and H2b Dependent Variables</title>
<p>Items measuring knowledge about components contained within the health care reform legislation were included in polls fielded before and after the legislation passed (Kaiser Health Tracking Poll, January, April, and June 2010). Hence, the wording of the statement preceding the series of questions varied slightly.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn56-1077699012456021">56</xref></sup></p>
<p>Knowledge items that were used in all three surveys were limited to four items, each of which was administered to half the sample of respondents:<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn57-1077699012456021">57</xref></sup>
<disp-quote>
<p>I’m going to read you a list of specific reform proposals. For each, please tell me whether you think it is included in the health care reform legislation being discussed in Congress or not. First, to the best of your knowledge, would you say the legislation being debated does or does not: Require nearly all Americans to have health insurance or else pay a fine; Gradually close the Medicare prescription drug “doughnut hole” or “coverage gap” so seniors will no longer be required to pay the full cost of their medications when they reach the gap; Impose a tax on insurers who offer the most expensive health plans, also called Cadillac plans, to help pay for health reform; Create health insurance exchanges or marketplaces where small businesses and people who don’t get coverage through their employers can shop for insurance and compare prices and benefits.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Because the bill/law contained all of the components mentioned, answers were coded so that responses of does include the feature or, if volunteered, “the House (or Senate) version does, but the Senate (or House) version does not” include the feature were scored as 1. Reponses that the bill/law does not include the feature were coded as 0.</p>
<p>Correct answers to the four items were summed for each participant, creating an index ranging from 0 to 4 (<italic>M</italic> = 2.4, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.2). The distribution exhibited significant levels of skew and kurtosis, so a Poisson regression was used for the analysis. Because the items represent counts of correct responses and not underlying concepts, measures of internal consistency were not necessary.</p>
<p>Data were analyzed using version 17 of SPSS.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>The first pair of hypotheses dealt with beliefs about the value of health care legislation for one’s family and the country. <bold>H1a</bold> stated that <italic>party identification will be a better predictor of beliefs about the value of health care reform than will education.</italic> <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1077699012456021">Table 2</xref> shows that the hypothesis was supported in that the standardized regression coefficient for party was statistically significant (β = .41, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), whereas the coefficient for education was not. It is also worth noting that demographic indicators of age, sex, race, and income were statistically significant, with younger, female, nonwhites from lower income groups seeing the highest value in health care reform. These findings make sense in that these are the groups that are most likely to benefit from health care reform. Interestingly, issue interest was statistically significant, but in a negative direction. In other words, those who reported more closely following discussions in Washington about health care reform were less likely to see the value of the proposed legislation to one’s family and country. This finding may be a reflection of the stridency of the coverage of both supporters and opponents of the bill.</p>

For Republicans, the trend was generally downward, with the steep decline between December and January indicating that the respondents thought their country and families would be generally worse off if the health care reform legislation passed. The trend for Democrats was relatively steady, and for Independents it was up sharply in November but returned to the previous levels for December and January.</p>

<p>The second pair of hypotheses predicted that knowledge about the components contained within the bill would also be more a function of party identification than educational level, and that the gaps between parties would grow over time. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1077699012456021">Table 3</xref>, model 5, shows that the unstandardized Poisson regression coefficient for party identification was in the expected direction and was statistically significant (<italic>B</italic> = 0.07, <italic>SE</italic> = 0.01, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), whereas the coefficient for education was not.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The study included a test of hypotheses regarding the distribution of beliefs and knowledge about health care reform legislation. The goal was to extend the knowledge gap hypothesis to account for public opinion during an era of unprecedented partisanship. The focus was on the impact of the partisan political climate on beliefs and knowledge regarding a controversial public policy issue: health care reform.</p>
<p>First, the study showed that belief gaps regarding the value of health care reform for families and the country developed during the months leading up to the March 2010 passage of the legislation. The gap between Republicans and Democrats grew significantly during the five months included in the study. Republicans were less likely to see value in the legislation for either their families or for the country, and saw significantly less value in January 2010 than in September 2009.</p>
<p>The study also showed that belief gaps apply, in part, to traditionally defined indicators of knowledge, whether or not the health care reform legislation contained specific components. Party identification was a significant predictor of knowledge about components contained within the legislation, whereas educational level was not. Furthermore, the gaps in knowledge between Democrats and Republicans grew significantly over time.</p>
<p>Assumptions in the work of the original authors of the knowledge gap study are informed by these findings. One is that knowledge is cumulative and irreversible.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn58-1077699012456021">58</xref></sup> The present study shows that Republicans appeared to know less about the components in the health care law in April of 2010 than they did three months earlier. In an era of political polarization in which political elites map themselves into intractable positions opposite that of their opponents, knowledge of heavily publicized and politically contested issues does not accumulate; instead, <italic>beliefs about knowledge</italic> accumulate in directions that serve the political objectives of the parties.</p>
<p>Another assumption that is informed by this study is the claim that social conflict may, under certain conditions, result in the narrowing of status-based knowledge gaps.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn59-1077699012456021">59</xref></sup> The data in this study showed that status-based knowledge gaps, with status measured as educational attainment, were not significant, and that instead gaps based on social group identification in the form of party identification grew. This confirms the original authors’ revision of the knowledge gap from an emphasis on status-based differences to the more broadly conceived emphasis on power-based differentials among social groups.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn60-1077699012456021">60</xref></sup> In this perspective, previous research showing the importance of involvement and issue interest in affecting knowledge is relevant—particularly when the involvement and interest is with political parties.</p>
<p>Although it was not tested directly in this study, the findings are consistent with the conclusion that media coverage of political controversies serves to transmit social identification cues to citizens and that group identification may override knowledge that is contrary to those beliefs.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn61-1077699012456021">61</xref></sup> Also untested in this study but consistent with previous research is the possibility that selective exposure processes are also likely contributing to belief gaps. That is, exposure to partisan media, both traditional and online, as well as selective perception of balanced reporting by fact-based journalism contribute to belief gaps.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn62-1077699012456021">62</xref></sup></p>
<p>In general, these are troubling findings for those who believe that democracy depends on a factual discussion of issues.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn63-1077699012456021">63</xref></sup> The findings, however, are consistent with conclusions in the original knowledge gap study: media, particularly when in the service of competing elite social groups, tend to reinforce or increase existing disparities in power.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn64-1077699012456021">64</xref></sup> In a polarized political environment, political elites in the service of powerful constituents redefine knowledge as partisan beliefs and beliefs about knowledge. News media distribution and amplification of partisan beliefs help transform knowledge into a strategy for political gain rather than an indispensible component of self-government.</p>
<p>Limitations of the current study include a lack of psychometric testing of the two-item indicator of beliefs used for the first pair of hypotheses, a lack of media exposure and attention indicators in each sample, and a lack of indicators that would allow for a full test of the model in which media exposure/attention leads to group identification processes which override cognitive processes. Addressing these issues would require a more comprehensive battery of knowledge items regarding the components of the bill.</p>
<p>Future research will address these limitations, and will include tests of the dynamic nature of gaps in relation to variation in the volume and nature of media coverage of politically contested issues.</p>

<p>Age is in years. For sex, 1 = <italic>male</italic>, 2 = <italic>female</italic>. Race is recoded so 1 = <italic>white</italic>, 0 = <italic>other races, ethnicities</italic>. Income is an 8-point ordinal scale representing the previous year’s total family income before taxes, in which 1 = <italic>less than $20,000</italic> and 8 = <italic>$100,000 or more</italic>. Education is a 7-point ordinal scale in which 1 = <italic>none or grade 1–8</italic>, 8 = <italic>postgraduate or professional schooling after college, e.g., toward a master’s degree or PhD, law or medical school</italic>. Party was coded so that 1 = <italic>Republican</italic>, 2 = <italic>Independent or “other,”</italic> 3 = Democrat. For <bold>H1a</bold> and <bold>H1b</bold>, an indicator of issue interest was measured by asking respondents “How closely have you been following discussions in Washington about health care reform? Very closely, somewhat closely, not too closely or not at all?” (recoded so that 1 = <italic>not closely at all</italic> and 4 = <italic>very closely</italic>). The issue interest indicator was not available in the polls used for <bold>H2a</bold> and <bold>H2b</bold>. Indicators of time represented months for each set of hypotheses. For <bold>H1a</bold> and <bold>H1b</bold>, the time indicator ranged from 1 for the September 2009 poll to 5 for the January 2010 poll. For <bold>H2a</bold> and <bold>H2b</bold>, the time indicator represents months since the first poll in the series, so that the January 2010 poll was coded as 0, the April 2010 poll was 3, and the June 2010 poll was 5. For both studies, interaction terms for education × time and party × time were created by standardizing and multiplying the values.</p>

<p>The weighted demographics of the Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF) samples resembled those of the 2010 U.S. census. For age categories, the KFF samples were slightly older than the U.S. 18+ population in 2010. The census data for the 18+ age category are as follows: 13% were 18–24, and the weighted KFF samples ranged from 10% to 12%; 18% were 25–34, and the weighted KFF samples ranged from 16% to 18%; 18% were 35–44, and the weighted KFF samples ranged from 18% to 19%; 19% were 45–54, and the weighted KFF samples were 20%; 15% were 55–64, and the weighted KFF samples ranged from 15% to 16%; 17% were 65+, and the weighted KFF samples ranged from 16% to 19%. The percentage of the population identifying its race as white or white plus another race was 75% in the 2010 census, and the weighted KFF samples ranged from 72% to 80% white. In the 2010 U.S. census, of the 18+ population, 52% were female and 48% male, whereas the KFF samples were weighted to 51% female and 49% male. In the 2010 U.S. census, the percentage of the U.S. 18+ population with a BA or higher was 28.2 and for the combined KFF samples was 29.2%. Income categories in the 2010 census showed 20% of households had family incomes of less than $20K, while the KFF samples ranged from 15 to 21; 12% of U.S. households had $20K to less than $30K, while KFF samples ranged from 11% to 16%; 10% of U.S. households earned $30K to less than $40k, while the KFF samples ranged from 9% to 16%; 9% of U.S. households had incomes of $40K to less than $50K, and the KFF samples ranged from 10% to 14%; 18% of U.S. households had incomes between $50K and less than $75K, and the KFF samples ranged from 14% to 18%; 8% of households had incomes between $75K and less than $90K, and the KFF samples ranged from 3% to 7%; 4% were between $90K and less than $100k, and the KFF samples ranged from 3% to 7%; 20% of U.S. households had incomes over $100k, whereas the KFF samples ranged from 10% to 17%. Hence, the upper and lower income categories were underrepresented in the survey samples.</p>

<p>In January 2010, the heading read, “I’m going to read you a list of specific reform proposals. For each, please tell me whether you think it is included in the health care reform legislation being discussed in Congress or not. First, to the best of your knowledge, would you say the legislation being debated does or does not (items inserted in random order)?” In April 2010, the introduction was changed so that the phrase “legislation being debated” became “health care reform bill recently passed by Congress and signed into law by the president.” In June 2010, the phrase “health care reform bill recently passed by Congress and signed into law by the president” was changed to “new health reform law.”</p>

<p>A statistical comparison of the demographic indicators across the split-half samples showed no significant differences. An analysis of the knowledge items in the unused split halves of each sample showed similar results regarding the strength of party identification versus educational attainment in predicting knowledge about the bill/law.</p>
