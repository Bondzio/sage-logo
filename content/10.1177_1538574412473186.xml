<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The placement of an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter is a well established and effective method to prevent lethal and sublethal pulmonary embolism (PE) in patients with deep venous thrombosis (DVT) who otherwise cannot be anticoagulated.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1538574412473186">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1538574412473186">2</xref>
</sup> The percutaneous, image-guided placement of an IVC filter is typically done under fluoroscopic guidance with contrast venography.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1538574412473186">3</xref>
</sup> This procedure can be safely and quickly performed but is limited by several factors including the transportation of critically ill patients, wait times for available procedure rooms, concerns regarding exposure to radiation, and the use of nephrotoxic contrast material in patients who may have compromised renal function. Several alternative techniques for IVC filter placement have been proposed that attempt to circumvent the aforementioned limitations of traditional fluoroscopic guidance.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1538574412473186">4</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1538574412473186"/>

</sup> One such alternative method for image guidance is intravascular ultrasound (IVUS). The IVUS-guided IVC filter placement can be performed at the patient’s bedside and without the use of fluoroscopy, thereby alleviating the problems associated with patient transport, ionizing radiation, and nephrotoxic contrast material. Indeed, IVUS-guided placement of IVC filters has been shown to be safe, effective, and minimally invasive.<sup>

</p>
<p>The IVUS-guided IVC filter placement using a double-puncture technique within the femoral vein (either 2 access sites in 1 femoral vein or bilateral femoral venous access) allows for real-time IVUS guidance during filter deployment. Such technique, however, is often associated with higher access site complications and prolonged procedure times in comparison to a single venous puncture technique.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1538574412473186">15</xref>
</sup> Moreover, it is unclear whether direct supervision of filter deployment using real-time IVUS guidance, which necessitates the double-puncture technique, improves positioning compared to filter deployment without real-time IVUS guidance (as occurs in a single-puncture technique). Therefore, in order to help answer these questions, we retrospectively reviewed our experience with IVUS-guided IVC filter placement within an interventional radiology (IR) division using a single-puncture technique over a 7-year period.</p>

<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<p>This study was approved by our institutional review board and is Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act compliant. Since this retrospective study was limited to the review of medical records and imaging examinations, the requirement to obtain informed consent was waived. There were 99 patients (60 males and 39 females) who underwent IVUS-guided IVC filter placement by an interventional radiologist at our institution between January 1, 2005 and December 31, 2011. The patients’ median age was 58.8 years (range: 19-91 years). The patients’ medical records were reviewed for procedure indication, filter type, site of approach, location where the procedure was performed, type of anesthesia, vascular anomalies, position of the filter, the presence of DVT or PE prior to filter placement, follow-up imaging, and potential complications. Pertinent data were collected from hospital and clinic notes, discharge summaries, and imaging records.</p>
<p>The indications for IVC filter placement in the 99 patients are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1538574412473186">Table 1</xref>. Patients with trauma (n = 4), recent or impending surgery (n = 7), intracranial hemorrhage (n = 11), or spinal cord injury (n = 2) comprised 86% (n = 24) of the 28 patients needing IVC filters for prophylactic purposes. On preprocedural imaging, 26% (n = 26) of the patients had DVT, 29% (n = 29) had both DVT and PE, and 16% (n = 16) had PE only. There was 1 patient in our series who had a known duplicated IVC prior to filter placement; thus, the prevalence of a duplicated IVC in this series is in keeping with published data.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1538574412473186">16</xref>
</sup> The IVC filter in this patient was purposefully placed in a suprarenal location and is considered a successful placement in data calculations.</p>

<p>In all, 41% (n = 41) of the IVC filters were placed at the patient’s bedside and 59% (n = 58) were placed in the IR suite, with fluoroscopy available, if needed. The IVUS guidance was used in the IR suite primarily for teaching purposes (42 of 58 cases) and also to avoid using nephrotoxic contrast material in 13 patients with compromised renal function and because of contrast allergy in 3 patients. Most patients (81%, n = 80) received only local anesthesia but 17% (n = 17) received conscious sedation. Two patients (2%) received general anesthesia for the procedure because they were considered too unstable to receive sedation without anesthetist monitoring (one patient had undergone recent liver transplantation and the other had a left ventricular ejection fraction of only 22%).</p>
<p>Our technique for IVUS-guided IVC filter placement was as follows: preprocedural duplex ultrasonography was utilized to exclude venous thrombosis at the site of vascular access. Access was then obtained with an 18G needle and a 0.035 in J guide wire was advanced into the IVC. The right common femoral vein approach (82%, n = 81) was most commonly used, followed by the left common femoral vein in 15% (n = 15), and the right internal jugular vein in 3% (n = 3). The needle was then exchanged for an 11F short vascular access sheath after serial dilation of the venotomy site. An 11-F IVUS catheter (Volcano; Rancho Cordova, California) was introduced over the guidewire into the IVC to the level of the right atrium. Using pullback technique, the level of the renal veins was identified by IVUS. At this point, the intravascular portion of the IVUS catheter was measured and this same length was marked on the exterior of the 6.5-F IVC filter introducer sheath. The IVUS catheter was then exchanged over the wire for the filter introducer sheath, which was then advanced until the external mark on the catheter was at the hub of the 11-F introducer sheath. The filter was then deployed according to the manufacturer’s instructions for use. A repeat evaluation of the IVC with the IVUS catheter was then performed to check the location of the filter relative to the renal veins. In all, 96 patients (97%) received either intraprocedural abdominal radiographs with the fluoroscopic C-arm (n = 42; 42%) or postprocedural abdominal radiographs (n = 54; 55%) to document filter position in relation to boney structures. The remaining 3 (3%) patients had the position of their filters assessed by intraprocedural IVUS only. Of note, all patients who had IVUS-guided filters placed at the bedside received follow-up abdominal radiographs to document filter position in relation to boney structures. The types of filters placed are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1538574412473186">Table 2</xref>.</p>

<p>A technically successful procedure was defined as placement of the filter in the infrarenal IVC (unless specifically stated otherwise). Clinical success was defined as absence of postprocedural PE or progression of existing PE. Complications of the procedure were defined as groin hematoma, postprocedural DVT at the site of vascular access, arteriovenous fistulas at the site of vascular access, femoral pseudoaneurysms at the site of vascular access, infection, and filter tilt of &gt;15° in relation to the long axis of the IVC. Delayed complications were defined as filter leg fracture, filter migration, caval thrombosis, filter protruding greater than 3 mm through the IVC wall, and death related to filter placement.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1538574412473186">
<title>Results</title>
<p>Filters were successfully deployed in their intended location in 93 of the 99 patients (technical success rate = 94%). Two (2%) filters were unintentionally deployed in a suprarenal location within the IVC. Four (4%) filters were inadvertently deployed within the iliac veins, all of which occurred at the patient’s bedside rather than the IR suite. The 4 filters deployed in the iliac veins were detected on the day of the procedure in each case by postprocedural abdominal radiographs. These 4 patients were all subsequently brought down to the IR suite on the same day for filter repositioning within the IVC which, in each case, was done under traditional fluoroscopic guidance using a right internal jugular vein approach without the use IVUS. There were no cases of new or progressive PE after filter placement in any of the 28 patients who had follow-up, contrast-enhanced chest computed tomographies (CTs; clinical success rate = 100%).</p>
<p>In all, 96 (97%) patients received either intraprocedural abdominal radiographs with the fluoroscopic C-arm or postprocedural abdominal radiographs to document filter position in relation to boney structures, including all 41 patients whose filters were placed at the bedside. The positioning of the other 3% of the filters was assessed by intraprocedural IVUS only. The positioning of 93% of the filters (89/96) on radiography was found to be at the L1-L3 vertebral level, which was considered appropriate for the infrarenal IVC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1538574412473186">Figure 1A</xref>). Of the malpositioned filters on radiography, 1 was suggested to be suprarenal ((<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1538574412473186">Figure 1B</xref>), which was confirmed by a follow-up abdominal CT), 2 were suggested to have more than 15°of tilt in relation to the long axis of the IVC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1538574412473186">Figure 1C</xref>), which was confirmed by follow-up abdominal CT), and 4 were in the iliac veins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1538574412473186">Figure 1D</xref>). One filter that was determined to be appropriately positioned by radiography was actually found to be in suprarenal position on a follow-up abdominal CT. Of note, 33.3% (n = 33) of the patients also underwent an abdominal CT within 6 months of filter placement, which accurately characterized the position of the filter in all the cases.</p>

<p>Procedure-related complications, the majority of which were minor, are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1538574412473186">Table 3</xref>. In 1 patient with a postprocedural access site DVT, the DVT extended into the IVC requiring catheter-directed thrombolysis. The patient did not develop PE and the thrombus resolved on follow-up ultrasound (US) studies. There were no arteriovenous fistulas, pseudoaneurysms, or infections at the access site. Delayed complications included &gt;3 mm of penetration into the caval wall by the filter legs (4%, n = 4), caval thrombosis below the level of the filter (2%, n = 2), and filter leg fracture (1%, n = 1). It should be noted, however, that the fracture of the filter leg was subsequently found to be a problem inherent to the filter itself rather than with the procedure. There were no filter migrations or deaths associated with filter placement.</p>

<p>Caval interruption with an IVC filter is a well-documented and highly effective method to prevent lethal and sublethal PE,<sup>

</sup> Fluoroscopy with contrast venography continues to be the “gold standard” for imaging guidance when placing IVC filters but this method is not without limitations. Although the requisite contrast material may be as little as 20 cc<sup>3</sup>, its use may be relatively contraindicated in patients with compromised renal function as was the case for 13 patients in this series. Moreover, the use of contrast material may not be possible in patients with a contrast allergy as was the case for 3 patients in this series. Finally, traditional fluoroscopic guidance typically requires that the patient travel to an operating room or angiography suite, which creates the challenge of arranging for appropriate patient care and monitoring during transport and managing the multiple monitors, lines, and tubes that frequently accompany this patient population.</p>
<p>Several alternative methods of image guidance for the placement of an IVC filter have been proposed. For example, authors have advocated the use of transabdominal duplex US to guide IVC filter placement at the bedside; however, such technique is often limited by its ability to accurately identify the renal veins secondary to soft tissue edema and overlying bowel gas.<sup>

</sup> Other authors have proposed the use of portable fluoroscopic C-arms in lieu of transporting the patient to the angiography suite, although this proposal is limited by the availability of such equipment, sufficient space within the patient’s room, and the continued use of nephrotoxic contrast material.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1538574412473186">5</xref>
</sup> Carbon dioxide venography is another proposed alternative which obviates the need for nephrotoxic contrast material but still requires patient transport.<sup>

</sup> Using IVUS as guidance for the placement of IVC filters alleviates many of the limitations encountered with traditional fluoroscopic guidance. Technical limitations of IVUS guidance include the relative inability of IVUS to detect vascular anomalies such as duplicated IVC, circumaortic left renal vein, mega cava, and accessory renal veins in comparison to traditional contrast venography.</p>
<p>The IVUS-guided placement of IVC filters is a safe, effective, and minimally invasive alternative to fluoroscopic guidance.<sup>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1538574412473186">8</xref>

</sup> Using a single-venous puncture technique and without the use of real-time US during filter deployment, we had a technical success rate of 94% (n = 93/99), comparable to those of prior reports (94%-100%) in which the authors have used a double-puncture technique within the femoral vein and real-time US during filter deployment.<sup>

</sup> These findings demonstrate that using a single-puncture technique without real-time US during filter deployment is just as technically feasible and successful as the double-puncture technique, while having the advantage of requiring less time and materials. The clinical success of filters placed under IVUS-guidance in the prevention of new or progressive PE was 100%. Although one advantage of IVUS-guided IVC filter placement is the ability to perform the procedure at the patient’s bedside, we found that filters were more likely to be malpositioned if the procedure was done at the patient’s bedside rather than in the IR suite (risk ratio: 1.17,<italic>P</italic> = .01). The reasons for this difference are unclear and likely multifactorial but did not appear to be related to the type of filter used or operator experience. One potential explanation may be that patients who are unable to travel to the IR suite may also be difficult to optimally position on the hospital bed for the procedure as well. Nonetheless, 4 of the 6 malpositioned filters in this series were deployed within the iliac veins and were repositioned within the IVC on the same day as the original IVUS-guided procedure under traditional fluoroscopic guidance without additional complications. Two of the malpositioned filters were deployed in a suprarenal location and were not adjusted within the IVC because prior reports have found this location to not portend any increased risk of PE.<sup>

</p>
<p>The IVUS-guided IVC filter placement is an extremely safe procedure with the most common complication in the reported literature being DVT at the site of vascular access occurring in approximately 4% to 5% of the patients.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1538574412473186">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1538574412473186">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1538574412473186">13</xref>
</sup> Although the earliest reports of using IVUS guidance for IVC filter placement used a single-puncture technique,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1538574412473186">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1538574412473186">11</xref>
</sup> the majority of the current literature reports the use of a double-puncture technique and real-time US guidance during filter deployment. A recent report examining 2 different types of filters also found that venous access site DVTs occurred more frequently in patients in which a double-puncture technique was used instead of a single-puncture technique.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1538574412473186">15</xref>
</sup> As such, we were interested in comparing our rates of venous access site DVT with those seen using a double-puncture technique. We found that only 2% (n = 2) of the patients in our series developed DVT at the site of vascular access, which is lower than the reported rates using the double-puncture technique.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1538574412473186">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1538574412473186">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1538574412473186">21</xref>
</sup> In one patient with postprocedural DVT, the thrombus did extend into the IVC requiring catheter-directed thrombolysis by IR; however, neither patient with post-procedural DVT developed PE. The most common procedural complication in our series was groin hematoma (4%, n = 4), whose incidence was similar to that of prior reports which used a double-puncture technique .<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1538574412473186">17</xref>
</sup> Therefore, the current data suggests that the use of a single-puncture technique results in fewer venous access site complications than the double-puncture method.</p>
<p>This study is limited by several factors including its retrospective nature and the academic environment in which it was produced. Specifically, 42 patients in this series had their IVC filters placed under IVUS guidance rather than under traditional fluoroscopic guidance for teaching purposes. One could imagine differing results if all patients in this series required IVUS guidance because of critical illness and/or the inability to travel to the angiography suite, which might have resulted in more malpositioned filters or procedural complications. Conversely, one could also imagine improved outcomes if all filters had been placed by more experienced operators in a private setting, rather than radiology residents and fellows being supervised by an attending radiologist. Regardless, the current data suggest that IVUS-guided IVC filter placement using a single-puncture technique is as technically successful and effective in the prevention of PE as a double-puncture technique that uses real-time US during filter deployment and results in less venous access site complications.</p>
