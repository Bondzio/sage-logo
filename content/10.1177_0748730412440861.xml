<p>A fundamental role of the circadian clock is to control biochemical and physiological processes such that they occur an optimal time of day. One of the most significant clock outputs from a clinical as well as basic biological standpoint is the timing of the cell cycle. Here we show that the circadian clock regulates the timing of mitosis in a light-responsive, clock-containing zebrafish cell line. Disrupting clock function, using a <italic>CLOCK1</italic> dominant-negative construct or constant light, blocks the gating of cell division, demonstrating that this mitotic rhythm is cell autonomous and under control of the circadian pacemaker. Quantitative PCR reveals that several key mitotic genes, including <italic>Cyclin B1, Cyclin B2</italic>, and <italic>cdc2</italic>, are rhythmically expressed and clock-controlled. Peak expression of these genes occurs at a critical phase required to gate mitosis to the late night/early morning. Using clock and cell cycle luminescent reporter zebrafish cell lines, we show that light strongly represses not only circadian clock function, but also mitotic gene expression, and consequently slows cell proliferation.</p>

<p>A major role of the circadian pacemaker is to regulate behavioral and physiological processes such that they occur at an optimal time of day, relative to the environment, as well as to each other. Over the past decade, we have seen a dramatic increase in our understanding of the core circadian clock mechanism, but much less is known about how the clock regulates downstream, rhythmic outputs. One of the most significant biological processes influenced by the circadian clock is the timing or “gating” of the cell cycle. Circadian rhythms in cell division were described in mammalian tissues, including liver, in vivo more than 50 years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0748730412440861">Halberg, 1960</xref>) and have now been shown to exist in a wide range of organisms from unicellular algae to humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0748730412440861">Johnson, 2010</xref>). More recent studies, which have begun to explore the possible underlying mechanisms, have also revealed a circadian rhythm in mitosis in mouse liver undergoing regeneration, following partial hepatectomy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0748730412440861">Matsuo et al., 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Many factors could play a role in regulating this clock-cell cycle link in the whole animal, including rhythms in hormonal and humoral signals, metabolic influences, and neural signals from central pacemakers. Recent studies, however, have revealed the presence of independent circadian clocks within individual cells, both in cultured tissues and in dispersed cell cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0748730412440861">Nagoshi et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0748730412440861">Welsh et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0748730412440861">Carr and Whitmore, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0748730412440861">Liu et al., 2007</xref>). This has raised the obvious question of whether single cell oscillators can also regulate the timing of the cell cycle autonomously, an issue that is currently under some debate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0748730412440861">Nagoshi et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0748730412440861">Yeom et al., 2010</xref>). If this is the case, does disruption of circadian clock function alter cell cycle timing and cell proliferation rates in culture? If so, how does intracellular coupling between these two oscillators occur? In the case of liver regeneration in vivo, it has been shown from studies in <italic>Cryptochrome-</italic>deficient and <italic>Clock</italic> mutant mice that the timing of mitosis is clock-gated. Rhythmic expression of the cell cycle regulator <italic>Wee1</italic> appears to play a critical role in this gating process through its phosphorylation of the Cyclin B1/CDC2 complex, an event that blocks entry into mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0748730412440861">Matsuo et al., 2003</xref>). But is this regulation also occurring in individual cells in vitro, and if so, is the involvement of <italic>Wee1</italic> universal, or is its regulation tissue-specific?</p>
<p>Addressing these questions in mammalian cell lines is possible, but is complicated by the fact that treatments used to synchronize the circadian pacemaker, such as serum shock or dexamethasone pulses, are also likely to influence the cell cycle directly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0748730412440861">Balsalobre et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0748730412440861">Balsalobre et al., 2000</xref>). Manipulating the mammalian clock in culture using natural, biologically relevant zeitgebers (or synchronizers) without affecting the cell cycle is therefore extremely difficult. The situation may be easier to explore in zebrafish, since the circadian system as a whole is far more decentralized. Isolated adult tissues contain directly light-responsive circadian clocks, and the same is true for individual cells derived from early stage zebrafish embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0748730412440861">Whitmore et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0748730412440861">Carr and Whitmore, 2005</xref>). There is currently no evidence in zebrafish for a central “master” pacemaker coordinating these peripheral oscillators. The direct light sensitivity of zebrafish tissues and cells means that the circadian clock itself is rapidly and directly entrained following light exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0748730412440861">Carr and Whitmore, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0748730412440861">Tamai et al., 2007</xref>). In developing zebrafish embryos and embryonic cell lines, the timing of DNA replication is restricted to the late day/early evening, suggesting some degree of cell autonomy to this aspect of clock-cell cycle regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0748730412440861">Dekens et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0748730412440861">Dickmeis et al., 2007</xref>). However, is this gating of S phase purely light-driven in zebrafish or due to the direct action of the circadian clock? Moreover, are other phases of the cell cycle, such as mitosis, also clock-regulated in zebrafish cells? At this time, surprisingly little is known about the underlying molecular links between the circadian clock and the cell cycle in this species. The aim of this study is to address some of these key issues in this unique model system.</p>
<p>Here we demonstrate a clear circadian regulation of mitotic timing in zebrafish cells, with the number of actively dividing cells showing a peak in the late night/early morning. Generating clock mutant cells by overexpressing a <italic>CLOCK1</italic> dominant-negative (DN) construct blocks rhythms in mitosis, and exposing clock mutant cells to a light-dark (LD) cycle is unable to drive or “mask” this process. These results reveal for the first time that the circadian pacemaker, and not light, is the principal regulator of the cell cycle in this system, since activation of the light input pathway alone is not sufficient to drive a mitotic rhythm. In addition, we show a clear circadian oscillation in the expression of several key mitotic genes, which corresponds to the timing of spontaneous, rhythmic mitotic activity in these cells. The generation of a <italic>Cyclin B1</italic> luminescent reporter cell line allows us to follow mitotic gene expression dynamically. Interestingly, sustained light strongly represses the expression of <italic>Cyclin B1</italic>, as well as other key mitotic regulators, and consequently slows cell proliferation. Light exposure of zebrafish cells and tissues has been previously shown to induce the sustained expression of <italic>Cryptochrome 1a (Cry1a)</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0748730412440861">Hirayama et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0748730412440861">Tamai et al., 2007</xref>). Overexpression of <italic>Cry1a</italic> mimics the effects of light on the mitotic rhythm and cell proliferation, suggesting that it is a key light-induced regulator of the cell cycle through its ability to block pacemaker function. Furthermore, disrupting the circadian pacemaker itself, in clock mutant cells, can mimic this result, showing that a functional clock is required for optimal cell proliferation rates in a normal, nonmalignant cell line.</p>

<title>Zebrafish Cell Lines</title>
<p>PAC2 cells were derived from 24-h zebrafish embryos, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0748730412440861">Whitmore et al., 2000</xref>). A clonal <italic>Period 1 (Per1)-luciferase</italic> cell line was established from PAC2 cells and isolated by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) using previously established methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0748730412440861">Tamai et al., 2007</xref>). To generate <italic>Cyclin B1-luciferase</italic> zebrafish cell lines, genomic DNA fragments 4.0 kb and 0.9 kb upstream of the zebrafish <italic>Cyclin B1</italic> translational start site were amplified by PCR from bacterial artificial chromosome clone HUKGB735K07267Q8 (German Resource Center for Genome Research) and subcloned into pGL3-Basic (Promega) to create plasmids pGL3-Cyclin B1 (4.0) and pGL3-Cyclin B1 (0.9). These constructs were linearized along with vector pcDNA3.1/myc-His A (Invitrogen) and electroporated into PAC2 cells using the Cell Line Nucleofector Kit V and program T-20 (Amaxa Biosystems). Following neomycin selection, pooled populations of transfected cells were plated, and bioluminescence was monitored as described below. For some experiments, single cells were isolated by FACS, and clonal <italic>Cyclin B1-luciferase</italic> cell lines were established. Quantitative PCR analysis showed that the 4.0 kb and 0.9 kb fragments of the <italic>Cyclin B1</italic> promoter regulated expression of luciferase, which matched that of the endogenous <italic>Cyclin B1</italic> gene. To determine whether the only E-box–related elements in the <italic>Cyclin B1</italic> promoter, one E-box (CACGTG) and one E′-box (AACGTG), are important for rhythmic expression of this gene, the region containing these sequences was deleted from the 0.9 kb promoter fragment by PCR, restriction digestion, and religation, resulting in plasmid pGL3-Cyclin B1 (0.9) delta E. A potential retinoid-related orphan receptor regulatory element (RRE) in the 0.9 kb fragment of the <italic>Cyclin B1</italic> promoter was also mutated, alone or in combination with the E-box deletions, using gene synthesis (Geneart), and these fragments were subcloned into pGL3-Basic. These plasmids were transfected into PAC2 cells as above, and stable luminescent cell lines were generated.</p>

<title>Retroviral Constructs and Transfections</title>
<p>Plasmid pCLNCX is a retroviral expression vector and part of the Retromax expression system for retroviral transfections (Imgenex). For our overexpression studies, zebrafish cells were transfected with the pCLNCX empty vector as a control. Plasmid pCLNC.Flag containing the Flag tag (MDYKDDDDK) was created by subcloning hybridized oligos encoding this sequence into retroviral expression vector pCLNCX (Imgenex). pCLNC.Flag-CLOCK1 DN was generated by subcloning a 1.2 kb fragment of zebrafish <italic>CLOCK1</italic>, encoding amino acids 1-389 and lacking the putative C-terminal transactivation domain, in-frame with the Flag sequence. The pCLNC.HA-Cry1a plasmid has been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0748730412440861">Tamai et al., 2007</xref>).

<title>Zebrafish Circadian Clock Controls Rhythmic Mitosis</title>
<p>Using pH3 as a marker of mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0748730412440861">Hendzel et al., 1997</xref>), we examined whether zebrafish PAC2 cells maintained on an LD cycle divide rhythmically. Cells were plated at a density of 100,000 cells/mL and harvested every 6 h for 2 days (6 and 7 days after plating). Quantification of pH3 staining by flow cytometry shows a clear circadian rhythm in mitosis, peaking in the late night/early morning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0748730412440861">Fig. 1A</xref>). These peaks in mitosis are evident over a 2-day period, as cells become more confluent and the total percentage of dividing cells is slightly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0748730412440861">Fig. 1A</xref>). To determine whether the circadian clock controls this rhythm in mitosis, PAC2 cells were entrained to an LD cycle and transferred into constant darkness (DD) the night before harvesting. Analysis of pH3 staining reveals that the mitotic rhythm observed in LD persists in DD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0748730412440861">Fig. 1B</xref>). We then generated a clock mutant cell line by transfecting <italic>Per1-luciferase</italic> zebrafish cells with a truncated form of <italic>CLOCK1</italic>, encoding amino acids 1-389 and lacking its putative C-terminal transactivation domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0748730412440861">Whitmore et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0748730412440861">Dekens and Whitmore, 2008</xref>). Bioluminescent traces show that overexpression of this mutant construct dramatically reduces expression of <italic>Per1-luciferase</italic> approximately 80-fold compared with empty vector pCLNCX transfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0748730412440861">Fig. 1C</xref> and Suppl. Fig. S1). The residual oscillation may reflect either cells within population that still retain a rhythm or individual cells where normal CLOCK and BMAL escape inhibition by the mutant construct and drive downstream transcription (Suppl. Fig. S1). Nevertheless, this truncated zebrafish CLOCK1 protein appears to act in a dominant-negative fashion, similar to <italic>clock</italic> mutations isolated from genetic screens in mouse and <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0748730412440861">Antoch et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0748730412440861">King et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0748730412440861">Allada et al., 1998</xref>). Flow cytometric analysis of pH3 staining in empty vector control cells versus <italic>CLOCK1 DN</italic> cells shows that rhythmic mitosis is abolished in clock mutant cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0748730412440861">Fig. 1D</xref>).</p>

<title>Light Abolishes Rhythmic Mitosis by Inhibiting Circadian Clock Function</title>
<p>Our previous work has shown that light has a potent repressive action on clock function in zebrafish cells and, at high intensities, severely disrupts the circadian oscillator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0748730412440861">Tamai et al., 2007</xref>). Bioluminescent traces of <italic>Per1-luciferase</italic> cells reveal high amplitude rhythms of <italic>Per1</italic> expression on an LD cycle that are dramatically reduced in constant light (LL). <italic>Per1</italic> rhythms are then reestablished once cells enter DD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0748730412440861">Fig. 2A</xref>). To determine whether sustained light affects rhythmic cell division, we analyzed pH3 staining in PAC2 cells in LD versus LL. In contrast to the robust rhythms observed on an LD cycle, zebrafish cells maintained in LL divide arrhythmically (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0748730412440861">Fig. 2B</xref>). These results are similar to those observed in clock mutant cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0748730412440861">Fig. 1D</xref>) and are consistent with light repressing the circadian clock.</p>

<p>Light-dependent repression of clock function in zebrafish cells occurs, at least in part, through the light induction of <italic>Cry1a</italic>, which encodes a potent transcriptional repressor. The Cry1a protein binds directly to core clock proteins CLOCK and BMAL and inhibits their ability to activate transcription, and its overexpression in <italic>Per1-luciferase</italic> cells appears to mimic the effect of LL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0748730412440861">Tamai et al., 2007</xref>).

<title>Inhibition of the Cell Cycle Has No Effect on <italic>Per1-luciferase</italic> Rhythms</title>
<p>We have shown above that the zebrafish clock is clearly regulating circadian rhythms in cell division. We then asked whether blocking the cell cycle might affect the circadian clock. To test this hypothesis, we plated <italic>Per1-luciferase</italic> cells at a density of 250,000 cells/mL and treated cells tonically with either DMSO or 0.5 µg/mL aphidicolin, a reversible inhibitor of DNA replication. Supplemental Figure S2A shows that 0.5 µg/mL aphidicolin significantly slows zebrafish cell growth compared with the control, as one would expect for an inhibitor of DNA replication. In addition, flow cytometry reveals nearly a 3-fold increase in the percentage of S phase cells in aphidicolin-treated compared with DMSO control cells (Suppl. Fig. S2B). Bioluminescent traces in Supplemental Figure S2C show that the overall photon counts and amplitude are reduced in aphidicolin-treated <italic>Per1-luciferase</italic> cells compared with controls, probably due to a decrease in the number of cells (as shown in Suppl. Fig. S2A). However, there is no difference in the entrained phase of the <italic>Per1</italic> rhythm between treated and DMSO control cells (Suppl. Fig. S2C).</p>

<title>Expression of Several Key Mitotic Regulators Is Clock-Controlled and Suppressed by Constant Light</title>
<p>To determine how the circadian clock and light might influence cell division, we compared the expression of several key mitotic regulators to that of known oscillatory (<italic>Per1</italic>) and light-regulated (<italic>Cry1a)</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0748730412440861">Vallone et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0748730412440861">Hirayama et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0748730412440861">Tamai et al., 2007</xref>). Quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis reveals that expression of the zebrafish <italic>Cyclin B1, Cyclin B2</italic>, and <italic>cdc2</italic> genes is rhythmic on an LD cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0748730412440861">Fig. 3</xref>) and, importantly, closely mirrors the precise timing or phase of the mitotic rhythms observed in zebrafish cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0748730412440861">Fig. 1</xref>). These genes are required for entry into mitosis and are known to be expressed at high levels during the G2/M phase of the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0748730412440861">Pines and Hunter, 1989</xref>). Rhythmic expression of zebrafish <italic>Cyclin B1, Cyclin B2</italic>, and <italic>cdc2</italic> persists after transfer into DD (Suppl. Fig. S3) and is dramatically reduced in <italic>CLOCK1 DN</italic> mutant cells (Suppl. Fig. S4). These results demonstrate that several key mitotic genes are clock-controlled in zebrafish cells and provide important clues as to how the circadian clock might regulate the timing of cell division in this system. Unlike mammals, the zebrafish <italic>Wee1</italic> and <italic>Wee2</italic> genes are not rhythmically expressed in PAC2 cells and appear relatively unaffected in <italic>CLOCK1 DN</italic> mutant cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0748730412440861">Fig. 3</xref>, Suppl.

<p>To monitor mitotic gene expression dynamically, we generated a <italic>Cyclin B1-luciferase</italic> reporter cell line by stably transfecting PAC2 cells with 4.0 kb of the <italic>Cyclin B1</italic> promoter fused to luciferase. Along with our <italic>Per1-luciferase</italic> cells, these <italic>Cyclin B1-luciferase</italic> cells allow us to follow both cell cycle and circadian oscillations in parallel in living cells and determine how cell cycle timing alters in response to changes in lighting conditions. Bioluminescent traces of <italic>Cyclin B1-</italic> and <italic>Per1-luciferase</italic> cells are consistent with our qPCR data and show rhythmic expression of both genes on an LD cycle, which persists in DD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0748730412440861">Fig. 4A</xref>). <italic>Cyclin B1</italic> expression clearly oscillates, with its peak levels corresponding to the phase of maximal mitotic activity. We believe, therefore, that the timing of this oscillation is one of the key elements in setting up the intrinsic “gate” or “window” in which cells are mostly likely to enter mitosis. This high-resolution analysis also reveals a clear phase difference between <italic>Cyclin B1</italic> and <italic>Per1</italic> expression, suggesting that these genes might be differentially regulated. Two E-box (CACGTG) and two E′-box (AACGTG) sequences close to the transcription start site of <italic>Per1</italic> are known to drive rhythmic expression of this gene in PAC2 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0748730412440861">Vallone et al., 2004</xref>). We searched for potential regulatory elements in the zebrafish <italic>Cyclin B1</italic> promoter and found one E-box and one E′-box, which were the only E-box–related sequences in the entire 4.0 kb fragment (Suppl. Fig. S5). A 0.9 kb fragment of the <italic>Cyclin B1</italic> promoter contains both E-box and E′-box regulatory elements and shows similar rhythms to the 4.0 kb fragment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0748730412440861">Fig. 4B</xref> and Suppl. Fig. S5). Deletion of these E-box sequences within the 0.9 kb promoter fragment had no effect on rhythmic expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0748730412440861">Fig. 4B</xref>), suggesting that <italic>Cyclin B1</italic> is not a direct target of the CLOCK/BMAL heterodimer. A potential, though imperfect, RRE is also present upstream of the two E-boxes (Suppl. Fig. S5). Mutation of this sequence, however, alone or in combination with deletion of the E-boxes, has no effect on <italic>Cyclin B1</italic> rhythms (data not shown).</p>

<title>Inhibition of Circadian Clock Function Suppresses Cell Proliferation</title>
<p>We have shown that day lengths longer than 12 h suppress clock oscillations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0748730412440861">Tamai et al., 2007</xref>) and repress and maintain <italic>Cyclin B1</italic> expression at a low level until cells are returned to the dark (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0748730412440861">Fig. 4C</xref>).

Cells were then harvested by trypsinization and counted using a hemocytometer. These experiments show that sustained light exposure has a significant effect of slowing cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0748730412440861">Fig. 5A</xref>). As previously mentioned, light exposure increases the level of <italic>Cry1a</italic> expression in these cells.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The topic of circadian clock regulation of the cell cycle is not new, but is one that has regained interest recently, not least as a consequence of numerous epidemiological studies that have shown a link between clock disruption and cancer risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0748730412440861">Johnson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0748730412440861">Gery and Koeffler, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0748730412440861">Yu and Weaver, 2011</xref>). This phenomenon clearly exists in unicellular organisms, but whether it is also a cell autonomous process in multicellular organisms is a little more contentious. Previous studies in mouse NIH3T3 cells showed circadian gating of cell cycle events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0748730412440861">Nagoshi et al., 2004</xref>). A more recent study in Rat-1 fibroblasts drew the opposite conclusion, with a clear uncoupling of the clock from cell cycle timing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0748730412440861">Yeom et al., 2010</xref>). From the data shown in this study, however, the situation in zebrafish cells is quite clear. There is an obvious circadian rhythm in mitosis in zebrafish embryonic cell cultures. This rhythm persists under constant dark, free-running conditions, following entrainment to a light-dark cycle, and is severely reduced in clock mutant cells. This is a clear demonstration that a functional clock in a cell line is absolutely necessary for the timed regulation of mitosis. Furthermore, exposing <italic>CLOCK1 DN</italic> cells to an LD cycle is unable to drive or “mask” rhythmic cell division, indicating that this process is directly clock-controlled. This suggests that light itself appears to have little or no influence on rhythmic control of the cell cycle in zebrafish, except via the circadian pacemaker.</p>
<p>Although light cannot drive a daily mitotic rhythm in zebrafish cells, it can certainly repress circadian clock function. We have previously shown that light acts on the core circadian oscillator, through the induction of <italic>Cry1a</italic>, to suppress <italic>Per1</italic> expression levels and hold them constant, as long as light is present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0748730412440861">Tamai et al., 2007</xref>). In this study, we show that sustained light exposure not only suppresses clock function but, as a consequence, also eliminates the cellular rhythm in mitosis. This effect is mimicked in Cry1a overexpressing cells, which fail to divide rhythmically. The light induction of <italic>Cry1a</italic> appears to be a key molecular event for the light-dependent suppression of rhythmic mitosis in zebrafish cells, via its action on the core clock mechanism.</p>
<p>To determine whether inhibiting the cell cycle has any effect on the circadian clock, we treated <italic>Per1-luciferase</italic> cells with the DNA replication inhibitor aphidicolin. This treatment clearly reduces cell proliferation, as shown by the significant decrease in cell number in the treated cultures compared with controls, and increases the number of cells locked in S phase (Suppl. Figs. S2A and S2B, respectively). However, the nature of the entrained <italic>Per1-luciferase</italic> rhythm is very similar between control and treated cells, with the phase and waveform of the circadian oscillation remaining identical (Suppl. Fig. S2C). There is a reduction in the strength or level of the luminescent signal following aphidicolin treatment, but we believe that this is almost certainly due to the lower number of cells remaining in this culture. This result confirms the idea that progression through the cell cycle itself, and an oscillation in the molecular components underlying the cell cycle, do not feed back onto the circadian mechanism and influence the generation of a 24-h rhythm.</p>
<p>We show that a number of genes known to be important for mitotic regulation are under clock control in our zebrafish cell lines. Rhythmic expression of these cell cycle genes, such as <italic>Cyclin B1, Cyclin B2</italic>, and <italic>cdc2</italic>, not only free-runs in constant darkness following entrainment, but also is disrupted in clock mutant cell lines. The robustness of the <italic>Cyclin B1</italic> rhythm can be seen in cell lines transfected with a <italic>Cyclin-B1-luciferase</italic> reporter construct. These luminescent cells not only reveal the timing of gene expression, but clearly demonstrate how strongly a long duration light pulse suppresses <italic>Cyclin B1</italic> expression. Light feeds into this system, not only to lower the expression of core clock genes but also to strongly repress the expression of a major mitotic regulator, <italic>Cyclin B1</italic>. Expression of <italic>Cyclin B1</italic> is rhythmic in zebrafish cells. Our promoter analysis, however, shows that this is not the consequence of direct transcriptional control through E-boxes and CLOCK/BMAL binding. Curiously, these results are similar to the human <italic>Cyclin B1</italic> promoter, which also contains an E-box, but is not directly bound or regulated by CLOCK/BMAL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0748730412440861">Muñoz et al., 2002</xref>). An imperfect RRE is also present in the zebrafish <italic>Cyclin B1</italic> promoter, but mutation of this regulatory sequence, alone or in combination with the E-box deletions, has no effect on <italic>Cyclin B1</italic> rhythms. These results indicate that this gene is indirectly clock-regulated.</p>
<p>Our results show that <italic>Wee1</italic> and <italic>Wee2</italic> are not oscillating or clock-controlled in any manner, indicating that these genes do not drive the rhythmic regulation of mitosis in zebrafish cells, as has been hypothesized in regenerating mouse liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0748730412440861">Matsuo et al., 2003</xref>). This is a point worth noting, as it suggests that this proposed mechanistic link between the clock and the cell cycle might not be universally conserved and that different tissues, cell types, or even organisms may use their own unique points of regulation. Along these lines and in contrast to a recent study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0748730412440861">Hirayama et al., 2005</xref>), our qPCR analysis shows that <italic>Wee1</italic> is not induced by light in PAC2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0748730412440861">Fig. 3</xref>, Suppl. Figs. S3 and S4).</p>
<p>Cell proliferation is slowed in clock mutant cells as well as in cells exposed to constant light or overexpressing <italic>Cry1a</italic>. Possessing a functional circadian clock is therefore important for optimal cell growth. Our gene expression studies and luminescent reporter data show that not only does clock disruption prevent a daily rhythm in cell cycle gene expression, but it in fact reduces the level of expression of these critical cell cycle components. This impact on elements of the cell cycle is one likely explanation as to why cells with such timing defects show significantly slower growth rates. These results in zebrafish embryonic cell lines raise obvious questions about the role of light and the circadian clock during zebrafish development. We are currently exploring the effect of raising embryos in constant light, as well as disrupting the circadian clock itself, on zebrafish development.</p>
<p>It is interesting that disruption of a functional clock leads to a slowing in proliferation rates in zebrafish cells, as it has been suggested that a loss of clock control may play a role in accelerated or unregulated cell division in certain mammalian cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0748730412440861">Filipski et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0748730412440861">Filipski et al., 2004</xref>). Our results, however, are consistent with observations in embryonic fibroblasts isolated from <italic>clock</italic> mutant mice, and in cells virally transfected with small interfering RNA constructs against mouse <italic>CLOCK</italic>, which show a significant decrease in growth rate compared with controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0748730412440861">Miller et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0748730412440861">Antoch et al., 2008</xref>). In zebrafish cells, it is clear that possessing a functional cellular clock not only is essential for cell cycle timing but also is important for achieving optimal growth rates.</p>
