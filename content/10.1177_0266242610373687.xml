<abstract>
<p>The exclusion of the poor in developing countries requires radical enterprising solutions. Hence, microfinance was originally developed to intermediate through tailored double-bottom line initiatives, which would first supply more appropriate credit and, then other ‘financial services’, in an essentially participatory, ‘bottom-up’ way. This would support local, small-scale economic activity while enhancing well-being and social/gender justice. However, frontline local officers, originally recruited into microfinance institutions to help ‘empower’ the poor towards this end, have in practice been found to adopt unexpectedly different roles. Using original data from Zambia this article examines how this occurred in a frontier field situation. Here loan officers performed multiple, ambiguous and changeable roles while their home institution at first sought to decouple, and then prioritized its own immediate survival over their other founding aspirations. Where they acted more like ‘loan repayment agents’ and ‘debt collectors’ than genuinely participative ‘facilitators’ supporting the poor, further, unintended consequences resulted. Any further decoupling and retreat from committed double-bottom line working could bear heavily upon the further/future development prospects of microfinance.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Microfinance has attracted increasing attention in the literature and policy circles. The United Nations declared 2005 to be the International Year of Microcredit and in 2006 the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Mohammed Yunus and the Grameen Bank. Such recognition rested upon the belief that microfinance is an intervention tool that will ‘empower’ the poor and enhance the socio-economic conditions of ‘developing’ countries. Among other global initiatives, microfinance is a ‘favoured’ means of increasing access to financial services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0266242610373687">Beck et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0266242610373687">Honohan, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0266242610373687">Mendoza and Thelen, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0266242610373687">Spencer and Wood, 2005</xref>). The ‘mainstreaming’ of microfinance has brought increased global/international bank, marque finance house, private equity and venture capitalist, and other private business/‘micro philanthropy’ interest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0266242610373687">Prahalad, 2005</xref>). A ‘second microfinance revolution’ leading to more inclusive small business finance has also been debated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0266242610373687">Green et al., 2006</xref>). However, its original importance as a targeted strategy for poverty alleviation was based on a belief in its potential to reach and grow from the grassroots, supplying locally customized financial services in a ‘bottom-up’ rather than ‘top-down’ approach.</p>
<p>Microfinance is particularly, though not exclusively, intended to enable the very poor to account properly and independently for their small business and other economic activities, and thus to manage better their livelihoods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0266242610373687">Dixon et al., 2006</xref>). It is also strongly connected with lending to women who, as well as being over-represented among the world’s poor, have arguably proved to be more reliable borrowers than men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0266242610373687">Elyachar, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0266242610373687">Sanyal, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0266242610373687">United Nations, 2009</xref>). Microfinance also looks beyond microcredit to the provision of other forms of deposits, loans, payment services, money transfer and insurance services. Where microcredit has supported particularly small-scale economic activities, microfinance can also have other potential domestic and household uses and meanings. Emerging studies emphasize how the poor manage money and juggle with different potential ‘portfolios’. Microfinance is often not the only potential source of support, but it is usually the most reliable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0266242610373687">Brett, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0266242610373687">Collins et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0266242610373687">Cull et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0266242610373687">Premchander, 2009</xref>). At its ‘business end’, however, microfinance holds that the poor will invest in micro enterprises, and then repay loans out of surplus profits, so that they become more economically active while their businesses grow, potentially lifting them and their dependents out of poverty. This assumes that the poor will be ‘empowered’, which in microfinance is defined as ‘encouraged to participate and equipped to self-manage their activities’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0266242610373687">Dixon et al., 2007</xref>: 48). In order to facilitate access through ‘bottom-up’ participation, loan officers<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0266242610373687">1</xref></sup> have been recruited by microfinance institutions (MFIs) and non-governmental organizations (NGOs), as ‘agents of change’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0266242610373687">Goetz, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0266242610373687">O’Reilly, 2006</xref>) and ‘facilitators’ of this vital empowerment process.</p>
<p>Although it is often loan officers who are in effect ‘producing development’ on the ground, their work role, especially in frontier territories, such as sub-Saharan Africa, has yet to be sufficiently examined. Research has neglected the active role of fieldworkers or loan officers and their interface with the poor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0266242610373687">Ahmad, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0266242610373687">Goetz, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0266242610373687">Jackson, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0266242610373687">O’Reilly, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0266242610373687">2006</xref>). Loan officers are such key links between MFIs and their poor clients, that they are central to service delivery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0266242610373687">Isaia, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0266242610373687">Matsuwaka, 2010</xref>). A number of issues and problems regarding what they do at this critical interface has not been sufficiently addressed, but these issues are potentially critical for frontier sites, such as sub-Saharan Africa, where microfinance still needs to progress from its recent promising beginnings. Many studies have focused on economic impact assessment, programme replication, client outreach, lending methodology and financial sustainability, but few have explicitly considered fieldworkers’ interactions with their poor clients.</p>
<p>The relatively limited literature on loan officers has mostly been drawn from Asia, while other world regions, especially Africa, are relatively under-represented. Among the few in-depth studies of fieldworkers are those of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0266242610373687">Goetz (2001)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0266242610373687">Ahmad (2000)</xref>, both based on microfinance NGOs in Bangladesh, which had progressed from being pioneering initiatives. Their findings show that, as ‘facilitators’ or ‘bearers’ of change, fieldworkers are often critical to the implementation of microcredit programmes, yet they remain organizationally marginalized. In sub-Saharan Africa, certain studies have considered the performance and growth of microfinance institutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0266242610373687">Baumann, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0266242610373687">Congo, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0266242610373687">Mukama et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0266242610373687">Volschenk and Biekpe, 2003</xref>). Others have examined lending methodologies, client ‘drop outs’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0266242610373687">Diagne et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0266242610373687">Musona and Coetzee, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0266242610373687">Wilson, 2001</xref>) and the impacts of microfinance programmes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0266242610373687">Hietalahti and Linden, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0266242610373687">Johnson et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0266242610373687">Mayoux, 2001</xref>). So far, however, research has only given loan officers limited attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0266242610373687">Siwale, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>The problem of understanding how microfinance works in emerging frontier sites can be overcome by the kind of research that itself gives loan officers more ‘voice’ when disclosing their actual working practices. This study seeks to fill this gap by exploring, first, the role and work of loan officers within MFIs and, second, how their practices influence and shape microfinance development. It presents evidence to answer the questions: What was their role and experience? What compromises did they make; and what were the consequences, both for client groups and MFIs’ own sustainability? A case study approach is used to illuminate what this means for the conduct of loan officers and their organizations. It shows that the loan officer role can increasingly reflect the divergent and contradictory position they are later required to occupy within these organizations. It additionally argues that the further development of microfinance becomes more difficult when loan officers in effect prioritize their short-term ‘debt collector’ over their other, socially ‘enabling’ or ‘facilitating’ role. Where this inhibits further engagement with the poor further potential MFI ‘mission drift’ can result. This has important implications for microfinance’s aspirations to be a socially equitable financial intermediation, especially for emerging MFIs using group loan contracts.</p>
<p>This article is organized as follows: the second section briefly reviews the existing literature about loan officers’ role within group-based microfinance. The third section details the methodology used to generate further data and the fourth section presents the context of the case studies. Findings are presented in the fifth section and discussion and conclusions follow in the last section.</p>

<title>Constructing and comparing the microfinance loan officers’ role</title>
<p>While there has been considerable research into the role of different frontline development workers and professional specialists in such diverse areas as: family planning programmes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0266242610373687">Andaleeb, 1996</xref>); social work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0266242610373687">Gibbs, 2001</xref>); extension agents in agricultural work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0266242610373687">Das, 1995</xref>); and bank lending officers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0266242610373687">Lehmann and Neuberger, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0266242610373687">Uzzi and Lancaster, 2003</xref>), it has often omitted others, such as loan officers. For larger value loans, researchers have previously explored the relationships between personal business advisors (PBAs) and clients (small firms), and found that the PBA can perform the roles of account manager, counsellor and coordinator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0266242610373687">Lean et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0266242610373687">Mole, 2002</xref>). Findings from family planning programmes of particular interest to the poor have furthermore suggested that, while fieldworkers have been central, much has depended on how they conducted their client relationships. Still others have extensively researched ‘street-level bureaucrats’ and their role in processing clients and policy implementation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0266242610373687">Brodkin, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0266242610373687">Lipsky, 1980</xref>).</p>
<p>The ‘street level bureaucracy’ model can help construct the loan officer role along comparative lines. In the original model, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0266242610373687">Lipsky (1980)</xref> maintained that, under certain circumstances, bureaucrats at the ‘bottom’ of the ladder were ex officio ‘policymakers’. In effect they also helped ‘make’ policy whenever aspects of formal statutes were either ambiguous or internally contradictory, or where the routine activities of frontline workers could not be fully monitored or controlled. Thus ‘although they are normally regarded as low level employees, the actions of public service workers actually constitute the services delivered by government’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0266242610373687">Lipsky, 1980</xref>: 3). The model thus directed attention to how real-world ‘policy deliverers’ worked and adapted to potential tensions between different managerial and client demands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0266242610373687">Barnes and Prior, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0266242610373687">Brodkin, 2000</xref>). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0266242610373687">Hilhorst and Schmiemann (2002)</xref> found that fieldworkers made their own interpretations of principles and priorities in response to differing demands. The ‘street-level bureaucracy’ model would therefore imply that fieldworkers are an important link in the group-based lending process because they meet with clients on a regular basis and establish the necessary close relationships, which should then facilitate further loan repayments. In many MFIs they are the ‘foot soldiers’ with the most direct contact with the poor. Borrowers gain their own particular experience of MFIs by interacting with fieldworkers as if they individually ‘personify’ microfinance institutions themselves.</p>
<p>In principle, clients enter a relationship with MFIs, which loan officers then mediate, without such clients having other direct links with MFI management. Group-based microfinance programmes usually rely on work practices such as ‘regular’ visits by loan officers and frequent contact with borrowers and group/centre meetings. The client–loan officer interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0266242610373687">Figure 1</xref>) is thus critical to realizing the developmental goals of microfinance. To the extent that they provide this link, loan officers directly impact upon repayment performance, client empowerment, client outreach, and other organizational dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0266242610373687">Dixon et al., 2007</xref>).</p>

<title>‘Multiplexity’ of the loan officer role</title>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0266242610373687">Fisher and Sriram (2002)</xref>, fieldworkers perform three particular roles when extending microfinancial services. First, they are crucial to helping overcome clients’ reluctance to participate. Second, in the absence of peer-information, loan officers help to reduce the probability of delinquency and default. Third, they can ensure high-quality service provision. In principle, the primary role of a fieldworker can be argued to be that of facilitator or catalyst (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0266242610373687">O’Reilly, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0266242610373687">Tembo, 2003</xref>), and also, at times, a personal advisor. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0266242610373687">Ito (2003)</xref> thus found that fieldworkers often simultaneously fulfilled the roles of village counsellors, money managers and conflict mediators. However, in fulfilling these different roles, fieldworkers (like ‘street level bureaucrats’) may face competing demands from their home MFIs, especially those seeking to increase loan disbursement and repayment, because their clients would prefer them to be more sensitive to their own personal circumstances. A potential conflict could, therefore, exist between borrowers’ expectations and MFI requirements.</p>
<p>While fieldwork is generally a ‘core process’, it is often the least researched and understood process in studies of microfinance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0266242610373687">Ahmad, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0266242610373687">Goetz, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0266242610373687">Siwale, 2006</xref>). By neglecting fieldwork much literature has in effect reaffirmed prior belief in the effectiveness of MFI-lending methodologies and related policies for reducing poverty. This article, therefore, seeks to shift the focus of investigation toward individual loan officers’ work and its inbuilt challenges and contradictions.</p>

<title>Case study research methods</title>
<p>This study is based on intensive qualitative research conducted in Zambia’s Copperbelt province, during 2003 and 2004, complemented by the (Zambian) researcher’s own local knowledge. The research explored the emerging role of loan officers in extending microfinance and of MFIs providing credit to the poor-especially women. The Christian Enterprise Trust of Zambia (CETZAM) and the Promotion of Rural Initiatives and Development Enterprises (PRIDE) Zambia were both selected because they each presented what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0266242610373687">Stake (2000)</xref> referred to as the <italic>opportunity to learn</italic>. This necessitated a combination of observations, semi-structured interviews, focus group discussions and informal discussions with loan officers, clients, immediate supervisors and senior management. Further interviews were also conducted with local specialists in microfinance and former loan officers. Clients and supervisors were interviewed to triangulate with the views of loan officers.</p>
<p>In all 59 formal interviews were conducted spanning loan officers through to poor clients, each lasting 45–90 minutes.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0266242610373687">2</xref></sup> In the interest of anonymity, all quotations and observations of participants have been attributed fictitious names. Broad, open-ended questions were used to elicit the interviewees’ own interpretations of everyday actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0266242610373687">Maykut and Morehouse, 1994</xref>). This approach is intended to empower interviewees, enabling them to speak in their own ‘voices’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0266242610373687">Llewellyn, 2001</xref>), and thereby give them more freedom to explain their own thoughts, as well as highlighting points of particular interest. Throughout the fieldwork, the researcher conducted informal conversations about how microfinance operated with almost every loan officer in these institutions. The opportunity to do this could arise casually or unexpectedly, as when waiting for a bus, or while walking or driving to the next meeting.</p>
<p>In addition to interviews, the researcher also accompanied 18 loan officers in the field in order to better capture the ‘oral’ character of microfinance, and observe their work. Observational methods were selected because of their ability to generate data about both interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0266242610373687">Handley et al., 2005</xref>) and also the role loan officers played. The researcher also attended 23 client group meetings to observe loan officers interacting with clients.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0266242610373687">3</xref></sup> Daily field notes were kept about fieldworkers’ interactions and conversations at branch offices and in the field with clients. Certain observed contradictions were also followed up and additional clarifications obtained by means of informal interviews and discussions. Other data was collected in the process of ‘being around’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0266242610373687">Rahman and Goddard, 1998</xref>: 87). The two MFIs were followed up in the second half of 2007 and 2008, and consequently their client numbers and subsequent performance has since been updated.</p>
<p>Data analysis was an iterative and reflexive process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0266242610373687">O’Dwyer, 2004</xref>). It involved a careful reading and re-reading of the data, while allowing for particular themes to emerge directly from it, using inductive coding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0266242610373687">Fereday and Muir-Cochrane, 2006</xref>). Analysis was conducted in accordance with grounded theory principles using the software programme, QSR Nvivo™. While a case study approach has limited generalizability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0266242610373687">Denscombe, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0266242610373687">Scapens, 1990</xref>) it draws strength from its ability to foreground the processes as embedded in a particular place or institution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0266242610373687">Blake, 2006</xref>).</p>

<title>Case study context</title>
<p>Poverty in Zambia is recognized to be widespread. Approximately 65 per cent of its population are below the national poverty line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0266242610373687">World Bank, 2009</xref>). In addition, many of the poor, including women, merely subsist as micro-entrepreneurs – that is, as farmers, street vendors, market traders and home workers. Microfinance is therefore important to Zambia’s goal of addressing mass poverty and, particularly, in enabling the poor to access suitable finance. However, microfinance in Zambia remains relatively new. It first emerged in the 1990s and was largely donor driven, with an unusually high urban concentration, and then became based upon smaller-scale MFIs than its counterparts in East and West Africa and South Asia. Consequently, the adoption of a replicated group model was not context-specific and most Zambian MFIs lacked the opportunity to evolve and learn like others in South Asia, for example. As with most MFIs in sub-Saharan Africa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0266242610373687">Siwale, 2006</xref>), Zambian MFIs have reportedly faced relatively high levels of delinquency and default, high operating costs, slow intake and high client exits, all of which inevitably constrain their efforts to achieve the financial and organizational sustainability many donors now require. Indeed, many face important management and corporate governance challenges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0266242610373687">Dixon et al., 2007</xref>). CETZAM and PRIDE Zambia, along with others, therefore provide much needed microfinance services in a country where, even by prevailing standards, access to financial services has been extremely low (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0266242610373687">FinScope, 2009</xref>). Current microfinance outreach has been estimated at near 100,000 clients out of a potential market of 2 million (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0266242610373687">AMIZ, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The specific context for these two main case studies can be explained as follows.</p>
<sec id="section6-0266242610373687">
<title>PRIDE Zambia</title>
<p>PRIDE Zambia started, as Pride Africa, in February 2000, following a project funding agreement between PRIDE Africa and the Swedish International Development Agency (SIDA). The project’s stated goal was the provision of financial services to small and micro-entrepreneurs. After successful completion of the project phase, PRIDE Zambia was incorporated as a company limited by guarantee. It was headquartered in Lusaka with a 10 branch network in four (out of nine) provinces, namely Lusaka, Copperbelt, Eastern and Southern. There were 25 loan officers as at June 2004, of whom six were female. By 30 December 2004, PRIDE Zambia’s reported outreach was 5080 active clients (65 per cent of whom were female), with a loan portfolio value at ZMK 5.6 billion (USD 1,154,621). Portfolio at risk was estimated at 7.38 per cent as of 30 June 2004.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0266242610373687">4</xref></sup> PRIDE Zambia’s performance, just like that of other Zambian MFIs has been less than impressive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0266242610373687">Figure 2</xref>), allegedly owing to diversion of micro-enterprise loans to consumption purposes, and possible large-scale financial fraud by clients, credit officers and/or top management. By August 2008, PRIDE Zambia had indeed dismissed its chief executive officer, suspended loan disbursement and its active client numbers were unknown. It faced significant restructuring under new ownership and different management (verbal communication with acting CEO, Lusaka, June 2008).</p>

<p>PRIDE Zambia advanced loans to individual entrepreneurs through a group-based system. Prospective borrowers organized themselves into groups of five members, called enterprise groups (EGs), each federated to a market enterprise committee (MEC). Ten EGs are combined to form a MEC comprising 50 members, who then elected a MEC leader. All self-selected persons in an EG are jointly liable for any loans made to peers in the group. Under PRIDE’s methodology the MEC management committee chairperson is formally responsible for: organizing registration; acting as spokesperson for the group; enforcing PRIDE rules and regulations; and conducting meetings. S/he can intervene and assist to resolve conflicts between MEC members. MEC meetings are usually held at PRIDE Zambia’s own office premises. Credit officers provided some supervision during the formation of groups and worked directly with the MEC leadership to ensure loans are repaid on time. However, their involvement in regular monitoring was limited, and so the obligation fell mainly on MEC leaders and members. Loan officers may nevertheless continue to support them in cases where group leaders are thought to be ineffective and unable to push for timely loan repayment.</p>
<p>PRIDE had three stated loan products:</p>

<title>CETZAM Opportunity Microfinance Ltd</title>
<p>CETZAM has been one of Zambia’s most high profile microfinance institutions. Headquartered in Lusaka,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0266242610373687">5</xref></sup> CETZAM had branches in three provinces: Copperbelt, Lusaka and Southern. Founded in 1995, it expressed a ‘strong vision’ to fulfil a social agenda driven by Christian principles to ‘transform the lives of the poor’ by ‘providing opportunities to create employment and generate income through credit and training services’. Its Trust Banks and Solidarity groups<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0266242610373687">6</xref></sup> were intended to target the poorest of the economically active population, especially women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0266242610373687">CETZAM brochure, 2001</xref>). The Trust Bank group members together guarantee one another’s loans ranging from USD 80 to USD 200. Borrowers form groups, which jointly share liability for loan delinquencies or default (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0266242610373687">Jurick, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0266242610373687">Mendoza and Thelen, 2008</xref>). CETZAM expanded quickly. Its initial ‘success story’ led to a massive client outreach drive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0266242610373687">Figure 3</xref>) partly driven by external donors. Together they envisaged the conversion of CETZAM into a registered bank with a network of at least 20 branches serving 50,000 clients by 2005 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0266242610373687">Cheston et al., 2000</xref>). By 2001 CETZAM had opened 12 branches (most eventually unsustainable) and employed 85 loan officers. The average number of clients per loan officer stood at 375 clients against an expected standard load of 350.</p>

<p>However, by the end of 2004, CETZAM had 4677 active borrowers and an operational sustainability of 35.4 per cent. From the end of 2002 into 2003, CETZAM’s portfolio and management significantly changed; the number of branches was reduced from 12, first down to seven, then to five in 2008 as client numbers fell from near 16,000 to 5000 by end of 2003 in the face of a potential collapse. In part, these developments were a result of its rapid growth, coupled with information shortfalls, where loan officers could not properly screen, evaluate and monitor loans, which made it more vulnerable to fraud. However, as seen from outside:
<disp-quote>
<p>There was too much luxury, accompanied by uncontrolled expenditures on luxurious buildings, trips and vehicles. There was fraud within the organization and head office staff spent recklessly. The institution was spending too money on rentals, vehicles, expensive furniture and staff used to give each other loans. This gave an impression of an organization with a lot of money and this didn’t please the donors, who demanded accountability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0266242610373687">Journalist from the local media, 27 November, 2003. Kitwe</xref>).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Overall, a perception of CETZAM as a faith-based NGO that used ‘free’ external funds, which also belonged to some ‘invisible’ outside donors, may itself have created an incentive to default. CETZAM ranks as a classic case of an MFI the expansion of which exceeded its capacity to monitor and control those involved in the lending process and which then suffered adverse consequences as a result (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0266242610373687">Dixon et al., 2007</xref>). However, both CETZAM and PRIDE Zambia predominantly used a group-based lending methodology with women as the majority clientele (75 per cent). However, they differed significantly in their espoused organizational philosophy. CETZAM began as a Christian faith-based NGO with a mission to ‘assist the poor’. PRIDE Zambia simply provided financial services to small and micro-entrepreneurs. Its mission statement made no reference to the ‘poor’ and contained no explicit client preferences.</p>

<title>Findings for the CETZAM and PRIDE Zambia cases</title>
<sec id="section9-0266242610373687">
<title>Disclosing the loan officer’s role</title>
<p>The loan officer’s intended role in both institutions was to recruit clients, assess their initial eligibility by visiting their businesses and workplaces, and train them in the lending methodologies – including some basic bookkeeping skills – for a period of 10 weeks before then disbursing loans. Loan officers therefore served as initial facilitators in group formation, and were then expected to work through group leaders to ensure proper attendance at group meetings and timely repayment. At the outset both CETZAM and PRIDE Zambia loan officers had been formally expected to help clients grow their businesses and generate profits and surpluses from which loans would be repaid. However, there were identifiable differences between the MFIs’ claim that loan officers were facilitators of bottom-up participation, and thus central to service delivery, and how they then came to feel individually marginalized. Using <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0266242610373687">Mintzberg’s (1980)</xref> original classification, loan officers here pursued interpersonal, information and decision roles. For their interpersonal roles, they acted as leaders and liaison officers who maintained horizontal relations with peers and their wider community, and vertical relations with clients and management. In performing the vertical role they were to be seen as facilitators, mediators and, at times, advisors as well. In their informational role, loan officers also received and monitored information that could help them categorize and understand their clients. Within this role, loan officers also transmitted specified information ‘down’ to clients and ‘up’ to higher management. As described from above:
<disp-quote>
<p>A loan officer is a person who acts as a bridge between the organization and clients. He/she is in constant touch with clients and should know what’s happening in client groups and pass on information to the branch manager and then senior management. So a loan officer is a key person. (Branch manager)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>From a loan officer’s perspective, however:
<disp-quote>
<p>We are the pillars linking clients to the organization. To a client, we are their mouthpiece. To do this, a loan officer has to know what is happening in the organization in order to feed clients with correct information and vice versa. (Loan officer)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In their decisional role, loan officers frequently sought to negotiate and mediate disputes and conflicts among clients. In addition they would on occasion themselves select leaders for groups, in effect imposing rather than waiting for them to be ‘elected’. A loan officer was, therefore, what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0266242610373687">Long (2001)</xref> termed a ‘multiple interface manager’ who linked clients to the branch office and clients to the MFI. As seen in the field, they were the human ‘glue’ that made group members ‘stick’ together:
<disp-quote>
<p>For us in the field, we are almost everything when we meet clients. When you are there, you have to behave like a fieldworker and at the same time represent the accountant, the CEO and your supervisor. All these things are acted out by you. This is what makes it different. For clients, it is the loan officer that really matters. (loan officer)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>However, the loan officers’ role here was not clear cut. It was consequently important to use a different cognitive lens to understand their actual role and a triangulation of different views proved useful for this purpose. Some loan officers readily described themselves as the ‘link’ between clients and their home organization and also regarded themselves as mediators. Others, however, claimed that their role was more immediately ‘situational’ because they often found themselves being ‘many things’ at the same time:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>JS:</speaker>
<p>What do you see as your role?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Suleni:</speaker>
<p>Your role depends on your situation. What exists on paper is what the people experienced and developed from wherever the methodology came from in East Africa. But our environment does not fit neatly into this methodology. Attitudes differ and so the roles of credit officers in this region differ from the roles of other credit officers (COs) in Zambia. A CO is supposed to recruit clients, train them and facilitate a cohesive group for clients to work properly. Thereafter, they administer the loans and then start collecting until their work is done. But in this country, a CO goes beyond that. In more instances than not, a CO has to take an extra job by actually recovering the money as well. (PRIDE Zambia)</p>
</speech>
<p>Others (especially the newer loan officers) simply claimed they did not have any clear understanding of their intended role thus:
<disp-quote>
<p>It’s difficult for me to answer the question accurately because even I don’t understand who a credit officer is, and what they are supposed to be doing. In short, we don’t understand it ourselves. We are just groomed to meet the targets of the organization [Others laugh]. We are not involved in the planning or shaping of microfinance.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Still others said that they appeared to be ‘everything’ to their clients and often found themselves playing divergent roles, especially when client groups became evidently dysfunctional. In practice, loan officers were here experiencing growing tensions amid increasingly inconsistent and/or erratic work and personal demands:
<disp-quote>
<p>In many ways, our job has changed a lot over the years, it’s no longer the case of just loan business – ‘you are everything’. You are the person with many hats. You know you’re a social worker; you’re a counsellor, and even a manager! I think we tend to be dealing with lots of things other than what management realises. (CETZAM loan officer)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Another officer claimed:
<disp-quote>
<p>We go beyond what is stated on paper because our job descriptions are not adhered to. There’s quite an overlap and sometimes we end up doing an accountant’s work. We even do banking! We don’t stick to what is on paper, as then nothing will be done. We are forced to do that because a credit officer has to be answerable. (PRIDE loan officer)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>It became increasingly apparent from informal conversations and shadowing of their work that loan officers were not adequately prepared to deal with both unexpected dysfunctional groups and abrupt changes in formal policy regarding financial sustainability. Consequently, these particular loan officers considered themselves to have potentially ‘boundless’ roles, which did not always match with the task that was originally envisaged in the chosen lending methodology, which an older loan officer interpreted as ‘marketing the product, mobilizing clients, supervise group formation, training, disbursing and monitoring the use of loans’. Contrary to group-lending methodology, client groups were observed to be top-down managed, thereby limiting client participation. Loan officers thus themselves became de facto group leaders. These findings support a view of participation that it ‘remains a way of talking about rather than doing things’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0266242610373687">Mosse, 2001</xref>: 32). Their actual roles were thus found to be much broader than those depicted in the literature and were also still in a state of flux, often changing in response to the immediate uncertainties arising in the field, hence their use of the term ‘chameleon’. From the grassroots or client view, loan officers could be virtually ‘everything’. In effect they were the ‘general practitioners’ of microfinance.</p>
<p>In addition, loan officers experienced other conflicts. They were discursively placed in a position of belonging to client groups, without being members; as facilitators, they were both outside and yet they also worked inside these groups as well. Neither did they fit easily into the management hierarchy. Their position in the MFI became more tenuous, as they stood outside its management, but were still its active ‘foot soldiers’. The role a loan officer actually performed consequently derived from whatever was most immediately pressing, and was regularly revised during daily interactions with clients, as one long-serving loan officer at CETZAM described thus:
<disp-quote>
<p>Management says that the key task for loan officers is to form good groups and give quality loans, yet, when we try to do this, the issue of meeting our targets is raised. Therefore the desire to see long term positive change in clients is there but the constant emphasis on meeting targets frankly gets in the way.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Clients’ understanding of a loan officer’s role was initially based on their ongoing interactions and relationships with them. As a result, the institutionally expected role was judged to be that of processing loans as the overriding priority, then collecting payments, mediating, followed by training and managing group conflicts. Many clients, however, inferred that ‘we see them to be more of “debt” or “money” collectors than anything else at this time’. From their standpoint, some ‘role displacement’ had already occurred. As it emerged in interviews and discussions, their work roles were defined more by what they had to do as ‘debt’ or ‘money’ collectors, and not as the would-be development ‘enablers’ described in formal manuals and brochures. The loan officers’ dilemma lay in the realization that they were at once a ‘toe’ and a ‘heel’, and that each required a different performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0266242610373687">Hochschild, 1983</xref>: 137): one first delivered a service, and then the other collected payment for it. When they felt pressured to meet targets for sustainability, some loan officers deliberately played the ‘bad guy’ in response. Their role was thus contextual, experiential and socially constructed.</p>
</sec>

<title>Identifying role displacement</title>
<p>Loan officers at CETZAM and PRIDE Zambia spent much time out of their office in field situations where their work mostly went unsupervised. This arrangement afforded loan officers a degree of freedom to decide for themselves about which activities they should devote time to. Just like ‘street level bureaucrats’ they negotiated a degree of autonomy and reprioritized their activities to make them seem more manageable. They also varied their conduct in order to accommodate the different demands made on them by their branch managers, management and clients. Loan officers, therefore, did not necessarily pursue officially stated lending procedures, as was frequently observed in group meetings, and discussions:
<disp-quote>
<p>You see group loan rules are very difficult. It is just we, the loan officers, who are in contact with clients make things easier for them; otherwise not many people would be getting loans. For example, when books don’t balance, we try to do something about it to ensure they do balance.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Another stated:
<disp-quote>
<p>There are MECs which are very good and make payments on time but others are a problem, and so as a credit officer I have to help in keeping those MECs intact by <italic>flouting</italic> a few rules here and there just to try and maintain them. If I strictly stick to the rules, then a lot of people will be frustrated and the whole process just won’t work.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Loan officers also adapted by reducing the time spent on the facilitative role and other activities (such as marketing, counselling and training) which were less visible, and which also invited more arbitrary judgements upon their own individual performance. Like other ‘street-level bureaucrats’ they too sought ways to reduce the intensity and range of their work tasks, and limit the demands and expectations placed upon them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0266242610373687">Barnes and Prior, 2009</xref>) through group management by selection or ‘cherry-picking’, as further conversation revealed:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Client:</speaker>
<p>We are not at the meeting place now because you [the loan officer] always come late for meetings. So we were expecting you around 15.30 hours.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Another client adds:</speaker>
<p>In fact the other time you made us wait for hours and never turned up so we thought you were not coming today as well.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Loan officer:</speaker>
<p>Oh! I am sorry. It is just that I had other pressing things to attend to at the office.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Later with the researcher, the loan officer adds:</speaker>
<p>Usually as loan officers we tend to sideline good performing TBs in order to give time to problematic ones, especially those in arrears. We pay more attention to those giving us problems and so this group here has no repayment problems, as such I just pass through like this to ensure I can chat with them. So I didn’t come when they had a meeting because I was following up other matters affecting our portfolio. That is the only way one can cope with all the different demands on us.</p>
</speech>
<p>Loan officers thus privately and individually modified the practiced methodology to suit their own immediate situation, especially where jobs were threatened, or if repayment targets were not met:
<disp-quote>
<p>These people have a tough job to do and do put in a lot. But they feel insecure and that tends to affect their performance. They have targets and are expected to meet these targets. But you see, management does not appreciate that group formation takes time if one is to come up with a quality loan. If a LO moves too quickly to form groups so as to meet set targets, they will have problems of delinquency later. On the other hand, if a LO takes time to form a quality group of clients, they will not meet the set target in client numbers, and therefore will be deemed lazy and have a bad assessment which then puts their jobs on the line. (Training manager, CETZAM)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>How they managed client groups therefore reflected loan officers’ ‘logical’ decision (in response to pressure from management) not to spend more time than appeared necessary on any activity that would not then be reflected in their subsequent performance evaluation. For example, many loan officers believed that their own training and that of clients was a ‘waste’ of their time as management hardly took it seriously, as two different loan officers described:
<disp-quote>
<p>We had really diverted from the original procedures and policy. Policy says there’s a pre-registration period of 4 weeks for training, then it takes 6 weeks before the first two clients in each EG get loans, so it’s then 10 weeks of intensive training. But, because head office wanted numbers, as credit officers we accepted anyone that came and just registered them, even before they were trained. We simply told them that ‘We will train you as you go on’. So, by the time they were getting loans, they didn’t even know the importance of making weekly repayments, loan procedures, or what else was expected of them. We had no time to screen clients and made fewer visits to their businesses. We were just on a rampage to get clients and increase portfolio size, that’s all. There is just too much pressure. Management keeps on saying ‘donors want to pull out’, which affects my work as I then begin to worry about losing my job. But we don’t realize that this will create problems for us when arrears start. Most loan officers say ‘we will get to that point later for now it’s just numbers and survival. (Older loan officer)</p>
<p>I have had a very rough start in the sense that, when I joined, they straight away threw me in the field and still expected me to handle clients. I have not undergone proper orientation and have not received any training. They just gave me a manual to go through and then learning from my colleagues. You pick things as you go. (Newer loan officer)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>However, two different management representatives indicated:
<disp-quote>
<p>There is an induction period first, where they have to read the procedures and methodology of the organisation from the manuals. The branch managers also have a checklist that helps them in training and so there is a theoretical and practical side of training. (Head of credit, CETZAM)</p>
<p>Training is an expensive venture but we do not retain these officers for a long period and right now, people at the top see training as unnecessary. But we have to appreciate the fact that new entrants need re-orienting and intensive training which takes time and money. However, with the current sustainability pressures, we are not giving them that leeway because they have to be in the field. (Operations manager, PRIDE Zambia)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>As a result, both loan officers and clients were not empowered to manage the process and transition to commercialization. Loan officers had to carefully choose what to emphasize to clients in case other contradictions became apparent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0266242610373687">O’Reilly, 2004</xref>). If their situation had been more positively enabling they might have had more time for reflection so that they could address these difficulties rather than try to conceal them.</p>

<title>Discussion and conclusion</title>
<p>This paper has disclosed the emerging role of loan officers in the context of growing pressure for ensuring microfinance institutional survival. It has shown a gap between loan officers’ observed role and what was originally intended, which was the facilitation of positive grassroots change. The findings indicate that the loan officers’ role was not pre-given and that ‘debt collecting’ rather than the ‘facilitation’ role later took precedence. While the microfinance literature has simply acknowledged possible work role-related issues, other research has studied what occurs when individuals have multiple and mutually incompatible roles. In this study it proved difficult for the loan officer to combine the roles of ‘facilitator’ and ‘debt collector’. Loan officers never seemed to be only facilitators or only ‘debt collectors’; they always seemed to be both, even if they felt split when deciding which to prioritize. In addition, the way they managed these tensions and contradictions could blur their judgement of other microfinance practices. In effect rising sustainability pressures made the practice of microfinance appear to be largely about just disbursing loans and repayment, and other issues were eclipsed by concern for short-term survival and job security. Moreover, microfinance practice was also influenced by contradictions between the loan officers’ extant and observed roles, and their ability to manage clients in a way that made sense to them. As the findings demonstrate, both loan officers and clients were potentially disempowered when short-term loan repayment and institutional survival were prioritized over client needs, thereby constraining outreach and further development.</p>
<p>These findings are similar to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0266242610373687">Ahmad’s (2000)</xref> regarding NGOs in Bangladesh. Money collection there became the loan officer’s key role (in line with MFI sustainability pressures), and displaced their other work roles, such as group capacity building and the marketing of other MFI services. Loan officers were absorbing other members’ and leaders’ roles as it was found that groups could not be as self-managing as originally intended. This could threaten further/future microfinance development. The intensity with which loan officers performed the ‘debt’-related role was surprising, given previous emphasis on their ‘facilitator’ role, as expressed in formal policy documentation. This difference is important: even if there was potential for success, it could still be inhibited by loan officers’ own need to dominate client groups, and thus deny them real autonomy. Few anticipated that loan officers would micromanage client groups themselves in order to ensure their home institution’s short-term survival. This is significant when fears about growing MFI ‘mission drift’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0266242610373687">Copestake, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0266242610373687">Cull et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0266242610373687">Mersland and Strom, 2010</xref>) are set against the original expectation that microfinance would enhance economic citizenship by reaching many more potential clients who cannot currently access mainstream financial services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0266242610373687">Beck et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0266242610373687">CGAP, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0266242610373687">Lafourcade et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>The case studies presented here, albeit situated within one country, call for an increased focus on the role of loan officers. Other studies have found that the surrounding legislative and regulatory framework, ambiguous ownership structure, operational costs, inadequate lending capital, level of economic development and lending policies each impact upon otherwise variable MFI performance, especially in sub-Saharan Africa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0266242610373687">Baumann, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0266242610373687">Mukama et al., 2005</xref>). We would also emphasize that the success or failure of microfinance in ‘empowering’ its clients may ultimately depend on the role played by loan officers as the key organizational ‘link pins’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0266242610373687">Likert, 1967</xref>). The further development of microfinance in frontiers, such as sub-Saharan Africa, could well suffer if loan officers become more like high pressure salespersons solely enforcing their MFI’s financial bottom line at the expense of its other founding aspirations.</p>
<p>This study makes its own threefold contribution. It has observed how loan officers work in the field. It has shown that the loan officer is a key figure in the lending process. They are the ‘real’ frontline practitioners of microfinance, whose locally ‘grounded knowledge’ remains particularly important for regions, such as sub-Saharan Africa, where microfinance is still just emerging, having matured differently elsewhere. While other studies have noted their intensive involvement when dealing with non-performing groups, this paper has also shown that loan officers have multiple, ambiguous and changeable roles, and are not always fully empowered to do the ‘proper’ microfinance originally envisaged. Their key role of facilitating local bottom-up ‘participation’ and ‘empowerment’ is at risk of being progressively displaced where other pressures take precedence.</p>
<p>This study has also focused on a particular country that is still under-researched, and presented insights which could advance knowledge of how group-based microfinance works in other sub-Saharan countries and similarly emerging sites. Previously, success in microfinance has been assumed to rest on the global diffusion of ‘best practice’ concepts and outcome measures, rather than how best to manage the intervening process of enabling it to work. As such many MFIs in frontier areas, such as sub-Saharan Africa, encounter unexpected blockages in their efforts to expand client outreach. The importance of this research therefore needs to be seen in light of global advocacy of microfinance as an effective strategy in pro-poor poverty alleviation and financial inclusiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0266242610373687">Beck et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0266242610373687">Commission for Africa, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0266242610373687">Honohan and Beck, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0266242610373687">Moyo, 2009</xref>; World Bank, 2005). However, this can only happen if grassroots perspectives are given more voice. These findings have, therefore, raised the more obvious question: if more loan officers elsewhere also work as they did here, can frontier microfinance really facilitate poverty reduction through active economic citizenship on anything like the scale required?</p>
<p>Finally, the study underlines the need for further research-informed interventions which would enable more constructive change and improvements. Whether such interventions succeed could, nevertheless, depend upon how well microfinance resolves certain key issues regarding its future character and conduct. A more commercialized ‘financial systems’ rather than ‘poverty lending’ based approach is one prospect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0266242610373687">Hulme and Arun, 2009</xref>). But, while there is agreement that microfinance must still expand in order to reach more of the poor, there are still differences about commercialization per se. In particular, critics fear that this will compromise and usurp microfinance’s founding double-bottom line aspirations, as for example the Compartamos ‘scandal’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0266242610373687">Aitken, 2010</xref>) and ‘Andhra Pradesh crisis’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0266242610373687">Ghate, 2007</xref>) reportedly imply. Yet, while some would advocate counterbalancing ‘social performance’ measures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0266242610373687">Copestake, 2007</xref>), including ‘social responsibility fund’ investors, others still question whether microfinance can be truly financial sustainable without continued subsidization. All this, and more, may come to bear even more heavily on loan officers in future, in addition to the other frontier-related issues observed here.</p>

<p>Loan officers are those employees of microfinance institutions who are actively involved in the lending process by way of implementing the policies, mediating transactions and interacting with clients. They link microfinance institutions with clients and are closest to implementation or ‘real work’ of microfinance. Other titles, such as field staff, credit officers or fieldworkers, have also been used to refer to such MFI employees. This study adopts the title loan officers unless referring to other sources.</p>

<p>Most client interviews could not be tape recorded (12 out of 18) due, for example, to noisy interruptions at their trading premises, and fears about the recording machine. Detailed notes were written up immediately after these interviews. Twenty-five loan officers, 3 ex-loan officers, 4 senior managers, 5 supervisors, 18 clients and 4 external informants made up the 59 interviews.</p>

<p>Membership in Trust Banks varied between 20 and 40, comprising people with similar economic needs. Solidarity groups had five to seven members. Trust Bank members met weekly, Solidarity fortnightly (CETZAM brochure). Loan officers went out to hold meetings in clients’ own local home and market environment. The difference between a trust bank and solidarity group primarily lies in the size of the group, and the scale of loans for solidarity are often bigger (USD 350–1000). The data in this article is mainly based on group loan contracts and not on individual lending loan arrangements.</p>
