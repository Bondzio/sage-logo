<p>In relation to special collections, two quotations by Alison Cullingford are interesting and notable: ‘special collections are everywhere!’, and ‘they [special collections] can be the most exciting, appealing and useful materials in a library’ (p. xi). In my opinion, these are not exaggerations, but are somehow in line with the annual theme of 78th IFLA Conference (held at Helsinki, Finland): <italic>Libraries Now: Inspiring, Surprising, Empowering</italic> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ifla.org/ifla78">http://www.ifla.org/ifla78</ext-link>). Paying attention to such a topic, <italic>The Special Collections Handbook</italic>, as a step towards the better management of special collections, is inspiring, surprising, empowering as well as promising. In fact, the saying ‘special collections are everywhere!’ is reinforced when the author indicates that they are held by all kinds of organizations: research libraries, universities, colleges, schools, national libraries, public libraries, museums, art galleries, archives, historic houses, cathedrals, subscription libraries, learned societies … and they include many kinds of material: early printed books, manuscripts, pamphlets, ephemera, maps, photographs, archives, newspapers, digital files, and much more (p. xi).</p>
<p>Taking a pragmatic approach to the management of special collections materials, i.e. the entire range of textual, graphic and artifact primary source materials in analog and digital formats, including printed books, manuscripts, photographs, maps, artworks, audio-visual materials, and realia (p. xii), the book embraces 10 chapters. Chapter 1, ‘The care of special collections’ reminds us of East and Myers’ belief (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0961000612459115">1998</xref>) that preservation takes precedence. As a result, it is emphasized that the care of collections is the basis of special collections work (p. 1). Like an encyclopaedic paper, Chapter 1 covers a variety of relevant issues regarding preserving humanity’s heritage. These include different threats to special collections and how to manage them, formulating a preservation policy, conservation and the role of the conservator, digital preservation. It is concluded that the scale of these threats is daunting, but a preservation approach helps librarians to manage them: improving storage, housekeeping and handling procedures, conservation techniques and preservation reformatting (p. 20). Chapter 2, ‘Emergency planning for special collections’ complements care-related issues discussed in Chapter 1. Accordingly, it emphasizes fire and water (flood) damage, and planning for coping with emergencies is examined.</p>
<p>Chapter 3, ‘Understanding objects in special collections’ introduces some of special materials available in special collections including medieval manuscripts, early printed books, analytical bibliography, modern formats, and important printed formats. In fact, Chapter 3 helps what is theoretically discussed in Chapter 4, ‘Acquiring and developing special collections’, be facilitated and realized in practice. In addition to familiarity with different types of special objects, Chapter 4 deals systematically with the cycle of collection building and development for special collections. Moreover, the ways by which special collections can be built and developed are reviewed: foundation collections, donation and deposit, purchase, internal transfer and proactive collecting. As its name suggests, Chapter 5, ‘Cataloguing, description and metadata in special collections’ concerns the organization and classification of collections of special materials. Standards and codes for cataloguing printed books, and standards and codes for cataloguing manuscripts and archives are discussed. More importantly, making special collections materials available via the Web (which in turn can increase their visibility and usability) is considered through acquainting readers with some emerging developments like metadata, RDA (Resource Description and Access), FRBR (Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records), FRAD (Functional Requirements for Authority Data), Linked Data, and the Semantic Web. Here, I believe that Cullingford has properly taken the handling of born-digital collections and digital materials in special collections into consideration.</p>
<p>The author posits that coping with legal and ethical matters is one of the most important and difficult aspects of managing special collection (p. 93). For this reason, Chapter 6, ‘Legal and ethical issues in Special Collections’ attempts to alleviate such a challenge through covering some basic considerations of legal and ethical issues in special collections. Chapter 7, ‘User services in special collections’, Chapter 8, ‘Marketing and communications in special collections’, and Chapter 9, ‘Widening access to special collections’, give general attention to the core of any library service – namely users and how the collection(s) and related services can be managed, improved, promoted, communicated, accessed, and utilized more effectively through both non-profit and profit channels. And finally, Chapter 10 entitled ‘Influencing and fund-raising for special collections’ discusses fund-raising and influence which, from Cullingford’s perspective (p. 161), underpin the possibility of all most activities within special collections. She also adds that without influence and understanding at a high level in their parent organizations, special collections are vulnerable to cuts, even closure (p. 178). In this respect, some informative notes plus sources of special collections funding (e.g. public programmes, trusts and foundations, individual giving, sponsorship, and income generation) are presented.</p>
<p>Cullingford’s book ends with the section ‘Afterword’ which discusses the future of special collections. This is followed by two useful appendices relating to some key reference sources, and careers and skills in special collections. The book has a single bibliography and there is also a [subject] index at the end of the book. The content is enriched by the inclusion of some sections in most of chapters: ‘A note on terminology’, ‘Further reading’, ‘Examples and case studies’, and ‘Useful websites’.</p>
<p>From a managerial standpoint, I think that the handbook has taken a successful stride from planning to acting on the basis of PDCA model (Plan-Do-Check-Act) developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0961000612459115">Deming (1986)</xref>. It can be truly considered as a roadmap fortified with good policies, strategies, planning frameworks, and especially the knowledge as well as experience of Allison Cullingford as special collections librarian at the University of Bradford. It can be treated as re-stating <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0961000612459115">Ranganathan’s (1931)</xref> Five Laws of Library Science in terms of special collections, that is, ‘special collections are for use’, ‘every user their special collections’, ‘every special collection has its user’, ‘save the time of the special collections user’, and ‘special collections are growing organisms’. And this means realizing the real place of all libraries (and here special collections) that may lead to diminishing one of the main global challenges of the third millennium viz. – to build a society where everyone can access and share information, enabling individuals and communities to achieve their full potential in promoting their development and improving their quality of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0961000612459115">Aqili and Isfandyari-Moghaddam, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>In sum, this educational handbook and textbook with its logical sequence is of high value for all those involved in special collections including managers, librarians and their colleagues, and librarianship students and professors. <italic>The Special Collections Handbook</italic>, in theory and practice, is an excellent sourcebook for both the related literature and the real world of managing special collections.</p>
