<abstract>
<p>The issue of racial profiling has come to represent one of the key contemporary challenges facing law enforcement agencies in the United States. One way that agencies have responded to this issue is to adopt anti-profiling policies to address concerns about racial disparities in traffic stops and their outcomes. Policy adoption is assumed to encourage more racially equitable policing as well as enhance community relations. While both of these outcomes appear beneficial to law enforcement agencies, there is also good reason to expect that agencies may differ in the extent to which they are likely to implement such policy. This study explores what factors explain the adoption of protocols addressing the racial profiling phenomenon. Using data on large law enforcement agencies from the 2003 LEMAS survey, the findings reveal that both agency organizational characteristics and environmental features of the jurisdiction are associated with the agency’s profiling policy regime.</p>

<p>Racial profiling is a policy issue that has received a great deal of attention from the public, elected officials, police, and researchers. The notion that police officers may make decisions based on the racial characteristics of citizens threatens the idealistic principles of fair and equal treatment before the law. Indeed, extant research establishes relatively strong evidence that people hold the perception that officers use race in exercising discretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0011128708328863">Ludwig, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0011128708328863">Weitzer &amp; Tuch, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0011128708328863">2005</xref>). It is little surprise, then, that a considerable number of studies have been concerned with testing whether police agencies and their personnel engage in race-based policing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0011128708328863">Alpert Group, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0011128708328863">Alpert, MacDonald, &amp; Dunham, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0011128708328863">Eck, Liu, &amp; Bostaph, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0011128708328863">Engel &amp; Calnon, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0011128708328863">Farrell, McDevitt, Bailey, Andresen, &amp; Pierce, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0011128708328863">Gaines, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0011128708328863">Lamberth, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0011128708328863">Lange, Johnson, &amp; Voas, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0011128708328863">Lundman &amp; Kaufman, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0011128708328863">Meehan &amp; Ponder, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0011128708328863">Miller, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0011128708328863">Novak, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0011128708328863">Rojek, Rosenfeld, &amp; Decker, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0011128708328863">Schafer, Carter, Katz-Bannister, &amp; Wells, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0011128708328863">M. R. Smith &amp; Petrocelli, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0011128708328863">Warren, Tomaskovic-Devey, Smith, Zingraff, &amp; Mason, 2006</xref>). Although the empirical focus is squarely trained on testing for evidence of the racial profiling phenomenon, very little attention has been paid to the patterns of response by local law enforcement agencies (LEAs) in dealing with racial profiling as a policy issue. In fact, with the exception of two descriptive studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0011128708328863">Fridell, Lunney, Diamond, &amp; Kubu, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0011128708328863">Schultz &amp; Withrow, 2004</xref>), no empirical research exists on the topic.</p>
<p>Policy research in police studies is important, because policy represents one way in which police discretion may be controlled or at least influenced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0011128708328863">Davis, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0011128708328863">Klinger, 2004</xref>). Indeed, police agencies have reacted to several contemporary policing controversies by implementing compliance regimes to direct officer behavior. Two types of police action—deadly force and arrest—have received the most policy attention in organizational efforts to direct police behavior. Traffic stops, the locus of the racial profiling controversy, have not yet received the same empirical scrutiny to understand whether policy has any effect on traffic stop practices.</p>
<p>Racial profiling presents a fertile arena to examine police policy and practice, because it exists at the intersection of crime control efforts and questions of police procedure, fairness, and accountability. Although most politicians cannot afford to appear to be soft on crime, legislative efforts to address public concerns about racial profiling by police have met with broad support as a number of state police agencies have adopted antiprofiling measures, many of which have been spearheaded by legislative action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0011128708328863">Hickman, 2005</xref>). The likelihood that legislative policies are put into action by police departments, however, is suspect. This is in large part due to a general reluctance on the part of police organizations, their leadership, and rank and file toward reform efforts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0011128708328863">Skolnick &amp; Bayley, 1986</xref>). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0011128708328863">Jenness and Grattet (2005)</xref> describe the context of policy adoption decisions by LEAs, “the ‘pro-innovation’ bias at the policymaking stage often clashes with ’anti-innovation’ bias of law enforcers” (p. 338). As such, there is good reason to expect that police departments may vary in the move to implement their own policy directives that define what racial profiling is or how their officers should work to avoid it.</p>
<p>The current study addresses this empirical gap by examining the organizational dynamics of police agencies as predictors of the adoption of innovative antiracial profiling policy using data on large LEAs from the 2003 Law Enforcement Management and Administrative Statistics (LEMAS) survey. Institutional data about LEAs are combined with structural data that describe important features of the jurisdictional environment thought to influence agency-level policy formation. The analysis tests a set of predictions that highlight the importance of environment, including community demand and threat hypotheses, along with organizational expectations for understanding agency-level policy adoption.</p>
<sec id="section1-0011128708328863">
<title>Literature</title>
<p>Contemporary scholarship concerned with explaining features of police organizations is relatively underdeveloped in criminology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0011128708328863">Maguire, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0011128708328863">Maguire &amp; King, 2004</xref>). Work focused on explaining features of the police industry or understanding aspects of LEAs has drawn on classical organizational and management research. However, since at least the 1960s, criminologists have incorporated new insights into models of police organization. Perhaps the most prominent example of this is <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0011128708328863">Wilson’s (1968)</xref> classic work, which significantly expanded the scope of police studies and the ways in which we think about the importance of organization as an influence on police behavior. Wilson’s book provides a framework for developing expectations that link elements of the organizational environment with agency characteristics. Although Wilson’s study linked police organizational structure to local political dynamics, other criminologists have followed by drawing on new developments in organizational and management theory—institutionalism—to develop a model of police organizational life and change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0011128708328863">Crank &amp; Langworthy, 1992</xref>).</p>
<p>Like <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0011128708328863">Wilson’s (1968)</xref> work, the institutional theory of police emphasizes the importance of the organizational environment of police for developing expectations about the features of LEAs. The institutional tradition offers a critique of classic models of bureaucracy that assume organizations to be closed systems. Rather, public organizations, like police agencies, are theorized to be open systems, prone to a variety of external influences on the shape and behavior of organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0011128708328863">DiMaggio &amp; Powell, 1991</xref>). This model of police organization has been used by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0011128708328863">Crank and Langworthy (1992)</xref> to explain such varied features of modern police organizations as the militaristic appearance of local police, the development of specialized units (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0011128708328863">Katz, 2001</xref>), and the use of preventive patrol as the primary police operational tactic of modern police. Others have deployed institutional theory to explain the historical and rhetorical shift in policing toward community policing in the contemporary era (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0011128708328863">Crank, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0011128708328863">Greene &amp; Mastrofski, 1988</xref>) as well as the embrace of new technologies as management tools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0011128708328863">Willis, Mastrofski, &amp; Weisburd, 2007</xref>).</p>

<title>Policy as a Management Tool</title>
<p>One of the primary reasons that practitioners, policy makers, and the public may be interested in policy is that it represents one of the primary tools by which problematic police behavior may be controlled or otherwise improved. Research on the effects of policy on police discretion is limited, despite the importance of discretion in contemporary controversies associated with police. Spanning such diverse arenas as police use of deadly force (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0011128708328863">Fyfe, 1979</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0011128708328863">1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0011128708328863">White, 2001</xref>), the handling of domestic disturbance calls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0011128708328863">Eitle, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0011128708328863">Sherman &amp; Berk, 1984</xref>), hate crime enforcement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0011128708328863">Jenness &amp; Grattet, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0011128708328863">King, 2007</xref>), drunk driving enforcement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0011128708328863">Mastrofski &amp; Ritti, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0011128708328863">Mastrofski, Ritti, &amp; Hoffmaster, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0011128708328863">Mastrofski, Ritti, &amp; Snipes, 1994</xref>), and racial profiling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0011128708328863">Schultz &amp; Withrow, 2004</xref>), the effects of policy on police discretion is still not well understood. When it comes to racial profiling, some have expressed concern that policies designed to address racial profiling may be met with resistance. For example, Schultz and Withrow suggest that such policy may alienate police personnel, contributing to police cynicism and decreasing police productivity in traffic enforcement, especially in minority communities. Their analysis of survey responses from a small sample of Kansas LEAs, however, showed that the depolicing effects of racial profiling policies were small to nonexistent.</p>
<p>Aside from managing police behavior in specific types of encounters with citizens, LEAs may also be inclined to implement policy as a symbolic maneuver to signal to political actors and community residents that the agency is doing something about a particular issue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0011128708328863">Gusfield, 1967</xref>). The issue of racial profiling has rapidly undergone a kind of moral passage, akin to a variety of other types of deviance, such as alcohol consumption, tobacco use, and child abuse. The term <italic>racial profiling</italic> can be traced to the explicit use of race as one component of an organizational policy of drug interdiction in the 1980s and 1990s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0011128708328863">Engel &amp; Calnon, 2004</xref>). The use of race in drug courier profiles used by several agencies along the I-95 corridor linking Miami to large urban markets in Washington, D.C., Baltimore, Philadelphia, New York, and Boston reflects the institutionalization of organizational assumptions about race and criminal suspicion, which sanctioned the legitimacy of considering race in law enforcement decisions. The issue has undergone a remarkable transformation since this time, as LEAs have sought to define racial profiling and prohibit the explicit use of race in officer decision making, largely in response to a variety of pressures from advocacy groups, politicians, and the public.</p>
<p>The question of what meaning the organizational use of race possesses in LEAs reflects the contradictory pressures that LEAs face in the contemporary drug war, and it provides the foundation for one of the research expectations regarding agency adoption. The first of these, the public demand hypothesis, holds that police are expected to respond, first and foremost, to their crime control mandate. In response to the public’s support for a central plank of the drug war—that police should prioritize crime control—LEAs were expected to engage in aggressive law enforcement. The use of race as a law enforcement tool was tolerated as either a cost of this pursuit or understood as a reasoned and informed response to the exigencies of the police mandate. Agencies in jurisdictions with higher rates of serious crime might be especially susceptible to the pressures associated with the public demand hypothesis. High-crime communities may be inclined to support a wider variety of police measures to address the crime problem as residents take a “do something” approach to the crime problem.</p>

<title>Police Organization and Policy</title>
<p>Institutional theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0011128708328863">Crank &amp; Langworthy, 1992</xref>) leads us to expect that police organizational behavior may reflect influences aside from rationality and the bureaucratic objective of efficiency. Rather, institutional theory provides the basis to expect that organizational form and strategy frequently reflect the values and beliefs espoused by powerful actors (sovereigns) in the environment. Such actors are powerful because they have the ability to influence resource allocation and the bureaucratic life of the agency in the environment. Organizational legitimacy is secured by police organizations when they develop organizational structure and operational strategies that conform to conventional wisdoms held by sovereigns about the institutional environment of police departments. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0011128708328863">Crank and Langworthy’s (1992)</xref> article asserts that modern police organizations are likely to experience periodic crises of legitimacy because of the complexity of environmental demands on the police. In the case of racial profiling, sovereigns may exert influence on police policy based on their assumptions about police agency operations and personnel. The nature of the influence (i.e., whether it manifests in terms of a racial profiling policy) depends on those factors that influence the degree to which sovereigns form and apply conventional wisdoms about the use of racial profiling as a police practice and whether or not it is either necessary or proper in pursuit of the police mission. Racial profiling has become an issue that is implicated by legitimacy issues among local police departments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0011128708328863">Tyler &amp; Wakslak, 2004</xref>). In the language of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0011128708328863">Crank and Langworthy (1992)</xref>, it represented a legitimation crisis for local law enforcement and the police industry as a whole. They argue that organizational response to crises of legitimacy should be largely ceremonial, as agencies develop “structures and policies that display to sovereigns the organization is responding to the conflict” (p. 355).</p>
<p>To some extent, this claim may be confirmed from a quick review of the discourse evident in professional policing circles. Both the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0011128708328863">International Association of Chiefs of Police (2006)</xref> and the Police Executive Research Forum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0011128708328863">Fridell, 2005</xref>) have published papers imploring police executives to adopt policy, consider implementing traffic stop data collection programs, and develop community partnerships in the process. Much of this literature is couched in terms of maintaining and enhancing the reputation of the LEA in the community and minimizing the issue of racial profiling as a threat to the legitimacy of the agency among citizens it serves. Although addressing the profiling issue has developed a degree of professional institutionalization, it is reasonable to expect that LEAs will vary in the degree to which they are sensitive to legitimacy concerns that arise from professional policing concerns. Agencies that possess features reflective of concern about public opinion of the LEA might be more likely to adopt profiling policies as a result of concerns about professionalism and institutional legitimacy. One way this can be measured is by asking whether agencies routinely sponsor surveys of public satisfaction.</p>
<p>Institutional theory sensitizes us to the importance of the political process in supporting LEAs. Because the political process links LEAs with resource allocation, institutional theories also lead to expectations about resource conditions necessary to initiate bureaucratic change. A necessary condition for the adoption of new policy or other organizational initiatives is an organization’s ability to do so, a function of organizational resources. Resource allocation is in part a reflection of community validation of organizational legitimacy. Some police departments have resisted data collection programs based on the argument that it is too expensive to commit officer time and energy to the necessary paperwork, training, and analysis of data that a data program would require (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0011128708328863">Schultz &amp; Withrow, 2004</xref>). This is an appeal that is based on an organization’s ability or capacity to implement a specific policy. Capacity is a function of organizational size, financial strength, and resource demand by the environment, all of which should affect policy adoption decisions. Aside from organizational capacity, organizations should vary in the degree to which they are amenable to adopting new policies, assuming that they are able to adopt new policies to begin with. LEAs may resist policy implementation because they are opposed to the motivation or politics of the policy or because they are relatively insulated from external influences. Both features of an agency—organizational capacity and institutional amenability to innovation—are thought to be influenced by features of the organization, its culture, and the environment in which the organization operates.</p>
<p>One recent study in policy innovation has highlighted the role that police agencies play in developing and implementing policies that affect the way that the police enforce the law. In particular, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0011128708328863">Jenness and Grattet (2005)</xref> documented the factors that distinguish local LEAs in California in their adoption of policies that encourage the enforcement of hate crime statutes. Their work problematizes the tendency by police departments to resist organizational change that is spurred by new legislation. They reveal that police organizational factors predict policy implementation, specifically what they describe as “organizational perviousness.” Perviousness is conceived as the degree to which an agency is susceptible to outside influence and the degree to which the agency aligns its actions with the thrust of the influence. They operationalize perviousness as an index constructed from three sets of measures contained in the 2000 LEMAS survey: (a) the practice of meeting with groups in the community, (b) organizational practices consistent with community-oriented policing philosophy, and (c) race and sex-based diversity among agency personnel. They find that perviousness is the only predictor of whether or not an agency possesses a hate crime policy, controlling for a variety of variables.</p>

<sec id="section4-0011128708328863">
<title>Community Influences</title>
<p>Organizational theories of police provide strong reason to account for environmental influences on agency-level innovative change. Two theories of the environment’s effects on police are the public demand and racial threat explanations. The public demand model of police change argues that public sentiment is expressed through the local political process. From this view, police innovation is a function of democratic expressions of popular will, and one would expect that racially diverse localities may be more supportive of antiprofiling and other due process reform efforts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0011128708328863">Weitzer &amp; Tuch, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Grounded in the conflict tradition, racial threat theories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0011128708328863">Blalock, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0011128708328863">Liska, 1992</xref>) may inform predictions about the nature of environmental influence on LEAs. Racial threat theories predict that state power and control should increase in environments where racial minorities are perceived to pose an economic, political, or criminal threat to dominant group interests. Expressions of state power and control come in the form of a variety of criminal justice outcomes. Recent research in this tradition has examined a variety of policing outcomes, such as police force size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0011128708328863">Jacobs &amp; Helms, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0011128708328863">Kane, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0011128708328863">Sever, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0011128708328863">Stucky, 2005</xref>), police expenditures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0011128708328863">Jackson, 1989</xref>), arrests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0011128708328863">Chamlin &amp; Liska, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0011128708328863">Parker, Stults, &amp; Rice, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0011128708328863">Stolzenberg, D’Alessio, &amp; Eitle, 2004</xref>), civil rights complaints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0011128708328863">Holmes, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0011128708328863">B. W. Smith &amp; Holmes, 2003</xref>), police use of deadly force (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0011128708328863">Jacobs &amp; O’Brien, 1998</xref>), and hate crime enforcement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0011128708328863">King, 2007</xref>). Racial threat as it is applied to the question of racial profiling might lead to the expectation that police use racial cues in a variety of decisions and that expressions of social control are greatest in racial minority communities (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0011128708328863">D. A. Smith, 1986</xref>). The logic of applying the threat framework to models of innovation emphasizing the values of due process, fairness, and impartiality leads to the expectation that as local racial threat increases, due process innovations should be less likely.</p>

<title>Hypotheses</title>
<p>Drawing primarily from police organizational insights, a number of research expectations can be sketched out. Institutional theory suggests that it is important to consider features of the environment in studies of police organizational behavior. The first of the environmental hypotheses, the community demand hypothesis, builds on rational and political models of policy implementation. It holds that as the percentage of the population that is expected to favor a policy (or be adversely affected by the absence of a policy) increases, then we should expect an increase in the likelihood of policy implementation. That is, as the proportion of Black residents increases in a jurisdiction, local LEAs are more likely to acknowledge the increasing influence of the Black community and implement a profiling policy.</p>
<p>The second environmental hypothesis, the racial threat hypothesis, holds that the likelihood of policy adoption by LEAs is negatively associated with the relative size of a jurisdiction’s population of Black residents and runs counter to the community demand expectation. That is, as the percentage of Black residents increases, the threat that this population poses to White community and race-primed concerns about crime will increase. In this environment, LEAs are more likely to police aggressively, less likely to impose elective procedural constraints on police discretion, and therefore less likely to implement a racial profiling policy. The racial threat hypothesis posits a curvilinear relationship between racial composition and social control outcomes as the proportion of the Black community approaches a statistical majority and is able to consolidate a numerical majority into economic and political gains. As this relates to profiling policy implementation, we should expect that as Blacks attain a measure of numerical power in the community, the likelihood of local LEA policy adoption should increase.</p>
<p>The third hypothesis, termed the “functionality” hypothesis, could be considered a criminal threat hypothesis, because it links the level of serious crime to the likelihood that an LEA will implement a profiling policy. Recall that functionality conceptually links an LEA’s functional or primary organizational objectives to the likelihood of policy innovation. It raises the issue of whether the policy is more or less likely to assist the agency in meeting its goals. Because profiling policies are assumed to discourage police productivity, increase the need for police to articulate the legal basis of individualized suspicion, and increase their sensitivity to the complexity of their working environment, it is assumed that profiling policies are perceived as interfering with the functional demands of an LEA. Therefore, the functionality hypothesis predicts a negative relationship between crime and policy adoption. That is, it is expected that as the rate of serious crime increases, the likelihood of implementing a profiling policy decreases.</p>
<p>In addition to the environment-focused expectations, the police organizational and policy literature leads to at least two research expectations that guide the following analysis. The first of these, the institutional hypothesis, argues that LEAs are likely to innovate largely in response to conventional wisdoms or popular opinion about the institutional project of policing in contemporary society. The institutional perspective, unlike the public demand and racial threat hypotheses, highlights the importance of public perception about what the police are, represent, and do in maintaining and enhancing a measure of organizational legitimacy. With regard to the racial profiling phenomenon, evidence suggests that the American public perceives that police use race in making decisions and that racial profiling is wrong (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0011128708328863">Ludwig, 2003</xref>). In light of this evidence and insights from institutional theory, one should expect that LEAs are likely to adopt racial profiling policy in part as a result of the extent to which they are concerned with and act on public perceptions of the police. LEAs are differentially concerned about public satisfaction with police services, police professionalism, and the like, and so the importance of a profiling policy to the institutional legitimacy of LEAs should vary. The institutional hypothesis leads to the expectation that LEAs that are more attuned to public opinion about the performance of the agency and its personnel are more likely to possess a profiling policy, holding all other factors constant.</p>
<p>The second organizational hypothesis is derived from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0011128708328863">Jenness and Grattet’s (2005)</xref> work on institutional openness. This hypothesis holds that as LEAs vary in their susceptibility to outside influences (perviousness), so will the likelihood that they adopt innovative policy, such as antiprofiling protocols. Organizational perviousness encompasses a broad range of agency characteristics but is especially tied to the extent to which LEAs support and practice community and problem-oriented policing philosophy.</p>

<title>Current Study</title>
<p>The analysis that follows seeks to document the prevalence of profiling policies in large local LEAs in the United States. The primary objective of the study is to investigate whether environmental features of the agency’s jurisdiction and organizational characteristics of the agency are related to the likelihood of police to develop and implement agency-level policies designed to limit racially biased policing. These objectives are pursued with data gathered through the 2003 LEMAS study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0011128708328863">U.S. Department of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics, 2006</xref>). The LEMAS data describe police agency organizational characteristics, including aspects of the agency organizational structure, personnel, technology, tactical elements, and policies. The 2003 version of the survey included new questions about agency level policies, including policy concerned with race-based policing practices among police officers. The LEMAS data are augmented by jurisdiction-level data from the 2000 Census and 2002 Uniform Crime Reports.</p>
<sec id="section7-0011128708328863">
<title>Sample</title>
<p>To ensure comparability, the sample is designed to gather data from large local municipal police agencies throughout the United States. According to the 2003 LEMAS survey, large municipal police agencies are defined as agencies that employ 100 or more sworn officers with 35 or more full-time uniformed sworn officers with regular assigned duties that include responding to calls for service (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0011128708328863">Reaves &amp; Hickman, 2004</xref>). In the 2003 LEMAS survey, 803 local LEAs met these criteria and completed a survey, including 501 municipal police departments and 302 county sheriff’s offices or police departments.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0011128708328863">
<title>Dependent Variables</title>
<p>Two dependent variables are used to examine the environmental and organizational hypotheses. Both are drawn from questions contained in the 2003 LEMAS. The first measure, Antiprofiling Policy (APP), is a dummy variable (1 = yes) that was drawn from a series of yes or no policy questions that ranged from whether an agency allows its officers to drive patrol vehicles home to policy on the use of deadly force. LEAs were asked whether they possessed a written policy directive on racial profiling. Unfortunately, the LEMAS survey does not ask additional questions about the substance of the APP. For example, it is likely that agencies with APPs vary widely in the substance of their policies, the processes by which their policies came about,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0011128708328863">1</xref></sup> as well as the amount of organizational emphasis placed on the policy. Nevertheless, the APP question provides a meaningful distinction between agencies; LEAs that have adopted some form of an APP are formally committed to engaging the organization in the racial profiling controversy compared to agencies with no formal policy. By 2003, adopting some form of APP was common, with 79.9% of agencies (638 of 798) reporting that they had a profiling policy in place.</p>
<p>A second dependent variable, Data Collection Program (DCP), is also a dummy variable (1 = yes). It is constructed from a question about whether or not the agency uses computers for a variety of organizational functions, including traffic stop data collection. Although it is possible that LEAs may be collecting data about traffic stops without using computers, those agencies that have a computerized system in place for either collecting the field data from patrol or entering and tabulating traffic stop data administratively are much better positioned to use the data for a variety of purposes, including officer performance audits and research on stop patterns. This variable is arguably a superior measure of organizational commitment to addressing the profiling controversy, because the implementation of a data collection program can be directly linked to increasing accountability in managing line officer discretion and, on average, it likely requires greater organizational commitment in resources and training to implement than a policy alone. Although policy adoption may be prone to claims that the policy is merely symbolic, traffic stop data collection programs are likely to be more meaningful. Exactly half of the sample reported a DCP (399 of 798).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0011128708328863">
<title>Independent Variables</title>
<p>The independent variables used in the study cover the environmental and organizational factors highlighted in the research literature. The first set of variables tap key dimensions of environmental influence on police and allow for tests of the public demand and threat hypotheses. Three variables are constructed from 2000 Census data regarding the racial and economic composition of the jurisdiction. Jurisdictions may either be at the city level or county level, as the LEAs that compose the sample may be either municipal police agencies with city jurisdictions or sheriff/county police agencies with county jurisdictions. These variables include two measures of racial composition: (a) percentage of Black population and (b) percentage of Hispanic population. The third, socioeconomic status, is a factor score based on the following four items: (a) 1999 median family income, (b) the proportion of college-educated residents over 25 years old, (c) the proportion of workers in professional and management occupations, and (d) the employment rate. In addition, the functionality hypothesis suggests that the crime rate may influence the likelihood of LEAs to adopt profiling measures. Thus, data from the 2002 UCR were used to construct a serious crime variable, the rate of index crime, for the county of the jurisdiction.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0011128708328863">2</xref></sup> This measure is logged in the models that follow due to its skewed distribution (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0011128708328863">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<p>To examine the effects of the institutional perspective and the expectations associated with organizational openness, a number of variables were drawn from the LEMAS survey data. All of these variables represent features of agency-level organizational characteristics. These variables include measures of organizational capacity, openness, and concern with public legitimacy. Organizational capacity is measured using the size of the LEA budget per 100,000 residents in the jurisdiction. LEAs with larger per-capita budgets may be more capable of investing organizational resources into policy initiatives. The openness of the agency is gauged via three measures. First, openness is represented in a dummy variable about the presence of a civilian review board to review complaints against LEA personnel (1 = yes). Second, community policing practices were measured by a 16-item index that sums the number of eight different types of community groups that the LEA regularly met with: (a) advocacy, (b) businesses, (c) religious, (d) local government, (e) neighborhood associations, (f) senior citizens, (g) school groups, and (h) youth service organizations, as well as the number of eight different community-oriented policing practices in place within the LEA: (a) problem-oriented policing projects, (b) a citizen academy, (c) a community-oriented policing plan, (d) geographic beats, (e) problem-solving evaluations, (f) citizen training in COPS, (g) partnering with citizen groups, and (h) a COPS–integrated mission statement. Last, openness was also measured in terms of the diversity of LEA personnel, calculated as a Gini index of workplace gender by race diversity (White, Black, and Other). Policing practices and personnel diversity are treated as distinctive features of an LEA’s susceptibility to external influences, which allows more precise empirical tests of their unique effects on profiling policy protocols. This represents a departure from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0011128708328863">Jenness and Grattet’s (2005)</xref> strategy for operationalizing perviousness, which they accomplished through a factor analysis of these items.</p>
<p>Agency concern about legitimacy among the public is measured by a dummy variable indicating whether the agency conducts public satisfaction surveys (1 = yes). In addition, two environmental variables are included in the analysis to control for other aspects of the LEA context. A dummy measure that indicates whether the LEA is a county sheriff or not (1 = yes) is included. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0011128708328863">Wilson’s (1968)</xref> pioneering work supports the notion that measures of agency type may be helpful in explaining institutional differences such as policy adoption. Also included is a dummy variable that reflects the LEA’s region of location in the nation. This dummy variable distinguishes between southern (1 = yes) and non-southern LEAs. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0011128708328863">King’s (2007)</xref> research shows that the level of enforcement of hate crime law by LEAs varies by region. Furthermore, the racial history of the South in the United States justifies including the South dummy as a control.</p>

<title>Findings</title>
<p>After inspection of univariate statistics and bivariate correlation tests (see the <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0011128708328863">appendix</xref>), logistic regression equations were estimated to explain the presence of agency profiling policy and data collection programs. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0011128708328863">Table 2</xref> shows the results of a series of logistic regression models that seek to explain the adoption of profiling policy and a data collection program separately. Separate models are estimated to test for the curvilinear predictions of the threat hypothesis by modeling the effects of the percentage Black term squared. The first two models in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0011128708328863">Table 2</xref> show the results of the logistic regression predicting the likelihood of an LEA possessing an antiprofiling policy. The results from the APP1 and APP2 model show that the log likelihood of possessing a profiling policy is significantly increased by community-oriented policing practices, the administration of a public satisfaction survey, and in the South region. None of the environmental variables is associated with changes in the log likelihood of a profiling policy, including the squared Black term.</p>

<p>The final two models in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0011128708328863">Table 2</xref> present the results of a logistic regression of possessing a computerized traffic stop data collection program on the environmental, organizational, and control variables. The likelihood that an LEA has a data collection program decreases as the percentage of the Black population increases. This finding is consistent with the racial threat hypothesis and contrary to the public demand hypothesis. Aside from racial composition, jurisdiction socioeconomic status is positively associated with a change in the log odds of a data collection program. Furthermore, there appears to be some evidence consistent with the functionality hypothesis, as serious crime negatively predicts a data collection program. In other words, as the level of serious crime increases, the likelihood of the LEA maintaining a data collection program decreases. Like the APP models, higher levels of agency-level community-oriented policing practices predict an increase in the log-odds of the agency implementing a data collection program. Personnel diversity is significant in both DCP models, but the effect is negative. That is, as personnel diversity increases in LEAs, the likelihood of a data collection program decreases. This effect is counter to the theoretical expectations of the openness hypothesis and runs counter to the effects of community policing practices. Perhaps this suggests that more diverse LEAs are less bureaucratic, at least with regard to supporting computerized data collection about traffic stops. It may also suggest that management is less likely to implement data collection protocols when the rank and file is more diverse; for example, racial profiling concerns may be diminished in such departments, as the presumption of antiminority prejudice as a basis for officer decision making is not thought to be as prevalent among female and racial minority personnel. In addition, the logits for both control variables, Sheriff and South, are both significant. Sheriff’s departments are significantly less likely than municipal police departments to sponsor a traffic stop data collection program, whereas LEAs in the South are significantly more likely than the rest of the nation to possess a data collection program for traffic stops.</p>
<p>Given the results of the DCP1 model and specific evidence that racial composition predicted changes in the log likelihood of a data collection program, a second logistic model containing a curvilinear racial threat term, percentage Black squared, was tested. The results of this model (DCP2) contained in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0011128708328863">Table 2</xref> reveal that the logit of percentage Black on the log odds of an agency data collection program is indeed curvilinear. As discussed previously, most of the extant studies testing aspects of the threat perspective have been interested in explaining features of formal state control. The expectation for a curvilinear effect of racial threat on formal control is that the distribution will resemble an inverted U-shape. In other words, as Black racial composition increases from zero, formal control outcomes should increase until the size of the Black population increases to the point where it tips and changes signs. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0011128708328863">Stucky (2005)</xref> finds a curvilinear effect for the percentage of Black population on municipal police strength (size) in a national sample of over 900 jurisdictions of at least 25,000 residents with a tipping point of 54% Black. Stucky’s findings are consistent with the notion that racial threat increases with minority population size but decreases soon after a minority group becomes a numerical majority. Data collection programs, however, are argued to be an accountability mechanism that reflects improving due process and limiting aspects of police discretion through monitoring. Thus, support for the threat model in studies of accountability or due process innovations should be found in a U-shaped distribution. That is, as the relative size of the Black population increases, the likelihood of accountability measures should decrease. At some point, perhaps around the time that the Black community achieves a statistical majority, the likelihood of implementing accountability measures—such as traffic stop data collection—should increase. The results of the DCP2 model show that the percentage Black squared term is negative and significant while the percentage Black term has switched signs from negative to positive and is also significant. This combination reflects an inverted U-shape rather than the expected U-shape predicted for a threat model of accountability mechanisms.</p>
<p>One may calculate the tipping point for the effect of the size of the Black population on the likelihood of an agency using a data collection program for traffic stops. To calculate the threshold for the curvilinear effect, the linear percentage Black coefficient is divided by −2 times the percentage Black squared coefficient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0011128708328863">Aiken &amp; West, 1991</xref>). The solution to this formula is .197 [3.498 / (−2 × −8.870)]. That is, the likelihood of a data collection program for traffic stops increases as the percentage of Black residents grows from 0% to 19.7% of the jurisdiction’s population. Beyond this threshold, Black racial composition exerted a negative influence on the likelihood of having a data collection program in the agency. Perhaps cues of racial threat do not begin to manifest in police organizational profiling policy and management features until the size of the Black community in the jurisdiction reaches a critical mass (as it approaches 20% of the population). All other effects persisted across the DCP1 and DCP2 models, with the exception of the South region variable, which dropped from statistical significance in the DCP2 model.</p>

<title>Discussion and Summary</title>
<p>This article set out to examine the environmental and organizational basis of racial profiling policy adoption by local LEAs. The study tested a number of research expectations associated with environment (community demand, threat, and functionality) and organization (openness and the institutional perspective). The results of logistic models testing these expectations for antiprofiling policy and data collection programs for traffic stops provided limited support for these expectations. Profiling policy was not explained by any of the environmental variables, with the exception of the control for South region. Organizational factors appeared to be more important for explaining policy adoption, with community-oriented policing and satisfaction surveys of the public significantly related to increases in the likelihood that an LEA maintains a profiling policy. Turning to the results of the models predicting the likelihood of a data collection program for traffic stops, multiple environmental effects emerged from the logistic model. Consistent with the threat prediction, increases in the relative size of the Black community in the jurisdiction were associated with a decrease in the likelihood that an LEA held a traffic stop data collection program. Furthermore, evidence of a curvilinear effect of racial threat was also found supportive of the racial threat hypothesis. Aside from racial composition, the likelihood of implementing a computerized traffic stop data system is associated with increases in the jurisdictional socioeconomic status and decreases in the rate of index crimes in the larger county (agency-jurisdiction included). Three organizational variables were also associated with increases in the likelihood that an LEA sponsored a data collection program: community-oriented policing practices (positive), diversity of LEA personnel (negative), and an organizational control for the type of agency (municipal agencies more likely than sheriffs).</p>
<p>The descriptive data drawn from the 2003 LEMAS suggest that implementing a profiling policy has become a standard feature of contemporary professional LEAs in the United States, with nearly 80% of all large LEAs possessing some form of profiling policy directive. It is likely that agencies with profiling policies adopt them for various reasons. Only a very small number have been compelled to do so by court order or consent decree, many more have been proactive in implementing antiprofiling policies on their own, perhaps as the issue began to acquire the degree of cultural significance it currently possesses. Publications by national police organizations suggest that the issue of race-based policing threatened the legitimacy of LEAs as professional organizations in a complex and multicultural society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0011128708328863">Fridell, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0011128708328863">International Association of Chiefs of Police, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0011128708328863">Miller, 2007</xref>). Professional police departments in the contemporary era better understand the importance of community relations in their efforts to establish and maintain legitimacy. Community policing has catalyzed police to change in a number of ways, though the extent of structural bureaucratic change among law enforcement organizations remains in doubt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0011128708328863">Maguire, 1997</xref>). One certain change is that LEAs have become more sensitive to the importance of public opinion about police performance. The analysis confirms that organizational sensitivity to public perception appears to increase the likelihood of implementing an antiprofiling policy. In fact, the findings suggest that organizational concern about legitimacy is more important than other organizational features expected to be associated with antiprofiling policy adoption. Profiling has reached a level of cultural significance that LEAs must engage in campaigns to demonstrate concern, regardless of evidence.</p>
<p>The findings provide some basis to consider the question of whether policy is a symbolic measure to address external perceptions about bias and police practice at the local level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0011128708328863">Gusfield, 1967</xref>) or whether policy is backed by organizational commitment to documenting the extent and nature of racial disparities. Comparing the environmental predictions across the policy and data collection measures suggests, as expected, that policy implementation may be a more symbolic maneuver than the implementation of a data collection protocol for traffic stops. Police scholars and professional organizations representing LEAs have both called for data collection as a central element of profiling policy, and it is a standard part of the terms in negotiated agreements and consent decrees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0011128708328863">Fridell, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0011128708328863">Harris, 2002</xref>). Although traffic stop data collection appears to be a part of the modern LEA, it has not become a standard part of departments to the extent that antiprofiling policy directives have. The results of the data collection models suggest that organizational openness is likely an important feature of agile LEAs that are willing to consider change and implement information gathering programs that help them make sense of their environment as well as their officers’ encounters with the environment. On the other hand, the results suggest that the adoption of concrete policy measures—those with greater potential to hold rank and file accountable, such as data collection protocols—are negatively linked to community-level racial threat.</p>
<p>Whether the pattern of widespread policy innovation has resulted in changes in the frequency or manner in which traffic stops are conducted is still unknown, and this represents an important next step in research on LEA responses to the racial profiling controversy. Some LEAs initially resisted policy implementation, arguing that such policies, including data collection programs, would decrease police productivity and result in adverse outcomes to public safety. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0011128708328863">Schultz and Withrow’s (2004)</xref> study found that some LEAs experienced a drop in traffic stop productivity following the implementation of a profiling policy. Their study did not explore how policy implementation influenced the racial composition of traffic stops, warnings, tickets, or vehicle searches. Whether or not policy implementation influences agency-level patterns of race-specific stop likelihood is an important question to investigate.</p>
<p>Among the primary questions this study raises is, what affect does the implementation of antiprofiling policy have on police behavior? Expectancy theory has been one of the primary management theories investigated by police scholars interested in how organizational factors may influence officer behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0011128708328863">Mastrofski &amp; Ritti, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0011128708328863">Mastrofski et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0011128708328863">Mastrofski et al., 1994</xref>). Expectancy theory suggests that organizational actors behave in ways that reflect the expectations of superiors. However, despite its intuitive appeal as a psychological model of organizational influence on officer action, this line of research shows that organizational expectations have only limited effects on police discretion. The significance of policy is mitigated by the extent to which it is meaningful in the contextually specific setting of the agency and either conforms to or is adaptable to the prevailing views of personnel. Of course, police agencies and their employees are notoriously resistant to change, especially if the change is initiated from outside of the department. Perhaps more interesting is not the question of the effects of policy on the volume of stops (productivity) or even its affect on racial disparities in agency-level stop patterns (fairness), but whether such policy innovation results in qualitative improvements in police discretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0011128708328863">Mastrofksi, 2006</xref>) in police-initiated actions such as traffic stops.</p>
<p>Another fruitful direction for future research could examine the extent and nature of profiling policy isomorphism. An examination of policy isomorphism is beyond the scope of the current study. Future surveys of law enforcement organizations might collect more detailed information about policy features that may be useful in testing the extent of agency commitment to such policy regimes. In light of the findings suggesting that departments that are more open are more likely to implement a profiling policy, it makes sense to pursue this line of research to determine whether policy implementation is motivated by concerns about institutional legitimacy or if it also improves or otherwise affects officer decision making.</p>

<p>A small number of large law enforcement agencies (LEAs) that possess Antiprofiling Policies have been compelled to do so by court order to address, at least in part, past grievances brought against the LEA by citizens. According to a report by the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0011128708328863">Racial Profiling Data Collection Resource Center at Northeastern University (2008)</xref>, five such agencies (Cincinnati, Ohio; District of Columbia; Los Angeles, California; Montgomery County, Maryland; and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania) and the State Police of New Jersey have entered into consent decrees or agreed to a negotiated Memorandum of Agreement with the federal government that resulted in new policies and practices that could be interpreted as an antiprofiling policy and/or a data collection program. These five cases have been removed from the sample, resulting in a sample of 798 LEAs.</p>

<p>A county-level crime measure was used, based on prior research on police traffic stop practices suggesting that police are aware of crime and other demographic features of communities that are adjacent to the jurisdiction of the LEA and that this knowledge may influence both police and public perceptions of the jurisdiction-level crime problem (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0011128708328863">Meehan &amp; Ponder, 2002</xref>). Local concern about crime is therefore partly a function of the broader dynamics associated with crime in neighboring jurisdictions in addition to crime in the LEA’s own jurisdiction. The county-level measure represents one strategy to capture this element of perceptions about the crime problem.</p>
