<abstract>
<p>Paclitaxel is a microtubule inhibitor causing mitotic arrest and is widely used in cancer chemotherapy. However, its poor water solubility restricts its direct clinical applications. In this article, we report paclitaxel-loaded nanoparticles that are water soluble and that can improve the drug’s bio-distribution and therapeutic efficacy. Paclitaxel-loaded nanoparticles were synthesized by using Pluronic copolymers (F-68 and P-123) and surfactant (Span 40) as nanocarrier. The toxicity and cellular uptake of paclitaxel-loaded nanoparticles were evaluated. The paclitaxel-loaded nanoparticles can completely disperse into phosphate buffer saline to produce a clear aqueous suspension. Based on HPLC analysis, the drug-loading rate is 9.0 ± 0.1% while drug encapsulation efficiency is 99.0 ± 1.0%. The cytotoxicity assay was performed using breast cancer MCF-7 and cervical cancer Hela cells. For MCF-7 cells, the half maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC<sub>50</sub>) of paclitaxel-loaded nanoparticles and paclitaxel are 8.5 ± 0.3 and 14.0 ± 0.7 ng/mL at 48 hours and 3.5 ± 0.4 and 5.2 ± 0.5 ng/mL at 72 hours across several runs. IC<sub>50</sub> of paclitaxel-loaded nanoparticles and paclitaxel for Hela cells are 5.0 ± 0.3 and 8.0 ± 0.3 ng/mL at 48 hours and 2.0 ± 0.1 and 6.5 ± 0.3 ng/mL at 72 hours. In-vitro studies show that the drug’s nanoformulation gives obvious enhancements in the drug’s efficiency at killing cancer cells over paclitaxel alone. Materials of the nanocarrier used for nanoformulation are approved with low toxicity according to the result of cell studies. Conclusion: paclitaxel-loaded nanoparticles greatly improved the physicochemical properties of paclitaxel without modifying its chemical structure, allowing for deep-site cancer drug delivery and enhancing the drug therapeutic efficiency.</p>

<p>Currently, more than 40% of new drugs have poor solubility in water or are completely water-insoluble.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0885328212446822">1</xref></sup> This restricts their ability to achieve their desired therapeutic effects. To achieve effective treatment, high doses or continuous infusion are used in clinical applications and this inevitably increases undesirable side effects. Nanotechnology is a new emerging technology in pharmaceutical formulations with the potential to enhance drug solubility, selective targeting and controlled release.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0885328212446822">2</xref></sup> To make insoluble drugs water-soluble, several micro/nano modalities have been used, including liposomes,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0885328212446822">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0885328212446822"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0885328212446822">5</xref></sup> polymeric/copolymeric micelles,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0885328212446822">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0885328212446822"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0885328212446822">8</xref></sup> nanospheres,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0885328212446822">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0885328212446822">10</xref></sup> nanocapsules,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0885328212446822">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0885328212446822">12</xref></sup> cyclodextrin complexes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0885328212446822">13</xref></sup> and surfactant micelles,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0885328212446822">14</xref></sup> but each modality has its own unique advantages and shortcomings.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0885328212446822">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0885328212446822"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0885328212446822">17</xref></sup> Of these approaches, copolymeric micellar systems offer the greatest flexibility in tuning drug solubility, nanoparticle size, targeted delivery and long-term stability.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0885328212446822">18</xref></sup> These self-assembled structures of amphiphilic block copolymers are sandwiched by a biocompatible hydrophilic outer shell feature and a hydrophobic inner core, which is able to encapsulate insoluble drugs and protect the drug from chemical degradation. Polyethylene glycol (PEG), with molecular weight 2–15 kD, is typically used as hydrophilic segment that is biocompatible and biodegradable.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0885328212446822">19</xref></sup> In addition to the PEG, poly(N-vinyl pyrrolidone) (PVP) and poly(N-isopropyl acrylamide) are also applied as hydrophilic segments, and degradable by enzymes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0885328212446822">20</xref></sup> Polyesters, polypeptides, poly(amino ester) and polyethers are used commonly as hydrophobic segments to encapsulate insoluble drugs, and are also biodegradable (except for polyethers).</p>
<p>Pluronic copolymers, which are types of polyethers, are broadly applied in the food and pharmaceutical industries and are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as pharmaceutical excipients. They are synthesized using ethylene oxide (EO) and propylene oxide (PO) with simple chemical process and are quite cheap. A molecule of pluronic copolymer is composed of hydrophilic PEG and hydrophobic polypropylene glycol (PPG). In aqueous medium, they self-assemble and form micelles that encapsulate insoluble drugs. Pluronic copolymers were shown to be inhibitors of P-glycoprotein that sensitize multidrug-resistant (MDR) tumors to paclitaxel (PTX) and other anticancer agents in-vitro and in-vivo.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0885328212446822">21</xref></sup> In vivo, the major metabolic pathway for Pluronics is through the urinary system. Pluronics can effectively pass through the kidneys and be excreted through the urine.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0885328212446822">22</xref></sup> Pluronic copolymers are promising pharmaceutical additives for formulating insoluble or poor water-soluble anti-cancer drugs.</p>
<p>PTX is a chemotherapy drug that has been widely used to treat breast, cervical and non-small cell lung cancers. PTX disrupts cellular microtubules causing cellular mitotic arrest, thus inhibiting cancer cells mitosis and division.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0885328212446822">23</xref></sup> The poor water solubility of PTX has made it difficult for it to be delivered into deep-site cancer through conventional routes, such as oral, intravenous or intramuscular injection. A number of attempts have been made to improve the water solubility of PTX or to produce its derivatives by chemically modifying its molecular structure, including taxol-2′-MPA,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0885328212446822">2</xref></sup> 2′-[3-(N, N-Diethylamino) propionyl] taxo1 and Glycan-Based PTX.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0885328212446822">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0885328212446822">25</xref></sup> However, these derivatives alter the pharmacological properties of the original PTX drug because these modifications change the chemical structure of PTX. To avoid altering the PTX structure, different nanoformulations were used to improve the properties of the PTX. Zhang et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0885328212446822">26</xref></sup> reported formulating PTX using Pluronic P123/F127 and achieved a drug loading of 1.42 ± 0.10% and an encapsulation efficiency of 97.34 ± 0.68%. PTX in this formulation degraded more than 6.9% in 48 hours. Because of low stability in aqueous medium and low drug loading, the higher dose of excipients has to be used in the formulation resulting in increased toxic side effects for normal tissue and PTX precipitation in body. To increase drug loading, Keun Sang Oh et al. reported formulating PTX using Pluronic F68/PEG400 at a high temperature (120℃) and achieved a drug loading of 9.8 ± 0.1% and an encapsulation efficiency of 98 ± 0.9%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0885328212446822">27</xref></sup> However, the high temperature could chemically degrade PTX because transesterification could occur between PTX and PEG400.</p>
<p>To overcome the previous problems, we report in this article the use of a mixture of pluronic P123/F68 and Sorbitan monopalmitate (Span 40) as a nanocarrier to load PTX to form PTX-nanoparticles (PTX-NPs). The schematic diagram of drug formulation is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0885328212446822">Figure 1</xref>. In all, PTX-NPs become water-soluble while still maintaining the original chemical structure of PTX.

<p>PTX-loaded pluronic copolymers and Span micelles (Pluronic-Span) were prepared through a modified thin-film hydration method.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0885328212446822">28</xref></sup> Briefly, 10.0 mg PTX, 98.0 mg pluronic copolymers, 2.0 mg Span 40 and 10 mL ethanol were mixed in a 50 mL round-bottom flask by a digital vortex mixer at 3000 rpm for 2 minutes. Then ethanol was evaporated via rotary vacuum evaporation at 60℃ for about 10 minutes to obtain a thin film of PTX/Pluronic-Span 40 on the wall of the flask. The thin film was then hydrated with a pre-determined amount of distilled water at a hydration temperature of 30℃. The mixture was stirred by a digital vortex mixer at 3000 rpm for 2 minutes, then treated by ultrasound (239 W, FS30H) in a water bath for 5 minutes to obtain a clear micelle solution. This micelle solution was then centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 minutes at room temperature to remove the unincorporated drug aggregate. Finally, the formulation underwent lyophilisation (Freezone<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0885328212446822">4</xref>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0885328212446822">5</xref></sup>, LABCONCO) for 48 hours.

Sample solution was injected at a volume of 10 µL with a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min for the mobile phase; the typical retention time was around 4.3 minutes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0885328212446822">Figure 2(b)</xref>). The concentrations of PTX were determined by comparing the peak areas with the standard curve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0885328212446822">Figure 3(c)</xref>). The lyophilized PTX-NPs were dissolved in DMSO or ethanol, effective solvents for PTX, and stirred at 3000 rpm by a digital vortex mixer for 2 minutes, centrifuged at 1200 rpm for 5 minutes and then the supernatant fraction injected onto the HPLC system.

The solvent was removed by rotary evaporation at 60℃ for about 10 minutes to obtain a thin film of in-FITC-PTX/Pluronic-Span matrix. The thin film was then hydrated with a pre-determined amount of water. The mixture was stirred by digital vortex mixer at 3000 rpm for 2 minutes, then treated by ultrasound (239 W, FS30H) for 5 minutes to obtain a clear micelle solution. This clear micelle solution was subsequently centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 minutes at room temperature to remove unincorporated drug and in-FITC aggregates, followed by lyophilisation (Freezone<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0885328212446822">4</xref>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0885328212446822">5</xref></sup>, LABCONCO) for 48 hours.</p>

<p>PTX-NPs were prepared by the thin-film hydration method. PTX and Span 40 were dissolved in ethanol at room temperature. Pluronic copolymers can be thoroughly dissolved in ethanol at 50–60℃. These two solutions were mixed to form a clear homogenous solution. After ethanol was removed from the mixture via rotary vacuum evaporator, water was quickly injected into the matrix. The polymeric solution was stirred by a vortex mixer for 2 minutes and sonicated in an ultrasonic bath for 5 minutes at room temperature, resulting in spontaneous formation of PTX-entrapped polymeric nanoparticles (PTX-NPs). Since the pluronic copolymers are amphiphilic block copolymers with PEG as a hydrophilic block and PPG as a hydrophobic block, the formed PTX-NPs may have a core-shell structure with hydrophobic PPG as the core entrapping precipitated PTX and PEG block as the hydrophilic stabilization shell. Span 40 is a poor water surfactant which interacts strongly with PTX and helps pluronic polymers load PTX into nanoparticles (see discussion in next paragraph). The drug loading content (D.L.) and the encapsulation efficiency (E.E.) were calculated by following the equations (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0885328212446822">Table 1</xref>):

<p>Span 40 was used in our nanoformulation to help Pluronic copolymers encapsulate more PTX than another formulation previously reported.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0885328212446822">26</xref></sup> Due to the water insolubility of both PTX and Span 40, both chemicals tend to locate themselves in the core of micelles as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0885328212446822">Figure 1</xref>. The interactions that occurred between PTX and Span 40 helped the nanoformulation encapsulate more PTX in the core. Based on their chemical molecular structures, although the interaction between PTX and Span 40 may occur due to dipole-dipole, dipole-induced dipole and dispersion, hydrogen bonding plays a key role in bonding PTX and Span 40. When Span 40 and PTX are mixed, Span 40 is adsorbed on the surface of PTX particles, thus changing the surface properties of the PTX. When Pluronic copolymers (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0885328212446822">Figure 1</xref>) were added to the mixture of PTX and Span 40, hydrophobic segment of pluronic polymer strongly interacted with PTX because the hydrophobic tail of Span 40 has fourteen CH<sub>2</sub> groups and one CH<sub>3</sub> group, and the hydrophobic segment of pluronic polymer (P123) has seventy CH<sub>2</sub> groups, seventy CH<sub>3</sub> groups and seventy CH groups. Moreover, Span 40 has low toxicity based on our experimental results.</p>

<p>PTX-NPs were characterized by SEM, TEM and DLS. The morphological structure of PTX-NPs was studied by SEM and TEM. The SEM and TEM pictures are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0885328212446822">Figure 4(a) and (b)</xref>, which indicate that most of PTX-NPs are spherical. It was also found that bright and dark areas were seen in these nanoparticles. The bright area could be attributed to the PEG block of Pluronic copolymers and the dark area could respond to the hydrophobic core of PPG chains and PTX. The mean size of PTX-NPs is 139.8 nm as determined by DLS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0885328212446822">Figure 4(c)</xref>). This size of nanoparticles could be small enough to evade detection and destruction by the reticuloendothelial system (RES) and achieve longevity during systemic circulation.

For cervical cancer Hela cells, 5 ng/ml PTX in PTX-NPs killed more than 80.23% of the cells at 72 hours, but 5 ng/ml PTX only induced the death of about 38.49% of the cells by the same time (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0885328212446822">Figure 2(c) and (d)</xref>).

<p>To monitor the dynamic process of cytotoxicity induced by PTX and PTX-NPs, we used an RT-CES system to track drug cytotoxicity in real time. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0885328212446822">Figure 5(c)</xref> is the RT-CES setup and its test results, both drugs exhibit similar reactions with MCF-7 breast cancer cells. Compared to control cells, the drugs (PTX and PTX-NPs) caused a decrease in survival rate of cancer cells by 50% at 48 hours. The IC<sub>50</sub> values are 8.5 ng/mL for PTX-NPs and 14 ng/mL for PTX in ethanol. From this data, we can conclude that water solubility is an important mechanism for improving drug efficacy.</p>

<sec id="sec26-0885328212446822"><title>Cellular uptake of PTX-NPs</title>
<p>The concentrations of PTX that were taken up by Hela or MCF-7 cells were quantified using HPLC analysis. After exposure to PTX-NPs at a PTX concentration of 10 µg/mL for 2 hours, Hela and MCF-7 cells absorbed 6.54 × 10<sup>−4 </sup>± 0.0 and 3.43 × 10<sup>−3 </sup>± 4.22 × 10<sup>−4 </sup>ng PTX per cell. After exposure to PTX-ethanol at a PTX concentration of 10 µg/mL, Hela cells absorbed 4.22 × 10<sup>−4 </sup>± 1.09 × 10<sup>−4 </sup>ng of PTX per cell, and no PTX in MCF-7 cell lysate was determined because the concentration is lower than test limit of HPLC. The test limit of HPLC for MCF-7 is 200 ng/ml. Therefore, PTX in MCF-7 cell lysate was lower than 200 ng/ml or 2.0 × 10<sup>−3 </sup>ng PTX per cell. This result indicates that MCF-7 cells uptook more of the nanoformulated PTX drug. To evaluate the cellular uptake of PTX-NPs through imaging, we made fluorescent PTX-NPs (F-PTX-NPs). We used this nanoparticle to study the uptake of PTX-NPs by MCF-7 breast cancer cells. Compared to the control, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0885328212446822">Figure 7</xref> shows cellular uptake of PTX-NPs after 1 and 4 hours of uptake. Green fluorescent intensity increased with time, indicating that more of the drug entered the cells as time elapsed. This result is in line with our expectation that the water-soluble drug can kill cancer cells better than the original water-insoluble PTX drug.

<p>In this study, a new nanoformation was developed for PTX. The PTX-NPs are superior to the original PTX drug, which cannot be achieved by traditional drug formulations or other nanoformulations reported previously because PTX-NPs can combine multiple functions in a single platform. First, the nanoformulation easily conferred water solubility to PTX without changing the drug's chemical structure. In our study, this formulation shows greater drug efficacy owing to increased drug biodistribution attributed to better water solubility. Second, with the assistance of Span 40, PTX-NPs greatly improve PTX loading with a load efficiency of 9.0 ± 0.1% and a drug encapsulation efficiency of 99.0 ± 1.0%. The nanoformulation significantly improves drug loading rate which was increased from the 1.5% previously reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0885328212446822">26</xref></sup> to 9.0%. Increased drug loading results in a decrease in side effects induced by high doses of excipients. Third, the ingredients in the nanoformulation, such as PEG, also helped PTX evade the RES, thereby prolonging circulation half-life to improve the drug biodistribution in vivo. Finally, sensing functions were showcased which could be used for diagnosis. Fluorescent or other labeling produces nanoparticles with sensing ability for diagnosis. This ability will be significantly enhanced when the nanoparticles are capable of targeted delivery.</p>

<sec id="sec28-0885328212446822" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Although PTX has been widely and effectively used for cancer chemotherapy in clinics across the globe, development of a new formulation to solve the problem of the PTX drug’s water solubility is urgently needed. In this study, we developed a new nanoformulation for PTX where Span 40 is added into the formulation to significantly enhance the capability of PTX loading with an overall six-fold increase compared to similar existing published results. The PTX-NPs showed greater drug efficacy due to increased drug biodistribution in the cancer cells which is attributed to higher water solubility. These results open up further exploration of biomedical applications of novel PTX-NPs for potential clinical usage in the future.</p>
