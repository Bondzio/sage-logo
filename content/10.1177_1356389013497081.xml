<abstract>
<p>Validity and generalization continue to be challenging aspects in designing and conducting case study evaluations, especially when the number of cases being studied is highly limited (even limited to a single case). To address the challenge, this article highlights current knowledge regarding the use of: (1) rival explanations, triangulation, and logic models in strengthening validity, and (2) analytic generalization and the role of theory in seeking to generalize from case studies. To ground the discussion, the article cites specific practices and examples from the existing literature as well as from the six preceding articles assembled in this special issue. Throughout, the article emphasizes that current knowledge may still be regarded as being at its early stage of development, still leaving room for more learning. The article concludes by pointing to three topics worthy of future methodological inquiry, including: (1) examining the connection between the way that initial evaluation questions are posed and the selection of the appropriate evaluation method in an ensuing evaluation, (2) the importance of operationally defining the ‘complexity’ of an intervention, and (3) raising awareness about case study evaluation methods more generally.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The classic case study consists of an in-depth inquiry into a specific and complex phenomenon (the ‘case’), set within its real-world context. To arrive at a sound understanding of the case, a case study should not be limited to the case in isolation but should examine the likely interaction between the case and its context. Technically, such an objective adds to a common problem, whether doing case study research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1356389013497081">Yin, 2014</xref>) or case study evaluation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1356389013497081">Yin and Ridde, 2012</xref>): the number of datapoints (each case being a single datapoint) will be far outstripped by the number of variables under study – because of the complexity of the case as well as the embracing of the contextual conditions. This situation is nearly impossible to remedy, even if a modest number of cases is included as part of the same (multiple-) case study. As a result, the usual analytic techniques based on having a large number of datapoints and a small number of variables (thereby permitting estimates of means and variances) are likely to be irrelevant in doing case study research.</p>
<p>For evaluations, the ability to address the complexity and contextual conditions nevertheless establishes case study methods as a viable alternative among the other methodological choices, such as survey, experimental, or economic research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1356389013497081">Stufflebeam and Shinkfield, 2007</xref>). The conditions appear especially relevant in efforts to evaluate highly broad and complex initiatives; for example, systems reforms, service delivery integration, community and economic development projects, and international development (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1356389013497081">Yin and Davis, 2007</xref>). At the same time, doing case study evaluations with acceptable and rigorous procedures must rely on a state-of-the-art still in its formative stages.</p>
<p>The May 2012 workshop on ‘Validity, Generalization, and Learning’ provided an opportunity for a variety of scholars to share their working knowledge and to advance the state-of-the-art. Six of the presentations became the other articles contained in this journal issue.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1356389013497081">1</xref></sup> Together, the six assembled articles form a basis for briefly reviewing the key practices regarding validity and generalization when doing case study evaluations. The present article tries to reinforce and also to elaborate upon the six articles. The goal is to stimulate yet newer contributions on all these important methodological practices. Only in this manner will case study evaluations continue to get stronger. The article is organized according to a slight adaptation of the main themes of the original workshop: Strengthening validity; Seeking to generalize; and Still more learning.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1356389013497081">
<title>Strengthening validity</title>
<p>Case study evaluations may limit themselves to descriptive or even exploratory objectives. However, the greatest challenge arises when case study evaluations fill an explanatory role. This means: (a) documenting (and interpreting) a set of outcomes, and then (b) trying <italic>to explain how those outcomes came about</italic>. When adopting such an explanatory objective, a case study evaluation will in effect be examining causal relationships. The evaluation thus squarely confronts issues of internal validity.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1356389013497081">2</xref></sup> To address these issues, the small number of cases in a case study – frequently involving only a single case – precludes the use of conventional experimental designs. These require the availability of a sufficiently large number of cases that can in turn be divided into two (or more) comparison groups. Instead, case study evaluations must rely on other techniques.</p>
<p>One evaluative approach has been to conduct and document direct observations of the events and actions as they actually occur in a local setting as a critical part of a case study’s data collection (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1356389013497081">Erickson, 2012</xref>: 688; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1356389013497081">Maxwell, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1356389013497081">2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1356389013497081">Miles and Huberman, 1994</xref>: 132). The inquiry can highlight the contextual role of the local settings and accommodate if not feature the non-linear and recursive flows of events (‘feedback loops that occur at irregular times’ – <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1356389013497081">Betts, 2013</xref>: 255) as well as the possibility of entertaining multiple causes, both proximal and distal. However, the ensuing analysis remains highly qualitative and may not be very convincing.</p>
<p>To improve on the precision of such an approach and to boost confidence in the findings, two of the six assembled articles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1356389013497081">Befani, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1356389013497081">Byrne, 2013</xref>) offer insights into a technique known as qualitative comparative analysis (QCA), developed by Charles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1356389013497081">Ragin (1987</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1356389013497081">2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1356389013497081">2009</xref>). This technique captures within-case patterns or <italic>configurations</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1356389013497081">Byrne, 2013</xref>: 224), consisting of the combination of intervention and outcome conditions for each particular case being studied. The cross-case analysis then becomes the systematic comparison of these within-case configurations or sets of intervention-outcome conditions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1356389013497081">3</xref></sup> When a sufficiently large number of cases is available, QCA can be ‘strong in testing, refining, and validating findings’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1356389013497081">Befani, 2013</xref>: 280). As examples, Befani’s article discusses two illustrations, having 17 and 11 cases, respectively.</p>
<p>The more advanced versions of QCA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1356389013497081">Ragin, 2000</xref>) permit the handling of 50 to 100 cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1356389013497081">Befani, 2013</xref>: 281–82). However, such a capability, as well as the QCA procedure more generally, may in fact focus on <italic>cases</italic> rather than on the conduct of <italic>in-depth case studies</italic>. Except when pre-existing cases are already archivally available, a study covering a large number of new in-depth case studies is likely to be difficult to conduct, because of both the elapsed time and the resources needed by the study. QCA’s capability, therefore, may move in the opposite direction from the initial challenge of confronting validity with a small number of cases, including the classic single-case study. For such situations, the six assembled articles gave less attention to three known practices, possibly because the practices remain underdeveloped.</p>
<sec id="section3-1356389013497081">
<title>Plausible, rival explanations</title>
<p>The role of examining plausible rival explanations has been readily recognized in doing evaluations (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1356389013497081">Maxwell, 2004</xref>: 257–60; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1356389013497081">Yin, 2000b</xref>). Appealing to such rivals has formed a central part of nearly all types of research in the social and physical sciences (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1356389013497081">Campbell, 2014</xref>: xvii–xviii). Although experimental designs may control for all rivals (but without specifying any of them), the number of <italic>plausible</italic> rivals competing with the main hypothesized causal relationships in a case study may be sufficiently limited that they can be studied directly. Thus, as part of the same case study, the procedure calls for a vigorous search for data related to the rivals, as if trying to find support for them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1356389013497081">Patton, 2002</xref>: 553; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1356389013497081">Rosenbaum, 2002</xref>: 8–10).</p>
<p>Given a vigorous search, but finding no such support, more confidence can be placed in the main hypothesized relationships. The degree of certainty will be lower than that associated with an experimental design but higher than if a case study had not investigated any plausible rivals. As noted in the field of education research, ‘the use of qualitative methods . . . can be particularly helpful in ruling out alternative explanations . . . [and] can enable stronger causal inferences’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1356389013497081">Shavelson and Towne, 2002</xref>: 109). For a case study evaluation, the most common rivals might be the existence of: an initiative similar to or overlapping with the intervention being evaluated; a salient policy shift not related to the intervention; or some other identifiable influence in the contextual environment.</p>
<p>However, beyond being identified as an integral and critical part of doing an evaluation, the operational procedure for making comparisons with plausible rival explanations has received little attention. Explicit procedures are needed to deal with how and whether the acceptance or rejection of rivals meets such benchmarks as being ‘acceptable,’ ‘weak,’ or ‘strong,’ or even how to distinguish between a plausible rival and a mere red herring. In addition, the operational steps involved in comparing the rival findings with those related to the main hypothesis may be intricate and may benefit from being represented as formal designs. To this extent, the use of plausible rival explanations remains an extremely promising but still underdeveloped procedure for strengthening the validity of case study evaluations.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1356389013497081">
<title>Triangulation</title>
<p>Triangulation presents a similar situation. The principle has been long understood (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1356389013497081">Denzin, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1356389013497081">Jick, 1979</xref>), with at least four types of triangulation being possible: (1) data source triangulation, (2) analyst triangulation, (3) theory/perspective triangulation, and (4) methods triangulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1356389013497081">Patton, 2002</xref>: 556–63). Of the four, the data source and methods types in particular are likely to strengthen the validity of a case study evaluation. Renewed interest in mixed methods research has highlighted the ways in which a methods triangulation can provide increased confidence in the findings from a study that has combined quantitative with qualitative methods (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1356389013497081">Creswell and Plano Clark, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1356389013497081">Teddlie and Tashakkori, 2009</xref>). (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1356389013497081">Vellema et al. [2013</xref>: Table 1], briefly refer to their use of one of the other kinds of triangulation: theory/perspective triangulation.)</p>
<p>Many case study evaluations, especially those focusing on broad or complex interventions, can involve a combination of two or more methods. When these methods are purposely designed to collect some overlapping data, the possibility for triangulation certainly exists and, if the results are convergent, greater confidence may be placed in the evaluation’s overall findings. Similarly, convergence over the examination of causal relationships will strengthen the evaluation’s internal validity.</p>
<p>At the same time, operational procedures for carrying out triangulations also have received little attention. No benchmarks exist to define when triangulation might be considered ‘strong’ or ‘weak’ or ‘complete’ or ‘incomplete.’ Similarly, sufficient triangulation might involve an intricate number of steps that need to be represented as formal designs. The ultimate goal, as with making comparisons with plausible rival explanations, calls for a common procedure that can be routinely adopted and used by many if not all case study evaluations.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1356389013497081">
<title>Logic models</title>
<p>Case study evaluations frequently use logic models, initially to express the theoretical causal relationships between an intervention and its outcomes, and then to guide data collection on these same topics. The collected data can be analyzed by comparing the empirical findings with the initially stipulated theoretical relationships, and a match between the empirical and the theoretical adds to the support for explaining how an intervention produced (or not) its outcomes.</p>
<p>The practice of using logic models in evaluations has again been understood for a lengthy period of time (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1356389013497081">Wholey, 1979</xref>). Nevertheless, although the practice of using logic models has become quite common, little has occurred to sharpen their use and strengthen their role.</p>
<p>For instance, a major shortcoming derives from the coincidentally graphic similarities between logic models and flow charts. Both are usually expressed as a sequence of boxes. In the case of the logic model, the boxes represent the key steps or events within an intervention and then between the intervention and its outcomes. Graphically, the boxes are then connected by arrows that identify the links between and among the events. Unfortunately, most evaluations collect data about the boxes, but nearly no data about the arrows. Yet they represent the flow of transitional or causal conditions, showing or explaining how one event (box) might actually lead to another event (a second box). One possible reason for such negligence is that transitional data are irrelevant in flow charts, which only represent the shifting from one task to another, but without implying any causal relationship. For logic models not having any transitional data, only a correlational analysis can be conducted, reducing the causal value (and validity) of the entire exercise. Future studies could again investigate ways of improving the use of logic models.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1356389013497081">
<title>Summary</title>
<p>Case study evaluations need to continue to confront the challenge of strengthening validity. Several known methodological practices accept rather than avoid the necessary underlying assumption that the typical case study will only include a small number of cases: checking for plausible, rival explanations; triangulating data or methods; and using logic models. These practices deserve greater attention than they have attracted in the past. In each situation, although the practices have been recognized and used for many years, the preceding paragraphs have suggested that room for improvement still exists. Future methodological contributions could therefore yield desirable payoffs.</p>

<sec id="section7-1356389013497081">
<title>Seeking to generalize</title>
<p>Concerns in doing case study evaluations extend from issues of validity to issues of generalization. In international development, the generalizations form the basis for transferring lessons from one country to another as well as for ‘scaling-up’ a desirable intervention within the same country. This facet of the May 2012 workshop theme led the six assembled articles to delve, in some cases quite deeply, into generalization issues.</p>
<p>The widespread assumption, embraced by most of the articles as well as the prevailing evaluation literature, interprets case study generalization as an effort to generalize from a small number of cases to a larger population of cases (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1356389013497081">Byrne, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1356389013497081">Ragin, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1356389013497081">Seawright and Gerring, 2008</xref>; and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1356389013497081">Woolcock, 2013</xref>). The common quest has been, first, to establish a sufficiently precise definition of the ‘case’ being studied (if not at the outset of a case study at least by its conclusion), and then to (retrospectively) define the broader population of relevant cases. The process mimics the conventional sampling procedure but can fail for two reasons.</p>
<p>First, the difficulties of selecting the initial case(s) usually mean that the case(s) being studied do not represent a known, much less random sample from the larger set of cases. An additional and circular problem involves not fully understanding the case or having sufficient data for selection purposes to be able to define the potential population of cases; but, without knowing the population, not being able to define fully the nature of the sampled case(s) to be studied.</p>
<p>Second, if a study genuinely takes advantage of the case study method – that is, by probing a case and its context in-depth – the study will likely only be able to include a small number of cases. In fact, the classic case study, as well as many case study evaluations, is usually limited to only a single case. The goal of understanding a case and its context, potentially over a meaningful period of time, is sufficiently engrossing that, even if <italic>thick description</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1356389013497081">Geertz, 1973</xref>) is not the end result, a case study will just not be able to cover more than a small number of cases. The only way of increasing the number of cases to some substantial level would mean sacrificing the in-depth and contextual nature of the insights inherent in using the case study method in the first place.</p>
<sec id="section8-1356389013497081">
<title>Analytic generalization</title>
<p>Instead of pursuing the sample-to-population logic, analytic generalization can serve as an appropriate logic for generalizing the findings from a case study (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1356389013497081">Bromley, 1986</xref>: 290–1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1356389013497081">Burawoy, 1991</xref>: 271–87; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1356389013497081">Donmoyer, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1356389013497081">Gomm et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1356389013497081">Mitchell, 1983</xref>; and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1356389013497081">Small, 2009</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1356389013497081">4</xref></sup> By analytic generalization is meant the extraction of a more abstract level of ideas from a set of case study findings – ideas that nevertheless can pertain to newer situations other than the case(s) in the original case study. For case study evaluations, the analytic generalization should aim to apply to other concrete situations and not just to contribute to abstract theory building.</p>
<p>The desired analytic generalization also should go beyond serving only as a ‘working hypothesis’ (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1356389013497081">Cronbach, 1975</xref>) – that is, one in need of further study rather than being ready to be generalized or applied to new situations. This shortcoming is not easily overcome. However, carefully linking an analytic generalization to the related research literature by identifying overlaps as well as gaps will help. Replication of the same findings by conducting a second or third case study (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1356389013497081">Yin, 2014</xref>: 57–9) can strengthen the generalization even further. Eventually, the ideal generalization may extend not only to other ‘like’ cases but also ‘apply to many different types of cases’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1356389013497081">Bennett, 2004</xref>: 50).</p>
<p>This manner of generalizing is not peculiar to doing case studies but is in fact analogous to the way that generalizations are made in doing experiments. Thus, the selection and conduct of an experiment derives from the goal of developing fresh data about some initially hypothesized conditions – or about discovering a totally new condition – but not from being a sample of some known, larger population of like experiments.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1356389013497081">5</xref></sup> Case study research follows a similar motive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1356389013497081">Yin, 2014</xref>: 44).</p>
<p>One of the six assembled articles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1356389013497081">Mookherji and LaFond, 2013</xref>) demonstrated the development of analytic generalizations in considerable detail. The study examined the ‘initiatives and processes [that were] actually “driving” the improvements in routine immunization [projects in three African countries]’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1356389013497081">Mookherji and LaFond, 2013</xref>: 288). A critical analytic step occurred after the data had been collected: the identification of the varied drivers in each of the case studies, followed by a cross-case synthesis of how the case-specific drivers fell into six categories, each representing one of six (conceptually) common drivers (see Table 1 of their article).</p>
<p>Based on these and other cross-case findings, Mookherji and LaFond formulated a comprehensive framework depicting the flow of pre-conditions, contextual conditions, and drivers (see Figure 4 of their article). The framework, now empirically derived, explains how and why immunization projects can succeed. In the authors’ view, it became the basis for generalizing the results from their evaluation to other districts in other African countries (p. 22). (By inspecting the framework closely, a reader might even speculate that the framework can pertain to immunization projects outside of that region – or even to the design of community health initiatives more broadly.)</p>
<p>Mookherji and LaFond’s example shows how analytic generalization offers improved ways of generalizing from case study evaluations. An additional line of thinking that builds on the importance of analytic generalization is described next.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1356389013497081">
<title>The role of ‘theory’ in making analytic generalizations</title>
<p>Mookherji and LaFond rightfully regarded their framework as expressing a theory of change (p. 23). One way to have further strengthened their framework would have been to connect it to the extant literature, which contains a considerable body of work on the locally decentralized service delivery conditions and the local partnering arrangements central to their framework. The authors might then have been able to discuss how their case study contributed (or not) to new knowledge about health interventions, and whether their findings were limited to immunization projects or could be applied to community health projects more generally.</p>
<p>In essence, the desired analytic generalization should present an explanation of how and why the initiative being evaluated produced results (or not) – or, for non-evaluation studies, how and why the studied events occurred (or not). In this latter regard, two other examples are worth noting. The first is Graham Allison’s well-known single-case study on the Cuban missile crisis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1356389013497081">Allison, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1356389013497081">Allison and Zelikow, 1999</xref>). The case study has for over 30 years been a best-seller in the field of political science because of its analytic generalizations and implications for a broad array of international relationships.</p>
<p>The second example (also illustrating how a detailed single-case study can be published in a leading academic journal, even given its page-length limitations) examined how the Croatian government represented the country’s past, present, and future in the aftermath of the wars of Yugoslav secession (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1356389013497081">Rivera, 2008</xref>). The wars had left a reputation-damaging effect, threatening Croatia’s highly valued tourist industry. The case study showed how, in response, the government reframed the country’s past by omitting the war in its representations of national history, re-positioning the country as more closely sharing a history and culture with its Western European neighbors. The explanation for these findings then drew from a prevailing theoretical framework, in which the author innovatively extended Erving Goffman’s well-regarded work on stigma and the management of ‘spoiled identity’ from the individual to the institutional realm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1356389013497081">Goffman, 1963</xref>).

<title>Summary</title>
<p>The preferred manner of generalizing from case studies and case study evaluations is likely to take the form of making an analytic or conceptual generalization, rather than of reaching for a numeric one. The desired generalization should present an explanation for how an evaluated initiative produces its results (or not). The explanation can be regarded as a theory of sorts – certainly more than a set of isolated concepts – and therefore yield a better understanding of an intervention and its outcomes. Whether such an explanation is based on a theory that emerged for the first time from a case study or had been entertained in hypothetical form prior to the conduct of the case study, researchers need to connect the theory to the extant literature, or alternatively, to use their findings to explain the gaps and weaknesses in that literature. By doing so, the generalizations from a single case study can be interpreted with greater meaning and lead to a desired cumulative knowledge. Finally, replications of the original case study also help.</p>
<p>At the same time, the strongest empirical foundation for these generalizations derives from the close-up, in-depth study of a specific case in its real-world context.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1356389013497081">6</xref></sup> Such a condition usually limits the number of cases that can be studied. In turn, such a limitation precludes applying the conventional numeric, or sample-to-population generalizations when doing case studies. If, in contrast, an evaluation genuinely has an overarching goal of establishing or estimating numeric relationships, doing a case study evaluation might not be the preferred method to satisfy such a goal.</p>

<title>Still more learning</title>
<p>The present article’s treatment of validity and generalization suggests ways that case study evaluations can gain from methodological studies yet to be done. These studies need to focus on case study practices to strengthen future case study evaluations. In this sense, there is still more learning to be done. Discussed next are three topics connected to validity and generalization that represent priorities for the desired methodological studies.</p>
<sec id="section12-1356389013497081">
<title>Noting carefully the nature of the initial evaluation questions</title>
<p>Perhaps the most important inquiry points to the very start of a case study evaluation – its evaluation questions. These questions have serious implications for the remainder of the case study. However, many case study evaluations may not be attending carefully to the way that these questions are posed. How best to pose these questions, therefore, should be a high priority for future investigation. Such studies could be quite straightforward, for example, conducting a meta-analysis of completed evaluations, deliberately covering a variety of forms of questions and types of evaluation methods.</p>
<p>The studies might initially assume that the desired questions for case study evaluations, as with case study research more generally, should be cast as ‘how’ or ‘why’ questions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1356389013497081">Yin, 2014</xref>: 10–11). Such questions implicitly direct attention to events and actions over time, including but not limited to causal processes (and therefore not restricted to explanatory case study evaluations but also embracing descriptive ones). The strength of the subsequent case study would be its ability to examine the relevant events and actions in all their complexity, even if re-creating a contemporary period of time retrospectively. ‘How’ and ‘why’ questions, for instance, highlighted the seven questions posed in doing each of the three country case studies in Mookherji and LaFond’s article (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1356389013497081">2013</xref>: 289).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, many evaluations, including those dealing with international development, totally ignore ‘how’ and ‘why’ questions and start with ‘what’ or ‘to what extent’ questions. The ‘what’ questions seek to identify the specific conditions associated with a successful (or not) intervention. Moreover, these conditions are sometimes expressed as single ‘present-absent’ variables, even when a condition, such as decentralization, is entirely too complex to be treated in this manner. Nevertheless, note that – assuming the availability of sufficient data – regressions, factor analyses, and other quantitative models can readily support the identification process. Furthermore, the models can more than capably demonstrate the potency of a targeted condition by controlling for competing conditions or showing how sets of conditions interact. Likewise, if properly addressed, the ‘to what extent’ questions beg for a numeric, not explanatory or even descriptive response.</p>
<p>When the initial evaluation questions appear to favor methods other than case studies, attempts to conduct case study evaluations in spite of these questions may lead to tough sledding for the ensuing case study. First, validity questions may arise about the sample of cases selected, the availability of counterfactual conditions, and the metrics used to assess the ‘extent’ in the phrase ‘to what “extent”.’ Most commonly, to address the ‘to what extent’ questions, a case study evaluation will have to resort to the use of Likert scales and then query respondents or analysts. Yet, such a maneuver can raise even more uncertainties about the sample and implicit biases of the respondents or analysts who were queried.</p>
<p>By addressing the less preferred form of questions, however, the greatest loss may be a case study’s inability to arrive at any generalizations. For instance, the ‘what’ questions may lead to no particular theoretical framework other than a correlative one, making analytic generalizations difficult. Depending upon the number of cases, numeric generalizations about the frequency or combination of the ‘whats’ may be tenuous from any conventional quantitative standpoint.</p>
<p>Overall, future inquiries should aim to yield a better understanding of how an evaluation’s initial questions can imply certain preferences in selecting the methods for an evaluation. An important hypothesis to be entertained is that the form of these questions dictates whether a case study (or other evaluation method) should be used in the first place (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1356389013497081">Shavelson and Towne, 2002</xref>: 99–108).</p>
<p>Extending this challenge into a slightly more controversial realm, a somewhat more complicated situation surfaces when evaluations are initially driven by the ‘realist’ framework of questions – ‘what works for whom, when, where, and why?’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1356389013497081">Woolcock, 2013</xref>: 245; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1356389013497081">Betts, 2013</xref>: 256). This common framework, appearing in many evaluations and evaluation programs (international and otherwise), leads to the impression that a short or at least manageable list of conditions can eventually be identified. Moreover, the ‘whom, when, where, and why’ portion of the framework leaves the impression that the responses will identify a set of constraining and enabling conditions related to generalizing to other situations.</p>
<p>However, the complexity of an intervention and its context may yield such a large number of conditions, not to speak of their distinctiveness or uniqueness, that they cannot be itemized in any practical way. Even if successfully itemized, the likely analytic tool may again be a correlative one, not a case study. Thus, future studies should deliberately examine the implications of using the evaluation questions deriving from a realist framework – at a minimum examining whether a useful procedure might be for a new study to speculate about the kind and length of the likely items before deciding whether to proceed with a case study or some alternative method.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1356389013497081">
<title>Revisiting the ‘complexity’ of interventions</title>
<p>A second priority topic covers the presumed complexity of an intervention and how it appears to influence the choice between case study evaluations and other evaluation methods. Many evaluations, as well as the present article, portray ‘complexity’ as an important feature justifying the use of case studies. The usual context for making this choice is a comparison to experiments, which in their classic form mainly focus on the relationship between a single cause and a single effect at a time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1356389013497081">Befani, 2013</xref>: 270; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1356389013497081">Byrne, 2013</xref>: 220). However, instead of relying on a comparison with experiments, a better justification for proceeding with a case study evaluation might require a sharper definition of what makes an intervention complex.</p>
<p>Some interventions may consist of a number of components that have complex relationships. These types of interventions and this type of complexity may nevertheless be highly amenable to methods other than case studies (e.g. an economic-based study of a housing intervention). Simply stipulating that complex interventions warrant the use of the case study method might appear to be naive if not offensive to analysts familiar with the alternative methods, which in fact can cover certain kinds of complexity quite well (again, regression models, structural equation models, and the like come readily to mind).</p>
<p>Instead, the desired future studies should explicitly define the conditions associated with the ‘complexity’ of the interventions that appear to favor case studies. Several of the six articles in this issue have begun to define these conditions, and future methodological work could usefully build on this foundation. For instance, an initially relevant characteristic of complexity can involve interventions having multiple causes and effects. Moreover, the intervention may be ‘quite distal from the outcomes and impacts of interest’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1356389013497081">Mookherji and LaFond, 2013</xref>: 285). Complexity also may mean understanding interventions in their totality, not ‘in terms of their components’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1356389013497081">Byrne, 2013</xref>: 218).</p>
<p>Finally, Woolcock suggests that interventions can vary according to their <italic>causal density</italic>: those having a high causal density might trigger a case study evaluation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1356389013497081">Woolcock, 2013</xref>: 237–39). According to Woolcock, density reflects four conditions: (1) the number of required person-to-person transactions, (2) the amount of discretion by front-line implementing agents, (3) the pressure on the agents to respond to distracting conditions, and (4) whether the agents’ solutions come from a known menu or need to innovate. In contrast, interventions with low causal densities may be physical development projects having known technological solutions, such as building roads, providing proper sanitation and electricity, building schools, and administering vaccinations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1356389013497081">Andrews et al., 2012</xref>) – and for which other evaluation methods may be entirely appropriate.</p>
<p>In summary, future studies should examine the importance of describing the actual features associated with the labeling of an intervention as ‘complex,’ rather than relying on the use of the label alone.</p>

<sec id="section14-1356389013497081">
<title>Making the awareness of case study evaluation methods a higher priority</title>
<p>A third priority topic sits at a higher plane than the first two – and may be more difficult to pursue. Although case study evaluation methods have advanced over the years, progress has been slow (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1356389013497081">Yin, 2000a</xref>). Some key topics such as triangulation and the use of rival explanations, as previously discussed in this article, still appear to be underdeveloped and await further investigation and elaboration in order to become potent routines.</p>
<p>One possible explanation for the lack of progress is that articles whose main concerns deal with case study evaluations paradoxically begin with a fairly elaborate discussion of non-case study methods, such as the experimental method. The effect of these lengthy and occasionally apologetic discussions may be to displace a systematic and more thorough canvassing of the potentially relevant case study methods. The desired canvassing would increase the awareness over justifying why some case study practices but not others are to be employed in a planned evaluation. As an example, an initial discussion on rival explanations might cite the relevant literature, show how rivals had been incorporated (or not) in previous studies, and then indicate how rivals are to be used (or not) in the design of the planned evaluation. Rival explanations were only mentioned once in the six assembled articles (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1356389013497081">Vellema et al., 2013</xref>).</p>
<p>Taking analytic generalization as a second example, the creation of some typology of analytic generalizations, along with the operational procedures for deriving each type, would represent a greater advance than has been experienced during the past couple of decades. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1356389013497081">Halkier (2011)</xref> suggests three forms of analytic generalization and offers procedures for examining them in empirical studies: (1) ideal-typologizing, (2) category zooming (depth on a single point), and (3) positioning (the reflection of multiple voices and discourse). Again, if an upcoming case study evaluation were initially to discuss the previous use of analytic generalization, even as a candidate but then rejected practice, the study still could be building important methodological lessons.</p>
<p>In summary, a more systematic canvassing should concentrate on case study methods. These could include rivals, analytic generalization, and other practices not even touched upon in the present article (e.g. case selection, the distinction between proximal and distal causes, the mixture of case study and other methods in the same evaluation, yet other ways of generalizing, or parsing contextual conditions rather than leaving them as an amorphous entity as they now are). Only in this way might newer contributions emerge, accelerating progress in strengthening future case study evaluations. Now that would be some kind of learning.</p>
