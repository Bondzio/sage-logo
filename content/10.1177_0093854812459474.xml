<abstract>
<p>Public policies related to the criminal justice system in the United States ultimately reflect the attitudes of its citizens. It is surprising, therefore, how few studies have investigated influences on attitudes about criminal justice issues and how narrow the scope of such investigations has been. In this study, we examined the effects of education on attitudes toward several criminal justice issues in college students enrolled in a senior-level forensic psychology course compared to a nonpsycholegal psychology course. Results indicated that education about public policy issues influenced students’ attitudes toward the death penalty, prison reform, and the insanity defense. In addition, we examined preexisting differences in these attitudes based on demographic and other status variables (i.e., race, gender, academic class standing) and found that these variables were associated with differences in attitudes about criminal justice issues in a much more complex way than previously considered in the extant literature.</p>

<p>At the end of 2009, more than 1.6 million people were incarcerated in federal and state prisons in the United States, representing a slight increase from the end of 2008 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0093854812459474">West, 2010</xref>). This rise is particularly evident within the federal system, in which the number of prisoners increased by almost 7,000 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0093854812459474">West, 2010</xref>). This increase occurred despite a co-occurring decrease in crime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0093854812459474">U.S. Department of Justice, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Criminal Justice Information Services Division, 2010</xref>) and many jurisdictions’ ongoing efforts to reduce prison populations and consequently cut costs associated with incarceration in the face of budget crises. Given these circumstances, the need for prison reform is evident. Because U.S. public policy is indirectly determined by its citizens (i.e., via the voting process of electing officials), the continued high rate of incarceration likely reflects the public’s propensity toward punitive criminal justice policy.</p>
<p>Because of this impact that the public’s attitudes ultimately have on criminal justice policy, it is important to know about the public’s attitudes toward criminal justice issues. One of the most popular topics of research in the area of attitudes toward criminal justice issues has been on attitudes toward sex offenders. The interest in research on sex offending may stem from the notion that people seem particularly bothered by sex offenses and may feel threatened by the presence of sex offenders in their communities. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0093854812459474">Brown (1999)</xref> found that British citizens held favorable attitudes about sex offenders receiving treatment aimed at reducing future sex offending; however, they were not supportive of having treatment located in their communities, nor were they accepting of the prospect of having sex offenders living in their communities even after completion of treatment programming. In addition, these citizens typically only were in support of treatment when offenders were also subjected to punishment.</p>
<p>Some research on attitudes about sex offenders has examined the potential role that experience and knowledge may have on these attitudes. In comparing the public’s attitudes with correctional employees’ attitudes, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0093854812459474">Kjelsberg and Loos (2008)</xref> found that college students had less favorable attitudes toward sex offenders compared to correctional employees and that older participants endorsed more favorable attitudes toward sex offenders. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0093854812459474">Sanghara and Wilson (2006)</xref> compared attitudes toward child sex offenders of sex offender treatment professionals with varying experience. The results from this study indicated that less experienced treatment professionals relied more on stereotyped beliefs and had less favorable attitudes about child sex offenders than treatment professionals with more experience. Sanghara and Wilson concluded that increasing treatment professionals’ knowledge about child sexual abuse may improve novice treatment professionals’ attitudes toward child sex offenders. Together, these studies suggest that experience with, and knowledge about, a specific offender population may contribute to more favorable attitudes about that population.</p>
<p>In addition to knowledge about sexual offending, attitudes toward sex offenders may also be affected by certain labels attributed to offenders, as demonstrated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0093854812459474">Guy and Edens (2006)</xref>. In their study, women were more likely than men to recommend civil commitment of a person who performed a sexual offense against an adult when the perpetrator was labeled a “psychopathic” offender. This gender difference was not found when the victim was a child, however, because recommendation of civil commitment was nearly universal, which suggests that being labeled as a child sexual offender is particularly influential. The description of the offense was held constant across these conditions, so that only the label of psychopathy of the offender (i.e., psychopathic versus nonpsychopathic) and age of the victim (i.e., child versus adult victim) differed.</p>
<p>Punishment against sex offenders has become progressively harsher in the U.S. criminal justice system. In fact, until the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in <italic>Kennedy v. Louisiana</italic> in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0093854812459474">2008</xref>, several states allowed the death penalty as punishment for sex offenses that did not involve murder of the victim. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0093854812459474">Mancini and Mears (2010)</xref> investigated whether this trend toward harsher punishment was preceded by public support for the execution of sex offenders. Based on data collected in 1991, they found that although support for the execution of sex offenders was stronger for perpetrators against children (i.e., about 50%, compared to about 25% for perpetrators against adults), support for the death penalty for either type of sex offender was significantly lower than support for the death penalty for murderers (i.e., about 80%). In addition, although several demographic factors were predictive of support for execution of murderers (i.e., gender, race, education, religious fundamentalism, political conservatism), education was the only demographic factor predictive of death penalty support for sex offenders (with adult or child victims). These findings suggest that sentencing policies may be discrepant from the public’s attitudes about the appropriateness of capital punishment of sex offenders in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0093854812459474">Mancini &amp; Mears, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The study of attitudes toward sexual offending has a strong foundation and will likely continue. However, attitudes toward several other specific criminal justice issues are also important but have received less attention in the literature. One such area is people’s attitudes toward the death penalty. The death penalty tends to be a hotly contested topic, and debates about this issue can be heard in a variety of settings. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0093854812459474">Lester, Maggioncalda-Aretz, and Stark (1997)</xref> sought to explore attitudes toward the death penalty amongst college and high school students. College students reported fewer criminal acts deserving of capital punishment than high school students, which indicates that age and/or education may be related to attitudes toward the death penalty. In the same study, no relationship was found between attitudes about the death penalty and personality constructs (i.e., neuroticism and extraversion) or gender. Focused solely on college students, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0093854812459474">Lambert et al. (2008)</xref> examined differences of attitudes toward the death penalty between criminal justice majors and noncriminal justice majors, their reasoning having been that criminal justice majors represent those who will be working with offenders in the near future. Compared to nonmajors, criminal justice majors identified the death penalty as being a stronger deterrent of criminal behavior and also identified the value of retribution in endorsing the death penalty. Nonmajors, on the other hand, were more likely than criminal justice majors to associate the death penalty with the brutalization effect (i.e., that capital punishment promotes more violent behavior in society).</p>
<p>As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0093854812459474">Jiang, Lambert, Wang, Saito, and Pilot (2010)</xref> pointed out, studies on death penalty attitudes tend to have focused solely on the United States and other Western cultures. In their study, though, the researchers investigated differences between attitudes toward the death penalty between college students from the United States, Japan, and China. In addition to having found that Chinese college students endorsed the highest levels of support for the death penalty (followed by Japanese students and then U.S. students), the researchers also engaged in the novel task of evaluating the students’ rationales behind their attitudes about the death penalty. They found that Chinese and Japanese students relied more heavily upon the notion that the death penalty deters criminal behavior in supporting the death penalty, whereas U.S. students were more likely to rely upon the retributive (i.e., eye-for-an-eye) value of the death penalty. Across all three groups, however, barbarity of the death penalty was the primary rational for less favorable attitudes toward the death penalty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0093854812459474">Jiang et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>These studies (i.e., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0093854812459474">Lambert et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0093854812459474">Lester et al., 1997</xref>) examined attitudes toward the death penalty as a static concept. Other researchers, however, have examined the potential impact that education about the death penalty has on attitudes toward the death penalty. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0093854812459474">Sandys (1995)</xref> conducted a study that investigated college students’ attitudes toward the death penalty over the course of a semester for students enrolled in a class that focused specifically on capital punishment. The results indicated increased opposition to the death penalty over the course of the semester. This level of opposition to the death penalty demonstrated stability over the course of 1 year following the conclusion of the class. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0093854812459474">Wright, Bohm, and Jamieson (1995)</xref> also investigated students’ attitudes toward the death penalty. They utilized pretest and posttest data from students in a class period focused on the death penalty as well as students in a class period focused on an unrelated issue (i.e., a control group). Students in the death-penalty-focused class, as compared with the control group, demonstrated a pretest to posttest increase in knowledge about and decrease in support for the death penalty, as well as stronger support for punitive alternatives to the death penalty. Over the course of more than 10 years, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0093854812459474">Bohm and Vogel (2004)</xref>, significant increase in support for the death penalty was found in people who had shown a decrease at the conclusion of a semester-long class on the death penalty. As such, it appears that education may have a significant impact on attitudes toward the death penalty, although without continued education these attitudes may regress toward their initial levels over the course of time.</p>
<p>In addition to the death penalty, another area within criminal justice that has been the target of attention, although less prevalent in the literature, has been the insanity defense. Although these two areas (i.e., death penalty and insanity defense) may seem unrelated, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0093854812459474">Bloechl, Vitacco, Neumann, and Erickson (2007)</xref> found that support for the death penalty was a strong predictor of attitudes against the insanity defense. Bloechl et al. also found that overestimates about the frequency of defendants pleading not guilty by reason of insanity were related to attitudes against the insanity defense. In a different study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0093854812459474">Updike and Shaw (1995)</xref> examined college students’ attitudes about the insanity defense, including temporary insanity, and evaluated status variables amongst the participants that were related to differences in attitudes. Their results indicated that people with strongly held religious beliefs and people who overestimate the frequency of insanity defense pleas had less favorable attitudes toward both defenses (i.e., insanity and temporary insanity). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0093854812459474">Butler (2006)</xref> also investigated factors related to attitudes about the insanity defense, although the participants in her sample consisted of venirepersons (i.e., persons called to potentially serve on a jury). Among venirepersons, attitudes about the insanity defense were found to be related to their belief in myths about the insanity defense (e.g., misunderstanding the frequency and success rates of the plea), their attitudes about how insanity is legally defined, and their attitudes about mental health disorders. These findings, collectively, suggest that attitudes about the insanity defense are influenced by a constellation of attitudes toward issues peripherally related to the insanity defense and also by the accuracy of knowledge about the defense.</p>
<p>Studies related to attitudes toward sex offenders, the death penalty, and the insanity defense compose the overwhelming majority of studies in the literature on attitudes toward criminal justice issues. There are some other studies, though, that focus on attitudes toward other criminal justice issues. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0093854812459474">Sigler and Lamb (1995)</xref>, for example, examined “court personnel’s” (i.e., defense and prosecuting attorneys, parole and probation officers, judges) and community citizens’ attitudes about alternatives to incarceration (i.e., programs in the community). Their findings demonstrated that all participants believed community-based correctional settings were more cost effective, but also more dangerous, than incarceration in jail. In addition, participants conveyed that jails promoted deterrence from crime more than community corrections and that jails served a more punitive function than community corrections. Focused solely on aspects related to incarcerated offenders, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0093854812459474">Hensley, Koscheski, and Tewksbury (2007)</xref> examined college students’ attitudes about services and programs afforded to inmates. Although the general consensus was that inmates can benefit from programs and services in the correctional institution, attitudes about the availability of the services and programs were dependent on the security level of the inmate (i.e., minimum versus maximum).</p>
<p>Throughout the literature related to attitudes about criminal justice issues, there is a trend toward emphasizing the potential importance that knowledge has on attitudes. Although some authors merely suggest that knowledge may impact attitudes, other researchers have conducted investigations specifically to determine this potential relationship. As previously mentioned, studies have been conducted on the influence of education on attitudes toward the death penalty (i.e., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0093854812459474">Sandys, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0093854812459474">Wright et al., 1995</xref>), but researchers have also examined the role that knowledge has on other criminal justice issues. For example, to study the effect of media information on attitudes about criminal justice, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0093854812459474">Elffers, de Keijser, van Koppen, and van Haeringen (2007)</xref> had two groups from the community in the Netherlands (i.e., those who read the local paper and those who did not) attend criminal court cases and report their attitudes about the criminal justice system over the course of a year. In their study, no difference was found between the two groups, suggesting that information provided by the media did not have a substantial impact on attitudes toward the criminal justice system. In contrast to this finding, however, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0093854812459474">Beale’s (2006)</xref> review of the literature related to the influence of media exposure on the public’s attitudes in the United States suggests that “the news media’s market-driven treatment of crime may influence public opinion and bolster support for punitive penal policies” (p. 402). The cause for such inconsistently found relationships between media exposure and the attitudes about criminal justice issues is unknown, but may be due to cultural variations (e.g., differential presentation of crime-related media in the Netherlands versus the United States), different research methodology, and a plethora of other unexamined factors.</p>
<p>While some of the studies on the impact of knowledge on attitudes toward criminal justice issues have focused on the general public, as did <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0093854812459474">Elffers et al. (2007)</xref>, most have focused on those who work within the criminal justice system. In one such study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0093854812459474">Young, Antonio, and Wingeard (2009)</xref> examined the attitudes of newly hired correctional staff who attended training sessions that emphasized staff members’ role in strengthening inmate treatment programs as well as the correctional system’s general philosophy of promoting treatment for inmates. Posttraining surveys demonstrated that staff believed that their interactions with inmates impacted the correctional institution environment and the outcome of rehabilitation programs for inmates. Although these findings were evident for all the staff who attended the training, these attitudes were endorsed more strongly among clerical and treatment staff than in correctional officers.</p>
<p>In another study that focused on the impact of training on attitudes about offenders and treatment with offenders, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0093854812459474">Hogue (1995)</xref> examined the change in British correctional staff’s (i.e., correctional officers, probation officers, correctional psychologists) attitudes over the course of a program that trained them to lead structured treatment programs. Upon completion of their training, staff members endorsed higher self-efficacy in their treatment provision abilities as well as more confidence in the ability of the treatment programs in producing positive change in offenders. In addition, they reported more positive attitudes about offenders than prior to receiving training. The attitudes reported immediately upon completion of training were found to be maintained at a 6-month follow-up, which suggests a long-term change in attitudes due to the training.</p>
<p>Although there are many different issues that researchers can focus on when investigating attitudes toward criminal justice issues, perhaps the most interesting and potentially important implications of research in this area relates to the impact that providing information can have on people’s attitudes toward criminal justice issues. Despite the array of studies already mentioned, this is an area in need of continued exploration. For example, several studies have focused on the effect that training has had on criminal justice professionals, but few have focused on the change that information has on attitudes of the general public. This is of critical importance, because although criminal justice professionals work directly with offenders, the general public has a less direct yet equally strong influence on legal and criminal justice policies (e.g., the death penalty, the insanity defense, funding for offender treatment programming, correctional system reformation). Those studies that have investigated how education impacts criminal justice issues have also been limited by a failure to utilize a control group to rule out other factors that may have caused attitude changes (i.e., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0093854812459474">Sandys, 1995</xref>) and/or only evaluated the influence that education has on attitudes toward a single issue, such as having focused exclusively on the death penalty (i.e., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0093854812459474">Sandys, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0093854812459474">Wright et al., 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>Because of the influence that voting citizens ultimately have on public policy, it is important to investigate the effect that a more general education about criminal justice issues has on a wider array of attitudes toward criminal justice issues among those who are likely to vote. A college sample, which was utilized in this study, appears to be well representative of the voting public, given that in the November 2008 presidential election over 65% of those who voted had attended at least some college and that over 70% of all people with some college education voted in that election (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0093854812459474">File &amp; Crissey, 2010</xref>). As such, the purpose of this study was to investigate the influence that a forensic psychology class had on attitudes about several aspects related to criminal justice (i.e., prisoners, prison reform, the death penalty, the insanity defense), compared to a class not focused on criminal justice. Students from the forensic psychology class would likely reflect more favorable attitudes toward prisoners and prison reform, less support for the death penalty, and more support of for the insanity defense compared to students in another senior-level psychology course.</p>
<p>In addition to examining the effect of education on these criminal justice issues, we aimed to investigate differences in criminal justice attitudes between major segments of the population (i.e., gender, race, academic class standing). Surprisingly little research has been conducted investigating differences in criminal justice attitudes among people from different cultural groups, and those that have generally do not address the potential interactive effects of demographic and other status variables. Therefore, our investigation into such differences in this study is meant to be primarily exploratory in nature and is intended to examine the relationship between criminal justice attitudes and status variables beyond simply main effects. For example, criminal justice attitudes in this study were examined by gender in relation to, not independent of, race and academic class standing. As these analyses were exploratory, no specific hypotheses were developed.</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>Participants consisted of 226 undergraduate students enrolled in upper-level psychology courses over two semesters. Of the 226 student participants, 86 (38.1%) were enrolled in Forensic Psychology (i.e., the “treatment” group) and 140 (61.9%) were enrolled in Drugs, Alcohol, and Behavior (i.e., the control group). The average age for the entire sample was 21.89 years (<italic>SD</italic> = 3.50) with a range of 17 to 49 years. The majority of participants were female (<italic>n</italic> = 140; 61.9%), with 64 (28.3%) males and 22 (9.7%) who did not report their gender. The majority of participants identified as White (<italic>n</italic> = 144, 63.7%); however, the sample was somewhat racially and ethnically diverse with 35 (15.5 %) who identified as Hispanic, 15 (6.6%) who identified as Black, and 10 (4.4%) who identified as some other race or ethnicity; 22 (9.7%) did not report their racial or ethnic identity. As would be expected for upper level courses in psychology, the majority of the participants indicated their academic class standing as a Senior (<italic>n</italic> = 111; 49.1%) or a Junior (<italic>n</italic> = 64; 28.3%), with some Sophomores (<italic>n</italic> = 24; 10.6%) and very few Freshman (<italic>n</italic> = 2; 0.9%); 22 (9.7%) did not indicate their academic class standing.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0093854812459474">
<title>Measures</title>
<p>A standard demographic form requested information on age, racial/ethnic identity, years of formal education completed, and other items related to education (e.g., academic class standing).</p>
<p>Multiple measures were utilized to measure attitudes toward various criminal justice issues. The Attitudes Towards Prisoners scale (ATP; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0093854812459474">Melvin, Grambling, &amp; Gardner, 1985</xref>) is a 36-item measure designed to assess the strength and valence of general attitudes toward prisoners. These attitudes are seen as important to the public perception of the criminal justice system and may play a role in innovative programs such as rehabilitation and early releases, as well as the physical location of prisons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0093854812459474">Melvin et al., 1985</xref>). Seventeen items on the ATP scale are rated on a Likert-type scale ranging from 1 (<italic>strongly disagree</italic>) to 5 (<italic>strongly agree</italic>), whereas the other 19 items are reverse scored, ranging from 1 (<italic>strongly agree</italic>) to 5 (<italic>strongly disagree</italic>). Higher scores on the scale are associated with more favorable attitudes toward prisoners. The ATP scale has adequate reliability with internal consistency coefficients ranging from 0.84 to 0.92 and test-retest reliability of 0.82 over an interval of 2 weeks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0093854812459474">Melvin et al., 1985</xref>). In the present study, the ATP demonstrated good internal consistency (Cronbach’s alpha = .91, split-half = .89).</p>
<p>The Attitudes Toward Prison Reform Scale (APRS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0093854812459474">Silvia, 2003</xref>) is a 12-item measure designed to assess the public’s attitude toward the correctional system. Seven items on the APRS are rated on a Likert-type scale ranging from 1 (<italic>strongly disagree</italic>) to 7 (<italic>strongly agree</italic>), whereas the other five items are reverse scored, ranging from 1 (<italic>strongly agree</italic>) to 7 (<italic>strongly disagree</italic>). Higher scores on the scale are associated with more favorable attitudes toward liberal or progressive prison policies. Prison reform attitudes were conceptualized as unidimensional, with individuals supporting either a more liberal and rehabilitative view toward prisons or one that is harsher and supportive of greater punitiveness. The APRS has adequate reliability with a reported internal consistency coefficient of 0.82 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0093854812459474">Silvia, 2003</xref>). In the present study, the APRS evidenced a Cronbach’s alpha coefficient of .87 and a split-half coefficient of .87.</p>
<p>The Attitudes Toward the Death Penalty Scale (ATDP; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0093854812459474">Hingula &amp; Wrightsman, 2002</xref>) is a 23-item measure designed to assess attitudes toward the use of the death penalty. Nine items on the ATDP are rated on a Likert-type scale ranging from 1 (<italic>strongly agree</italic>) to 5 (<italic>strongly disagree</italic>), whereas the other 14 items are reverse scored, ranging from 1 (<italic>strongly disagree</italic>) to 5 (<italic>strongly agree</italic>). Higher scores on the scale are associated with more support for the death penalty. No published reliability data were found for the ATDP scale, however the ATDP scale produced a Cronbach’s alpha coefficient of .88 and a split-half coefficient of .83 in the present study.</p>
<p>The Insanity Defense Attitude Scale (IDAS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0093854812459474">Skeem &amp; Evans-DeCicco, 2004</xref>) is a 32-item measure designed to aid in the prediction of jurors’ attitudes toward the insanity defense. The scoring information that accompanied the instrument only provided instructions for a subscale of the IDAS and so the scoring protocol for the present study was determined by the researchers. Only 28 items were included in the total score (Items 1 to 28), with the last items on the measure (29 to 32) pertaining to strength of attitudes rather than reflecting sentiment for or against the insanity defense. Sixteen items on the IDAS are rated on a Likert-type scale ranging from 1 (<italic>strongly agree</italic>) to 7 (<italic>strongly disagree</italic>), whereas the other 12 items are reverse scored, ranging from 1 (<italic>strongly disagree</italic>) to 7 (<italic>strongly agree</italic>). Higher scores are indicative of less favorable attitudes toward the insanity defense. No published reliability data were found for the IDAS, although the IDAS produced a Cronbach’s alpha coefficient of .81 and a split-half coefficient of .73 in the present study.</p>

<title>Procedure</title>
<p>At the beginning of each semester of data collection, students in the two classes were greeted by one of the researchers, informed of the nature and purpose of this study, and asked if they would like to volunteer their participation. Provision of incentive (e.g., extra credit in the course) for participation in this study was determined by the instructors for the courses. Those students who agreed to participate were provided greater detail regarding the study and their participation and asked to sign an informed consent form. All participants were then instructed to complete the measures in the questionnaire packet. Once a student’s questionnaire packet was completed, his or her material was coded with a randomly assigned number so the packet could be tracked without identifying information attached to the data. At the end of the semester, this process was repeated so attitudes from the beginning to the end of the semester could be compared. In order to obtain enough information, data collection was conducted over the course of two semesters.</p>

<title>Data Screening</title>
<p>Prior to conducting the primary analyses, the data were screened for entry and scoring errors by checking for values outside of the possible ranges and by reviewing approximately 10% of the entered data compared to the original responses on the measures. The minimal data entry errors that were discovered (i.e., less than .05% of the data reviewed) were corrected in the data file. The distribution of the data was also evaluated, and no data included in the analyses displayed a nonnormal distribution that required transformation.</p>

<sec id="section7-0093854812459474">
<title>Group Equivalence</title>
<p>To evaluate the equivalence of the participants from the Forensic Psychology course group and the comparison group, independent sample <italic>t</italic> tests were conducted for the continuous demographic variables (i.e., age), and chi-square analyses were conducted for the categorical demographic variables (i.e., gender, ethnicity, year in college). Of these demographic variables, year in college (i.e., freshman, sophomore, junior, senior, other) was significantly different between the two groups (χ<sup>2</sup> = 11.29, <italic>p</italic> = .023); the comparison group had more students classified in earlier years of study. For example, whereas only about 5% of the participants from the forensic class were sophomores, about 18% of the participants from the comparison group were sophomores. Likewise, about 69% of the participants from the Forensic Psychology class were seniors, compared to only about 46% of the participants from the control group. No other demographic variables were significantly different for participants in the two groups of classes.</p>

<title>Attitudes Toward Criminal Justice Issues Over Time</title>
<p>To evaluate the change in attitudes toward criminal justice issues for participants from each of the groups (i.e., Forensic Psychology and the comparison group) over the course of the semester, a doubly multivariate analysis of variance was conducted. This analysis is suitable for examining the repeated measurement of multiple outcome variables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0093854812459474">Tabachnick &amp; Fidell, 2001</xref>). In this analysis, four attitude outcome variables were evaluated (i.e., ATP, APRS, ATDP, IDAS) between the two groups (i.e., Forensic Psychology and the comparison group), and the within-subjects factor was the time of testing (i.e., at the start of the course [Time 1] and at the end of the course [Time 2]). These analyses included data only from students who participated in both the Time 1 and Time 2 data collection periods (<italic>n</italic> = 178). The multivariate test statistic indicated a significant omnibus attitude by group interaction, <italic>F</italic><sub>(4, 152)</sub> = 8.44, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, partial μ<sup>2</sup> = .18.</p>
<p>Examination of the univariate test statistics for each measure indicated significant group by time interactions for APRS scores, <italic>F</italic><sub>(4, 155)</sub> = 10.773, <italic>p =</italic> .001, partial μ<sup>2</sup> = .07; ATDP scores, <italic>F</italic><sub>(4, 155)</sub> = 21.032, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, partial μ<sup>2</sup> = .12; and IDAS scores, <italic>F</italic><sub>(4, 155)</sub> = 8.763, <italic>p</italic> = .004, partial μ<sup>2</sup> = .05. No significant interaction or main effect differences for group or time for ATP scores were found.</p>
<p>To examine the specific nature of these interactions, univariate repeated measures analyses of variance were conducted using split-file procedures (i.e., to test for differences across time for each measure separately for the two groups). For the participants from the Forensic Psychology class, significant mean differences across time were found for the APRS scores, <italic>F</italic><sub>(1, 61)</sub> = 14.328, <italic>p &lt;</italic> .001, partial μ<sup>2</sup> = .19; ATDP scores, <italic>F</italic><sub>(1, 61)</sub> = 18.351 <italic>p &lt;</italic> .001, partial μ<sup>2</sup> = .23; and IDAS scores, <italic>F</italic><sub>(1, 61)</sub> = 28.70, <italic>p &lt;</italic> .001, partial μ<sup>2</sup> = .29. Specifically, it was found that over the course of the semester, the Forensic Psychology participants’ APRS scores increased (i.e., they developed more liberal and progressive views of prison reform), their ATDP scores decreased (i.e., they became less supportive of the death penalty), and their IDAS scores decreased (i.e., they became more approving of the insanity defense). For the participants from the comparison group, significant mean differences across time were found only for IDAS scores, <italic>F</italic><sub>(1, 94)</sub> = 8.325, <italic>p</italic> = .005, partial μ<sup>2</sup> = .081. Specifically, over the course of the semester, the comparison group’s IDAS scores decreased (i.e., they became more approving of the insanity defense).

<title>Demographic Group Differences In Attitudes Toward Criminal Justice Issues</title>
<p>To examine differences between different subgroups of the entire sample (i.e., race, gender, academic class standing), only the data from the first data collection period were utilized (i.e., “pretreatment” data). As such, the data from students in both courses (i.e., Forensic and the comparison group) were combined for the following analyses and consisted of the entire group of 226 participants (i.e., not restricted to those who completed both Time 1 and Time 2 data). An examination of equivalence in attitudes for the students between the two courses, however, was first conducted by independent samples <italic>t</italic> test. The results indicated that the participants’ scores on the ATP (<italic>t</italic> = .218, <italic>p</italic> = .828), APRS (<italic>t</italic> = .342, <italic>p</italic> = .733), and ATDP (<italic>t</italic> = −.406, <italic>p</italic> = .685) did not differ by course, but that participants from the comparison group endorsed significantly higher scores on the IDAS (i.e., were more disapproving of the insanity defense; <italic>t</italic> = −2.361, <italic>p</italic> = .019) than the Forensic group.</p>
<p>The examination of potential differences in criminal justice attitudes by gender, race, and academic class standing was conducted by means of multivariate analyses of covariance (MANCOVA). Race and academic class standing were dichotomized into White versus non-White and senior versus nonsenior (i.e., freshman, junior, sophomore) because over half of the participants were White and classified as seniors, respectively. In addition, because age has been shown in the literature to be associated with differences in criminal justice attitudes (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0093854812459474">Butler, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0093854812459474">Craig, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0093854812459474">Kjelsberg &amp; Loos, 2008</xref>) and because of the difference in insanity defense attitudes between the participants from the two groups prior to receiving education (i.e., a “pretreatment” difference) that was found in the present study, both age and course were entered into the analyses as covariates.</p>
<p>In the MANCOVA, age was not found to be a significant covariate for any of the measures, whereas course was found to be a significant covariate for the IDAS only, <italic>F</italic> = 4.931 (1,191), <italic>p</italic> = .028. The MANCOVA resulted in a significant three-way interaction (i.e., gender by race by academic class standing), <italic>F</italic> = 4.684 (4,191), <italic>p</italic> = .001. An examination of results for each attitude measure indicated a significant three-way interaction (i.e., gender by race by academic class standing) for the ATDP, <italic>F</italic> = 6.56 (1,194), <italic>p</italic> = .011, and a trend toward a two-way interaction (i.e., race by academic class standing) for the APRS, <italic>F</italic> = 3.809 (1,191), <italic>p</italic> = .052. No significant interactions or main effects were found for ATP or IDAS scores.</p>
<p>Split-file procedures were used to investigate the three-way interaction for ATDP by examining potential gender by race interactions separately for seniors and nonseniors. A significant gender by race interaction was found for nonseniors, <italic>F</italic> = 4.358 (1, 93), <italic>p</italic> = .040, whereas no significant interaction or main effects were found for seniors, <italic>F</italic> = 1.939 (1,111), <italic>p</italic> = .167. To investigate the gender by race interaction found for nonseniors for the ATDP, differences by race were examined separately for males and females (for nonseniors only). The results indicated that for nonseniors, a difference in ATDP scores was found by race for males, <italic>F =</italic> 4.604 (1, 22), <italic>p</italic> = .043, but not for females, <italic>F</italic> = 0.049 (1, 63), <italic>p</italic> = .825. Specifically, in nonsenior males, non-White participants endorsed higher ATDP scores (i.e., expressed more approving attitudes toward the death penalty) than White participants. These group differences for ATDP scores are illustrated graphically in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0093854812459474">Figure 5</xref>.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of education on participants’ attitudes toward criminal justice issues. Our approach adds to the literature in this area by employing a more rigorous methodology (i.e., by using pre- and postmeasures as well as a comparison group) and by investigating a wider range of criminal justice attitudes (i.e., about prisoners, prison reform, the death penalty, and the insanity defense) than other studies. As hypothesized, results of this study indicated that as participants were educated about forensic and criminal justice issues their attitudes became more favorable toward prison reform and the insanity defense and less favorable toward the death penalty. That is, participants educated with regard to forensic and criminal justice issues became more liberal and progressive compared to a group of students not receiving this education.</p>
<p>Using the findings from the split-file procedures, the effect of education across group became more readily understandable. No significant interaction was found for the ATP, because there was no change in mean score over the course of the semester for either group. A significant interaction was found for the APRS, because participants from the Forensic Psychology class developed more liberal and progressive views toward prison reform, whereas there was no change in the comparison group. A significant interaction was found for the ATDP, because the Forensic Psychology participants became less opposed to the death penalty, whereas the comparison group showed no change. Finally, a significant difference was found for the IDAS, because although both groups became more approving of the insanity defense, there was greater change found for the Forensic Psychology group than the comparison group.</p>
<p>Consistent with notions from previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0093854812459474">Sandys, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0093854812459474">Wright et al., 1995</xref>), these data suggest that education affected attitudes toward criminal justice issues. It is noteworthy, however, that education resulted in attitudinal changes in a student body in West Texas, a traditionally conservative political climate that typically endorses “get tough on crime” legislation. Although the permanence of these participants’ attitudinal changes is unknown and possibly temporary (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0093854812459474">Bohm &amp; Vogel, 2004</xref>), it is significant that these students evidenced a more progressive mindset toward crime-related issues. It appears that education that logically challenged previously held moral and ideological values produced these attitudinal changes. Given that U.S. citizens typically vote based on their moral and ideological values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0093854812459474">Baker, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0093854812459474">Miller &amp; Shanks, 1996</xref>), it is possible that these findings support public education campaigns as a means to educate citizens about key criminal justice issues to impact criminal justice policy. As public health campaigns appear to be a primary intervention strategy for altering attitudes and behaviors for non-criminal-justice-related public crises and concerns (e.g., AIDS, smoking, organ donation, gambling, substance abuse, violence, obesity, eating disorders, mental illness awareness, homelessness, to name just a few; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0093854812459474">Noar, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0093854812459474">Snyder, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0093854812459474">Snyder et al., 2004</xref>), it appears that effectively crafted public health campaigns can alter societal attitudes toward crime legislation. Given current incarceration rates (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0093854812459474">West, 2010</xref>), including overrepresentation of minorities in the criminal justice system (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0093854812459474">Welsh, Jenkins, &amp; Harris, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0093854812459474">Western &amp; Pettit, 2002</xref>), the criminal justice system is in crisis, and efforts to alter approaches to crime (e.g., prison/sentencing reform) are needed.</p>
<p>The findings from this study are important in demonstrating that education may influence criminal justice attitudes, but they do not provide insight as to why this influence occurs. One potential explanation may be that increasing education about the criminal justice system also bolsters trust in the system. This may be an important implication, because as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0093854812459474">Jackson et al. (2011)</xref> emphasized, public support of the justice system is necessary for efficient and fair functioning. Although no system in place is perfectly fair, education about criminal justice issues may increase people’s confidence in two factors related to perceived fairness: equitable distribution of resources and punishment, and the impartial implementation of justice system procedures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0093854812459474">Bradford, Jackson, Hough, &amp; Farrall, 2008</xref>). The relationship between education and trust in the system is merely speculation at this point, though, and presents a promising area for future exploration.</p>
<p>In addition to evaluating the effect of education on criminal justice attitudes, this study also provided more detailed information about the relationship between criminal justice attitudes and the complex interaction of status variables (i.e., different combinations of race, education, gender). Because there have been surprisingly few studies examining attitudes toward crime and criminal justice policy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0093854812459474">Peffley &amp; Hurwitz, 2002</xref>), only very general findings have been previously established. It is well documented that Blacks have more unfavorable attitudes toward police and the criminal justice system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0093854812459474">Decker, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0093854812459474">Flanagan &amp; Vaughn, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0093854812459474">Weitzer &amp; Tuch, 1999</xref>), and that Whites appear to have more favorable attitudes toward punitive criminal justice policy (e.g., death penalty; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0093854812459474">Anthony, 2000</xref>). Less clear is how ethnic minorities view criminal justice policy. The results of this study suggest, contrary to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0093854812459474">Anthony (2000)</xref>, that minority participants harbor less favorable attitudes toward prison reform and attitudes more supportive of the death penalty than do White participants. Thus, although minorities are more likely to believe they are mistreated by police (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0093854812459474">Flanagan &amp; Vaughn, 1996</xref>), they are more likely to possess more punitive attitudes toward crime. It is possible, however, that with more formal education, race is less of a determining factor of attitudinal differences about criminal justice policy.</p>
<p>The current findings suggest that characterizing groups’ criminal justice attitudes by race, gender, and educational experience may be overly simplistic. The current study suggests a more complicated pattern of the interactional influence of these demographic factors. Specifically, among the collective group of nonseniors (i.e., freshman, sophomores, and juniors together), non-White male students were more supportive of the death penalty than White male students. This differential support of the death penalty was not found between White and non-White females, and no differences in death penalty attitudes were found on the basis of race or gender for students who were seniors. Furthermore, the current results show that for nonseniors, race was related to attitudes about prison reform. Specifically, nonsenior White students were more liberal and progressive in their attitudes about prison reform than nonsenior racial minority students. Prison reform attitudes were not related to gender among the nonseniors, and there was no difference in prison reform attitudes by gender or race among seniors. Overall, these findings appear to support the notion that unique experiences and beliefs across race and gender may be instrumental factors in forming attitudes about criminal justice issues for persons with less college education, but not for those with more college education.</p>
<p>The results of this study are informative for criminal justice policy makers as it is clear that with education, societal attitudes and opinions toward criminal justice policy can change. This is particularly important given the influence exerted by the media toward punitive approaches to managing crime. As new criminal justice reforms are developed, providing detailed education about policy issues may significantly increase individuals’ (i.e., voters) attitudes toward criminal justice policy and such information may be more effective if dispersed via educational outlets rather than via traditional media outlets (e.g., news reports), particularly given the media’s influence on punitive criminal justice policy decisions in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0093854812459474">Beale, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Although the results of this study provide important information regarding the effect of education on individuals’ attitudes toward criminal justice issues, the study is not without limitations. Participants were not randomly assigned to classes, so possible selection bias exists. Additionally, contamination may have occurred as students in the Alcohol and Drugs course may have been influenced by education that affected their attitudes toward criminal justice issues (e.g., attitudes toward criminal justice practices toward substance use). Generalizability is limited in this study due to the restricted sample (students from one Southwestern public university in a conservative community). Furthermore, only one form of education was examined (i.e., involvement in a college course), and so the influence of less formal and potentially more widespread means of education (e.g., media) may yield different results. Also, this study examined attitudes toward only four criminal justice issues (prisoners, prison reform, insanity defense, and death penalty). Finally, given <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0093854812459474">Bohm and Vogel’s (2004)</xref> finding regarding the tendency for change in attitudes to revert toward a pre-education stance over a long time period, the permanence of the attitudinal changes realized in this study is uncertain.</p>
<p>In spite of these limitations, the results of this study are informative for demonstrating that education may effectively alter people’s attitudes toward various criminal justice issues (i.e., attitudes toward prison reform, the death penalty and the insanity defense). The significance of these findings are in the potential implications, as the results suggest education (e.g., public education campaigns) can successfully impact attitudes toward criminal justice issues and therefore possibly contribute to shifts in criminal justice policy. Future research, however, needs to examine the permanence of these attitudinal shifts. Importantly, attitudinal shifts resulting from intervention do appear durable (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0093854812459474">Albarracín, Durantini, &amp; Earl, 2006</xref>); however, this is an important area for further research, particularly with regard to attitudes toward criminal justice issues given the likely influence of morals and life values on these attitudes. Nevertheless, it is encouraging that educating people may provide more progressive attitudes toward crime legislation, an important finding given current issues of budget crisis and prison overcrowding necessitating prison reform, for example.</p>
