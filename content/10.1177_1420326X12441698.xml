<p>Source analysis shows that motor vehicle exhausts are the major pollutant emission sources in urban atmosphere. Street canyons are areas where vehicle exhausts are most frequently discharged into and where urban residents could be subjected to exposure of likely high concentrations of these emissions. The spread of pollutants in urban street canyons would affect the neighbourhood environments and indoor air qualities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1420326X12441698">1</xref>]. The numerical simulation and in situ investigation of fine particle dispersion in an actual deep street canyon in Hong Kong has been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1420326X12441698">2</xref>]. Motor vehicle emissions in urban street canyons are thus serious threats to the health of pedestrians [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1420326X12441698">3</xref>]. The link between certain respiratory health issues, such as the increase in asthma cases and mortality, and traffic-related pollutants, such as suspended particulate matters (PMs), nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>) and ozone (O<sub>3</sub>), have been established by epidemiological and toxicological studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1420326X12441698">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1420326X12441698">5</xref>]. The exposure and risk assessments are of significance for urban residents’ health, especially for elderly and children. Thus, the awareness of diurnal variations of pollutant concentrations are urgently needed for real risk assessments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1420326X12441698">6</xref>], in which the urban air pollution monitoring and modelling are important tools. Nowadays, the numerical modelling method is usually favoured by researchers due to its convenience and speed in forecasting and assessment on dispersion of pollutants and variations.</p>
<p>Although the numerical model scales are relatively small, the modelling of atmospheric environment in urban canopy layer is complex and difficult since air flow and pollutant dispersion in street canyons are related to weather conditions, atmospheric turbulence and building layout and building ventilation. With regard to the street planning, the uneven building layout along street and the height difference between the opposite buildings in street can induce the amplifications of wind strength inside urban street canyons and the macro-scale convections of air mass inside/outside street canyons, which sufficiently improve the pollutants dispersion efficiency and reduce the street level pollutant concentrations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1420326X12441698">7</xref>].</p>
<p>The diurnal variations of pollutant concentrations within the urban canopy layer are affected by the urban background pollution concentration and emissions together [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1420326X12441698">8</xref>]. The urban background pollutant concentration variations can be attributed to the atmospheric boundary layer movements that are induced by regional climate and local meteorological process. The urban background pollutant concentrations reduce with the daytime air mass expansion in atmospheric boundary layer and increase with the nighttime air mass contraction in atmospheric boundary layer. On the other hand, effects of emission sources on the diurnal variations of pollutant concentrations within urban canopy layer are relatively complex, generally depending on the relative relationship between the pollutant emission intensity and the pollutant spread efficiency out of the canopy layer. When the pollutant spread efficiency out of the canopy layer is more than the pollutant emission intensity, the effect of vehicle emissions descends, otherwise, vehicle emissions accumulate within the urban canopy layer. It follows that the diurnal changes of different pollutant concentrations have integration effect features. Actually, on street vehicle fluxes also have obvious diurnal variation. Therefore, the relative relationship between the pollutant emission intensity and the pollutant spread efficiency out of the canopy layer actually has relatively time-dependent dynamic characteristics. Typically, motor vehicle exhausts are on the accumulation conditions within the urban canopy layer, resulting in the integral fluctuation of pollutants’ concentrations in a day, together with the pollutant dispersion by the background wind over street canyons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1420326X12441698">8</xref>].</p>
<p>Totally, the spread of pollutants within the urban canopy layer is concerned with the upper layer air flow (background wind field). Observations on pollutants’ concentration variations in urban street canyons show that when the upper layer wind is weak or the coming wind is normal to street canyon, the pollutant concentrations would be significantly increased [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1420326X12441698">9</xref>]. Under the weak background wind condition, there occurs poor air quality, resulting from low dispersion efficiency of pollutants affected by the atmospheric turbulence in street canyons. When the background wind speed is large (more than 2 m·s<sup>−1</sup>), the angle of incidence alters the flow structures inside street canyons greatly. With the background wind normal to street canyon, there exist isolated circulation vortices, which confine the dispersion of motor vehicle exhaust within the street canyon and deteriorate the air quality. In particular, variations of background wind speed and direction can induce the amplifications of wind strength inside urban street canyons and the macro-scale convections of air mass inside/outside street canyons, which effectively improve the pollutant dispersion efficiency and reduce the street level pollutants concentrations as well [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1420326X12441698">10</xref>]. Note the background wind has characteristics of the time-series changes of velocity and direction, following that real background wind has the integration effect on the pollutant dispersion.</p>
<p>Up to now, for modelling the diurnal variations of pollutant concentration in urban street canyons, the commonly used method is dividing the day time into several time periods and each of them is modelled as a scene by empirical/semi-empirical mode, with all the average wind speed, prevailing wind direction and average traffic flux for determining parameters. The series of scenario simulations is regarded as the diurnal variation of pollutant concentration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1420326X12441698">11</xref>]. However, from the point of view of numerical simulation, there is no inherited correlation between the adjacent scenes, meaning that the initial and boundary conditions of the present scene are often independent, different from those at the end of the previous scene. Then again, the series of modelled results could not reflect the time-series integration effects in pollutant concentration variations.</p>
<p>Simulation and prediction of the real fluctuation of pollutant concentrations within urban canopy layer need the time series numerical simulation under real environment conditions. Different from the scenario simulations, the time series numerical simulation studies need the time-dependent input data, such as time series of wind speed/direction, traffic flow and air temperature. The outcome of the time series numerical simulation is the time-dependent variation of the pollutant concentration, as a result of dynamic pollutants emission, background concentration, upper layer wind flow and dispersion conditions, reflecting the diurnal integral results in street canyons. Therefore, the time series numerical simulation could improve the prediction accuracy of pollutant concentration variations in urban canopy layer, beneficial to careful exposure risk assessments.</p>
<p>To realize the time series numerical simulation, the present physical models should be considered in detail, in addition with the building layouts and the effects of moving vehicles on wind field turbulence.</p>
