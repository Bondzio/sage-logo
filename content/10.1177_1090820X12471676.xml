         <title>Introduction</title>
         <p>
            <italic>The Art of Gluteal Sculpting</italic>, written by Dr Constantino Mendieta, is divided into 2 parts: Basics and Technique. In the Basics section, the author explains the relation between gluteal anatomy and the visible landmarks in the buttock contour, explaining individual variations. The Technique section is very detailed in its coverage of buttock fat sculpting, fat grafting, and the use of intramuscular and submuscular implants, along with the correction of gluteal ptosis and excess skin in normal-weight patients and in those with massive weight loss. Two DVD videos are also included: one on gluteal reshaping with fat and the other on skin removal from the medial aspect of the gluteal region to improve gluteal shape.</p>

         <title>Strengths</title>
         <p>The book benefits greatly from the author’s extensive experience and his unique perspective. For example, in a section titled “Aesthetic Unit Analysis,” the author divides the buttock area, lumbar area, and the proximal region of the posterior thighs into 11 aesthetic units. Possible deformities of each unit are discussed and a specific treatment plan, patient positioning, and access incisions are suggested. This detailed anatomical description leads to a discussion of several surgical options rarely seen in other publications. The information in this section is very useful for surgeons who are willing to develop their skills in this area. The description of the anatomical correlation with each aesthetic unit is unique, and the various proposed techniques to correct these deformities are logical and helpful.</p>
         <p>Also of benefit is the fact that different points of view are presented from various contributors. Dr De la Peña’s chapter on gluteal augmentation describes use of the subfascial plane to insert the implants, as opposed to the intramuscular approach preferred by Dr Mendieta. Several similar chapters, such as the one on the “thong lift” and Dr Aly’s coverage of surgical gluteal correction after massive weight loss, are unique, informative, and fundamental to our understanding of modern gluteal surgery.</p>
         <p>The text is very easy to read, and the figures, of which there are many, are displayed and selected well.</p>

         <title>Weaknesses</title>
         <p>Occasionally, the text could have benefitted from more attention being paid to alternative techniques. For example, in Part 1, Chapter 2 (which is related to clinical decision-making), the author presents 7 cases in which surgical treatment was based on liposuction and fat grafting of specific areas, as well as the addition of gluteal implants. Although the author describes a very wise method by which to analyze different deformities, he has a tendency to use fat grafting rather than implants. In some of the cases in this chapter and throughout the whole book, implants might have been a better choice. It is important to stress that results were excellent with fat grafting, but readers should consider that patients were exposed to a procedure with more potential risk for serious complications (as highlighted by the author himself when he reports fat embolism as one possible complication of fat grafting). To his credit, the author is very forthright in describing a large number of complications with gluteal implants and states that he has been progressively relying more on fat grafting. He mentions the few articles that detail the incidence of complications with gluteal implants. Although this is an operation known to have more complications as compared with other cosmetic procedures, they are mostly related to wound healing and infection. These complications can be dramatic but are usually not life threatening.</p>
         <p>Also, when the author describes his harvesting technique in Part 2 of the book, several details reflect his experience rather than facts based on research. This might be expected in a book where the author shares his personal techniques; however, some of the assertions would benefit from scientific support, especially in the section that addresses methods for avoiding complications. It is important to note that some but not all of the assertions are fully supported by the literature.</p>
         <p>In terms of organization, it is not always easy to follow the relationship of the images to the text, as there are no legends. (I do agree that in some cases, legends would be redundant, but they would have been of benefit in many other instances.)</p>

         <title>Summary</title>
         <p>This is a very good book with a detailed view of gluteal anatomy and landmarks described by a plastic surgeon (not by an anatomist). The author is to be commended for his huge effort to synthesize so many thoughts about the gluteal anatomic units as an aid to diagnosis for plastic surgeons and his thorough discussion of all available techniques in an up-to-date fashion.</p>
