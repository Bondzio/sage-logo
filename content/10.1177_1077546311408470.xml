<abstract>
<p>The performance of main bearings in a combustion engine affects key functions such as durability, noise and vibration. Thus, with the aim of reducing friction losses and vibrations between the crankshaft and the bearings, the work reported here evaluates different strategies for applying controllable radial oil injection to main crankshaft journal bearings. In an actively lubricated bearing, conventional hydrodynamic lubrication is combined with controllable hydrostatic lubrication, where the oil injection pressures can be modified depending on the operational conditions. In this study, the dynamic behaviour of the main bearing of a medium-size engine is theoretically analysed when the engine operates with controllable radial oil injection and four different injection control rules. The theoretical investigation is based on a single-cylinder combustion engine model. The performance of the actively lubricated bearing is compared with the performance of the conventional lubricated bearing, giving some insights into the minimum fluid film thickness, maximum fluid film pressure, friction losses and maximum vibration levels.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1077546311408470"><title>1. Introduction</title>
<p>A main concern in the development of new designs of internal combustion engines is a reduction in energy losses and an increase in efficiency. However, the energy losses produced by friction and heat still account for a significant proportion of energy use. Some studies have shown that for a light duty vehicle, the frictional losses in the engine could amount to as much as 48% of the total energy consumption (Tung and McMillan, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1077546311408470">2004</xref>). Frictional losses associated with the bearings and crankshaft alone could amount to 15% of the total energy consumption (Spearot, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1077546311408470">2000</xref>). Moreover, the performance of the bearings affects key characteristics of the engines, such as durability, noise and vibrations. Against this background, the present study aims to evaluate the feasibility of improving the performance of main engine bearings when conventional lubrication is actively modified by applying controllable radial oil injection. Active lubrication refers to those cases where hydrostatic and hydrodynamic lubrication are simultaneously combined (i.e. hybrid lubrication) and when some fraction of the hydrostatic pressure is also dynamically modified.</p>
<p>In particular, during the last 20 years, the combination of tribology, control techniques and informatics has enabled the development of active lubricated bearings, which are not only able to support the rotating shaft, but are also able to deal with multi-objective functions (e.g. increasing of the film thickness, reduction of friction, enlarging of stability margins, modification of stiffness and damping, reduction of cross-coupling effects, etc.). A recent literature review of the theoretical and experimental achievements in the development of active tribological systems is given by Santos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1077546311408470">2009</xref>). Among the industrial applications applying active lubrication, one can cite the case of industrial gas compressors, where lateral vibrations and rotor-bearing stability have been improved by using active lubricated tilting pad journal bearings (Santos et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1077546311408470">2004</xref>) and multi-recess active journal bearings with active pockets (Santos and Watanabe, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1077546311408470">2006</xref>).</p>
<p>In this work, the conventional lubrication of the bearings is modified by dynamically injecting oil through orifices disposed circumferentially along the bearing surface at specific angular positions (hole-entry-type bearings), controlling oil injection pressures as a function of the instantaneous crank angle. The performance of the main journal bearing of a single cylinder medium-size combustion engine is evaluated under hydrodynamic (passive) lubrication conditions and under controllable lubrication conditions. Four different strategies for controlling the radial oil injection pressure are applied and the results are evaluated in terms of the resulting behaviour of the oil film thickness, the viscous friction losses and the journal vibrations. By applying controllable radial oil injection to main bearings, we expect: (a) to reduce the friction losses by increasing the fluid film thickness; (b) to reduce vibrations (i.e. resulting in smaller journal orbits); and (c) to increase the effective carrying load area by modifying the pressure distribution profile, which can make it possible to use bearings of smaller dimensions with similar load-carrying capacity.</p>

<sec id="sec2-1077546311408470"><title>2. Modelling dynamically loaded journal bearings</title>
<p>In an internal combustion engine, the lubricant films surrounding the main bearings support the inertial load of the crankshaft and the combustion force transmitted from the cylinders to the crankshaft.</p>
<p>A wide spectrum of excitation frequencies is usually seen in the combustion process. The representation of the combustion force based on real measurement data leads to a function depending on the crankshaft angle, i.e. <italic>f</italic>(θ<sub><italic>c</italic></sub>). Depending on the angular velocity (<inline-formula id="ilm1-1077546311408470"><mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline" id="mml-math1-1077546311408470"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mover><mml:mrow><mml:mi>θ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mi>·</mml:mi></mml:mover></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>c</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>), the combustion force can be rewritten as a function of time, i.e. θ<sub><italic>c</italic></sub>(<italic>t</italic>) and <italic>f</italic>(θ<sub><italic>c</italic></sub>(<italic>t</italic>)) or simply <italic>f</italic>(<italic>t</italic>). The spectrum of the dynamic force generated during the combustion process is relatively wide, containing a fundamental frequency depending on the number of explosions per cycles. If the mentioned dynamic force <italic>f</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) is transformed to the frequency domain <italic>F</italic>(ω) such a claim can be easily seen. Owing to the high level of damping in the journal, any journal transient vibration is suppressed after some operational cycles and the steady-state response is plotted, showing a clear period journal motion.</p>
<p>Engine bearings are commonly designed to operate in the hydrodynamic regime of lubrication even under the most extreme conditions of load and speed encountered in an operating engine. The analysis of journal bearings can be rather complicated since their tribological behaviour can be influenced by factors such as lubricant supply, thermal effects, dynamic loading and elasticity of the bounding solids. Therefore, different methods for the analysis of dynamically loaded journal bearings have been established. Among them, the mobility technique is the most common used due to its robustness and simplicity at the same time (Booker, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1077546311408470">1965</xref>). However it is important to recall that several assumptions are implicit when this technique is used, such as short-bearing consideration, rigid surfaces and a hydrodynamic and isothermal lubrication regime, among others (Priest and Taylor, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1077546311408470">2000</xref>). In cases where the tribological behaviour of bearings is significantly affected by elastic and/or thermal effects, either an elasto-hydrodynamic (<italic>EHL</italic>) or thermo-elasto-hydrodynamic lubrication analysis (<italic>TEHL</italic>), should be used (Taylor, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1077546311408470">1998</xref>; Moreau et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1077546311408470">2002</xref>), however, they introduce modelling complexity, demand significant computational resources and require high-level expertise for the correct interpretation of the results.</p>
<p>In the analysis of engine bearings, <italic>EHL</italic> is more commonly used for connecting rod bearings than for main bearings, since the oil film pressures in the conrod bearings are usually much higher (e.g. 300–400 MPa in bearings of diesel engines), and therefore the elastic deformations may have a more significant influence on the bearing performance. Despite the fact that an important number of studies have included <italic>EHL</italic> and <italic>TEHL</italic> in the analysis of engine bearings during the last few decades, these methods of analysis are not yet considered as standard tools in routine bearing design applications, considering the significant increase in the computational effort compared with a rigid and isothermal bearing solution, which can be accurate enough as a benchmark and at the same time computationally more efficient (Fridman et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1077546311408470">2004</xref>).</p>
<p>However, <italic>EHL</italic> and <italic>TEHL</italic> are increasingly being used, and are rapidly on the way to becoming common use in bearing design (MAN B&amp;W Diesel A/S, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1077546311408470">2002</xref>; Makino and Koga, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1077546311408470">2002</xref>; Bukovnik et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1077546311408470">2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1077546311408470">2007</xref>). Representative literature reviews of the most significant studies related to the approaches developed during the last few decades for the analysis of engine bearings are given by Martin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1077546311408470">1983</xref>), Paranjpe and Goenka (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1077546311408470">1990</xref>), Xu (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1077546311408470">1999</xref>), and Goodwin et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1077546311408470">2003</xref>).</p>
<p>In the analysis of an actively lubricated engine bearing the inclusion of an <italic>EHL</italic> or <italic>TEHL</italic> analysis can make the problem computationally prohibitive, once the combination of fluid dynamics, multibody dynamics and control techniques leads to a very time-consuming analysis. In this work more importance is given to the evaluation of the performance of engine bearings operating under different conditions of radial oil injection than to the study of elastic deformations or thermal effects. Therefore, <italic>EHL</italic> or <italic>TEHL</italic> analysis has not been used for simplicity, and instead a rigid finite-bearing approach assuming a hydrodynamic regime of lubrication has been adopted. Nevertheless, the effect of temperature could be included by solving the energy equation in combination with the modified Reynolds equation, as presented by Santos and Nicoletti (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1077546311408470">1999</xref>), where it was shown that an increase in the temperature of the oil film will lead to a reduction of lubricant viscosity and consequently a reduction of oil film thickness.</p>
<p>The equations describing the dynamics of the reciprocating mechanism are coupled to the fluid film forces, which are obtained from the Reynolds equation for dynamically loaded journal bearings (Hamrock, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1077546311408470">1991</xref>). The multibody dynamic model of a single-cylinder combustion engine used in this work was obtained by using the Newton–Euler method, and it is fully described by Estupinan and Santos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1077546311408470">2008</xref>). The model comprises the dynamics of the main components of the reciprocating mechanism (i.e. piston, connecting rod and crank) and joint constraints, subjected to the combustion gas forces. The dynamics of the fluid films are coupled to the multibody dynamic model by incorporating the instantaneous fluid film forces of the main journal bearing into the model, which are calculated based on hydrodynamic fluid film theory. The global system of equations exhibits very nonlinear behaviour due to the constraints, the cylinder combustion forces and the fluid film contact forces, and must therefore be solved numerically.</p>
<p>The bearing considered in this study is a hole-entry-type bearing with holes disposed circumferentially along two rows, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1077546311408470">Figure 1</xref>. Active lubrication is achieved by radially injecting oil at pressures that are controlled in the function of the crank angle. In order to advantageously modify the hydrodynamic fluid films, suitable positions of the injection orifices along the bearing surface and appropriate control rules for the oil injection pressures have to be derived. Thus, the curves of the loads acting on the bearings, the curves of the combustion forces inside the cylinders, and the plots that represent the performance of the bearings under conventional hydrodynamic lubrication are important sources of information when attempting to optimize the oil injection.

<sec id="sec3-1077546311408470"><title>2.1. Pressure distribution and fluid film forces</title>
<p>The fluid film pressure for dynamically loaded journal bearings operating with conventional hydrodynamic lubrication is governed by the general formulation of the Reynolds equation (Hamrock, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1077546311408470">1991</xref>). In dynamically loaded bearings, the eccentricity and attitude angle vary throughout the loading cycle, so the oil pressure distribution and likewise the load-carrying capacity of the bearing both change dynamically. When active (controllable) lubrication is applied, the Reynolds equation changes into a new modified Reynolds equation that includes the terms physically related to the injection pressures (<italic>P</italic><sub>inj<sub><italic>i</italic></sub></sub>) and the geometric configuration of the hybrid bearing (Γ<sub><italic>i</italic></sub>(φ, <italic>z</italic>)). Taken from Santos and Russo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1077546311408470">1998</xref>), the governing equation for the pressure distribution of a dynamically loaded and actively lubricated journal bearing, assuming an isoviscous, Newtonian, incompressible fluid operating in laminar regime, is given by
<disp-formula id="disp-formula1-1077546311408470"><label>(1)</label><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1077546311408470-eq1.tif"/></disp-formula>
It is worth noting that when the radial oil injection is not operating (Γ<sub><italic>i</italic></sub>(φ, <italic>z</italic>) = 0) and <italic>P</italic><sub>inj</sub> = 0), Equation (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula1-1077546311408470">1</xref>) reduces to the conventional Reynolds equation for hydrodynamic lubrication. The oil pressure distribution is obtained by numerically solving the modified Reynolds equation using finite differences. The fluid film forces are calculated by integrating the pressure distribution over the bearing surface. The estimation of the viscous frictional forces (<italic>f</italic><sub>vf</sub>) acting in the opposite direction to that of the crankshaft rotation can be obtained by integrating the shear stress around the journal surface. Thus, the instantaneous power dissipation caused by the viscous frictional force and the cyclic averaged power consumption are given by

<sec id="sec4-1077546311408470"><title>3. Numerical solutions and discussion of results</title>
<p>The global mathematical model that combines the dynamics of the piston/connecting rod/crank mechanism and the dynamics of the fluid film reaction forces in the crankshaft journal bearing is obtained when the instantaneous fluid film forces (obtained from the solution of the Reynolds equation) are incorporated into the vector forces of the multibody dynamic model. Since this is a dynamic model, all of the kinematic variables in the system and the fluid film forces must be updated at each time step. In order to solve such a nonlinear system and to simultaneously compute velocities and displacements, a direct iterative method combined with the implicit Newmark method and a predictor–corrector approach was used (Garcia de Jalon and Bayo, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1077546311408470">1994</xref>). The results included in this section are for the main bearing of a medium size engine of a light duty vehicle. The main geometrical parameters of the system are given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1077546311408470">Table 1</xref> and the curves of combustion pressures inside the cylinder for three different engine speeds are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1077546311408470">Figure 2</xref>.

It is also apparent that the maximum film pressure is found at 10° after the top dead centre, during the power stroke, which coincides with the event of maximum pressure in the cylinder, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1077546311408470">Figure 2</xref>.

<sec id="sec6-1077546311408470"><title>3.2. Results: controllable lubrication</title>
<p>The behaviour of the main bearing operating with hybrid lubrication and using four different strategies for controlling the radial oil injection is analysed in this section. The control strategies are proposed based on the results obtained for the conventional hydrodynamic case, aiming to increase the minimum film thickness and consequently to reduce the vibration levels and viscous friction forces. For instance, from the plots of journal orbits and pressure distributions obtained for the conventional hydrodynamic case, it can be inferred that by injecting oil at higher pressures than the hydrodynamic pressure, through orifices radially located along the third bearing quadrant (i.e., 180° ≤ Θ ≤ 270°), the hydrodynamic fluid film may be modified advantageously: in other words, the minimum oil film thickness may be increased. On the other hand, as in typical hybrid bearing applications, along the width of the bearing the orifices should be located near the edges of the bearing, in order to be able to inject oil at lower injection pressures than the maximum hydrodynamic film pressures (which are found at the middle plane of the bearing). Taking these criteria into consideration hybrid bearings with four different geometric configurations are evaluated in this work. For all the cases, the bearing is a hole-entry-type bearing with oil injected through radial orifices located at the angles: Θ<sub><italic>o</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub></sub> and axially positioned at the distance <italic>a</italic><sub><italic>b</italic></sub> from the edges of the bearing, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1077546311408470">Figure 1</xref>. An axial land width ratio: <italic>a</italic><sub><italic>b</italic></sub>/<italic>l</italic><sub><italic>b</italic></sub> = 0.2 was used, in order to avoid the high hydrodynamic film pressures at the middle plane of the bearing. The details of each hybrid bearing configuration are given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1077546311408470">Table 2</xref>. The results are obtained when the global mathematical model is solved for each one of the bearing configurations and following the injection rules given for each one of the cases.

<p>The predicted journal centre orbits for all of the cases and for two different operational speeds are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1077546311408470">Figure 6</xref>. It can be seen that the predicted orbits for all cases with controllable lubrication are smaller compared with the orbits obtained for the bearing operating with conventional lubrication (shown in light grey colour in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1077546311408470">Figure 6</xref>). These results show that controllable radial injection helps to reduce vibration displacements of the crankshaft as well as the possibility of solid contact between the journal surface and the bearing surface during each crank cycle. It can also be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1077546311408470">Figure 6</xref> that the orbits of cases (b) and (e) present the best advantage compared with the other cases.

<p>The minimum film thicknesses and maximum film pressures for cases (a), (b) and (e) are plotted as a function of the crank angle during two power strokes in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1077546311408470">Figure 7</xref>. It can be seen in this figure that the predicted minimum film thicknesses for cases (b) and (e) are significantly thicker than those of case (a). It can also be seen that the maximum values of the film pressures for cases (b) and (e) are smaller than those of case (a). It should be noted that in cases (b) and (e) the maximum film pressures are determined by the maximum oil injection pressures that occur in each cycle, as seen for case (e) in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1077546311408470">Figure 8</xref>, where the film pressure distributions are plotted at three different crank angles. By having a thicker fluid film thickness, lower viscous friction losses are expected, together with a reduced possibility of solid contact between solid surfaces. By achieving a reduction in the maximum oil film pressures while keeping the same bearing load-carrying capacity, lower mechanical stresses over the bearing surface may be assumed.

<p>The performance of the bearing for all of the analysed cases in terms of the lowest film thicknesses, maximum fluid film pressures, journal vibrations and cyclic averaged power consumption due to the viscous frictional forces, is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1077546311408470">Figure 9</xref>. It can be seen from this figure that the bearing of case (e) exhibits the best bearing performance compared with the other cases. Although the bearing performance of cases (b), (c) and (d) is not as good as case (e), they also present advantages in terms of increasing the minimum film thickness <italic>h</italic><sub>min</sub> and reducing the cyclic power consumption <italic>W</italic><sub>avg</sub>. In this case, the cyclic power consumption considers the power dissipation due only to the viscous friction forces <italic>f</italic><sub>vf</sub> in the journal bearing, as presented in Equations (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula2-1077546311408470">2</xref>) and (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula3-1077546311408470">3</xref>).

<p>In summary, it can be seen from the previous results that by applying controllable radial oil injection to main journal bearings: (i) the fluid film thickness can be significantly increased (by up to 90% in case (e), as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1077546311408470">Figure 7</xref>(a)); (ii) the maximum fluid film pressure is given by the oil injection pressures rather than by the hydrodynamic fluid film pressure, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1077546311408470">Figure 7</xref>(b); (iii) the global vibration levels can be reduced, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1077546311408470">Figure 9</xref>; and (iv) the power consumption due to the viscous frictional forces can be reduced, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1077546311408470">Figure 9</xref>.</p>

<sec id="sec7-1077546311408470"><title>4. Conclusions and further remarks</title>
<p>It has been shown in this paper that the lubrication performance of main engine bearings can be enhanced by combining conventional hydrodynamic lubrication with controllable radial oil injection. In this way, the fluid film thickness can be significantly increased and at the same time the friction losses and vibrations can be reduced. It has been shown that adequate strategies for controlling radial oil injection may be defined based on the predicted results for the bearing operating under conventional lubrication conditions. The lubrication performance of a main engine bearing operating under four different schemes of radial oil injection has been analysed, where the oil injection pressures are given as a function of the crank angle. Although in this study a dynamic but periodic load condition acting on the bearing was taken into account, further studies should be carried out in order to define suitable correction factors that account for changes in the engine operational conditions from one cycle to another. The focus of this study was on the main bearing of a single-cylinder combustion engine, however, the results presented in this paper can be extended to main bearings of multiple cylinder combustion engines and other reciprocating machines such as reciprocating compressors.</p>
