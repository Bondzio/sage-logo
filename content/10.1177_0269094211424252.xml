<abstract>
<p>High growth firms play a disproportionate role in contributing to the economic vitality of regional economies. These are precisely the types of businesses that policy makers need to support in order to generate economic growth. Despite this, the article argues that current regional industrial and enterprise promotion policies in the UK are poorly equipped to help firms grow rapidly. This argument is developed by means of a critical examination of innovation support policies in Scotland. Indeed, many governments use such policies as a surrogate form of high growth firm policy. The article discusses the underlying principles and types of support which are needed to help foster and support rapidly growing firms. It argues that effective policy needs to be targeted, selective and customized to the specialist needs of high growth firms. The implementation of these types of policies is best delivered at a sub-national or regional level.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0269094211424252"><title>Introduction: Rethinking industrial policy for a new era</title>
<p>Until the late 1970s industrial policy was seen as a key means for boosting the UK economy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269094211424252">Beath, 2002</xref>). The implicit belief was that governments could help to improve the functioning of the economy through strategic industrial intervention. However, during the last 30 years there has been a gradual shift away from this proactive policy stance in the UK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269094211424252">Bailey and Cowling, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0269094211424252">Cowling and Sugden, 1993</xref>), with successive UK Governments since the early 1980s becoming less overtly interventionist and more focused on intervening to overcome so-called ‘market failures’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0269094211424252">1</xref></sup> This re-calibration of policy has been evident across much of the developed and developing world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269094211424252">Chang, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0269094211424252">Rodrik, 2004</xref>). Neo-liberal, market-friendly forms of industrial policy are now strongly embedded within the public policy making community. The concepts of ‘picking winners’ and ‘selectivity’ are now largely discredited notions, especially in supranational organizations such as the OECD and World Bank (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0269094211424252">Lee and McBride, 2007</xref>). Allied to this, proactive regional policies have become heavily diluted in recent years in the UK and subjected to greater centralized control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0269094211424252">Pike and Tomaney, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite these policy trends, and somewhat paradoxically, during the last 30 years there have been a significant number of business support and enterprise promotion policies which have been developed and delivered by sub-national bodies such as Regional Development Agencies (RDAs), both in the UK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0269094211424252">Huggins and Williams, 2009</xref>) and further afield (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269094211424252">Audretsch et al., 2007</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0269094211424252">2</xref></sup> During the 1980s and 1990s, the focal point of much of this support was geared towards promoting entrepreneurship and new business start-ups. For example, during the early 1990s, a major piece of research identified that Scotland’s level of business start-ups was much lower than other parts of the UK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269094211424252">Brown and Mason, forthcoming</xref>). This led to the development of the Business Birth Rate Strategy to help promote new start-ups in Scotland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0269094211424252">Scottish Enterprise, 1993</xref>). However, a number of observers have been very critical of this kind of blanket support for start-ups due to their high failure rates, displacement and associated deadweight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0269094211424252">Freel, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0269094211424252">Shane, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0269094211424252">Storey, 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0269094211424252">1994</xref>).</p>
<p>More recently, the focus of these enterprise policies has significantly altered and is now much more targeted towards particular types of businesses. A key focus for many of these enterprise policies during the last 10 years has been the desire to produce more high growth firms (HGFs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269094211424252">BERR, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0269094211424252">Patton et al., 2003</xref>). Despite comprising only 6 percent of UK firms, a recent study discovered that HGFs account for nearly half of all new private sector employment growth in firms employing more than 10 employees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269094211424252">Anyadike-Danes et al., 2009</xref>). Other research has demonstrated that HGFs have above average levels of productivity, are highly innovative and feature strong levels of business internationalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0269094211424252">Mason et al., 2009</xref>). Similarly, research in the US found that these firms are relatively old, rare and contribute to the majority of overall economic growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269094211424252">Acs et al., 2008</xref>). For these reasons, encouraging such firms is now a key policy objective in several OECD economies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0269094211424252">OECD, 2010</xref>). Indeed, given the urgent desire to generate new private sector employment in the UK, the current Coalition Government has placed the promotion of high growth enterprises as a key element of their new economic growth strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0269094211424252">Groom and Jack, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>The main contention advanced in this article is that current industrial and enterprise apparatus is poorly equipped to promote rapidly growing enterprises. Much of the current industrial policy thinking is predicated on addressing ‘market failures’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0269094211424252">Cowling and Sugden, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0269094211424252">Hutton and Schneider, 2008</xref>). A focus on market failure arguments has generally resulted in light-touch business support programmes with weak levels of targeting and selectivity. In the main, this has led to generic policies aimed at improving the overall business environment. The vast array of cluster policies introduced across over the last 20 years is indicative of this rather indiscriminate, broad-brush approach towards industrial policy making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0269094211424252">Martin and Sunley, 2003</xref>). In this policy environment much industrial support is concentrated on programmes to support new start-ups, the promotion of innovation, networking, business clusters, the commercialization of university research and infrastructure provision. These broad-brush policy approaches by and large fail to properly understand the complexities and dynamics of firm growth and, in consequence, have been largely unsuccessful at generating HGFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0269094211424252">Mason and Brown, 2011a</xref>).</p>
<p>The key proposition articulated in this article is that policy makers should proactively attempt to cultivate high growth enterprises. While this could be criticized as a return to ‘picking winners’ by some, there is a strong rationale for this policy focus. One of the main arguments against the concept of picking winners is that governments have imperfect information and are therefore unable to make effective decisions regarding which firms to support. However, as others have strongly argued, private sector firms also face problems of imperfect information and informational asymmetries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0269094211424252">Rodrik, 2004</xref>). According to one policy observer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269094211424252">Chang, 2010</xref>), private sector firms try to pick winners all the time by speculating on uncertain technologies and entering new untested markets. Chang (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269094211424252">2010</xref>: 135) claims that there is a legitimate role for public policy to help pick winners and that the challenge for governments is to improve their ‘batting average’. Our argument is that one way of maximizing the effectiveness of industrial policy, and hence ‘raising the batting average’, is to focus on firms with the greatest growth potential. Given the finite nature of policy resources, it seems logical to concentrate industrial policy towards firms with the largest positive externalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0269094211424252">Morrison et al., 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>The article draws for its support on a major recent research project examining high growth enterprises in Scotland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0269094211424252">Mason and Brown, 2010</xref>) and unpublished evaluation evidence obtained from Scottish Enterprise, the main RDA in Scotland. The article is structured as follows. First, we begin by briefly highlighting the importanceof HGFs for regional economic development. Second, we provide a critique of current enterprise promotion policies in the UK. This is done by assessing the nature and effectiveness of innovation support policies in Scotland. In the penultimate section we discuss some of the new approaches which will be needed to help nurture and support HGFs. We finish with some brief conclusions and policy implications.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-0269094211424252"><title>High growth firms and regional economic development</title>
<p>There is now considerable empirical evidence supporting the proposition that only a small proportion of firms create the majority of jobs in any cohort of businesses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269094211424252">Acs et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0269094211424252">Shane, 2009</xref>), and a growing volume of scholarly evidence points to thefact that HGFs are key actors which drive economic growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0269094211424252">Henrekson and Johansson, 2010</xref>). These are extremely dynamic firms which undergo periods of rapid, transformative growth, radically changing the scale of their operations. By undergoing one or more periods of rapid growth, some firms are able to undertake a ‘quantum leap’ towards becoming fully rounded ‘companies of scale’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269094211424252">Brown and Mason, 2010</xref>). These rapidly growing firms often act as vital ‘growth nodes’ in shaping the overall growth trajectory of different industries through a variety of positive spillover effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269094211424252">Brown, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>As a consequence, in recent years, RDAs have introduced a number of programmes to help foster HGFs (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0269094211424252">Patton et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0269094211424252">Scottish Enterprise, 2011</xref>). Part of this undoubted appeal stems from the potentially large economic impact regions can derive from these firms. A recent major study of HGFs in Scotland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0269094211424252">Mason and Brown, 2010</xref>) estimated that in April 2009 there were 825 HGFs in Scotland, a figure constituting a mere 4.1 percent of the business stock of firms employing more than 10 employees.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0269094211424252">3</xref></sup> While small in number it was found that cumulatively these firms employed approximately half a million employees—but because of the extensive internationalization of many of these firms, not all this employment is actually in Scotland. Nevertheless, these firms generate highly substantial levels of employment and gross value added in the Scottish economy both directly and through their supply chains. They play a vital role in the regional economy owing to their highlevels of innovative behaviour, strong export-intensity, high quality headquarters employment, supplier linkages and as generators of new spin-off companies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0269094211424252">Mason et al., 2009</xref>). However, it is important to note that periods of rapid growth are highly episodic in nature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0269094211424252">Garnsey et al., 2006</xref>). Therefore, high growth is not a ‘characteristic’ of a sub-set of firms but rather a ‘state’ that some firms experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0269094211424252">OECD, 2010</xref>: 9). As a consequence, the population of these firms is constantly fluctuating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0269094211424252">Mason and Brown, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>What has enabled these firms to achieve high growth? Research on HGFs reveals that they have a number of distinctive characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0269094211424252">Mason and Brown, 2010</xref>) (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0269094211424252">Table 1</xref> for a summary). Most are relatively old and many have their origins in existing businesses that have undergone a major business transformation such as a management buy-out (MBO) or management buy-in (MBI). They are found in almost all sectors of the economy, most are involved in business-to-business markets and many have business models which entail recurring revenue streams (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0269094211424252">Mason and Brown, 2011b</xref>). Another key feature of HGFs is that they have very close relationships with their customers or end-users. Most have significant international sales and a physical presence in overseas markets.

<p>Taken together, these characteristics clearly make HGFs highly desirable from a regional development perspective. If developing more of these firms is now a central policy objective, a key issue for policy makers is how to design suitable support mechanisms which can best select and assist them. To avoid problems associated with ‘picking winners’ such as informational asymmetries, rent-seeking and regulatory capture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0269094211424252">Lerner, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0269094211424252">Rodrik, 2004</xref>) policy makers must become intimately knowledgeable about potential HGFs in order to apply the necessary selectivity and discrimination when choosing which firms to assist. In the following section we examine current regional industrial policies designed to supportinnovation—which governments have usedas a surrogate high growth firms policy—and then go on to outline potential new methods of supporting HGFs.</p>
<sec id="sec3-0269094211424252"><title>A critique of current regional industrial and enterprise policies</title>
<p>We critically examine innovation support policies in Scotland in order to demonstrate some of the limitations of current industrial and enterprise support policy in the UK. Innovation policies have become central within regional economic strategies during the last 20 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269094211424252">Bachtler and Brown, 2004</xref>) and in most advanced economies are viewed as a primary mechanism for producing HGFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0269094211424252">Mason and Brown, 2011a</xref>). Although the empirical examples are drawn from Scotland, many have very close similarities to the types of policies adopted elsewhere in the UK and indeed in many parts of the OECD (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269094211424252">Autio et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0269094211424252">OECD, 2010</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-0269094211424252"><title>Innovation support policies in Scotland</title>
<p>Assistance for technological development has become one of the cornerstones of UK industrial policy since the 1960s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269094211424252">Beath, 2002</xref>). Whereas the nature and types of innovation support have changed markedly since this time there is still a strong belief that improving the innovation capacity of firms can have significant economic benefits and positive spillovers for other actors in any given geographic location (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269094211424252">Audretsch and Feldman, 1996</xref>). The focus of much technology policy was originally on generating new R&amp;D projects. But, in the light of the strong emphasis now placed on the iterative nature of innovation processes, ‘absorptive capacity’ issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0269094211424252">Cohen and Levinthal, 1990</xref>) and open sources of innovation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0269094211424252">Chesbrough, 2003</xref>), far greater efforts are now being made to assist with ‘softer’ support such as developing human capital, organizational learning and inter-firm networking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0269094211424252">NESTA, 2010</xref>). An emerging area of regional innovation policy is the emphasis on theresearch commercialization process of universities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0269094211424252">Charles, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0269094211424252">Harrison and Leitch, 2010</xref>). In Scotland, for example, a sizeable amount of innovation support goes to universities (e.g. Proof of Concept programme), Higher Education Research institutes (e.g. Enterprise Fellowships) and parts of the National Health Service.</p>
<p>There has also been a strong emphasis in recent times, on designing new institutional arrangements and delivery models for supporting the innovation process in many advanced economies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269094211424252">Bachtler and Brown, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0269094211424252">Gertler, 2010</xref>). Scotland has been very active in this respect and many of its new initiatives have explicitly intended to produce more high potential new starts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269094211424252">Brown and Mason, forthcoming</xref>). For example, the largest single project launched by Scottish Enterprise during the last decade or so was the creation of the Intermediate Technology Institutes (ITIs). The rationalewas that in order to aid the development and growth of high technology companies inScotland a radical new model for people and knowledge transfer was required (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269094211424252">Brown et al., 2008</xref>). This highly ambitious initiative was launched in 2003 as a 10-year programme to promote the creation of new high growth ventures. With an initial allocated funding of £45 m per annum, the ITI programme was designed to promote the development of ‘platform’ technologies in three broad areas of the economy: digital media, energy and life sciences. A separate institution was created for each technology and all three ITIs were made arms-length from Scottish Enterprise so that they could operate in a highly responsive and commercial manner. Each ITI was designed to undertake three core functions, including:
<list id="list1-0269094211424252" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>fore-sighting new areas of unexploited research with sizeable market potential;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>commissioning research programmes to develop new platform technologies;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>commercializing the technology through new venture creation or intellectual property (IP) licensing to existing firms.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>According to Scottish Enterprise, the primary aim of the ITIs was to bridge the gap between publicly-funded, early-stage R&amp;D and privately backed commercial development to the benefit of the Scottish economy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269094211424252">Brown et al., 2008</xref>). A number of observations can be made regarding its effectiveness. On one hand, the ITI programme has undoubtedly been a highly effective mechanism for producing new technology in the shape of new or ‘virgin’ IP. The interim evaluation of the programme discovered that the ITIs had implemented 25 research programmes which in turn had produced 129 patents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269094211424252">Brown et al., 2008</xref>). This is a significant impact in terms of research output and comprises over 10 percent of the total of all patents filed in Scotland in any given year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0269094211424252">Scottish Government, 2008</xref>). On the other hand, however, while effective at generating new IP, the ITIs have been much less successful at the commercialization of this research. Despite being the main remit of the programme at its outset, it had only generated two new start-ups by 2008. Moreover, during this time they had only managed to conclude 10 deals for licensing the technology to existing Scottish companies. Indeed, one of the key criticisms of the programme was that it had been far too technology driven and that insufficient attention had been placed on the ‘company building’ aspects of the programme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269094211424252">Brown et al., 2008</xref>). Perceived weaknesses surrounding the organization’s complex structure along with its lack of success in technology commercialization led to the ITI programme being brought in-house and its funding significantly reduced.</p>
<p>Innovation policies, such as the ITI programme, have a number of critical drawbacks which undermine their efficiency and ultimately limit their usefulness for supporting rapidly growing firms. First, despite recent changes in target groups and institutional delivery models, the majority of UK innovation support policies continue to take the form of standardized, grant-based mechanisms which support ‘intramural’ R&amp;D within firms. In Scotland, for example, this takes the form of grants for specific innovation projects within firms (e.g. SMART, R&amp;D Support). Much of this support is heavily predicated on a linear model of innovation development. In fact, the ITI model exemplifies the belief that innovation begins by assessing how markets are changing, undertaking research and then producing new products based on the IP generated. This is very much a ‘technology-push’ model rather than a market-driven model and ignores the growing body of evidence suggesting that more ‘open’ sources of innovation such as end-user linkages and customer engagement are critical to the development of successful product innovation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0269094211424252">Mason and Brown, 2011a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0269094211424252">NESTA, 2010</xref>). Indeed, most of the spending that promotes innovation does not take place in science laboratories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0269094211424252">Kay, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0269094211424252">NESTA, 2010</xref>). In short, support that is based on a view of innovation that is linear is simply too crude for effectively stimulating and delivering effective firm-based innovation.</p>
<p>Second, much of this type of innovation support is awarded to early stage firms in high technology sectors. For example, around three-quarters of the innovation support provided by Scottish Enterprise goes towards three sectors: electronics, life sciences and energy. However, the bulk of the research on HGFs shows that there is no strong correlation between HGFs and these high technology sectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0269094211424252">Mason and Brown, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0269094211424252">Mason et al., 2009</xref>). This strong emphasis on high tech industries therefore seems unwarranted. Another strong beneficiary of these types of support programmes are University Spin-Outs (USOs). In fact, USOs have been given a central role in the Scottish Government’s new economic strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0269094211424252">Scottish Government, 2007</xref>). However, recent evidence both in Scotland and elsewhere suggests that USOs tend to be very small and exhibit limited employmentorturnover growth (Harrison and Leitch,2011; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0269094211424252">Targeting Innovation, 2008</xref>). Moreover, few HGFs emerge from the Higher Education sector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0269094211424252">Mason and Brown, 2010</xref>). In short, policy makers may be guilty of ‘looking in the wrong places for HGFs’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0269094211424252">Mason and Brown, 2011a</xref>).</p>
<p>A third criticism of this type of support is that that much of it is unselective and untargeted, with rejection rates for grant aid typically very low. As long as firms meet the aid scheme’s eligibility criteria, they tend to receive funding. Owing to the fact that many of the programmes are interconnected, firms can often end up on an ‘escalator of assistance’—obtaining several rounds of support over the course of their life span and technological development- irrespective of the firm’s actual growth performance. Therefore, it may enable regulatory capturein some cases as firms become wedded to the support systems on offer from the public sector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0269094211424252">Lerner, 2010</xref>). Because of thelack of targeting, many firms on these programmes may not have very ambitious growth aspirations. Many applicants to programmes like SMART tend to be firms which are strongly technology oriented but have very modest entrepreneurial ambitions. A recent evaluation of the SMART Scotland innovation programme reported that 81 percent of successful SMART applicants (many of whom are USOs) wanted to either ‘grow moderately’ or ‘stay the same size’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0269094211424252">PACEC, 2009</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0269094211424252">4</xref></sup> Only a minority of firms—just 19—actually wanted to grow rapidly. If it is the case that many early-stage, technology-based firms have very limited growth ambitions, then should policy makers be funding innovation projects which are unlikely to generate much benefit to the wider economy as a whole?</p>
<p>The central role accorded to most innovation support programmes as a tool for producing more HGFs therefore seems to be misplaced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0269094211424252">Mason and Brown, 2011a</xref>). Innovation policies may well produce some benefits to the recipient firms and give rise to knowledge spillovers in other related firms. However, the strong policy focus on innovation support has arguably had little impact on producing more HGFs within regional economies. While this evidence is taken from the Scottish context, there is nothing to suggest that this is out of line with the situation found in other peripheral UK regional economies. Moreover, although our argument has concentrated on innovation support policies, a similar critical picture would most likely emerge if we had explored the impact of other entrepreneurship or cluster-related initiatives in promoting high growth entrepreneurship.</p>

<sec id="sec5-0269094211424252"><title>New directions for industrial and enterprise support policies</title>
<p>One of the overarching principles when designing policies for high growth enterprises is the need to acknowledge their enormous diversity. In fact, one of the main conclusions from our recent study of Scottish HGFs was that these firms are extremely heterogeneous (in terms or age, size and sector) and it is important not to prejudge where these businesses emerge from, especially in terms of their sectoral origin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0269094211424252">Mason and Brown, 2010</xref>). Policy makers therefore have to alter their view that new and early-stage technology-based firms are the main sources of high growth within regional economies. There is also an argument for redirecting resources from broad-brush regional industrial policies, such as generic cluster, business support and innovation policies with their strong focus on high technology sectors such as life sciences and digital media, towards a focus on promoting HGFs across all sectors of the economy irrespective of sector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269094211424252">Centre for Cities, 2010</xref>). Finally, entrepreneurs in HGFs benefit hugely from the advice they receive from other successful entrepreneurs and this is something policy makers can facilitate, relatively inexpensively, through activities such as peer-based networking initiatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0269094211424252">Fischer and Reuber, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>In the remainder of this article we outline some practical suggestions for the types of targeting which policy makers might wish to consider when redesigning industrial and entrepreneurship policies to aid the development of HGFs.</p>
<sec id="sec6-0269094211424252"><title>Do more with fewer firms</title>
<p>One of the key messages from our research is that policy makers have to be much more selective about the types of businesses they can assist. Given that not all firms have the same level of growth aspirations, it seems sensible for resources to be targeted at firms with the greatest level of growth potential. This will require policy makers to be much more proactive about segmenting their stock of potential high growth companies and trying to support those with the greatest growth potential. As we noted earlier, most economic development agencies tend to be quite reactive towards their client group of companies. Plus, most government funded programmes tend to operate on a very reactive ‘first come, first served basis’. Instead, policymakers need to segment their business base in order to proactively target companies which fulfil certain characteristics in terms of their historical growth record, quality of management team and growth ambitions. Identifying firms with the greatest growth potential requires policy makers to achieve a deep level of understanding of the business community which, in turn, demands that policy makers become better connected with the firms they support.</p>
<p>Another key lesson for policy makers is the need to offer much more comprehensive and in-depth forms of support to companies targeted for assistance. As other research has shown, it is often more effective to offer deeper levels of support to a fewer number of firms rather than less intensive support to a larger number of firms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0269094211424252">Mole et al., 2011</xref>). Our research suggests that rapidly growing firms benefit most from bespoke and customized forms of support rather than generic business support packages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0269094211424252">Mason and Brown, 2010</xref>). A good example of this type of customized support is the assistance offered through the Companies of Scale programme operated by Scottish Enterprise. This pilot programme offers a small number of rapidly growing firms the opportunity to form a very close interactive relationship with Scottish Enterprise and other high growth businesses. In contrast to traditional types of business support involving standardized products and assistance with grant support, the companies on this programme receive in-depth and customized levels of support of a strategic nature. This can take the form of leadership development training, strategy development and assistance at identifying suitable acquisition targets. It is often this kind of strategic relationship with business support agencies which firms appreciate the most rather than more traditional ‘transactional’ forms of assistance such as grant support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0269094211424252">Mason and Brown, 2010</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-0269094211424252"><title>Do not ignore existing firms</title>
<p>Policy makers need to focus more support on existing firms within regional economies as a means of producing high growth ventures. Despite this, the thrust of many high growth support programmes is geared towards new start-ups (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0269094211424252">OECD, 2010</xref>). This emphasis ignores a strong rationale for harnessing existing firms as a source of new HGFs. First, considerations about selecting which firms to support is extremely difficult in the case of new starts because such firms do not have a sufficient experience of growth on which to be effectively judged. By focusing on existing firms which have managed to grow beyond a certain level, policy makers can at least assess a firm’s track record of growth when judging its ability to embark on a subsequent period of growth and thereby avoid the difficulties associated with supporting high potential new start-ups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0269094211424252">Freel, 1998</xref>). In short, policy makers should spend less time trying to ‘pick’ newly emerging firms but instead ‘back’ existing firms with a strong growth track record.</p>
<p>Second, one of the key findings from recent research on firm growth is the important role of existing firms as a key source of new HGFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0269094211424252">Mason and Brown, 2010</xref>). In fact, many HGFs examined in Scotland had been ‘pre-incubated’ in other existing Scottish firms.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0269094211424252">5</xref> </sup>The term ‘intrapreneurship’ has been used to describe the situation when individuals act in an entrepreneurial manner within existing corporations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269094211424252">Antoncic and Hisrich, 2001</xref>). One of its key facets is new business venturing. Yet, despite the enormous potential for corporate spin-offs from existing firms, these businesses tend to be somewhat overlooked in favour of newer or ‘greenfield’ business start-ups. However, businesses that have been part of established firms can often undergo significant growth following a change of ownership, such as MBOs, MBIs and corporate spin-outs. Ownership changes seem to be particularly powerful ‘trigger points’ which can help propel firms towards periods of rapid growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0269094211424252">Mason and Brown, 2010</xref>). Policy makers should therefore try to leverage to a much greater extent the entrepreneurial potential of the existing business base to help germinate more HGFs. Possible approaches would be to alter the eligibility criteria for commercialization programmes, which heavily support USOs, to include existing businesses so they can also be encouraged to produce more corporate spin-offs. Advisory support, and even financial support for management teams seeking to undertake management buyouts, could also be considered as a potential role for public policy in the future. Existing financial schemes which are implicitly aimed at the new and early growth stages, not least on account of their maximum investment size and requirement that the investment is in the form of new shares, should also be extended to include support for MBOs and MBIs.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-0269094211424252"><title>Support ambitious businesses which want to grow</title>
<p>A key issue for policy makers is to ensure that they support businesses which are ambitious and genuinely wish to grow. As noted earlier, a lot of businesses do not actually wish to grow to any great extent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0269094211424252">Henrekson andJohannson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0269094211424252">OECD, 2010</xref>). Transforming untested start-ups into successful established businesses often requires both a significant step change in size and a radical mind shift for entrepreneurs. However, the financial and human capital resources are often not available to enable firms to ‘cross the chasm’ to serve mainstream markets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0269094211424252">Moore, 1991</xref>) or service global customers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0269094211424252">Davenport, 2009</xref>). Many entrepreneurs are also unable or unwilling to make this adaptation to enable the growth of an organization due to fear of failure or resource constraint issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269094211424252">Bhide, 2000</xref>). As a consequence, a sizeable number of early-stage businesses pursue early exit strategies rather than seeking to grow to become ‘companies of scale’ and perhaps achieve a stock market listing. Indeed, for most entrepreneurs of technology-based firms, it is not a case of if but when to sell their company (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0269094211424252">Oakey, 2003</xref>). In some cases acquisition provides companies with the managerial and financial resources and distribution channels to grow, with benefits to the local economy. In addition, the entrepreneurs are able to recycle their financial gains and expertise as serial entrepreneurs or business angels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0269094211424252">Mason and Harrison, 2006</xref>). And investors are able to recycle their capital gains into new investments. However, there are also downsides, including loss of top level head office jobs and other functions. In addition, it deprives the local management of the opportunity to gain experience of growing a global business. In the worst case scenario the local company may be run down and its intellectual assets transferred to the acquiring company. Policy makers therefore need to help anchor and embed HGFs so that their assets cannot be easily uprooted in the event that they are acquired (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269094211424252">Brown, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite this, a considerable amount of business assistance still goes to firms irrespective of their growth objectives and ambitions. Policy makers therefore need to be much more selective when choosing the types of companies they wish to support. Although a complex issue to overcome, there are various ways policy makers could try and ensure support is directed towards the most ambitious firms. According to recent research there are clear characteristicsaround opportunity perception, growth ambition, attitudes to innovation and use ofbusiness networks which differentiate ‘growers’ from ‘non-growers’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0269094211424252">Hansen and Hamilton, 2011</xref>). This requires policy makers to develop tools and methods for teasing out these positive growth characteristics of firms. In addition, economic development bodies could also make existing aid mechanisms contingent on growth. For example, grant award payments could be made dependent on growth milestones which a company must attain in order to receive subsequent funding instalments. Amore punitive or ‘stick-based’ approach would be to insert claw-back provisions within grant support which could be activated in the event that supported businesses are acquired within a short period after receiving support. In other words, policy makers must be much more selective concerning which types of businesses they can help to grow and focus on those that actually wish to grow and become larger scale enterprises.</p>
<p>There is also a compelling argument for supporting firms which are strongly customer oriented. Recent research on HGFs reveals that many HGFs are highly customer focused and gain a lot of their competitive advantage (such as new product development etc.) from being deeply involved with their customers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269094211424252">BIS, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0269094211424252">Mason and Brown, 2010</xref>). In this respect, changes could be made to existing grant mechanisms to ensure that recipient firms have properly considered their overall marketing strategy and taken into account the specificities ofparticular customers and end-users. Additional ways in which innovation policies could be adapted include making innovation programmes more customer-driven. For example, new innovation programmes could be implemented which fund collaborative projects between local companies and potential end-users. By doing so, it is far more likely that new product development process has strong customer input at the outset of a project which should enhance the likelihood that the product will gain greater market acceptance. Additionally, an external panel of experts with strong levels of commercial acumen could be invited to comment upon (or score) the proposed effectiveness of new innovation projects to be undertaken in companies as occurs elsewhere with other development agencies, such as Vinnova in Sweden.</p>
<p>Finally, in recent years policy makers have made considerable efforts to help develop the level of entrepreneurial finance within regional economies to help promote high potential ventures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0269094211424252">Lerner, 2010</xref>). In Scotland, for example, the availability of venture capital has grown rapidly as a result of the work of public agencies such as Scottish Enterprise to help pump prime the risk capital market. This has undoubtedly helped foster the creation of a more advanced investment community, and in turn enhanced the ability of early stage technology companies in Scotland to access finance. But by investing alongside commercially-oriented private investors in early stage companies through co-investment vehicles (which are intended to be ‘evergreen’) and therefore seeking a commercial return in the same way that the private sector does, there is a danger that development agencies may be operating in a ‘quasi-private’ role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0269094211424252">Huggins and Williams, 2009</xref>) and thereby potentially exacerbating the exit culture highlighted above. Moreover, the problems of obtaining large-scale (i.e. sums of £5–20 m) follow-on funding remains endemic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269094211424252">Birch, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0269094211424252">Scottish Enterprise, 2008</xref>). This also drives firms down the takeover route. In future, policy makers will have to give greater thought to how they can help facilitate the provision of large-scale, patient capital to enable transformative growth within rapidly growing firms.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec9-0269094211424252"><title>What kind(s) of HGFs?</title>
<p>The argument for focusing policy on HGFs is that these businesses have the greatest economic impact within the regional economy. However, one of the key findings from recent research is that HGFs have quite a divergent impact on the local economy, with marked contrasts in their local supply chains, university linkages and overall Scottish footprint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0269094211424252">Mason and Brown, 2010</xref>). In some cases the physical growth of firms has been in other regions and countries, hence their main economic contribution may be restricted to direct employment at their headquarter operations which comprises only a minority of the company’s total workforce. The strategic approach adopted by firms will also have a bearing on how much growth within a company translates into benefits for its home economy. For example, HGFs which pursue growth strategies through international outsourcing or non-domestic acquisition are unlikely to bring large direct economic benefits to a local economy.</p>
<p>Although much more needs to be known about the differential regional economic impact of different types of high growth enterprises, certain companies appear to have particular attractions from an economic development perspective. First, companies have varying impacts in terms of the level and quality of employment they generate within local economies. Second, some HGFs appear to have stronger localized supplier linkages than others. And third, spillovers such as links to universities, inter-firm knowledge transfers and levels of spin-off businesses also vary considerably between firms. Although these issues suggest targeting certain types of HGFs to maximise regional economic development, classifying different HGFs in terms of their economic impact is not an easy task. For example, making crude distinctions between manufacturing and service firms is insufficiently nuanced. Some manufacturing firms may have strong local supply chains whereas others may not undertake localized production. Conversely, some service-related firms can play a very strong role in stimulating the local manufacturing base through their role as customers.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0269094211424252">6</xref></sup> Policy makers therefore need to carefully consider the potential spillover benefits of high potential firms before engaging in resource-intensive forms of support for these businesses.</p>
<p>Finally, the international dimension of firms is important because recent research suggests that ambitious firms target more spatially extensive market opportunities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0269094211424252">Hansen and Hamilton, 2011</xref>). Analysis of Business Link in England and Wales suggested that its impact might increase if larger, more export-oriented firms were targeted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0269094211424252">Mole et al., 2008</xref>). Research also shows that export-oriented entrepreneurs are more likely to have higher growth ambitions than entrepreneurs serving purely domestic markets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0269094211424252">Verheul and Mil, 2008</xref>), suggesting that emphasis on export-orientation could apply to younger firms also. This is reinforced by the small size of most peripheral regional economies in the UK, which pushes firms to rapidly internationalize in order to maximize their growth potential, or even be ‘born global’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0269094211424252">Rialp et al., 2005</xref>). Policy makers now strongly encourage business internationalization owing to the fact that exporters are more likely to experience rapid growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269094211424252">BIS, 2010</xref>). Support for business internationalization was found to be one of the main methods of enabling firms to undergo a period of rapid growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0269094211424252">Mason and Brown, 2010</xref>). One of the most effective approaches may be to use prominent members of diasporas (both former residents of the region and affinity diaspora) in overseas business communities that local companies which are internationalizing can draw upon for advice, support contacts and networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0269094211424252">Rogerson et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec10-0269094211424252"><title>Institutional arrangements for support</title>
<p>To properly support the kind of businesses which can make a significant impact on regional economies, RDAs and other economic development actors will require far greater levels of engagement with the private sector than has traditionally been the case. They will also need to display much greater levels of ‘institutional entrepreneurship’ if they are to effectively support rapid firm growth. By this we mean offering firms customized forms of support rather than transactional approaches towards assisting firms through traditional grant instruments and standardized products such as innovation and capital expansion grants. The system of account management adopted by Scottish Enterprise is one example of a more bespoke and customized approach towards aiding company growth. Around 2000 Scottish companies are assisted by business development representatives from Scottish Enterprise under this form of ongoing business development support. These companies vary in size and scale but each has been selected as result of its growth potential. The main objective of this approach is to work closely with accountmanaged companies so that Scottish Enterprise can really understand their business and help develop a tailored action plan that will enable them to target new business opportunities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0269094211424252">Scottish Enterprise, 2011</xref>: 8). This form of close relational support also gives business support organizations the ability to help increase support when firms undergo important growth trigger points (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0269094211424252">Mason and Brown, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The kind of close engagement with companies outlined above is a vital way of enabling policy makers to better understand the specific needs of rapidly growing companies. It is also a key facet for cultivating the kind of ‘strategic collaboration’ required between the public and private sector to promote effective industrial policy making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0269094211424252">Rodrik, 2004</xref>: 3). Localized forms of business support delivery are invariably fundamental in fostering this type of tacit knowledge sharing and relational understanding between policy makers and businesses. Given that the most appropriate spatial level for this type of strategic engagement is the locality or region, it seems regrettable that the UK Coalition Government decided to abolish the English RDAs, especially given their in-depth knowledge of the regional economic landscape coupled with their close links with the local business community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269094211424252">Bentley et al., 2010</xref>). A recent evaluation of the RDAs concluded that between 2002–3 and 2006–7 they had delivered some form of business support to some 90,000 enterprises (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0269094211424252">Levy et al., 2011</xref>). As local authorities and sub-national bodies in England and Wales have little funding to effectively promote HGFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0269094211424252">Levy et al., 2011</xref>), filling this substantial gap in business support provision is going to be extremely difficult.</p>

<sec id="sec11-0269094211424252" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title>
<p>This article highlights the crucial role played by HGFs in regional economic development and has outlined how industrial and enterprise support policies can be reshaped to better foster and accelerate the growth of such enterprises. The growing recognition of the importance of HGFs in national and regional economic development has started a lively discussion amongst various ‘think tanks’ about how best to promote and assist such firms (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0269094211424252">Levy et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0269094211424252">NESTA, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0269094211424252">OECD, 2010</xref>). One view is that government’s role should be to remove regulatory obstacles to growth and minimize interference in the operation of markets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0269094211424252">NESTA, 2011</xref>). Proponents of this view often see traditional SME support systems, such as innovation support and access to finance, as the main ways of providing direct support to these firms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0269094211424252">NESTA, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0269094211424252">OECD, 2010</xref>). But as our analysis of innovation policy in Scotland revealed these ‘light touch’ industrial policy prescriptions have not been very successful at generating HGFs.</p>
<p>The current changes being made to the RDAs and Business Link in England and Wales offer the opportunity to re-calibrate support towards HGFs. In this respect, proposed initiatives such as the Business Coaching for Growth Scheme—which aims to provide specialist business advice and create hubs for networking activities—seem like positive steps in the right direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0269094211424252">Levy et al., 2011</xref>). It remains an open question if these policies will generate more HGFs however. To properly resolve the problems inherent within current industrial policy in the UK, policy makers will have to delve much deeper inside the ‘black box’ of the firm to look at the characteristics of firms with the capacity to grow rapidly. For this to happen, enterprise policy requires a major overhaul and strategic re-orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0269094211424252">Mason and Brown, 2011a</xref>). Newer forms of strategic collaboration between firms and governments are absolutely crucial and policies should be as much about eliciting information from companies and workinginpartnership with the private sector as it is about implementing grandiose or large-scale funding programmes. In order to do so we have suggested that enterprise policies should do more with fewer firms, work with established firms (not just new starts), be more selective when determining which firms to assist and focus on firms with the greatest economic development impact. To facilitate this kind of strategic collaboration, the public sector will need to exhibit substantial levels of institutional entrepreneurship especially at a regional or local level because the implementation of these policies is best delivered locally.</p>

<fn id="fn1-0269094211424252"><label>1.</label><p>It must be recognized that successive British Governments of all political persuasions have undertaken policies of ‘picking winners’ of one particular kind or another (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0269094211424252">Lee, 2010</xref>). Recent history abounds with examples where governments have intervened to help (or pick) particular companies (or winners). The example of the loan granted by the last Labour Government to Sheffield Forgemasters which was subsequently cancelled following the election of the new Coalition Government vividly illustrates the highly politicized and contested nature of industrial policy in the UK.</p></fn>
<fn id="fn2-0269094211424252"><label>2.</label><p>Within this article we use the terms ‘industrial’ and ‘enterprise’ policies interchangeably. In line with others, we will use these terms to denote restructuring policies in favour of more dynamic economic activities (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0269094211424252">Rodrik, 2004</xref>).</p></fn>
