<abstract>
<p>Heavy vehicles have sluggish pneumatic brake actuators that limit the control bandwidth of their anti-lock braking systems. In order to implement more effective braking controllers, it is proposed that high-bandwidth, binary-actuated valves are directly placed on the brake chambers. This article details investigations made into modelling and controlling heavy-vehicle pneumatic brake actuators with a view towards implementing the novel brake actuator design. One-dimensional flow theory is combined with simple thermodynamic arguments for polytropic systems to describe the charging and discharging of a brake chamber. Particular attention is paid to the simulation of perceptible vibrations caused by the piston’s motion at relatively low charging pressures, using a hysteresis model. The resulting equations are linearized and used to design a closed-loop pressure controller for the actuator. Finally, the non-linear performance limits of the valves, caused by dead-zones and time delays, are investigated using a describing function analysis.</p>

<p>Commercial vehicles are a vital part of the economy, moving seven times more freight in the UK in tonne kilometres than trains.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954406211430882">1</xref></sup> However, heavy goods vehicles (HGV) require 40 per cent more distance for braking than passenger cars on dry roads, contributing to their higher rate of involvement in fatal accidents than any other vehicles.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954406211430882">2</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954406211430882">4</xref></sup> The mandatory use of anti-lock braking systems (ABS) on articulated vehicles in North America and Europe has helped to improve heavy-vehicle braking performance somewhat. However, the bandwidth, and hence stopping performance, of current heavy-vehicle ABS is limited due to the slow pneumatic braking hardware.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954406211430882">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>Pneumatic actuation is a preferred and established technology for HGV brakes because compressed air is cleaner to produce and handle than other fluids, and can provide a large mechanical advantage.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954406211430882">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0954406211430882">7</xref></sup> Simplified schematics of braking systems, omitting various safety check-valves, are shown for a tractor in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954406211430882">Figure 1</xref>(a), and for a trailer in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954406211430882">Figure 1</xref>(b). On a tractor, compressed air is stored in a central reservoir and regulated to the brake chambers by a foot-operated treadle valve. The trailer receives air via a service line and a supply line from the tractor. The supply line charges the trailer reservoirs, whereas the service line acts as a control line to the relay emergency valve, which relays air from the trailer reservoirs to the trailer brake chambers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954406211430882">6</xref></sup> Recently, purely pneumatic connections that relay driver-demanded pressures to the brake chambers have been replaced with electronic signals through electronic control units (ECUs). The ECUs have electro-pneumatic valves that respond to signals sent by sensors on the treadle valve, creating an electronically controlled braking system (EBS).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0954406211430882">8</xref></sup>

<p>A common brake chamber is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954406211430882">Figure 1</xref>(c). Pressurized air pushes against a piston, whose cross-sectional area creates a mechanical advantage. The piston moves a push rod that is attached to a lever, providing a further mechanical advantage. The lever presses the friction material against the brake drum or disc. A flexible diaphragm separates the pressurized portion of the brake chamber from the unpressurized portion, and a return spring resets the brake when the chamber pressure is low.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0954406211430882">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>The dynamic response of an air-actuated brake depends upon the speed with which air signals can be delivered and the rate that chambers can be filled or emptied.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0954406211430882">12</xref></sup> Consequently, the compressibility of air, pipe lengths and valve response times create delays that increase the response time of pneumatic brake actuators, making them harder to control, limiting the controller bandwidth and preventing the use of high control gains.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0954406211430882">13</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0954406211430882">15</xref></sup> These delays have been previously measured to be approximately 40 ms between a pressure demand and a pressure change in the chamber using ordinary EBS solenoid valves with orifice diameters of approximately 8 mm.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0954406211430882">16</xref></sup> Consequently, HGV ABS systems cycle at frequencies of 1–2 Hz, compared to passenger car ABS, which cycle at frequencies closer to 6–8 Hz.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0954406211430882">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0954406211430882">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>A research project has been undertaken to improve heavy-vehicle emergency braking systems by revising both the pneumatic braking hardware and braking control algorithms. This article details the investigations made into modelling and controlling the pneumatic brake actuators, with a view towards implementing a novel brake actuator design. The study is an extension of the previous studies undertaken to understand pneumatic actuators and braking systems. Simulations of a HGV brake actuator are made using thermodynamic arguments and a mechanical hysteresis model. The simulations are validated against experimental results. A model-based pressure controller is then derived, and the non-linear limits on the controllability of the actuator are explored.</p>

<sec id="sec3-0954406211430882"><title>Pneumatic brake modelling</title>
<p>Studies of braking controllers for heavy vehicles have often used simplified actuator models that ranged from static relationships between the brake pressure and torque,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0954406211430882">18</xref></sup> to first-order filters with time delays,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0954406211430882">19</xref></sup> and higher-order linear systems.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0954406211430882">14</xref></sup> It has been recognized, however, that the weakest link in heavy vehicle braking simulation studies is often modelling the dynamics of the highly non-linear pneumatic system.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0954406211430882">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>A detailed and experimentally validated model of a heavy vehicle pneumatic brake system was derived by Subramanian et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0954406211430882">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0954406211430882">22</xref></sup> The mechanics of the treadle valve were comprehensively analysed; an equation was derived for isentropic, one-dimensional (1D) flow of air through the chamber nozzle; and simplified thermodynamic relations were used to model the pressure changes in the chamber, assuming adiabatic conditions. Similar, though less exhaustive approaches to modelling heavy vehicle pneumatic brakes were used by Acarman et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0954406211430882">20</xref></sup> and Kandt et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0954406211430882">23</xref></sup> Wang et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0954406211430882">24</xref></sup> created models of more complicated air-over-hydraulic brake systems, used on medium-sized trucks, by combining the modelling approaches previously described with models of the hydraulic system and the stiffness of the brake linings. All the studies listed so far used simplified mechanical models of the chamber and piston, and assumed adiabatic conditions in the chamber.</p>
<p>A more fundamental derivation of the thermodynamic relations describing the rapid charging and discharging of pneumatic pressure vessels was presented by Addy and Walker.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0954406211430882">25</xref></sup> Their derivation was later elaborated upon by Dutton and Coverdill,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0954406211430882">26</xref></sup> who focussed on the characteristics of charging and discharging. They showed that discharging tended to be adiabatic, if fast, and isothermal, if slow, and that charging tended to be best described only by isothermal models.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-0954406211430882"><title>Pneumatic brake control</title>
<p>The literature on truck brake control rarely focuses on the actuator control loop. However, Bowlin et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0954406211430882">27</xref></sup> used the models derived by Subramanian et al. as the basis for a non-linear feedback controller that attempted to regulate chamber pressures by activating the treadle valve.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0954406211430882">27</xref></sup> The controller did regulate the pressure in the chamber, but also produced overshoots and became unstable for higher gains.</p>
<p>Electropneumatic actuators have been extensively applied to robotic manipulators. Richer and Hurmuzlu<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0954406211430882">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0954406211430882">29</xref></sup> derived full-order and reduced-order sliding-mode controllers based on extensive non-linear models of the pneumatics and mechanics of the actuator, and based on neglecting the valve dynamics, respectively. A sliding mode approach was also explored for the position control of a pneumatic actuator for a robot by Nguyen et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0954406211430882">30</xref></sup> The authors switched low-cost servo-valves on and off using the signum function in the controller, but resorted to iterative tuning of the dead-zone to balance actuator activity with accuracy.</p>
<p>Lai et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0954406211430882">31</xref></sup> proposed controlling the position of a pneumatic robotic manipulator by keeping one end of the chamber at a constant pressure, and controlling the pressure on the opposite side of the piston to achieve the necessary displacements. This eliminated the non-linearities associated with large pressure variations in the chamber. Position control of an electropneumatic actuator through the regulation of the differential pressure in the chambers was also investigated by Richard and Scavarda<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0954406211430882">32</xref></sup> for a rotary-arm actuator.</p>
<p>The short list of control schemes discussed here in general do not lend themselves to high-performance, analogue implementation. In addition, none of the studies have analysed the effects and limitations of using discrete on–off control valves.</p>

<sec id="sec5-0954406211430882"><title>Modelling a novel actuator</title>
<p>It is proposed that conventional HGV braking hardware is modified by replacing the slow solenoid valves with high-speed, ‘binary-actuated’ valves,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0954406211430882">33</xref></sup> and by directly placing these valves on the brake chamber to minimize the pneumatic delays. Binary-actuated valves operate bi-stably in either the fully-open or fully-closed states, with permanent magnets holding each valve in a given state. To change the state of a valve, a short electrical pulse is sent to the coil to alter the magnetic field to prefer the opposing state, causing the valve to switch states with the help of a mechanical spring. Each valve is controlled using a transistor–transistor logic signal with pulse width modulation (PWM). An edge-detection circuit sends actuating pulses to the coil in response to the edges of the PWM signal. PWM is used because it enables on–off valves to have linear flow control characteristics.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0954406211430882">34</xref></sup> A prototype manifold has been built in association with Camcon and is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954406211430882">Figure 2</xref>. This manifold is used with a Haldex Type 16 brake chamber attached to a calliper to test the theoretical results throughout this study.

Further details about the experiments can be found in Miller et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0954406211430882">16</xref></sup> It would be expected that the flow rate through the valves would vary linearly with the mark–space ratio, and rise with an increase in upstream supply pressure. Overall, the correlation between experiment and theory is very good. The discrepancies between theory and experiment in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954406211430882">Figure 3</xref> at mark–space ratios above 80 per cent and below 20 per cent were caused by inherent electromechanical limitations of the valves at the extreme mark–space ratios that can be explained using the logic of Topcu et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0954406211430882">34</xref></sup>

<p>Assume that the total time taken to open the valve equals the total time taken to close the valve. In addition, assume that all variables reach their steady state between consecutive valve opening and closing. Then, errors in the flow rate when opening the valve combine with errors in the flow rate when closing the valve to produce an ‘ideal pulse’ between the mark–space ratio limits, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954406211430882">Figure 4</xref>.</p>
<p>Outside these mark–space ratio limits, the second actuating pulse arrives before the valve has finished changing states, interfering with it. Ideally, the valve should return to its original state, but this is dependent upon variables such as the valve spring adjustment and the coil impedance. Consequently, the motion of the valve is undefined at the extreme mark–space ratios, and dead-zones should be placed over these ratios in the controller to prevent unexpected behaviour. Mark–space ratios of 0 and 1 are perfectly valid, though, since only a single pulse is sent to the valves in these cases.</p>

<p>The volume in the chamber varies due to piston motion. In the first instance, a quasi-static relationship was used between the pressure and volume. This relationship was determined by pressurizing the chamber with de-aerated water and measuring the pressure and volume of water delivered. The results are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954406211430882">Figure 5</xref>. Three phases of piston motion can be identified during pressurization in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954406211430882">Figure 5</xref>, as described in Subramanian et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0954406211430882">22</xref></sup> Initially, the pressure rises without piston motion until it reaches a ‘threshold pressure,’ when the pressure force exceeds the preload of the return spring. Then, the pushrod stroke rapidly increases as the piston moves to take up slack in the system (the distance between the pads and the disc), until a ‘contact pressure’ is reached. In the final phase, the piston stroke slowly rises with pressure because of compliance in the system. The discharge process follows a similar curve, with some hysteresis that is probably caused by friction in the mechanism.

<sec id="sec9-0954406211430882"><title>Theory</title>
<p>It was originally thought that the simplified quasi-static relationship between pressure and volume shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954406211430882">Figure 5</xref> would be sufficient for simulations, since the pressures in the chamber would be well above the ‘contact pressure’ during advanced braking control.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0954406211430882">15</xref></sup> However, in a separate project, it was found that an undesirable physical vibration (a ‘clunk’) could be felt through a vehicle chassis when there was a low pressure request through relatively fast (10–15 ms) on–off valves with 9 mm diameter orifices, in non-emergency situations. Consequently, attention was focussed on modelling the charging of brake chambers to relatively low pressures, and validating the model with experiments using a Type 16 chamber connected to a calliper.</p>
<p>A single-degree-of-freedom mechanical model, based on the system shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0954406211430882">Figure 7</xref>, was explored to describe the motion of the piston. The equation of motion for the piston is given by

<p>Sample results from the comparison are shown for increasing actuation intervals in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0954406211430882">Figure 10</xref>. The experiments show that above 7 ms actuation, a pneumatic vibration occurs in the chamber.

<p>The frequencies of vibration of the piston in the experiments and simulations in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0954406211430882">Figure 10</xref> were quite close: 60 and 68 Hz, respectively. In addition, the simulation accurately captures the increase in damping as the actuation times rise, and in particular the secondary piston rebound at approximately 1 bar in the experiment for 40 ms actuation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0954406211430882">Figure 10</xref>(i)). However, a difference in the absolute level of damping is noticeable for the 8 and 9 ms trials.</p>
<p>Part of the differences in both damping and frequency between the simulations and experiments may have been caused by inaccuracy in the friction model. In addition, though, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0954406211430882">Figure 10</xref>(h) and (i) show that the piston moves at a slightly lower pressure in the simulations than in the experiments. This causes the oscillations in the simulation results to be seemingly out of phase with the experimental results, and also contributes to the differences in damping at low actuation times, when the piston barely begins to move. Although oscillations start at different times between simulations and experiments, the frequency of the oscillations agreed to within 15 per cent for all actuation times. Moreover, the errors in the modelled damping were far less prominent as actuation times rose above 8 ms.</p>
<p>The experimental and simulated clamp-forces of the brake calliper when charging to the contact pressure are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0954406211430882">Figure 11</xref>. The peak values of the oscillating load in the simulation are slightly larger than those measured in experiments, despite the steady-state values of load being equal. This coincides with the small differences in the amplitudes of the pressure oscillations, and is probably due to fine measurement errors made when creating the model. Nevertheless, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0954406211430882">Figure 10</xref> illustrates that large oscillations in pressure occur when attempting to charge the chamber to demand pressures below 0.5 bar (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0954406211430882">Figure 10</xref>(c) to (f)). These oscillations are the result of the chamber being charged to a pressure just less than the contact pressure, and then having a sudden impact with the brake pads as the pressure is increased. It is theorized that the vibrations have not been observed in conventional ABS actuators because the poppet valves used in EBS systems have much lower slew rates.

<p>Limit cycling was found to occur when attempting to correct for small pressure errors about a set point, because of the mechanical limitations of the valves at extreme mark–space ratios. Under these circumstances, the valves spend only a small amount of time open at the lowest mark–space ratios just above the dead-zone, resulting in the situation depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954406211430882">Figure 4</xref>. If the amount of air introduced into the chamber during the short ‘ideal pulse’ changes the pressure error such that the demand mark–space ratio for the opposite valve increases beyond its dead-zone, the opposite valve will open and a limit cycle will begin. Accordingly, the function for the non-linearity, <italic>f<sub>nl</sub></italic>, can be approximated by a relay with a dead-zone, or

The nominal parameters of the valve studied are a delay of around 10 ms, and an orifice diameter of approximately 9 mm. Although −1/<italic>N</italic>(<italic>E</italic>) can contain both real and imaginary parts, only the solutions containing just real parts, when <italic>E</italic> ≥ <italic>δ<sub>MS</sub></italic>, were found to be relevant to the analysis. It follows that solutions containing imaginary parts were omitted from the plot.

<p>The solutions of −1/<italic>N</italic>(<italic>E</italic>) of interest are plotted as a straight line on the real axis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14-0954406211430882">Figure 14</xref>. If there was no delay in the valve, <italic>G</italic>(<italic>jω</italic>) would plot as straight lines on the imaginary axis from positive and negative infinity to the origin, and the valve would not limit cycle. However, delays introduce the term <italic>e</italic><sup>−</sup><italic><sup>sτ</sup></italic> into <italic>G</italic>(<italic>jω</italic>), causing the asymptotes of the Nyquist locus to shift to the left of the imaginary axis in the plot and spiral into the origin. Given a dead-zone on the mark–space ratio of 10 per cent, or <italic>δ<sub>MS</sub></italic> = 0.1, <italic>G</italic>(<italic>jω</italic>) crosses −1/<italic>N</italic>(<italic>E</italic>) when the valve’s time delay rises above 6 ms. In addition, decreasing <italic>δ<sub>MS</sub></italic> from 0.1 shifts the start of the purely real solutions of −1/<italic>N</italic>(<italic>E</italic>) to a lower value, as indicated in equation (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula20-0954406211430882">20</xref>), creating the potential for the two loci to cross at lower valve time delays. In both cases, the limit cycle is predicted to be stable according to describing function theory, since −1/<italic>N</italic>(<italic>E</italic>) moves outside the loop enclosed by <italic>G</italic>(<italic>jω</italic>), rather than inside.</p>
<p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14-0954406211430882">Figure 14</xref>(b), −1/<italic>N</italic>(<italic>E</italic>) is plotted against <italic>G</italic>(<italic>jω</italic>) for several control gains, with the nominal valve time delay of 10 ms. Control gains effectively cause the Nyquist plot to radially expand. Accordingly, stable limit cycles are predicted for gains larger than 0.6.</p>
<p>Experimental results for charging the brake chamber to 6 bar with the valves are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15-0954406211430882">Figure 15</xref>(a) for a gain of 0.8 and a dead-zone of 10 per cent, and in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15-0954406211430882">Figure 15</xref>(b) for a gain of 1 and a dead-zone of 10 per cent. It is clear in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15-0954406211430882">Figure 15</xref> that the valve begins to limit cycle when the gain rises above 0.8. The amplitude and frequency of the limit cycle were approximately 0.4 bar and 20 Hz in the experiments, whereas the theoretical amplitude, <italic>E</italic>, and frequency, <italic>ω</italic>, were deduced from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14-0954406211430882">Figure 14</xref>(b) to be 0.35 bar and 23 Hz, respectively.

<p>Closed-loop simulation results based on equations (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula5-0954406211430882">5</xref>) and (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula6-0954406211430882">6</xref>) are also shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15-0954406211430882">Figure 15</xref>(a) and (b). The parameters of the simulations, such as the initial upstream tank pressures, were tuned to match the conditions of the experiments shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15-0954406211430882">Figure 15</xref>. Like the experiments, the valves began to limit cycle in the simulations with a frequency of approximately 20 Hz when the gain rose above 0.8. However, unlike the experiments, the amplitude of the simulated limit cycling was close to the value of 0.35 bar predicted by the describing function analysis.</p>
<p>The differences between the predicted start and actual start of limit cycling, amplitude of the cycling and frequency of the cycling can be attributed in part to the assumptions made in deriving the transfer function described by equation (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula12-0954406211430882">12</xref>). The transfer function assumes that the chamber is charged and discharged at the same, constant rate. By contrast, both the simulation and experiment take into account that there are dissimilar pressure differentials across the inlet and outlet valves, and the different discharge coefficients, which results in distinct rates of charging and discharging. Errors between the predicted start and actual start of limit cycling may also be due to nonidealities in the experiments, such as a variable valve delay, thermal effects and leakage. Despite the sources of error, the broad agreement between the predictions, simulations and experiments suggests that the predominant cause of the limit-cycling behaviour of the valve is captured by the simplified describing function analysis performed here.</p>

<sec id="sec14-0954406211430882"><title>Comments on the accuracy of the simulation</title>
<p>The validation exercises performed throughout this investigation show that the pneumatic model reasonably describes air brake actuators. However, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15-0954406211430882">Figure 15</xref> highlights some shortcomings of the model. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15-0954406211430882">Figure 15</xref>(a), the pressure in the chamber reaches just above 6 bar in the simulation, the inlet valve closes, and the pressure remains just above 6 bar for the duration of the trial. By contrast, the pressure reaches just above 6 bar in the experiment, the valve closes, and changes in the air temperature within the chamber slowly causes the pressure to fall below 6 bar. However, this effect is less prominent when air is being let into and out of the system dynamically than when all valves are held closed, as illustrated by comparing <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15-0954406211430882">Figure 15</xref>(a) and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15-0954406211430882">Figure 15</xref>(b). Attempts are being undertaken to model the change in pressure using temperature decrements, and this research is ongoing.</p>
<p>Other weak points of the air brake model are highlighted by <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15-0954406211430882">Figure 15</xref>(b). Although care was taken to measure electrical delays and offsets in the system, their values changed during experiments as components, such as solenoid coils, heated up. The changes caused differences between the times when experimental valves changed states and when simulated valves changed states, as illustrated by the small mismatch in the frequency of the limit cycle between the simulation and the experiment from 0.5 to 1 s in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15-0954406211430882">Figure 15</xref>(b). Despite this, many of the salient features of the experiments, such as the charge and discharge rates, and the existence of limit cycles, are captured in the simulation with reasonable accuracy.</p>

<sec id="sec15-0954406211430882" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title>
<p>A novel HGV brake architecture was introduced that features binary-actuated pneumatic valves directly placed on the brake chambers. Simulations of the pneumatic system were made, whereby chamber charging and discharging was described using 1D flow theory and polytropic thermodynamic relations for the uniform, unsteady flow of air into and out of an open system. The description was shown to be accurate when both charging to and discharging from tank pressure, and when charging the chamber at intermediate mark–space ratios. Research is ongoing into the transient effects of temperature on the chamber pressure when all valves are held closed at intermediate pressures.</p>
<p>The simulation was extended with a mechanical model of the piston with hysteresis to describe charging to very low pressures. Care was also taken to distinguish between the concepts of ‘force-area’ and ‘volume-area’. The simulations showed that the oscillations found during experiments were caused by the piston having a sudden impact with the brake pads when the chamber is charged to a pressure just less than the contact pressure.</p>
<p>An analogue proportional pressure controller was devised for the pneumatic system. A describing function analysis showed that limit cycling can occur with the control system if the controller has too high a gain, the valves have too high a time delay or if there is too low a dead-zone at the extreme values of mark–space ratio.</p>
