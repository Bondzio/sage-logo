<p>No sooner had the threat of annihilation been lifted from Jews in Europe than they began to accuse one another of cooperating with the Germans in order to survive. Within weeks after liberation, tribunals were set up in freed cities and displaced persons camps to hear the charges against former functionaries in German-run administrations.</p>
<p>In western Europe and under the Soviets, Jews were put on trial in civil courts. Many were convicted and given harsh sentences. Denunciations and popular anger among survivors were so common in Israel that, in 1950, the Knesset passed a law to enable the trial of persons accused of having been ‘kapos’. Over forty ‘kapo trials’ were held.</p>
<p>The subject exploded again in the 1960s thanks to Raul Hilberg’s ill-informed remarks about Jewish behaviour in extremis, remarks that were ramped up by the insensitive journalism of Hannah Arendt. In the first edition of her book about Eichmann’s trial she dubbed Leo Baeck, revered leader of German Jews, ‘a Jewish führer’ and asserted that more Jews would have survived if there had not been any Jewish leaders.</p>
<p>Arendt’s strictures triggered a wave of research that revealed the nuances in Jewish leadership across German-ruled Europe and the universally appalling dilemmas they confronted. Doron Rabinovici’s study of the German-appointed Jewish administration in Vienna, originally published in 2000, is important because it focuses on the first one established by the Nazis. Vienna provided a model that was employed by the Germans wherever they conquered.</p>
<p>Rabinovici begins with crucial background. Jewish communal leaders in Austria had become used to cooperating with a fascist regime from 1934 until the German occupation. But this only habituated them to expecting rational conduct, even if it was clad in vile rhetoric and accompanied by violence.</p>
<p>In March 1938 the community was decapitated by arrests and traumatized by unprecedented brutality that exposed their isolation. Those leaders who were permitted to reconstruct a Jewish community organization had to serve the German goal of rapid mass emigration. In addition they took responsibility for patching together welfare services for a Jewish population that was soon deprived of any livelihood.</p>
<p>Adolf Eichmann emerged as a key figure implementing anti-Jewish measures. To fulfil the SS agenda of forced emigration he commanded Josef Löwenherz, a former director of the Jewish Community (IKG) to devise a centralized office to manage emigration. The Central Office, in turn, came to control the IKG and the destiny of Austria’s Jews.</p>
<p>Until November 1941, as well as caring for needy, sick, aged, and orphan Jews, the IKG ran a massive emigration operation. But when the Germans stopped emigration and switched to deportation it continued to perform. IKG employees distributed the yellow star that marked Jews, prepared inventories of Jewish properties, and issued instructions for the deportees. The Germans prepared the lists, but, in room 8 of the IKG, Löwenherz and other officials agonized over whom they could make a case for ‘deferring’.</p>
<p>The IKG also provided ‘marshals’, <italic>Ausheber</italic>, who located Jews in their homes, escorted them to the assembly sites, and watched over vacated properties until teams, also from the IKG, came to remove the household goods for utilization by the Germans. Jewish doctors and nurses were present at the final registration and at the station where trains left for ‘the East’ or Theresienstadt. The last Jew many saw was the <italic>Gruppenführer</italic> of the marshals, Robert Prochnik.</p>
<p>For the doomed it looked as if Jewish functionaries ruled their lives. They blamed the ever-present Jews, not the remote Germans. The fact that Benjamin Murmelstein, who ran the emigration system, was (necessarily) cold and hard only aggravated this belief. The administrators appeared determined to implement every German decree rather than show mercy towards their own kind. Few knew that Löwenherz was abetting Franzi Löw, in charge of welfare, who was forging and distributing ration cards to Jews in hiding.</p>
<p>Instead, all twelve members of the Jewish executive were arrested after the war. One of the <italic>Ausheber</italic>, Wilhelm Reisz, got a harsher prison term than the SS man who commanded him. Dr Emil Tuchmann, who ran the Jewish hospital, was hated for meeting German demands punctiliously. Jews who came back physically assaulted him. He was arrested twice, but never convicted. Investigations revealed that his compliance was the reverse side of his efforts to save those who he could.</p>
<p>Rabinovici concludes that anger on the part of the Jews was misdirected. They were fooled by the illusion that Jews were running their own affairs. ‘In reality’, he writes, ‘the Jewish functionaries were powerless in the face of the deceptions practiced by the Nazi authorities. The Jewish administration was unable to offer an alternative strategy … the behaviour of the Jews no longer had any effect on the Nazi policies.’</p>
<p>Yet the policy of cooperation enabled two-thirds of Austrian Jews to emigrate, half of whom were assisted by the Jewish organizations. In 1941, when 5000 were deported eastwards, they helped 6000 to emigrate. Once the Jewish leadership understood that deportation meant death, only 8600 Jews remained. Until the end they cooperated with the Germans in order to save lives, never to assist Nazi goals. No other oppressed group behaved much differently. All were victims of a cruel policy ruthlessly designed to entrap the victims into abetting their own destruction.</p>
<p>Rabinovici’s study is occasionally repetitive and poorly organized, although Nick Somers’ translation assists readability. It convincingly shows that the myth of Jewish collaboration and individual self-preservation was part of a post-Holocaust identity, a rejection of failed values, and a comforting fantasy that those who did not cooperate had resisted. In fact, the Jewish leaders had inevitably shared the hopes and delusions of their communities and it was this common fate that makes their role so tragic.</p>
