<abstract>
<p>This article reports on a qualitative study that examined the identity construction experiences of six international English-language teaching assistants (IELTAs) in a large English medium of instruction university in Hong Kong. The study explored the contribution of the IELTAs to the internationalization goals of the university using a framework of teacher identity construction. The study illustrates that the IELTAs faced significant challenges in constructing their identities as teachers, and that identity conflicts that arose with students at the host university could threaten the IELTAs’ contributions to the internationalization goals of the university. The article draws upon aspects of critical discourse analysis to explore the reactions of the IELTAs to these conflicts and reveals how, through the exercise of agency and the emergence of an evolving community of practice, the IELTAs constructed their preferred teacher identities. Implications for the design of IELTA programs in analogous educational settings and future research are also considered.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1475240911434339">Naidoo (2006</xref>: 234), internationalization refers to ‘the policy-based responses that educational institutions adopt as a result of the impact of globalization’. One aspect of this policy-based response has been the emergence of English as a medium of research and instruction in many tertiary institutions around the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1475240911434339">Altbach and Knight, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1475240911434339">Andrade, 2010</xref>). Within Europe, for instance, Phillipson (2006) refers to the ‘Englishization’ of European higher education. In Asia, use of the English language is seen as one of the most substantial factors influencing the internationalization of some tertiary institutions in the People’s Republic of China (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1475240911434339">Yang, 2002</xref>). In Hong Kong, the University of Hong Kong has identified the English language, as a medium of instruction and as a lingua franca on campus, as crucial to promoting an ‘international perspective’ across the curriculum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1475240911434339">University of Hong Kong, n.d.</xref>). At the Chinese University of Hong Kong, an institution whose Ordinance states that the principal medium of teaching shall be Chinese, authorities have justified attempts to significantly increase the number of courses taught in English on the grounds of broadening the international vision of students and because English is the major medium of international academic exchange (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1475240911434339">Choi, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>A contribution of this study is to use the lens of teacher identity to investigate the role of the English language in the internationalization of tertiary education by considering the experiences of six English-language teachers, who were recruited from Western and Asian countries in the capacity of international English language teaching assistants (IELTAs) by a large English medium of instruction tertiary institution in Hong Kong. This article begins by grounding this study within debates about globalization and education. The article then situates the study within the context of the internationalization of tertiary education in Asia, with particular attention to the role the English language, and English-language teachers and teaching, can play within such internationalization efforts. Next, a theoretical framework for understanding teacher identity construction in practice and discourse is outlined. The experiences of six IELTAs at a large tertiary education institution in Hong Kong are then described and explained in terms of this theoretical framework. Implications for how IELTAs can best contribute to the internationalization goals of tertiary institutions are then described and possibilities for future research are considered.</p>

<sec id="section2-1475240911434339">
<title>Globalization, education and identity</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1475240911434339">Ben-Rafael and Sternberg (2001</xref>: 7) argue that globalization can be thought of as the ‘global spatialization of the social reality’. As one aspect of this social reality, education is deeply implicated in the spatial consequences of globalization. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1475240911434339">Edwards and Usher (2008)</xref> suggest that globalization challenges fixed understandings of time and space in relation to teaching and learning, pointing to an undermining of schools and universities as privileged sites of learning and teaching and the emergence of different learning settings, such as the workplace and the home. Thus, the growing significance of e-learning and of study abroad opportunities in some undergraduate programmes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1475240911434339">Jackson, 2008</xref>) could be seen as markers of the ‘de-territorializing’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1475240911434339">Edwards and Usher, 2008</xref>: 143) of education. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1475240911434339">Edwards and Usher (2008</xref>: 143) suggest that one consequence of this interface between globalization and education is the decline of the bounded notion of what it means to be a student: ‘the focus shifts from being a member of an institution to being an individualized, flexible lifelong learner’.</p>
<p>While this focus is on learners, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1475240911434339">Edwards and Usher’s (2008)</xref> considerations of the changes globalization has brought to the meaning of being a student could also be applied to teacher identities. Indeed, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1475240911434339">Edwards and Usher (2008)</xref> foreshadow this possibility in two respects. First, in linking globalization to learner centered teaching, they highlight a challenge to teacher centered pedagogies, thereby raising questions about what is taught and how teaching is carried out. In addition, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1475240911434339">Edwards and Usher (2008)</xref> note that globalization has been associated with the entrance of wider groups and different types of practitioners into the terrain of education. Although they refer to learning in the workplace and the home, in relation to tertiary education institutions this list could include, for instance, the role of international teaching assistants. Therefore, in addition to the questions of what and how, analysis of the interface between globalization and education should also consider the question of who is regarded as a teacher.</p>
<p>To explore how the answers to these questions shape and are shaped by efforts to internationalize tertiary educational institutions in Asia and other parts of the world, the current study draws upon a framework of teacher identity. Teacher identity has been argued as crucial to understanding teachers and teaching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1475240911434339">Varghese et al., 2005</xref>), and therefore to determining the role different types of teachers can play in these internationalization efforts. A contribution of the current article is to use a framework of identity to consider how one type of teacher (international English language teaching assistants) contributed to the internationalization efforts of a tertiary education institution in Hong Kong. Prior to presenting the theory of identity used in this study, this article describes the internationalization efforts of tertiary institutions in Asia, with particular reference to Hong Kong and the role English-language teaching and learning is thought to play in such efforts.</p>

<title>The internationalization of higher education: language and teaching in the Hong Kong context</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1475240911434339">Mok (2007</xref>: 435, 442) points out that the internationalization of higher education has been taken ‘very seriously’ within Asia, noting that ‘all the East Asian governments have placed internationalization of higher education at the top of their education reform agenda’. In the case of Hong Kong, the internationalization of tertiary education has led to efforts to position the territory as ‘a regional education hub’, for instance by engaging with international teaching and research benchmarks and by recruiting overseas students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1475240911434339">University Grants Committee, 2002</xref>). Hong Kong however is not alone in its vision of establishing such a hub (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1475240911434339">Yoshino, 2009</xref>). Given competition from other Asian countries, it is therefore important for Hong Kong to differentiate the educational experiences it provides, particularly in terms of the ability to recruit overseas students to Hong Kong’s tertiary education institutions.</p>
<p>One of the means by which differentiation might be achieved is through the opportunities Hong Kong provides for English-medium teaching and learning. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1475240911434339">Cheong et al.’s (2009)</xref> study of non-local students undertaking higher education in Hong Kong concluded that English-medium teaching is crucial in opening up the territory’s tertiary education institutions to overseas students. However, the authors also reported disappointment among students from some Asian countries concerning aspects of the English-medium teaching and learning environment they encountered in Hong Kong, such as the limited number of modules being delivered in English, difficulties with lecturers’ spoken English and the use of Cantonese in the classroom. Conversely, some students – in particular those from the Chinese mainland – have argued that although the opportunity to study in an English-medium environment was an important factor in their decision to pursue tertiary education in Hong Kong, they consider English to be the most difficult barrier to conquer in terms of both studying and living in the territory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1475240911434339">Li and Bray, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1475240911434339">Xie, 2009</xref>). The role of the English language within the internationalization strategies of tertiary institutions has often been considered from the perspective of students, seeking ways to better support non-native English-speaking international students studying in English-speaking host countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1475240911434339">Andrade, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1475240911434339">Brown and Holloway, 2008</xref>). What also needs to be considered is the role of teacher identity in teaching and learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1475240911434339">Varghese et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1475240911434339">
<title>Teacher identity-in-practice</title>
<p>Identity refers to ‘our understanding of who we are and who we think other people are’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1475240911434339">Danielewicz, 2001</xref>: 10). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1475240911434339">Varghese et al. (2005</xref>: 39) maintain that a comprehensive understanding of teaching and teachers requires attention to both ‘identity-in-discourse’ and ‘identity-in-practice’. Identity-in-practice describes an action-orientated approach to understanding identity, underlining the need to investigate identity construction as a social matter, which is operationalized through concrete practices and tasks. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1475240911434339">Wenger (1998)</xref> explores identity construction as an experience in terms of three modes of belonging: engagement, imagination and alignment. Through engagement, individuals establish and maintain joint enterprises and negotiate meanings. Engagement allows individuals to invest in what they do and in their relations with other people, gaining ‘a lived sense of who we are’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1475240911434339">Wenger, 1998</xref>: 192). Engaging in practice is a powerful source of identity construction because it allows individuals to determine how they can take part in activities and the competencies that are required. Engagement also allows us to relate ourselves to other people in creating a common enterprise and undertaking shared activities.</p>
<p>Imagination provides identity with new dimensions because it takes the individual beyond the here and now of their engagement in practice by creating images of the world and one’s place within it across time and space. Through imagination, the individual creates a trajectory of identity formation that links understandings of past experiences to anticipations of the future connected to the present. Whereas imagination involves surpassing current realities, alignment coordinates an individual’s activities with other realities and other communities of practice. Alignment bridges time and space by connecting the individual to broader structures and enterprises, allowing the identity of a larger group to become part of the identity of the individual participants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1475240911434339">Wenger 1998</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1475240911434339">Wenger (1998)</xref> also investigates identity formation in terms of the negotiation of meanings that matter within a social configuration. For <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1475240911434339">Wenger (1998</xref>: 199), meanings exist within a broader structure termed the ‘economy of meanings’, in which a range of meanings are produced, each of which competes ‘for the definition of certain events, actions, or artifacts’. Within an economy of meanings, different individuals have varying degrees of control over the meanings that are produced, a situation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1475240911434339">Wenger (1998</xref>: 200) describes as the ‘ownership of meanings’. The diverse degrees of control different individuals have over meanings – the relations of ownership of meaning – shape the negotiability of meanings and result in some meanings having more currency than others. Negotiability then refers to the extent to which individuals can use, modify, and claim as their own the meanings that matter to them. If such negotiability is absent an identity of non-participation and marginality can result; the individual’s experience ‘becomes irrelevant because it cannot be asserted and recognized as a form of competence’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1475240911434339">Wenger, 1998</xref>: 203).</p>

<sec id="section5-1475240911434339">
<title>Teacher identity-in-discourse</title>
<p>The other aspect of a comprehensive understanding of teacher identity construction, identity-in-discourse, acknowledges that identities are discursively constituted, mainly through language. In poststructuralist theory, for example, identity construction occurs as individuals identify with particular subject positions within discourses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1475240911434339">Weedon, 1997</xref>). In this view, language and identity are mutually constitutive; while language presents to the individual historically specific ways of giving meaning to social reality, ‘it is also the place where our sense of ourselves, our subjectivity, is constructed’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1475240911434339">Weedon, 1997</xref>: 21). From a poststructuralist perspective, such construction is a process of struggle because ‘the individual is always the site of conflicting forms of subjectivity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1475240911434339">Weedon, 1997</xref>: 32). Although <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1475240911434339">Wenger’s (1998)</xref> concept of the economy of meanings does allow for the possibility of conflict as different meanings compete to define actions and events, his framework has been criticized for offering a ‘benign model’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1475240911434339">Barton and Tusting, 2005</xref>: 10) that fails to adequately theorize the role of conflict and contestation.</p>
<p>One theory of discourse that does address the role of conflict and contestation is that of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1475240911434339">Laclau and Mouffe (1985)</xref>, whose framework is described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1475240911434339">Jorgensen and Phillips (2002)</xref>. For <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1475240911434339">Laclau and Mouffe (1985)</xref>, meanings are fluid and discourses contingent; that is, there is always scope for struggles over what discourses should prevail. Within this view of discourse, identity is discursively constituted through chains of equivalence which contain nodal points or master signifiers of identity, such as ‘man’, with which particular content comes to be equated: ‘strength’ and ‘reason’, for instance. Different signifiers or signs, including ‘passive’ and ‘passion’, contrast this nodal point with other master signifiers such as ‘woman’. It is the collision of conflicting discourses that can result in social antagonisms, which occur ‘when different identities mutually exclude each other’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1475240911434339">Jorgensen and Phillips, 2002</xref>: 47). Social antagonisms can be dissolved through a hegemonic intervention in which one discourse comes to dominate and ‘by means of force reconstitutes ambiguity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1475240911434339">Jorgensen and Phillips, 2002</xref>: 48). However, as discourses are always contingent and the meaning of signs can never be ultimately fixed, such a hegemonic intervention can be undermined in an ongoing social struggle over the definition of society and identity.</p>
<p>While the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1475240911434339">Laclau and Mouffe (1985)</xref> provides insight into the role of struggle and contestation in identity formation, their framework lacks specific tools for discourse analysis. Within this paper, this limitation is addressed through the use of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1475240911434339">Fairclough’s (2003</xref>: 164) model of identity formation, which argues that ‘what people commit themselves to in texts is an important part of how they identify themselves, the texturing of identity’. Linguistically, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1475240911434339">Fairclough (2003)</xref> examines the commitments an author makes in terms of both modality and evaluation. Modality refers to what individuals commit themselves to in terms of truth, obligation and necessity, and is often displayed in the use of modal verbs, such as ‘should’ and ‘must’, and modal adverbs, including ‘probably’ and ‘possibly’. Evaluation describes what is believed to be desirable or undesirable and can be expressed in terms of what is considered good or bad, as well as useful and important. While such evaluations can be expressed explicitly, through the use of terms such as ‘wonderful’ or ‘dreadful’, they can also be more deeply embedded in texts through, for example, invoking implicit value systems that are assumed to be shared between author and interpreter. Finally, the texturing of identity can be examined in terms not only of what individuals commit to, but also of why they make such commitments, that is, the ‘reasons that either the whole of a social practice or some part of it must take place’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1475240911434339">van Leeuwen, 2008</xref>: 20).</p>
<p>This paper considers four strategies that individuals use to explain and legitimize the texturing of their identities: authorization, which occurs when reference is made to tradition, laws, or institutional authority; rationalization, which relies upon references to the utility of a particular course of action; moral evaluation, which appeals to value systems; and mythopoesis, which is legitimation derived from narratives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1475240911434339">Fairclough, 2003</xref>). Based on this theoretical framework, the collection and analysis of data was guided by the following research question: How did one group of IELTAs develop their teacher identities in practice and discourse at a large English medium of instruction university in Hong Kong?</p>

<title>The study</title>
<sec id="section7-1475240911434339">
<title>Context and participants</title>
<p>Six IELTAs, four female and two male, participated in this study. During the 2008/9 academic year, the participants were employed on a 12-month contract within the language learning centre of a large tertiary education institution in Hong Kong in which English is the official medium of instruction for most undergraduate programs. The IELTA program, which recruits up to a dozen teaching assistants per year from Western and Asian countries, represents part of the university’s strategic plan for internationalization by fostering a global perspective among staff and students through the provision of national and international teaching and learning experiences.</p>
<p>To support this plan, one aspect of the IELTAs’ responsibilities is to provide English-language instruction to undergraduate students from different faculties and departments across the university through a variety of modes. For example, IELTAs provide classes for up to 20 students who are preparing for the International English Language Testing System (IELTS) examination. In addition, IELTAs conduct smaller classes for up to 10 students who are interested in improving their general proficiency in the English language, with an emphasis on speaking, reading, writing and listening skills. IELTAs also hold one-to-one consultations with undergraduate students who require assistance with specific aspects of academic English, such as offering advice on writing assignments and taking examinations in the English medium. The role of the IELTAs in the internationalization of the university also requires their participation in extracurricular and cultural activities as a means of fostering cross-cultural and multi-ethnic understanding among the student population. For the undergraduate students at the university, participation in these classes, consultations and social activities is non-credit bearing and, therefore, optional.</p>
<p>Purposive sampling decisions also reflected a desire to include participants with a variety of geographical and educational backgrounds, as well as a gender mix. The IELTAs came from geographical backgrounds that included the USA, New Zealand and Malaysia. All IELTAs had obtained undergraduate degree qualifications from their respective country of origin in subjects such as political science, international relations and English literature. One of the participants, Pam, had obtained qualifications in teaching English as a second or foreign language. (The names of all participants are pseudonyms, to preserve their anonymity.)</p>
<p>Upon their arrival in Hong Kong, only Pam and Jan had classroom teaching experience, although Pam’s experience was limited to the completion of a six-week practicum as part of the requirements of her teaching qualification. Prior to her arrival in Hong Kong, Jan had spent one year teaching English as a foreign language at a secondary school in the People’s Republic of China (PRC). None of the other participants had lived or studied abroad for any significant length of time prior to taking up their position as an IELTA. Upon arrival in Hong Kong, the IELTAs undertook a three day induction program, which included sessions, conducted by staff from the university’s language center, designed to assist them to assimilate into Hong Kong society in general and their language teaching role in particular. For example, IELTAs participated in an orientation program which introduced them to the IELTA program and structure, and included seminars and workshops such as ‘developing pedagogical skills’, ‘issues in cross-cultural communication’ and ‘preparing students for the IELTS examination’. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1475240911434339">Table 1</xref> summarizes the biographical backgrounds of the participants.</p>

<title>Data collection and analyses</title>
<p>Semi-structured interviews, which were audio-recorded and transcribed, were conducted with all six participants in three stages. An initial interview was conducted shortly after the participant’s arrival in Hong Kong and before they began their teaching duties. Interview questions explored their reasons for becoming IELTAs, their expectations of living and teaching in Hong Kong, their views about language teaching and learning, and what preparation, if any, they had undertaken prior to their arrival in Hong Kong. A second set of interviews was carried out approximately six months after participants began their teaching duties in Hong Kong. These interviews explored whether the participants’ initial expectations of teachers, students, and teaching in Hong Kong had been fulfilled, whether they had experienced any significant challenges, and how, if at all, they had overcome the difficulties they encountered. A final round of interviews was conducted approximately one month before the IELTAs were due to conclude their contracts and depart from Hong Kong. Participants were asked to reflect on their experiences of teaching and living in Hong Kong, including the most and least enjoyable aspects of their teaching experiences, their relations with colleagues and students, and what advice they would offer other people in their home countries who might be considering taking up the role of an IELTA in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Analyses and interpretations of the data were attained in a recursive, iterative manner as interview transcripts were reviewed multiple times. As a first step, ‘codes’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1475240911434339">Miles and Huberman, 1994</xref>: 56) were used to assign meaning and to organize the data as the contents of the interview transcripts were broken down into discrete parts. Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1475240911434339">Miles and Huberman (1994</xref>: 56), codes were assigned to different sized ‘chunks’ of data; words, phrases and sentences, for instance. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1475240911434339">Bogdan and Biklen (2003)</xref> suggest that particular theoretical approaches imply particular coding schemes. Codes that were developed therefore reflected the theoretical framework for understanding identity construction described earlier. For example, one participant, Philip, offered the following comment:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I was very worried. Would I be a good teacher? Would I be able to inspire them (students)? … I must get the students in my classroom to use English, speak it, enjoy it, and have fun.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Philip names the identity position ‘good teacher’, which he partly fills with meaning through his explanation of this type of teacher as one who inspires students. The strength of his commitment to truth about what constitutes a ‘good teacher’ is underscored by his adamant assertion that ‘I <italic>must</italic> get the students in my classroom to use English, speak it, enjoy it, and have fun’, a stance that leaves little doubt that the classroom environment he describes is obligatory. This approach to data analysis reflects the use of a ‘case-oriented strategy’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1475240911434339">Miles and Huberman, 1994</xref>: 174), meaning that data from each individual participant was considered as a whole, and recurring topics were identified in the case of each individual IELTA. Later, a comparative analysis was undertaken across data from different IELTAs to identify similarities and constant associations. For example, other characteristics that different IELTAs associated with a good teacher included making students interested in learning English (Vivian) and engaging with students in the classroom (Jessica).</p>
<p>Data analysis was not however restricted to the use of case-orientated strategies. A ‘variable-orientated strategy’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1475240911434339">Miles and Huberman, 1994</xref>: 175) was also used in which data from all the participants were sorted using theoretical categories suggested by the framework for understanding identity construction described above. One example of a category developed in this way was ‘engagement as identity construction’, which was used to locate recurring themes that cut across data from different participants that reflected the IELTAs’ beliefs about how they and their students took part in classroom activities and interactions associated with teaching and learning in Hong Kong. This process was repeated using other categories suggested by the theoretical framework, such as ‘imagination as identity construction’ and ‘identity conflict’. Finally, participants were consulted about their interpretation of the findings, and further refinements were made.</p>

<title>Before the sojourn</title>
<p>In discussing their aspirations for the IELTA program, participants mentioned not only a range of anticipated gains to their personal identities, including ‘becoming someone who’s more culturally aware’ (Vivian) and ‘developing my skills as a Chinese language learner’ (Jerry), but also expectations about their emerging teacher identities, as shown through the following extracts from interview transcripts:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Extract 1</p>
<p>Before (I arrived in Hong Kong) I was really concerned about teaching in Hong Kong. I thought, will my students recognize me as a teacher, not just as an assistant teacher or a visitor to the university, but as someone who is really teaching them language? Because, as a teacher, I must make them interested in learning English. (Vivian)</p>
<p>Extract 2</p>
<p>I’m very worried. Will I be a good teacher? Will I be able to inspire them (students) to really engage with language? In my classroom I must get the students to use English, speak it, enjoy it and have fun. So, I am worried, can I do all this, can I pull it off? (Philip)</p>
<p>Extract 3</p>
<p>As a new teacher, I think of going to Hong Kong as a challenging and scary experience because I was asking myself could I apply what I learned about English teaching and develop my teaching skills … in my (teacher education) course we studied things like how to develop classroom interaction, group work, communicative approaches, so I thought it’ll be great, I will be able to apply this knowledge, but I’m also worried, can I do it? (Pam)</p>
<p>Extract 4</p>
<p>Being a teacher in Hong Kong, I didn’t expect it would be easy, as Hong Kong students face lots of exam pressure, but I thought it would be great to engage with students. Before I arrived, I expected the students here to be like American university students, where they engage in class discussion. But after I arrived – it was a really big surprise – in the Hong Kong approach, there’s much, much greater focus on testing and memorization, as opposed to the American approach, which is more about higher order thinking, not so much lower order memorization. (Jessica)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In each of these extracts, participants name the identity category ‘teacher’, describing their perceptions of what ‘being a teacher in Hong Kong’ (Jessica) meant to them. For example, the significance Vivian places on having her teaching competencies recognized by students is evident in her careful attempt to differentiate the identity ‘teacher’ from that of ‘assistant teacher’, and from ‘visitor’ to the classrooms of Hong Kong, identity positions that she implicitly negatively evaluates using the term ‘just’. The participants also list the competencies that they associate with their preferred teacher identity positions. For instance, a ‘good teacher’ is someone ‘really teaching’ the English language by making students interested in English-language learning (Vivian), inspiring students to use English (Philip) and engaging with students in the classroom (Jessica). The importance each IELTA places on operationalizing these competencies is evident in their adamant commitments to truth about what they ‘must’ achieve as teachers: ‘as a teacher I <italic>must …</italic> ’; ‘I <italic>must</italic> get the students to … ’. Embedded within each IELTA’s uncompromising beliefs about teachers and teaching are certain assumed values. It is, for instance, taken as self evident that inspiring learners, making learning interesting and engaging students in the learning process are desirable goals for language teachers.</p>
<p>For each IELTA, becoming the type of teacher described in extracts 1–4 is built upon a foundation of teacher agency, that is ‘the socioculturally mediated capacity to act’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1475240911434339">Ahern, 2001</xref>: 112). In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1475240911434339">van Leeuwen’s (2008)</xref> terms, the establishment and development of these teacher identities is agentialized, that is, represented as being brought about by the teachers themselves. Linguistically, this individualized forging of the identity ‘teacher’ is displayed in strongly modalized personal statements that express not merely aspirations of what the IELTAs ‘should’ or ‘could’ achieve as teachers in Hong Kong, but rather represent adamant assertions about the type of teachers and teaching that ‘must’ and ‘will’ be realized within their classrooms: ‘<italic>I</italic> must <italic>make</italic> them (students) interested in learning English’ (Vivian); ‘<italic>I</italic> will be able to <italic>apply</italic> this knowledge’ (Pam).</p>
<p>Together with positively evaluated opportunities to establish and extend their teacher identities, extracts 1–4 report a series of less sanguine emotions and attitudes towards the prospect of teaching in Hong Kong, including being ‘concerned’ (Vivian) and ‘worried’ about this ‘challenging and scary experience’. These terms, which capture the doubts IELTAs had about their ability to realize their teacher identities in terms of the actions, practices and competencies described above, open the potential for the participants’ Hong Kong teaching experiences to be negatively evaluated in terms of their contribution to the participants’ teacher identity construction. Linguistically, the possible failure to realize their preferred identity positions is flagged by a series of rhetorical questions: ‘can I do all this?’, ‘can I pull it off?’. The subjective markings (‘can <italic>I</italic> do it?’; ‘can <italic>I</italic> pull it off<italic>’</italic>?) used here suggest that these IELTAs identified potential limits to the realization of their preferred teacher identities partly at the intrasubjective level; the questions explicitly mark these doubts as those of the author.</p>
<p>However, Jessica’s reference to the Hong Kong education system introduces the possibility of socioculturally mediated limits to teacher agency. For example, the emphasis within the Hong Kong education system on testing and memorization is presented as a potential threat to the realization of Jessica’s identity as a teacher who engages with students. This potentiality is signaled by her use of the term ‘surprise’, which differentiates her experiences in the USA where students ‘engage in class’, from the classroom environments she encountered in Hong Kong, a division that is underscored by the use of a contrastive ‘before-and-after’ construction: ‘<italic>Before</italic> I arrived … <italic>but after</italic> I arrived in Hong Kong.’ Her use of repetition in describing the ‘Hong Kong approach’ as one that places ‘<italic>much, much</italic> greater focus on testing and memorization’ adds further strength to this division, which Jessica goes on to explicitly characterize as oppositional (‘as <italic>opposed</italic> to the American approach’). Moreover, it is the Hong Kong educational context that is negatively evaluated within her depiction of a hierarchy of teaching and learning styles, one which associates the ‘American approach’ with ‘<italic>higher</italic> order thinking’ and the ‘Hong Kong approach’ primarily with ‘<italic>lower</italic> order memorization’. This hierarchical divide suggests awareness among the IELTAs that they had entered a very different teaching and learning environment in Hong Kong, an issue that is explored in more detail in the following section.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1475240911434339">
<title>The sojourn</title>
<p>The oppositional structure between teaching and learning in their home and host countries was one that many of the participants explored when asked to reflect on their experiences of teaching in Hong Kong. Jerry’s comments are representative of the arguments the IELTAs presented:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Extract 5</p>
<p>I really believe that classrooms are run very differently here (Hong Kong) compared to at home. Unfortunately students here are really burdened by exams and are really dependent on the teacher. The classes have a huge emphasis on students being passive, taking notes and memorization based learning, not questioning information, which I think is part of their background in schools; in Hong Kong I understand schools are very teacher dominated. And this is very different than my experience in New Zealand universities. Over there, there’s definitely a lot more emphasis on independent learning, class discussions and debates, and students’ critical responses to what they are taught. (Jerry)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Jerry offers a strongly modalized personal statement of belief (<italic>I really believe</italic> that … ‘), which details his perceptions of the differences between teaching and learning in Hong Kong and New Zealand. He develops this contrast through a juxtaposition of teaching and learning ‘here’ in Hong Kong as opposed to what takes place ‘at home’ or ‘over there’. This dichotomy was argued to exist across several dimensions. For example, in Hong Kong, students are seen as dependent on ‘the teacher’, while in New Zealand students are represented as ‘independent learners’. Hong Kong students sit ‘passively taking notes’, in contrast to New Zealand classrooms that are characterized by ‘discussions and debates’. Whereas learning in Hong Kong is based on ‘memorization’, in New Zealand students are encouraged to question information and critically respond to what they are taught. Jerry’s descriptions of these divisions take the form of adamant statements of what he believes distinguishes Hong Kong and New Zealand classrooms. For instance, in Hong Kong students <italic>are very</italic> dependent on the professor, classes <italic>have a huge</italic> emphasis on students sitting passively, a situation which i<italic>s very</italic> different from that found in New Zealand, where there <italic>definitely is</italic> more emphasis on independent learning and critical reflection. Jerry’s emphatic contrast between New Zealand with Hong Kong is resolved in favor of the situation ‘back home’, with his recount of the Hong Kong context prefaced by an explicitly marked negative evaluation: ‘<italic>unfortunately</italic> students here are …’. As in extracts 1–4, embedded within this evaluation is a series of assumed values about the desirability, or otherwise, of the conditions of teaching and learning Jerry describes within both the home and host countries. It is, for instance, taken for granted that it is desirable for learners to be independent, involved in classroom discussion, and questioning of information. Jerry’s legitimatization for these beliefs is based on an appeal to the authority of his personal experiences of teachers and teaching, students and learning, within New Zealand universities.</p>
<p>Having encountered a teaching and learning environment vastly different from that to which they were accustomed ‘at home’, the IELTAs set about, as Jerry put it, ‘making their mark’:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Extract 6</p>
<p>It was helpful to know that the problems weren’t unique to me and my approach to teaching, we (IELTAs) all had problems drawing in students, getting them to communicate in class, so, when I realized that, I decided, I’m here on a program that’s sponsored by the university, I’m going to teach the way I know how to teach and it’s part of cultural exchange for me to bring the concept of calling people out and putting them on the spot. (Jan)</p>
<p>Extract 7</p>
<p>So after a while we (IELTAs) decided that we must teach our way which is not having passive learners but getting students engaged in learning. So we decided to try to get them (students) to fit in. The staff of the language centre, our colleagues, gave us a lot of support for our teaching methods after we explained the problems we’re having in the classroom. They provided lots of advice and teaching materials and that helped to sort of justify what we were at least trying to do. (Vivian)</p>
<p>Extract 8</p>
<p>Amongst us, it was crash or crash through, we had to make our mark … we all knew we were having problems, and we knew how we wanted to teach, what we wanted to do in the classroom, so we thought we can either give into them and just teach to a test or just do enough so they can get through an exam, or we can really teach them language and so we all decided that it was going to be our way. (Jerry)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The responses of the IELTAs to the conditions of teaching and learning they encountered within Hong Kong emphasizes the role of agency in teacher identity construction. For instance, the IELTAs represent their responses to the Hong Kong teaching and learning environment in obligatory terms, positioning themselves as actively forging their own teacher identities: ‘<italic>I’m going to</italic> teach the way I know how to teach’; ‘we <italic>must</italic> teach our way’; ‘It <italic>was c</italic>rash or crash through … we <italic>knew</italic> how we wanted to teach, <italic>what we wanted</italic> to do in the classroom.’ These linguistic choices appear to rule out any scope for negotiation in respect of the IELTAs’ approach to language teaching, a stance that is perhaps most forcefully displayed in extract 8, where Jerry offers a stark declaration, presented in the form of an either/or option, that underscores the IELTAs’ determination to teach ‘our way’.</p>
<p>That such an emphatic stance can be a realistic option seems to owe much to the sense of community that the IELTAs appear to construct within extracts 6–8. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1475240911434339">Wenger (1998</xref>: 73) argues that community exists across three dimensions: mutual engagement, joint enterprise, and shared repertoire. Linguistically, Jan, Vivian and Jerry signal their construction of a community of IELTAs partly in their repeated deployment of inclusive pronouns such as ‘we’, ‘us’ and ‘our’. Extracts 6 to 8 suggest that the emergence of this community was based partly on IELTAs’ shared understandings of the challenges that confronted them as they mutually engaged in learning and teaching in Hong Kong: ‘<italic>we (ITAs) all had</italic> problems’; ‘<italic>we all knew we</italic> were having problems’. The inclusivity implied by these discursive choices appeared to be especially beneficial to the IELTAs as they moved from acknowledging common challenges to the formation and implementation of their own preferred teacher identity positions. For example, the extent to which IELTAs could view the problems they encountered in their individual classrooms through the prism of students’ responding to a repertoire of language teaching techniques that were shared by all the IELTAs might have helped overcome feelings of isolation and potential doubts about their own teacher identity. As Jan put it, ‘it was <italic>helpful</italic> to know that the problems weren’t unique to me and my approach to teaching’, where what is helpful is taken to be desirable.</p>
<p>The sense of solidarity evident in extracts 6–8 appears to be built upon a set of core values of language teaching and learning that underpinned IELTAs’ mutual engagement in the joint enterprise of teaching in Hong Kong. These values included ‘drawing in students’, ‘getting them to communicate’ and having the learners ‘engaged in learning’. It was these common beliefs and shared sense of purpose in relation to the enterprise of teaching that were the cornerstone of the apparently unanimous diagnosis IELTAs made of the problems they encountered within Hong Kong classrooms, as well as their embrace of a seemingly unified set of responses to those difficulties. The IELTAs derive legitimacy for their ardent approach to confronting the challenges they encountered in the classroom from the personal authority associated with their particular role within the university: ‘I’m here on a program that’s <italic>sponsored by the university</italic> …’ (Jan), as well as through reference to other persons in whom institutional authority was vested: ‘the <italic>staff of the language centre</italic>, our colleagues, gave us a lot of support for our teaching methods’ (Vivian).</p>
<p>Having adopted this ‘crash or crash through’ approach, IELTAs went on to describe the reactions of their learners to the uncompromising stance they took towards learning and teaching:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Extract 9</p>
<p>We were pretty worried at first. Lots of students have very fixed views about language learning, they want an exam-focused teacher, they don’t see it our way at all, like the need for communication, speaking up in class and so there is resistance from a lot, they don’t see it as directly helpful to their academic goals, which I think in many cases was just to pass an exam. And some of them have stopped coming to the (language) classes and some of us, we have started to question ourselves as teachers. (Philip)</p>
<p>Extract 10</p>
<p>First, when we started using those communicative techniques they (students) were really shocked and stunned that I was demanding them to come along with our teaching methods and quite a few were reluctant. But I coped by exposing my more human side of being quite friendly, sharing a little bit more about myself. I’ve had an opportunity to teach in Mainland China and that technique definitely works especially well. So I think doing that is really helpful, to start to overcome at least some of their resistance to our teaching methods. (Jan)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Just as extracts 6–8 revealed the IELTAs’ resolute stance towards how languages should be taught, Philip and Jan appear to have judged that their students hold equally strident views about language teaching and learning: ‘lots of students have <italic>very fixed</italic> views about language learning; they wanted an exam-focused teacher’. The lack of congruence between the seemingly unyielding views of the IELTAs and their students regarding language teaching and learning is revealed in Jan and Philip’s discursive construction of an ‘us and them’ dichotomy. For example, while Jan and Philip refer to students in terms of ‘they’ and ‘them’, both IELTAs deploy linguistic strategies, including references to ‘our way’ of teaching and repeated references to the plural ‘we’, that return to the earlier theme of an IELTA community united around its shared beliefs and understandings about how language should be taught and learned.</p>
<p>The implications, for both IELTAs and students, of the collision of these apparently divergent views are evaluated as overwhelmingly negative. Jan reports students feeling ‘shocked and stunned’, while Philip describes the sense of doubt this caused among IELTAs in terms of their teacher identities: ‘we have started to question ourselves as teachers’. Jan, however, begins to explore possibilities for the bridging of this divide. Her strategy of ‘exposing (her) more human side’, of ‘sharing’ and being ‘friendly’, is both explicitly and implicitly endorsed as positive. The power of Jan’s commitment to truth, displayed in her description of this technique as one that ‘<italic>definitely</italic> works <italic>especially well</italic>’, explicitly marks this strategy as a success, while its final characterization as ‘really helpful’ takes as self evident that what is ‘helpful’ is also desirable. Her suggested solution finds legitimization within the authority of personal experience, in this case drawing upon her earlier ‘opportunity to teach in Mainland China’. Jan also deploys rationalization as a legitimization device, that is, an appeal to the utility or beneficial effects of certain action. In this case, the benefits of sharing and being friendly include the dissipation of student ‘resistance to our teaching methods’.</p>

<title>Reflecting on the sojourn</title>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Extract 11</p>
<p>I think that a lot of English teaching assistants (I’ve had to put an echo in my sentence because I’m speaking for many of them) really are underutilized. We came in with a set of skills and it wasn’t until we really took the bull by the horns; this is what we do, these are our backgrounds, experiences. So, I suppose there’s some confusion as to what we were here for. Something must be done to change this, otherwise the money and time spent on ITAs by this university is wasted. (Jerry)</p>
<p>Extract 12</p>
<p>I believe definitely being able to chart specific students’ progress is great about being a teacher in Hong Kong. I would like to come back (to Hong Kong) because when I think of teaching here I think of students at the beginning, with a certain low English level or lack of understanding, and then fast forward a few months and I can really see the grasp of English they have or their understanding of the world, it’s very rewarding. (Jessica)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>A range of themes arose from the IELTAs’ reflections on their teaching and learning experiences in Hong Kong. Jessica’s views reflected many of the positive evaluations participants made about ‘being a teacher in Hong Kong’. In a strong personal statement of belief (‘<italic>I</italic> believe <italic>definitely</italic> …’), Jessica offers a positive evaluation of this identity position as ‘great’ and ‘rewarding’, as she shares her vision of teaching in terms of tracing the development of certain competencies in her students over time. In contrast, Jerry’s assertion that IELTAs ‘really are underutilized’ offers a less complimentary view of the participants’ experiences of teaching in Hong Kong. The force of this explicit negative assessment is moderated somewhat by use of a mental process clause (‘<italic>I think</italic> that …’), giving a subjective marking to the modality, a signal of his potentially weakened commitment to truth that is repeated in his later observation that ‘<italic>I suppose</italic> there’s <italic>some</italic> confusion …’. Nevertheless, the strength of Jerry’s assessment is reasserted in his final call for action: ‘something <italic>must</italic> be done to change this’.</p>
<p>While Jerry’s opening statement personalizes his truth commitments (‘<italic>I</italic> think that …’), he immediately qualifies this in his claim to be speaking on behalf of other IELTAs: ‘<italic>I’ve had to put an echo in my sentence because I’m speaking for many of them</italic>.’ This authority assumes a high degree of unity among these IELTAs, in terms of their beliefs about language teaching and learning as well as in respect of the action they took to implement these beliefs. Thus, the strong sense of agency that Jerry deploys (‘it wasn’t until we really <italic>took the bull by the horns;</italic> this is what we <italic>had</italic> to do <italic>…</italic>’) is accompanied by the inclusive ‘we’, presupposing consensus among the participants regarding the desirability of the response IELTAs took to the challenges they encountered in Hong Kong classrooms. Legitimatization for this stance again relies upon the authority of expertise; it is suggested that IELTAs possess certain ‘skills’, as well as distinctive ‘backgrounds’ and ‘experiences’. In addition, Jerry draws upon moral evaluation to legitimize his belief that IELTAs are ‘underutilized’. His final description of the potential ‘waste’ of time and money serves as a cautionary tale that warns of the negative consequences of not taking the action he demands.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1475240911434339">Wenger’s (1998)</xref> description of identity in terms of three modes of belonging – engagement, imagination and alignment – provides one framework for understanding the identity construction experiences of the six IELTAs.</p>
<sec id="section14-1475240911434339">
<title>Engagement as identity construction</title>
<p>Engagement as a source of identity formation reflects our investment in what we do, providing ‘a lived sense of who we are’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1475240911434339">Wenger, 1998</xref>: 192). The IELTAs’ engagement in the enterprise of English-language teaching in Hong Kong and the construction of their preferred teacher identities was contingent upon the application and recognition of a set of teaching competencies. Taking on the identity of a ‘real teacher’ (extract 1), for instance, necessitated that IELTAs’ participation in the practices and activities of teaching should include developing classroom interaction, encouraging group work and implementing communicative approaches to language teaching and learning (extract 3). As one part of this display of teacher competencies, students’ engagement in the language classroom would reflect their role as active participants which, as Pam put it, included speaking, enjoying language learning and having fun in the classroom (extract 2). However, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1475240911434339">Wenger (1998)</xref> points out, our engagement in practices and actions can be inhibited by boundaries.</p>
<p>One boundary IELTAs encountered to the enactment of their preferred teacher identities was the mode of engagement in language learning that some students were reported to adopt. As opposed to the active classroom role described above, the IELTAs regarded some of their learners as ‘passive’ and ‘dependent on the teacher’ (extract 5). This form of student engagement in the language classroom was significant to the IELTAs’ teacher identity construction because engagement in practice involves investing not only in what we do but also in relations with others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1475240911434339">Wenger, 1998</xref>: 192).</p>
<p>At the heart of this relational form of identity construction is mutuality, meaning that the work of identity formation is two-way; by recognizing each other as participants we give ‘life to our respective social selves’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1475240911434339">Wenger, 1998</xref>: 193). However, the ‘very fixed views about language learning’ (extract 9) that some students were reported to hold meant that their engagement in the language classroom implied the absence of recognition for those teaching competencies valued by the IELTAs. A lack of mutuality meant that the capacity of IELTAs to engage in teaching in terms of the type of teachers they sought to become was threatened.</p>
<p>This potential marginalization of their teacher competencies appeared to be realized when, as IELTAs reported, some students stopped attending their language classes (extract 9). It was shown that the reaction of IELTAs to this threat of marginalization was to view their relations with passive, teacher dependent students through the prism of an ‘us and them’ dichotomy (extracts 6–8). This process of ‘othering’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1475240911434339">MacLure, 2003</xref>), and its role in IELTAs’ identity formation, was also reflected in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1475240911434339">Wenger’s (1998)</xref> remaining modes of belonging, imagination and alignment, which are discussed below.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-1475240911434339">
<title>Imagination as identity construction</title>
<p>As a mode of belonging, imagination involves creating images of the world and our place within it that transcend our immediate engagement in the practices and activities of a community. These images, which reach across time and space, mark identity construction as a temporal process. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1475240911434339">Wenger (1998</xref>: 149) explains, ‘we define who we are by where we have been and where we are going’. In relation to the IELTAs, imagination was an important part of their teacher identity construction as they drew upon where they have been, their learning and teaching experiences ‘at home’ (extract 5), to construct and legitimize their own meanings of language teaching and learning in the present, within the context of their Hong Kong classrooms.</p>
<p>Another image of the world IELTAs created that transcended their immediate engagement in teaching concerned their students. Extrapolating beyond their own language classrooms, the IELTAs created images of language learning and teaching shaped by examination pressures (extract 4) and by methods of language learning and teaching used within Hong Kong secondary schools that positioned learners as passive and teacher dependent (extract 5). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1475240911434339">Wenger (1998)</xref> points out that imagination can yield both affinity and dissociation. Linguistically, the IELTAs’ affinity with the connections they made to teaching and learning ‘at home’ was evident within their adamant assertions about the desirability of the methods of learning and teaching they had experience of in the USA (extract 4) and New Zealand (extract 5), for instance. In contrast, the IELTAs’ dissociation from the implications for teaching and learning suggested by the images they constructed of their students’ previous classroom experiences in Hong Kong is apparent in their strongly modalized statements rejecting passive and teacher dependent roles for language learners.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-1475240911434339">
<title>Alignment as identity construction</title>
<p>Identity construction also took place through IELTAs’ alignment of their teaching practices and activities with those of educational communities beyond Hong Kong. The connections the IELTAs made to methods of teaching and learning ‘at home’ were actualized through their classroom efforts to implement communicative methods of language teaching, for instance (extract 3). The success of this alignment in practice owes much to the capacity for agency IELTAs appeared to command. One example of the link between agency and alignment in the service of identity formation took the form of IELTA demands for student compliance with their preferred modes of language teaching and learning. The exercise of agency in this way highlights the role of relations of power in identity construction.</p>
<p>However, the capacity of IELTAs to demand such compliance from students not only reflected differential power relations between teachers and students but also appeared to be assisted by the discursive construction of communal ties among this group of IELTAs. This community membership, built around shared values of language teaching and learning and marked by linguistic strategies such as use of inclusive plural terms, appeared to provide individual IELTAs not only with authority to speak on behalf of others, but also with social recognition of their individual attempts to impose on students the meanings of learning and teaching that mattered to them. In this way the IELTAs’ identity construction can be seen as social as well as individual.</p>
<p>To summarize, IELTAs’ construction of their teacher identities underscores the interplay of the local and global, the individual and the social, in identity formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1475240911434339">Wenger, 1998</xref>). Thus, the teacher identities constructed by these IELTAs reflected their capacity to connect their present engagement in teaching practices and activities within local Hong Kong classrooms to broader teaching practices and activities beyond their immediate classrooms. However, this identity construction process also included the adamant rejection of certain other discourses of language education. In particular, IELTAs appeared to oppose what they believed to be the discourse of language teaching and learning experienced and taken up by some of their Hong Kong students. As a result, IELTAs’ teacher identity formation played out against the background of an oppositional structure between, on the one hand, their own endorsed views of language teachers and teaching and, on the other, the views of teaching and learning they attributed to some of their students. This oppositional structure suggests potential for the type of conflict and contestation between these different discourses of language teaching and learning that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1475240911434339">Wenger’s (1998)</xref> framework has been criticized for inadequately theorizing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1475240911434339">Barton and Tusting, 2005</xref>). The following section therefore explores the role of conflict and contestation in the IELTAs’ teacher identity construction from a poststructuralist perspective.</p>

<title>Identity conflict</title>
<p>The theory of discourse developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1475240911434339">Laclau and Mouffe (1985)</xref>, described above, suggests that IELTAs discursively constructed their teacher identities partly through chains of equivalence, in which signs are sorted and linked together (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1475240911434339">Jorgensen and Phillips, 2002</xref>). For instance, master signifiers or nodal points that IELTAs used in their identity formation included ‘real teacher’ (extract 1) and ‘good teacher’ (extract 2), which were filled with meaning by linking together signifiers in chains of equivalence. Thus, ‘real’ and ‘good’ teachers, which some equated to an ‘American approach’ (extract 4), were associated with classroom practices and activities that inspire students, develop classroom interaction, promote group work and engage students in classroom discussion (extracts 1–4). However, as a discourse is always constructed in terms of what it excludes, the IELTAs also deployed the nodal point ‘exam focused teacher’ (extract 9), which was equated to a ‘Hong Kong approach’ (extract 4) and contrasted with ‘real teacher’. This alternative nodal point was filled with meaning by linking together signifiers such as testing, memorization and the positioning of learners as passive and teacher dependent.</p>
<p>The relations between the identities ‘real teacher’ and ‘exam focused teacher’ appeared to be characterized by social antagonism, which occurs when ‘different identities mutually exclude each other’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1475240911434339">Jorgensen and Phillips, 2002</xref>: 47). As a result, it did not appear possible for an IELTA to be simultaneously a ‘real teacher’ and an ‘exam focused teacher’. The collision of these antagonistic identities was resolved through a hegemonic intervention, in which IELTAs attempted to limit scope for the negotiability of meaning in respect of language teaching and learning by suppressing the identity ‘exam focused teacher’ in favor of the alternative ‘real teacher’. While the IELTAs offered advice on how this intervention might be implemented in the face of student resistance (extract 10), the reaction of some students, which included not attending language classes, led some IELTAs to question themselves as teachers (extract 9), casting doubt on the totalizing effect of this intervention. Whether this intervention is successful or not, antagonistic relations with students are likely to threaten the capacity of IELTAs to effectively contribute to the university’s goals for internationalization. Therefore, the following section considers how this potential for ongoing identity conflict among the IELTAs might be overcome.</p>

<title>Overcoming antagonism</title>
<p>Within poststructuralist theory it is discourses, ‘frameworks for thought and action that groups of individuals draw upon in order to speak and interact with one another in meaningful ways’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1475240911434339">Miller Marsh, 2002</xref>), which constitute the social world. However, for poststructuralists, discourses represent a contingent, temporary fixation of meaning; one discourse alone can never fully structure the social (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1475240911434339">Jorgensen and Phillips, 2002</xref>). A poststructuralist approach reveals how individuals are positioned by contingent discourses, as a precursor to taking up alternative positions in relation to such discourses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1475240911434339">Davies, 1994</xref>: 26). In the case of IELTAs, the problematization of discourses that position them as either ‘real teachers’ or as ‘exam focused teachers’ is likely to be socially achieved, or as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1475240911434339">Burbules and Berk (1999</xref>: 61) argue, critical reflection is enabled ‘through our conversations with others, especially others not like us’.</p>
<p>To establish such conversations, one part of IELTAs’ induction program to the university could require them to carry out interviews with their students in Hong Kong, enquiring about their language learning history, their expectations of language teachers and of themselves as language learners, as well as their learning goals. A reciprocal process could be undertaken by students as part of their language course requirements, in which they interview IELTAs regarding their past learning and teaching experiences, their reasons for becoming an IELTA, and their goals as teachers in Hong Kong. IELTAs and students could then meet to discuss these jointly constructed texts, interrogating them to reveal how both groups are positioned as particular types of students or teachers by different discourses of teaching and learning. A similar construction of texts and critical conversations could occur between IELTAs and local instructors of both English language and content subjects within the institution. This could, for instance, include these different stakeholders observing each other’s lessons and engaging in post-lesson conferences, in which critical incidents could be discussed and examined with a view to revealing their positioning within different discourses of teaching.</p>
<p>This process could be of value to the IELTAs, their students and local teachers by allowing them to view language teaching and learning ‘through the eyes of the other’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1475240911434339">Spivak, 1990</xref>), alerting both to the constitutive effects of discourses. The goal here is not to impose a different discourse upon IELTAs, students or teachers, but rather to allow all groups to experience what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1475240911434339">Davies (1994</xref>: 3) terms a ‘multiplication of categories’ in which individuals come to see themselves not as positioned in one category or another but ‘in both categories and also in neither’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1475240911434339">Davies, 1994</xref>: 3). If such outcomes are to be realized, pre-departure preparation for IELTAs is crucial. For example, prior to their sojourn, IELTAs could be required to complete classes at their home institution dedicated to exploring identity, providing IELTAs with an understanding of its construction in discourse and in practice, as well as supplying them with the tools for discourse analysis they will need to interrogate the different texts they encounter and to challenge their positioning within different discourses.</p>

<title>Reconsidering the role of IELTAs in the internationalization of higher education</title>
<p>The results of this study suggest the need to problematize the role and contribution of IELTAs to the internationalization of higher education in Asia and other analogous educational settings by ‘turning a skeptical eye towards assumptions, ideas that have become ‘naturalized’, notions that are no longer questioned’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1475240911434339">Pennycook, 2004</xref>: 799). In particular, there is a necessity to challenge the apparent self positioning of some IELTAs as ‘custodians and arbiters not only of proper English but of proper pedagogy as well’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1475240911434339">Widdowson, 1993</xref>: 387). The importance of calling into question IELTAs as the privileged purveyors of ‘proper pedagogy’ is underscored by the potential threat such positioning poses to the internationalization agenda set out by the higher education institution in which this study took place. For example, one part of the stated goal of the institution in respect of IELTAs – as providers of international perspectives and international learning experiences throughout the campus – could potentially be threatened by the type of hegemonic intervention described in the previous section because it may render local pedagogies and practices of marginal relevance. Thus, one effect of the privileged positioning of IELTAs might be the denigration of local pedagogical cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1475240911434339">Canagarajah, 2008</xref>). An unintended bi-product of IELTAs’ role in internationalization may therefore be the marginalization of the teaching and learning identities of local instructors and students. It is unlikely that the boundaries and antagonistic relations such marginalization could create would be beneficial to promoting the type of cooperation and collaboration between IELTAs, local students, and other instructors that appears to underpin the internationalization goals of the institution.</p>
<p>Alerting IELTAs, local instructors and students in tertiary education institutions to the ways in which they are positioned by different discourses, thereby opening the possibilities for all stakeholders to take on multiple identity positions, could be one way of contesting such positioning. This project would therefore represent one example of the process <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1475240911434339">Morgan and Ramanathan (2005</xref>: 162) describe as ‘decolonizing’ the authority that Western interests enjoy in English-language teaching. Deconstructing these divisions can also be beneficial in empowering local teachers and students, underscoring their role in the internationalization of tertiary education throughout Asia and other parts of the world by validating modes of teaching and learning that they believe to be relevant to their local pedagogical contexts. This would allow local instructors and students greater say in negotiating the meaning of internationalization in terms of learning and teaching, providing them with opportunities to claim ownership of the meanings that matter to them within the context of their own institution. Validating the role of local pedagogies is crucial to safeguarding the agency of these stakeholders – an essential aspect of their identity formation – because it reifies their competencies, along with those of IELTAs, as important contributors to the internationalization of higher education institutions.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This article underscores the value of making problematic the identity positions that IELTAs take up, resist, and reject in understanding their contribution to the internationalization of tertiary education in Asia. As a qualitative study the findings of the research are necessarily limited by the small sample size and by the fact that data was gathered from a single institution. Therefore, similar contextualized investigations of the role of IELTAs in the internationalization of other analogous higher education settings are needed. This research could cast further light on the complexity of the IELTA’s role in the internationalization of universities by considering the voices of different stakeholders – students, faculty and university administrators – who all shape the identity formation processes of IELTAs. Such research, which considers data from multiple sources and perspectives, would enhance our understanding of how IELTAs can best contribute to the internationalization of tertiary education in Asia and other parts of the world.</p>
