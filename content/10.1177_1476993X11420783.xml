<p>This article is the third and final essay in a three-part series concerned with an analysis of current scholarship and anti-imperial rhetoric in the writings of the New Testament. The focus of this article is on the challenges and the inspiration of the book of Revelation. While Revelation may be considered to be the most unambiguous and blatant example of confrontation between the early Christians and the Roman Empire in the New Testament, a diversity of opinions survives as to how modern readers should understand and apply John’s apocalyptic literature. Does this book have something to say to readers today about the concepts of ‘empire’, colonialism and imperialism? We begin with a reflection on ancient interpretations of the text of Revelation, which are foundational to today’s interpretations, and lend support to the existence of anti-imperial rhetoric found in this cryptic document. Consideration is given to numerous current scholarly approaches, historical, theoretical and literary, with select examples from the book of Revelation for a greater understanding of the text.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In view of the ample historical background information concerning the Roman Empire in the first century <sc>ce</sc>, biblical scholars are becoming increasing aware of numerous passages in the New Testament that can be interpreted and understood as ‘anti-imperial rhetoric’. Specific language and imagery employed by the ancient authors demonstrate that the early writers found it necessary to address the threatening realities of life for Christian believers who lived in this controlling, powerful empire. This is the third and final article that presents current scholarship as it relates to ‘anti-imperial rhetoric’ and ‘anti-emperor’ positions in the New Testament writings. The purpose of this series is to consider how biblical scholarship today is tackling the interpretation and application of the New Testament texts in light of perceived anti-imperial rhetoric. The first article addressed anti-imperial rhetoric in the New Testament Gospels and the book of Acts. The second in the series reviewed scholarship which observed anti-imperial rhetoric and anti-emperor postures in the New Testament Epistles.</p>
<p>This third article will deliberate current scholarship on the book of Revelation (also known as the ‘Apocalypse of John’) as the literary climax of politically-charged rhetoric in the New Testament. Consideration will be given to numerous current scholarly approaches, historical, theoretical and literary, with select examples from the book of Revelation for a greater understanding of the text. We must also reflect on ancient approaches to the text of Revelation which set the foundations to today’s interpretations; the views of ancient interpreters lend support to the existence of anti-imperial rhetoric found in this cryptic document.</p>
<p>There are many preliminary questions that can ‘whet our appetite’ for an investigation into the book of Revelation: how are we to understand the obscure imagery and messages so important to the ancient author of Revelation? Did the historical situation of the recipients create a necessity for ‘hidden language’ and ‘codified messages’ for their political protection, as well as the protection of the author? Was the book formed as a conscious reaction to the Roman imperial authority and emperor-worship in the Asia Minor region? Within the imperial milieu, was Jesus Christ seen as an adversary to the reigning Roman emperor? The summation of this investigation is that Revelation is the premier example of anti-imperial rhetoric and anti-emperor worship in the New Testament, while it is an example of apocalyptic literature in its finest form. Yet, does current scholarship validate such a conclusion? Can readers today conclude that the cry of the author of Revelation, in response to the dominating government, appears to be ‘Jesus is Lord, not Caesar!’?</p>

<title>Scholarly Approaches to the Book of Revelation: Then and Now</title>
<sec id="section3-1476993X11420783">
<title>Historical Interpretations</title>
<p>In 42 <sc>bce</sc>, the Roman Senate officially recognized Julius Caesar as divine. After his death, the ruling authorities inaugurated the imperial cult, that is, the worship of an emperor, alive or dead, as a divine being, by the people in Rome and in all the outlying provinces.</p>
<p>It was under these circumstances that the book of Revelation was read and used by Christians in the Roman Empire from as early as the second century <sc>ce</sc>. The text provoked discussions from patristic writers such as Irenaeus, Tertullian and Cyprian. Interestingly, Jerome and Augustine used Revelation to ‘advance the practice of virginity’. Still others, such as Athanasius, used the text for ‘theological and doctrinal’ purposes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1476993X11420783">Weinrich 2005</xref>: xxix). It was these first Christian commentators who established a foundation of understanding the symbolism of Revelation and the Roman Empire. Early documents reveal how Christians interpreted passages such as chapters 17 and 18 as promises of the defeat of the Empire. The reference to the ‘harlot’ in chapter 17, for example, is a ‘clear reference’ to the city of Rome and the Roman government (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1476993X11420783">Weinrich 2005</xref>: 266):<disp-quote>
<p>Oecumenius wrote: Having completed its discourse about the consummation of the present age and what will happen at that time, the vision now reveals to the Evangelist what will befall Rome… He calls [Rome] a ‘harlot’ because she had fornicated, that is, apostatized from God… By ‘many waters’ he refers to the nations that [Rome] rules and govern, as he says later on. ‘With whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication’, it says… For these kings of the earth are those who participated in her fornication and the madness of her idolatry (<italic>Commentary on the Apocalypse</italic> 17.1-5; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1476993X11420783">Weinrich 2005</xref>: 266).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In addition, the concept of ‘Babylon’ as a representation of Rome began very early in the church:<disp-quote>
<p>Victorinus of Petovium wrote: Therefore, those things written concerning the trumpets and the bowls are either the devastation of the plagues sent to the world, or the madness of the antichrist himself, or the blasphemies of the people, or the variety of the plagues, or the hope for the kingdom of the saints, or the ruin of cities, or the ruin of Babylon, that is, the city of Rome (<italic>Commentary on the Apocalypse</italic> 8.1-2; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1476993X11420783">Weinrich 2005</xref>: 121).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Chapter 18 is a vivid picture of the fall of ‘Babylon the Great’, the subversive title for the city of Rome (18.2). The poetic image of the city is that of a place of arrogance, immorality, demonic activity, material wealth, love of money, violence, as well as ‘plagues, death, mourning, and famine’ (18.8). While this could be a portrayal of Rome itself, it could also represent the entire unrepentant Empire (‘the merchants of the earth’, 18.11). Feeling the judgment of God, the city would be ‘consumed by fire’, potentially a reminder of the devastating fire while Nero was Emperor (18.8) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1476993X11420783">Weinrich 2005</xref>: 293).</p>
<p>Further, the early commentators deemed the book to be written during a time of intense persecution of Christians by the imperial authorities. Again, Victorinus of Petovium asserted that 17.10 was a reference to five ‘fallen’ Emperors: ‘Titus, his brother and Vespasian, their father, also Otho, Vitellius and Galboa’. The remaining ‘one’ is Domitian, ‘in whose reign the Apocalypse was written’ (<italic>Commentary on the Apocalypse</italic> 17.2; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1476993X11420783">Weinrich 2005</xref>: 276). Oecumenius saw that it was quite appropriate that the author recognized ‘seven kings’ in 17.10, representing basically the same imperial domination as the seven ‘hills’ or ‘heads’ in 17.9. He says that ‘the kings exercise the fullness of Roman hegemony’. Only seven are mentioned because these are the emperors who were connected to the ‘beast’ or the ‘devil’. He names the seven emperors who ‘have caused it [the beast] to raise its head against the Christians by initiating persecutions against the church’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1476993X11420783">Weinrich 2005</xref>: 277). Of these seven kings, the cruelest was Nero. Repeatedly, the early commentators raise his name, who seems to be the model king of arrogance, wickedness, afflictions and persecution (ibid.).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1476993X11420783">
<title>History and Theory</title>
<p>From the outset of this series of articles, we have noted that there are two fundamental approaches to the interpretation of the New Testament texts as they relate to the Roman Empire. The first approach is basically historical; scholars have recognized a connection between real historical events and persons, and the same as portrayed in the biblical texts. The second approach is more theoretical, where events and people are understood and analyzed through a lens of theory and conjecture. Michael G. Smith composed a recent essay which concentrates on these approaches in detail. Smith argues that the concept of ‘empire’ has been perceived in these two contrasting ways: first as history, and second as theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1476993X11420783">2010</xref>: 305-22). While some scholars have treated the concept of ‘empire’ historically, others have studied it theoretically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1476993X11420783">2010</xref>: 305).</p>
<p>As an example, attempts to determine the author of the book and the date of the book have been foundationally historical. Most scholars believe Revelation was written at the end of the first century <sc>ce</sc>, placing it after the Roman devastation of Jerusalem in 70 <sc>ce</sc>. If this is true, this has enormous impact on discerning the message of the book. The Jewish Temple, its cult, and its privileges were gone. At such a time, ‘Jewish Christianity was caught in the crossfire of hostility from Jews, the official actions and policies of the Roman Empire and unofficial public hostility’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1476993X11420783">Westfall 2011</xref>: 251). The Jewish Christians were no longer a part of the Jewish community, and with the addition of Gentile Christians, the communities struggled in every way, politically, economically and socially. In short, regardless of who he was, the author of Revelation was writing to both Jewish and Gentile Christians who were living a life of ‘faith on the margins’ in a historical time and setting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1476993X11420783">Westfall 2011</xref>: 252).</p>
<p>Political oppression was a persistent key element in the concept of ‘empire’ in a historical analysis of nineteenth- and twentieth-century European colonialism (that is, the ‘domination by European powers over colonized countries’) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1476993X11420783">Smith 2010</xref>: 306). It is this concept of oppression that drives the theoretical model of ‘empire’. Smith writes that we cannot define the term ‘empire’ without implications of ‘imperialism’, social and cultural domination and the political sovereignty of one nation over and against another (or against other nations, as the case may be) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1476993X11420783">Smith 2010</xref>: 306). The theoretical model of ‘empire’ is ‘largely a form of post-Marxist thought’, and is a model of human beings (both the powerful and the powerless), without consideration given to any divine power, authority or influence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1476993X11420783">Smith 2010</xref>: 306-307). The more recent ‘post-modern’ concept of ‘empire’, then, is closely related to concepts of human liberation and resistance; it is also intertwined with the abilities of the ‘marginal people’ to raise themselves ‘out of the mire of oppression’. As a result, Smith suggests that, in our time, ‘empire’ is driven more by theory than by history. He concludes that, ‘“empire” is inherently evil, but for reasons that are assumed, not necessarily demonstrated. It stands in the way of ethnic and national self-determination’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1476993X11420783">2010</xref>: 312).</p>
<p>Leonard Thompson reviews historical Roman society, religions and language, especially as they relate to Revelation and to the Asia Minor region. He contends that the language and society of the Roman Empire ‘form the script and stage’ for the book of Revelation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1476993X11420783">1990</xref>: 171). In addition, Thompson observes how ‘magic and prophecy’ are brought into play in the book. The author ‘draws freely on the Nero legend’ that pledged danger to the Empire inhabitants.</p>
<p>In spite of the views of the very earliest commentators, Mark Bredin concludes that throughout the history of the Christian church, the book of Revelation has been, in the least, controversial. Bredin notes that ‘some believe that the Jesus of the Gospels is different from the Jesus of Revelation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1476993X11420783">2003</xref>: 34). The presentation of Jesus in Revelation appears to be a far cry from the Gospel Jesus who stressed love and forgiveness, while ‘Revelation looks to God to deal violently with the oppressors’. As a result, the responses to the book have been extreme, from a demand for human revolt, war and violence, to complete nonviolent submission by the suffering, dominated peoples. Bredin uses theories of violence, conflict theory and intertextuality to evaluate Revelation. His thesis is that the author of Revelation is a skilled author who ‘builds upon his tradition in the challenging setting of an all powerful Rome, and against those who reject or compromise Jesus within his own tradition’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1476993X11420783">2003</xref>: 221).</p>
<p>Thus, Bredin moves from a purely historical to a more theoretical view of Revelation. He argues that Revelation can be read in a way that ‘corresponds to Gandhian nonviolence’. While Revelation failed to inspire Gandhi (as well as many others), students of the New Testament writings should not ignore the subtleties, the language, the rhetoric, the symbolism of the document (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1476993X11420783">2003</xref>: 34). In his words:<disp-quote>
<p>The witness of Jesus and his followers through suffering and death can lead the heart of the violent away from the ignorance of their violence. This is atonement in the nonviolent sense. The witness of the nonviolent reveals the ordering principles of the cosmos: love and forgiveness. The witness then rejects those who reject the witness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1476993X11420783">Bredin 2003</xref>: 35).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>With respect to deriving historical and theoretical ‘meaning’ and significance from the text, Bruce Malina and John Pilch insist that ‘meanings realized through reading documents inevitably derive from a social system’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1476993X11420783">2000</xref>: 22). Their commentary on the book of Revelation indicates that the readers of today need ‘fresh insight’ into the ‘social system and astronomical lore’ that was communicated by the ancient author and comprehended by the original readers. In their view, the social-scientific approach to the text is paramount because of two reasons: first, meaning is, in fact, derived from social systems; second, methodological models tend to ‘operate at a level of abstraction somewhat above that of historical inquiry’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1476993X11420783">2000</xref>: 22-23). As an example, the authors observe that ‘all first-century Mediterranean persons lived in an honor-shame culture’; the readers would have understood positions of ‘patrons, brokers and clients’ as well as normally-accepted gender roles. Most important, the original audience would have been familiar with ‘kings, temples, priests and sacrifices’; everyone in the empire encountered the power of rulers and the presence of soldiers. The general population understood the roles of the elite and the non-elites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1476993X11420783">2000</xref>: 23). The entire culture would have known political interaction in the forms of ‘war, victory, loss, enslavement, and exile’. Hence, Malina and Pilch contend that ‘no dimension of the Book of Revelation stood outside these social realities’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1476993X11420783">2000</xref>: 23). Theirs is not a total literary and/or historical commentary; it is a ‘simplified social-scientific’ attempt at interpretation that is moving from the historical toward the conceptual and theoretical analysis of the text (ibid.).</p>
<p>Our first observation, then, is that for the most part, early biblical scholarship featured historical methods to examine how the book of Revelation fit into the ancient world-view of the Roman Empire. Yet historical data alone has proved to be inadequate to answer all of our questions with great certainty. A shift began to take place in the twentieth century, when the theoretical ideas over-shadowed the known historical data. In effect, attempts to answer the <italic>why</italic> (or theoretical) questions of the text were raised above more historical <italic>what</italic> questions. This does not mean that present scholarship ignores or disparages historical and cultural criticism; rather, it remains a necessary, basic building block for researching and interpreting the book of Revelation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1476993X11420783">
<title>Literary Approaches</title>
<p>A second observation has to do with the literary approach to the text; perhaps we can understand this to be a search for answers to the <italic>how</italic> questions. How do we interpret this complex document? If we contend that Revelation is, broadly, subversive anti-imperial rhetoric, it may still be difficult for modern readers to discern the broad brush-strokes (the ‘meaning’) of the literary text, since the detailed images are confusing and quite unfamiliar to our culture.</p>
<p>Previous scholarship has discovered two intertwining literary features in the book of Revelation: the Jewish and the Gentile. Initially, readers are made aware of the author’s use of the Old Testament; intentionally, the author has made use of Jewish allusions which would have been familiar to his Jewish Christian audience. In addition, the author has created word-pictures using Gentile (more specifically, Greco-Roman) imagery. The Gentile Christians would have been well acquainted with these metaphors and similes from their own culture. Literary techniques such as hyperbole (or, exaggeration) were recognizable to the Jews who knew it from the literature of the Old Testament (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1476993X11420783">Godawa 2009</xref>: 40-43), as well as to the Gentile readers who had witnessed Greco-Roman epideictic rhetorical speeches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1476993X11420783">deSilva 2009</xref>: 20). That is to say, while much of the symbolism and imagery of Revelation spoke volumes to the Jewish Christians whose history was rooted in Old Testament literature and imagery, the author used other images that were very effective for his Gentile readers. It appears to be a both/and situation. For example, in one of the most vivid scenes in Revelation, the divine ‘throne-room’ in Revelation 4–5, the author makes an effort to depict the power and the authority of God in imagery that would speak to both Jewish and Gentile Christians. For the original readers, the royal picture was a dramatic and ironic reminder of the human ‘throne-room’ of the Roman emperor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1476993X11420783">Aune 2006</xref>: 12). Thus, with a creativity that is difficult to match, the author of Revelation wove together the two cultures by using descriptions that would impact a broad spectrum of early Christians. While this tapestry of images would have been quite clear to first-century readers, it is not simple for the modern reader to untangle and to understand the ancient fabric of the author’s message.</p>
<p>By observing the enigmatic way in which Revelation was written, we can assume that there must have been one or more reasons why the ancient author wrote in the manner in which he did. By authorial intent, the document was composed in such a way as to speak clearly (and urgently) to one audience (the original Christian readers), while another audience would have a difficult time deciphering its meaning, even in the first century <sc>ce</sc>. Brian Godawa calls this ‘subversive language’:<disp-quote>
<p>The Bible is often image-oriented in its communication of truth. And rather than rejecting all non-Christian imagery as useless, the Bible redefines such imagery in a new context of the Christian world-view. It redeems culture through subversion, which is the radical reinterpretation or undermining of commonly understood images, words, concepts or narratives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1476993X11420783">2009</xref>: 115).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>By using such techniques, the ancient author could influence and affect his audience without risking the danger of being accused of treason in the Roman imperial context, or of putting his readers in danger of similar accusations should iniquitous readers encounter the document.</p>
<p>Because of its rich subversive language and imagery, Revelation is almost in a class all by itself with respect to the study of anti-imperial rhetoric in the New Testament. Cynthia Westfall contends that, unlike many of the epistles in the New Testament, the book of Revelation has been ‘central’ in the scholarly discussion of ‘empire’ and New Testament studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1476993X11420783">2011</xref>: 251). A variety of words and images can be understood by the readers as references to the Roman Empire and its domination. Revelation recounts conflicts with the Roman Empire at a number of the same points as the New Testament general epistles, ‘running the gamut of different facets of resistance’ by Christians in the midst of imperial domination. Westfall writes that the ‘gloves are off’, the conflict is wide open, and Revelation clashes with the formidable military power of Rome itself. It is ‘the New Testament document that is most critical of the empire’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1476993X11420783">2011</xref>: 251).</p>
<p>Literarily, Revelation is also a composite of three genres: epistle, prophetic and apocalyptic in its character. The first three chapters imply that it is a letter written to seven churches in Asia Minor (1.19–3.22). First, by using the epistle form, the author shows a personal interest in these Christian communities; and he is able to bring out the specific issues of concern in the churches. We see the author’s deep concern about the fears and anxiety of his readers, ‘including issues of poverty (2.8-9), materialism (3.17-18), attacks through slander, rejection, persecution, imprisonment and martyrdom (2.9b-10, 13), idolatry (2.14b, 20b), and sexual immorality’ (2.14a, 20-23). In many ways, the book of Revelation begins and ends in the same manner as other New Testament epistles, with traditional greetings, benedictions and thanksgivings. The author’s concern and interest in the welfare of his audience is not unlike the apprehension found in some of the Pauline letters, or the epistles of John. Aune notes that the closing remarks of Rev. 22.6-21 parallel the opening statements of 1.1-3. In fact, it appears that the author may have ‘self-consciously framed the entire composition with similar motifs’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1476993X11420783">1998b</xref>: 1205). Such literary intentionality implies that the author was very careful to write what he had to say in exactly the manner he wanted to say it.</p>
<p>Second, the prophecies that follow in the book are pertinent to the ‘circumstances, problems and needs’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1476993X11420783">Westfall 2011</xref>: 253) of these seven churches. The author addresses the circumstances by ‘barely veiled’ condemnation of the Empire and by predictions of its future demise (ibid.). Over all other competitors, the sovereignty of God and the reign of Jesus Christ are predicted as victorious. The use of numerous allusions from the Old Testament reveals the author’s expectations and assurance that the prophetic ‘Day of the Lord’ will appear; the human imperial power and oppression will end, not unlike the former empires of Babylon, Assyria and Greece (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1476993X11420783">Westfall 2011</xref>: 253).</p>
<p>Third, the apocalyptic nature of the book may be the most important, while it may also be the most misunderstood of the three genres. The apocalyptic nature is observed in the basic framework of the narrative, in the ‘concept of recapitulation, dualism, angelic messages, vivid imagery and extensive symbolism, including numerology’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1476993X11420783">Westfall 2011</xref>: 253). Apocalyptic literature had been well-received for about three hundred years before the time of the early Christian church. Earlier examples of this kind of literature include 2 Enoch, 4 Ezra and 2 Baruch, as well as parts of the canonical books of Ezekiel and Daniel. (For more information on the roots of apocalyptic writings, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1476993X11420783">Collins 2000</xref>: 40-45.) This type of writing was birthed out of ‘oppressive social, political and economic situations’, when people were looking for justice and reforms. The justice and mercy of God’s reign were placed over against the violence and persecution of human domination. Apocalyptic writings were political in nature, with highly symbolic images and coded messages that pointed to hope and liberation for those who understood the authors’ meanings. While some language was subversive, other writings were quite ‘transparent’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1476993X11420783">Westfall 2011</xref>: 253). It is not difficult to see that the ‘great prostitute’ of ‘Babylon’, sitting on ‘seven hills’ is a metaphor for Rome (17.5, 9) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1476993X11420783">Westfall 2011</xref>: 254; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1476993X11420783">Aune 1998b</xref>: 944-45). Further, the early readers of Revelation would have been familiar with the use of numerology. The highly-debated meaning of the number ‘666’ in 13.18 would probably have been understood as a reference to the Emperor Nero, perhaps suggesting that his atrocities were being repeated by the Emperor Domitian ‘so as to identify him as a type of Nero’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1476993X11420783">Westfall 2011</xref>: 254; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1476993X11420783">Aune 1998a</xref>: 770-73). Because of its overwhelming strength and power, any figurative or implied references to political, economic or military dominance would have been comprehended as references to Rome and the imperial government.</p>
<p>Thus, Westfall contends, the ‘clearest resistance’ to the Roman Empire in the New Testament is found in the literature of Revelation. The author addresses a spectrum of societal issues, many of which are also seen in the New Testament general epistles (i.e., James, Hebrews, 1 and 2 Peter). The visions in the book of Revelation boldly criticize patterns such as ‘idolatry, blasphemy, persecution, exploitation and materialism’, so rampant in the first-century Roman Empire. As a result of these conditions, the Roman imperialistic society was a strong opponent against the sovereignty of God and the reign of Christ. Westfall suggests that of utmost concern to the Revelation author was the Christian’s response to the tyrannical, human Empire, even to the point of ‘non-violent active resistance’. Typical of apocalyptic literature, the author intended to encourage his readers by assuring them of their value and position in the kingdom of God, and remind them that the victory has already been won by Christ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1476993X11420783">2011</xref>: 256).</p>
<p>As readers of today’s struggle to make sense out of the book of Revelation historically, theoretically and literarily, it is imperative that we give further consideration to the unusual literary genre of apocalyptic literature. While it may be strange to modern readers, this type of literature was as familiar to the first-century readers as the science-fiction genre is to readers in our time and culture.</p>

<title>Apocalyptic Literature</title>
<p>The foundations of current understandings of apocalyptic literature were outlined in John J. Collins’s book written in 1979 (<italic>Apocalypse: The Morphology of a Genre</italic>). His early book is very helpful to modern readers who have difficulties in interpreting apocalyptic literature. Human nature the way it is, it became more ‘in vogue’ to use the text of Revelation in an attempt to predict future (eschatological) events based on historical creatures and events found in the book (i.e., the time of the tribulation, the identity of the ‘antichrist’ and the millennium timeframe). By concentrating on historical events and actual creatures, modern readers can overlook key features of apocalyptic literature which clearly affect the way the text is interpreted.</p>
<p>Proceeding from her husband’s volume, in her 1984 book (<italic>Crisis and Catharsis: The Power of the Apocalypse</italic>), Adela Yarbro Collins features historical aspects of the Roman Empire, especially as they affected the Jews and the early Christians living in the Empire. Yet, Collins furthers our understanding of apocalyptic literature, relating how the author of Revelation uses this type of rhetoric with great power and effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1476993X11420783">1984</xref>: 141-74). One unique feature of her scholarship is the presentation of ‘the process of catharsis’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1476993X11420783">1984</xref>: 152). In other words, for the recipients of the book, Revelation functioned in a manner similar to Aristotle’s term of ‘catharsis’. As a medical term, ‘catharsis’ refers to the removal of a painful foreign matter from the body; such a removal is restorative to the person afflicted. Painful human emotions such as ‘fear’ can be alleviated in much the same way. ‘We pity others where under like circumstances we would fear for ourselves’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1476993X11420783">1984</xref>: 153). Thus, fear of the Roman imperial system is shared by the readers, and intensified by using various symbolic narratives and conflicts. The stories are described in such a way that the symbolism is understood to be typical of the readers’ (or hearers’) own predicaments. Collins uses the example of chapters 17 and 18, where ‘resentment of Roman wealth and power is evoked or intensified’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1476993X11420783">1984</xref>: 153). The book of Revelation, then, creates a ‘catharsis’ for its readers through the use of symbolic narrative and in the structure of the book as a whole. Human emotions such as anxiety and resentment are intensified through the repeated cycles of persecution and the final destruction of the audience’s enemies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1476993X11420783">1984</xref>: 154).</p>
<p>About the same time as Collins’s work, Elisabeth Schüssler Fiorenza composed <italic>The Book of Revelation: Justice and Judgment</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1476993X11420783">1985</xref>). In her publication, Schüssler Fiorenza deals with scholastic ‘apocalyptic research’, especially as it contrasts ‘popular’ interpretations of Revelation. She recognizes that Revelation is ‘seldom read and often relegated to a curiosity in the Bible’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1476993X11420783">1985</xref>: 1). There is hope that biblical scholarship has moved past a ‘popular’ reading of Revelation, to an understanding of the ‘eschatological teaching of the document in its historical context of Jewish apocalypticism’. She brings our attention to the characteristics of the apocalyptic genre of literature, observing that Revelation has been considered to be more Jewish in nature than Christian because of its Jewish form and theology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1476993X11420783">1985</xref>: 1). Certainly some of the imagery in the book is Greco-Roman in nature, but she contends that ‘the dominant tenor of its symbolic language is the cult of Israel’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1476993X11420783">1985</xref>: 197). In effect, John is using traditional Jewish cultic symbols, ‘not only to alienate his audience from pagan mysteries and the emperor cult, but also to project essential stability, collective coherence and eternal bliss in order to overcome their experienced alienation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1476993X11420783">1985</xref>: 197).</p>
<p>With Collins, Schüssler Fiorenza suggests that the positive images of a final salvific redemption of the faithful believers and a ‘heavenly world of God’ are used to intensify the readers’ emotions. These images moved the readers to make righteous decisions in their present, and to live accordingly in this life to prepare for the future to come. In the negative sense, these passages were intended to persuade the readers to turn away from erroneous loyalties and allegiances, particularly those given to the Roman imperial power. The symbols of Rome represent ‘degradation, ugliness, ultimate failure and defeat’. The ‘visionary rhetoric’ grants new, positive symbols of redemption and salvation in an attempt to ersuade the readers to choose to worship God, who is not ‘doomed to failure and destruction’. ‘The book of Revelation not only seeks to convince Christians that this is the right decision but also seeks to provoke them to stake their lives on it’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1476993X11420783">1985</xref>: 192).</p>
<p>By rhetorically weaving together recognizable Jewish and the Roman Empire imagery, the author uses a particular rhetorical tool (the apocalyptic genre of literature) to respond to the social-political and religious situations found in a particular area of Asia. Schüssler Fiorenza contends that the existing situation found in a society is the determining factor for the kind of rhetorical literature used by an author. She reminds us that a specific historical situation ‘calls forth a particular rhetorical response, and not vice versa’. In other words, the express urgency of the specific conditions of a society determines the type of discourse or rhetoric employed for the maximum amount of results to be achieved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1476993X11420783">1985</xref>: 192).</p>
<p>Schüssler Fiorenza goes on to demonstrate the strong influence of the Roman emperor (especially Domitian) in the seven cities of Asia Minor found in Revelation 1–3. Emperor Domitian demanded that the ruled people acclaim him as ‘Lord and God’ and participate in the worship of him as divine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1476993X11420783">1985</xref>: 193). Under these circumstances, Christian believers were bound to experience growing conflicts with the imperial cult, since the believers claimed that Jesus Christ was their ‘Lord and God’ in opposition to the reigning emperor. The first-century readers would be quite familiar with the aggravation and maltreatment of individual Christians by the Roman officials, ‘especially in light of Domitian’s totalitarianism’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1476993X11420783">1985</xref>: 194). The author of Revelation, like the Apostle Paul, stressed that what lies behind the idolatrous worship is the ‘demonic power of Satan’, the ultimate enemy even beyond the human rulers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1476993X11420783">1985</xref>: 196).</p>

<sec id="section7-1476993X11420783">
<title>Apocalypticism</title>
<p>After the publication of his extensive commentaries on Revelation, David Aune’s more recent volume, <italic>Apocalypticism, Prophecy and Magic in Early Christianity</italic> was published in 2006. Aune reflects some of the historical and cultural background of Revelation established by Collins and Schüssler Fiorenza, and he augments their initial literary views of the genre of apocalypticism. Following Schüssler Fiorenza, Aune outlines the form, content and function of apocalyptic literature. He further supports the view that apocalyptic literature is ‘protest literature’, reflecting the ‘perspective of an oppressed minority’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1476993X11420783">2006</xref>: 2-3). The ‘language of persecution pervades the Revelation of John’ and this feature supports the idea that it was written either during the Nero persecution (the late 60s <sc>ce</sc>) or during the Domitianic reign (late 90s <sc>ce</sc>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1476993X11420783">2006</xref>: 3). However, Aune observes that in the past three decades scholars and historians have asserted that the threats to the Christians in the Roman Empire were ‘not official’, or as widespread as the later maltreatment in the second and third centuries. In any case, Aune says the Christians in the first century ‘can be forgiven if they thought that the roof was about to fall in on them’; and the language of Revelation reflects this apprehension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1476993X11420783">2006</xref>: 3). Language and symbols, easily recognized by the early Christians, reminded the readers of persecutions in their past. The figure of the antichrist, for example, was ‘based in part on tyrants of the past, such as Antiochus Epiphanes, the Seleucid ruler who was responsible for the religious persecution of the Jews in the 160’s <sc>bce</sc>’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1476993X11420783">2006</xref>: 4).</p>
<p>Aune explains the use of eschatological language and ‘millennarianism’ (a theory derived from the ‘thousand year reign of Christ’ in Revelation 20). These concepts are formed from ‘collective religious behavior’ that was motivated by the conviction that the known present world is about to end, and that drastic steps must be taken by an ‘oppressed minority’ to prepare for some kind of final, ‘imminent catastrophe’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1476993X11420783">2006</xref>: 5). Aune notes that, ‘while prophecy sees the future as arising from the present, apocalyptic eschatology regards the future as breaking into the present’. Thus, humanity anticipates a ‘cataclysmic divine intervention into the human world’, ending history as it is presently known. Following such a divine intervention, an idyllic, ‘Edenic’ world of peaceful conditions is expected (ibid.). After surviving the Jewish exile in Babylon, we see that ‘millennarian movements in first-century Judaism were not uncommon’ (ibid.), primarily because of the oppressive conditions experienced by the dominated peoples. Aune suggests that the Qumran community was a prime example of ‘religious revolt’ or ‘millennarianism’, anticipating the arrival of the kingdom of God on earth in their community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1476993X11420783">2006</xref>: 5-6). Yet, he also notes that apocalyptic literature as a genre was not found among all the writings at Qumran (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1476993X11420783">2006</xref>: 6).</p>
<p>In short, over the last few decades, modern biblical scholarship has debated the origins of, the content of, and the purpose of apocalyptic literature in general. On the one hand, Aune writes that ‘the polyvalent symbolism of apocalypses’ has also been ‘perverted in support of destructive and pathological behavior’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1476993X11420783">2006</xref>: 6). From the Middle Ages to the time of the Branch Davidian sect in Waco, Texas, in 1993, biblical apocalyptic images and symbols have been abused and misunderstood. Some authors and historians have created what Aune calls ‘apocalyptic fiction’, mishandling biblical imagery to support their own ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1476993X11420783">2006</xref>: 11). On the other hand, canonical apocalyptic literature such as the books of Daniel and Revelation has contributed positive messages to the modern church. While the first three chapters of Revelation provide profound guidance and assurance for Christians today, the rest of the book has been avoided by lay readers and preachers alike because of fear, misunderstandings and misinterpretation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1476993X11420783">2006</xref>: 12).</p>

<sec id="section8-1476993X11420783">
<title>Greco-Roman Magic</title>
<p>In addition to David Aune, two other authors comment on the use of magic in Revelation. Rodney Lawrence Thomas composed <italic>Magical Motifs in the Book of Revelation</italic>, where he responds to Aune’s opinions concerning magic in the ancient world. While Aune suggests that John created Revelation ‘as some form of “anti-magical polemic”’, Thomas contends that perhaps that is ‘taking the argument too far’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1476993X11420783">Aune 2006</xref>: 349-50, 381-82; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1476993X11420783">Thomas 2010</xref>: 194, 200). Thomas observes that use of magical terms and motifs in Revelation implies that John’s relationship with magic is very complex. That is, John ‘condemns’ some magical practices and those people who engage in the practice of magical arts (see Rev. 18.23). Today’s reader should not find such a condemnation to be ‘surprising’. Yet, we find that John can express, or even promote, a number of themes and traditions ‘that could easily be construed and interpreted against a formative magical background’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1476993X11420783">Thomas 2010</xref>: 194-95). The book of Revelation, for example, ‘uses the term <italic>pharmakeia</italic> [translated loosely as ‘magical practices’] more than any other book in the New Testament’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1476993X11420783">2010</xref>: 195). Thus, it appears that John saw grave danger in sorcery, as well as other procedures and practices that are associated with this terminology, including ‘incantations, name magic and amulets and reliance on spiritual sources other than God or Jesus Christ’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1476993X11420783">2010</xref>: 195). Leonard Thompson agrees that, while John may refer to magical elements in his visions, he generally regards magicians and their power with disdain; they will be among those who will be ‘thrown into the lake of fire’ (21.8) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1476993X11420783">1990</xref>: 184).</p>
<p>Thompson suggests that the author ‘is a Christian prophet who proclaims specifically revealed information’ borrowing liberally from other sources to picture his own revelation from God (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1476993X11420783">1990</xref>: 184). Thompson also observes that John uses language, motifs and traditions that could be associated with ancient magical practices without condemnation. As an example, both Aune and Thompson contend that John’s use of the ‘key’ imagery in Revelation 20 is ‘associated with a prominent and influential goddess in antiquity’ that was a ‘competitor’ to Christ. In Revelation 20.1, we read of a heavenly angel who welds a ‘key to the abyss and holds a great chain’. Thompson (with Thomas) relates that Hecate was a goddess whose image appeared on gates and doorways of public buildings. She was to have had ‘power over the dead’, yet such a right was reserved for only Christ in the Christian communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1476993X11420783">Thompson 1990</xref>: 184; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1476993X11420783">Thomas 2010</xref>: 196). Therefore, the picture in 20.1 is one of the capture and imprisonment of ‘the devil, or Satan’. Thomas writes that ‘even Beale, who is opposed to Aune’s contention that the Apocalypse is an anti-magical polemic, concedes the weightiness of the evidence put forward by Aune with regard to Hecate’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1476993X11420783">2010</xref>: 196-97; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1476993X11420783">Beale 1999</xref>). Further, Thompson sees other sources behind the text of Revelation, including ‘vowel chants from magical papyri’, and suggested ‘procedures for summoning a god for divination’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1476993X11420783">1990</xref>: 184).</p>
<p>A further example of the mixture of magic and prophecy is the use of plagues in Revelation 16 that parallel the Old Testament plagues in Egypt. In particular, the ‘frogs’ of Rev. 16.13-14 are an interesting image that may or may not be associated with magical practices. Since frogs were considered ‘unclean’ creatures by Jews, John’s reference to the image of frogs in this passage reminds his readers of the ancient magicians in Pharaoh’s court; John writes, ‘they are spirits of demons performing miraculous signs’ (16.14). Thomas writes that the image implies more than just human enemies of God’s people; these enemies had capabilities beyond the common human being, perhaps that of demonic powers. Such powers were being used against the movement of the early Christian church (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1476993X11420783">2010</xref>: 197). Common knowledge and customs, then, mask the lies of the ‘primordial Liar himself’ and only the word of God through John’s visions can lead the readers to ‘true knowledge’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1476993X11420783">Thompson 1990</xref>: 184-85).</p>
<p>Thus, John’s creative use of reversals, irony, imagery, common magical practices and language go beyond the normally accepted order, twisting and defying categories and constructs that had brought stability and harmony to Roman society. The author of Revelation not only subverts ordinary language and customs, but he gives them an ‘alternative order’, or significance. His letter to the people in Asia Minor is in direct opposition to the public, accepted knowledge of Roman institutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1476993X11420783">Thompson 1990</xref>: 185).</p>

<sec id="section9-1476993X11420783">
<title>Rhetorical-Critical Approach</title>
<p>David A. deSilva composed his investigation featuring the rhetorical-critical approach to John’s Revelation. He begins by defining classical rhetorical forms for his readers and then applies such analysis to the biblical text. deSilva is careful to acknowledge that various features of classical rhetorical literature ‘are simply inapplicable to Revelation’, so the biblical text does not always conform to the strict features of rhetorical theory as expressed in ancient ‘handbooks’ of rhetoric (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1476993X11420783">2009</xref>: 18). Whether or not the author of Revelation is the same as the author of the Fourth Gospel, in his own peculiar way, John arranges material, includes and omits material as he so desired, disregarding familiar literary rules and limitations. However, deSilva recognizes that John’s goals were to persuade his listeners, influence the values they maintained, promote certain courses of action, and ‘incite a verdict of innocence or guilt’ on the societal situation of his readers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1476993X11420783">2009</xref>: 18). A rhetorical function and purpose of the document, then, is most probable. Thus, a cautious rhetorical analysis of the text is an attempt to reveal the heuristic, ‘persuasive strategies’ intended by the author, by comparing John’s text to ‘near-contemporary works on the art of persuasion’. In this way, the author’s ‘ideological practices and persuasive goals are achieved’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1476993X11420783">2009</xref>: 18; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1476993X11420783">Schüssler Fiorenza 1991</xref>: 22). While he does not intend to force comparisons between Revelation and ancient rhetorical writings, deSilva does use the identifiable rhetorical devices to aid in our understanding of John’s objectives: ‘Revelation attends to the principal tasks in the art of persuasion’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1476993X11420783">2009</xref>: 18).</p>
<p>To preface the theories of rhetoric, deSilva reviews the historical setting behind the writing of the book of Revelation. He notes that at the end of the first century, ‘thirty-five cities in Asia Minor held the honorific title of “temple warden” (<italic>neokoros</italic>) of an imperial cult site’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1476993X11420783">2009</xref>: 41). More specifically, all seven cities mentioned in Revelation 1–3 had cultic sites: six (with the exception of Thyatira) had imperial temples; five (except Philadelphia and Laodicea) had imperial altars and priests. Pergamum was the first in the province to acclaim honor to Augustus Caesar (with a temple in Rome) and became a center for the imperial cult. The city’s most notable building was ‘the great altar of Zeus’, located on a mountain overlooking the city, with the appearance of a great throne. Ephesus was also a center of emperor-cult activity, building a ‘new, colossal’ Flavian temple and statue, honoring the Emperor Domitian, near the ‘older’ temple to Rome and Julius Caesar. Moreover, the imperial cult was more than stones and statues. The cult involved numerous priests and common people who followed a ‘calendar of celebrations’ and followed a way of life that brought honor to the reigning human emperor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1476993X11420783">deSilva 2009</xref>: 42-43). The clear authority of Rome was demonstrated through ancient literature, engravings, cultic practices and coinage. Obviously, the Christian manner of worship and way of life were in direct opposition to such cultic activities.</p>
<p>The original readers would have quickly recognized the economic picture of the Roman Empire in Revelation 17–18. In these chapters, the wealth and luxury of the elite class in Rome become a target of John’s criticism. In a similar manner, John alludes to the images in Daniel concerning world empires (see Dan. 7.3-7), and the worship by the ‘inhabitants of the earth’ in a way that resembles the worship of the emperor in Rome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1476993X11420783">deSilva 2009</xref>: 39). In addition, deSilva notes the powerful, vivid images in Revelation that ‘dominate’ the narrative: the ‘dragon’, the ‘beast of the sea’ and the ‘beast of the earth’. Moreover, the image of ‘Babylon the Great’ takes the form of a ‘luxuriating harlot’, which is a dramatic picture of the ‘urban seat of the world empire’ (Rome). While modern scholars have debated the identity of these images for centuries, deSilva agreeably states that the first-century readers would have had no problem in recognizing their identities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1476993X11420783">2009</xref>: 37). With other scholars, deSilva validates the theory that John selects particular images ‘for special examination through his apocalyptic lens’:<disp-quote>
<p>We need to enter into those interpretive, subversive visions with a clear sense of what Rome, her emperors and their cult represented for people living in and around the province of Asia Minor and in what ways these realities were represented to them by voices other than John’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1476993X11420783">2009</xref>: 39).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In summary, it is Roman imperialism, deSilva suggests, ‘with its seductive economy and blasphemous imperial cult’, that is the main challenge John identifies in chapters 4–22 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1476993X11420783">2009</xref>: 48). Through his persuasive rhetoric, the author of Revelation presents heuristic practices and attitudes that he urges his fellow Christians to follow. He focuses on malevolent conditions within the Empire that ‘weighed heavily on the minds of many Christians’. The author’s intentions, then, were to modify their thoughts and behaviors from their previous lives to a life committed to the God of Israel and his Messiah ‘and John had no illusions about the consequences of his preferred course of action’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1476993X11420783">2009</xref>: 55).</p>

<title>Imperial Cult</title>
<p>If the consensus of commentaries and other New Testament studies is that the book of Revelation is foundationally concerned with the Roman imperial cult, then Steven Friesen asks, ‘if this is so, why has most of the evidence for imperial cults been ignored for so long?’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1476993X11420783">2001</xref>: 3). Friesen agrees that John’s ancient audience would have felt the pressure of political, economic and social persecution including the threats surrounding widespread emperor-worship. He relates that ‘throughout the last century, nearly all commentators on the Revelation of John have acknowledged that imperial cults—that is, institutions for the worship of the Roman Emperors—played a crucial role in the production of John’s text’ (ibid.). Nevertheless, he suggests that one reason this evidence is often neglected is because it is difficult to merge historical evidence (like archeology) and biblical studies. New historical data can be received with suspicion based on skeptical ‘method and theory’. A second reason may have to do with our understanding of ‘imperialism’ itself. Friesen questions,<disp-quote>
<p>if the central figure of the Christian faith was executed on a sedition charge by the occupying forces of the Roman Empire, and if the early churches took root and grew in an imperialist setting, then why is there so little theorizing in biblical studies about empire and religion? (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1476993X11420783">2001</xref>: 214)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Friesen presents a study of the comparisons between the imperial cults and Revelation through his investigations of timely ‘literature, inscriptions, coins, sculpture and architecture’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1476993X11420783">2001</xref>: 3). He approaches his study from both the historical and theoretical aspects, trying to analyze the ancient historical evidence with respect to theoretically ‘inappropriate boundaries’ and without the limitations of ‘religious’ or ‘political’ ideology. Modern interpretations of emperor-worship, for example, can place the ideology into a category of ‘insincere religion, or mystified politics, or both’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1476993X11420783">2001</xref>: 4).</p>
<p>Historically, Friesen observes that the worship of political leaders is not an unusual phenomenon. It has been practiced at many times in many regions of the world. Modern readers tend to use more of a ‘parochial definition of religion’, based on the recent history of Europe and North America; in this context, the political realm and the realm of religion are separate and distinct spheres of activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1476993X11420783">2001</xref>: 5). Hence, the concept of worshipping a human political leader is quite foreign to our way of thinking. Biblical readers must intentionally consider the ‘imperial cult in the text’, observing the direct and indirect references to the imperial cult. These appear to be most obvious in the last half of the book, chapters 13–19. In these chapters we find various references to episodes and occasions that occurred within the commonly recognized imperial cult institutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1476993X11420783">2001</xref>: 150).</p>
<p>Further, in these chapters (13–19) the Roman imperial power is presented as ‘demonic’, and the people are deceived or pressured into worshipping a human emperor. Emperor-worship is portrayed as a deception, and a blasphemous lie, and the cult becomes a key aspect in the imperial domination and exploitation of the empire inhabitants. As a response to this ‘demonic power’, John does not offer an <italic>escape</italic> from the political, economic and social maltreatment of his day. Instead, Revelation is offered as a ‘symbolic universe’ (an eschatological future) that gives permission for the Christian believers to resist the opposing, prevailing representations of the imperial society. In contrast to the imperial cult, the author demonstrates that true worship is the worship of ‘the Lamb’ (ibid.).</p>
<p>With deSilva, Friesen understands that the use of symbolism is used ‘for rhetorical reasons’. As other ancient writers, John urges his readers to be faithful ‘while they awaited God’s intervention’ in their difficult situation. However, John defines this ‘faithfulness’ in the face of oppression in a different manner than the apocalyptic writers before him. For Friesen, the concept of faithfulness involves a ‘stronger emphasis on withdrawal and separation’ in Revelation. It is evident to the original readers that ‘the lines between God’s people and the rest of the world are drawn more clearly, the opponents are chastised more thoroughly, and the final destruction of evil is more central’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1476993X11420783">2001</xref>: 140). Ultimately, Revelation can be understood as a ‘rhetorical product of the urgent’ because the author keenly felt the limitations the Empire placed upon him.</p>
<p>Friesen also determines that the author of Revelation was less concerned about the ‘kings of the earth’ than he was about two other vital issues: who is ‘king’ and what is the ‘kingdom’? The first question is a matter of ‘who would be worshipped as the king of kings’. ‘The heart of the conflict’ in Revelation is the proper worship of the proper ‘king’. This is illustrated by his chief symbol of the ‘royal throne-room’ in chapters 4–5. John claims that proper worship is to be submitted to them alone (God and Jesus Christ, pictured as ‘the Lamb’) and not to a human emperor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1476993X11420783">2001</xref>: 209). This leads to the other issue which is ‘the kingdom of God and of his Christ’. God’s ‘kingdom’ encompasses all the Christian churches, all the people who commit fully to the proper ‘king’, Jesus. In ways similar to the Roman Empire, the people of God’s kingdom ‘transcend national, ethnic and linguistic borders’; however, unlike the Empire, the followers of Christ were representatives and servants of God who owed allegiance to no other human leaders. The high standards of this God-kingdom did not leave any room for compromise or concessions with a human imperial society. As a result, the chance for ‘survival under the Roman authority’ was almost ‘impossible’; and this, exactly, ‘was John’s point’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1476993X11420783">2001</xref>: 209).</p>

<title>A Misogynist Text?</title>
<p>Undoubtedly, public opinion and culture were heavily influenced by Roman imperial cult activities. History relates that the Empire was a male-dominated world, and the book of Revelation has been regarded as patriarchal in nature. On the one hand, John’s use of patriarchal symbols has been sharply censured by female scholars. Schüssler Fiorenza carefully views the use of females in the book of Revelation. First, she observes another both/and situation; the author used female symbols for both ‘the oppressive’ (in a negative sense) and the ‘eschatologically redemptive communities’ (in a positive sense). Second, Revelation uses symbols of idolatry from the prophetic and cultic language of Israel, such as ‘whore’ or the ‘defilement with women’ (chapter 17). It is possible, therefore, for modern interpreters to perceive the message of Revelation as degrading to women in general, or at least unjust and prejudicial, unless it is ‘translated’ into a more ‘fitting’ context and rhetorical situation which demands a more appropriate ‘rhetorical response’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1476993X11420783">1985</xref>: 199).</p>
<p>Tina Pippin argues that Revelation is a misogynist text where images of women are used in direct opposition to godly righteousness. Pippin interprets 21.3 as indicating that in the future eschatological city (the ‘new Jerusalem’), only men will dwell with God and be ‘his people’. In 14.4 the ‘righteous faithful’ are described as ‘pure’ men who have not ‘defiled’ themselves with women. Four female figures become images of ‘male control’: the condemned ‘Jezebel’ (2.20-23), the ‘Woman Clothed in the Sun’ who gives birth to a male son (12.1, 5), the ‘Great Whore’ of chapter 17, and the ‘Bride of the Lamb’ who is ‘completely submissive and silent’ (21.9) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1476993X11420783">Pippin 1992a</xref>: 194-96; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1476993X11420783">Friesen 2001</xref>: 186). Thus, Pippin determines that Revelation may be considered,<disp-quote>
<p>a fantasy of male power, where women’s voices and values are suppressed and where female images are subjected to horrendous treatment. Political domination is subverted, but male domination remains in tact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1476993X11420783">Pippin 1992a</xref>: 57-86, 103-105; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1476993X11420783">Friesen 2001</xref>: 186).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In agreement, Catherine Keller contends that John used the language of ‘power and conquest’ which are ‘pitted’ against female forms. The reader cannot miss the thin ‘veil’ of ‘misogyny’ in the metaphors. Hence, with Schüssler Fiorenza, ‘this is the one book of the NT that is dedicated to justice’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1476993X11420783">Keller 1996</xref>: 46; see pp. 36-83; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1476993X11420783">Friesen 2001</xref>: 186).</p>
<p>On the other hand, Friesen suggests that these readings of Revelation are ‘based on inadequate treatment of the text’s symbolism’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1476993X11420783">Friesen 2001</xref>: 186). He remains unconvinced of intentional gender commentary and outlines four aspects of the text that confront the misogyny debate. One important aspect is the ‘shifting symbolism’ that often occurs in John’s book. Repeated symbolic images can change in their referents, and we as readers can simply misinterpret their meanings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1476993X11420783">2001</xref>: 187). It may appear that the author demands that women readers choose between two stereotypes, the evil (‘the whore’) or the good (‘the bride’); yet, that is not the intent of the symbolism (ibid.). Friesen contends that within the context of the complete visionary narrative, one single image such as the ‘Great Whore of Babylon’ should not be reduced to a ‘secret message’ that speaks about gender. It is only one part of a series of symbols that cannot be diminished into a single ‘gender code’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1476993X11420783">2001</xref>: 186). Further, in the case of the woman ‘Jezebel’, it must be noted that she ‘<italic>calls herself</italic> a prophetess’ (2.20, Friesen’s emphasis); thus, John is not vilifying women or the prophet status. Similar language (‘who claim to be apostles but are not…’) is used of the male ‘false apostles’ in 2.2. Ironically, this ‘Jezebel’ reference in chapter 2 ‘confirms the role of women prophets in the congregations in Asia’, while it also confirms the status of the author John as a legitimate prophet (22.18) (ibid.).</p>
<p>For Friesen, then, the selected symbolism that represents wickedness in Revelation is not a comment on gender by the author; rather, the images must be put into the broader context of the book, where they are not individually, randomly chosen and isolated from other themes and pictures. This debate is a good illustration of some scholars treating the book of Revelation historically, while others have interpreted it more theoretically.</p>

<sec id="section12-1476993X11420783">
<title>Postcolonialism and Revelation</title>
<p>Another approach, postcolonialism, is a relatively new methodology for interpreting the writings of the New Testament. Stephen D. Moore attempts to provide modern readers with a distinction between ‘postcolonial’ studies and ‘empire’ studies, though he admits that the distinction is a ‘porous’ one (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1476993X11420783">2006</xref>: 19, 124). More difficult yet is to determine the differences between postcolonial studies, empire studies, liberation, and contextual hermeneutics. Many works in these latter two areas overlap with the former two categories, so it is not simple to place significant research into one or another rigid category.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Moore relates that Revelation should be analyzed as an ‘empire’ document. Even from very early times (as we have seen above), critical scholarship has viewed Revelation ‘as the most uncompromising attack on the Roman Empire, and on Christian collusion with the empire’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1476993X11420783">Moore 2007</xref>: 436). If readers interpret the text from a historical-critical approach, historical deeds and consequences of the Roman Empire are at the center of their understanding of Revelation (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1476993X11420783">Thompson 1990</xref>; or <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1476993X11420783">Howard-Brook and Gwyther 1999</xref>). Moore contends that the historical-critical approaches are ideal for reading the book as a ‘critique of contemporary culture’, while more theoretical readings move the reader toward concepts such as liberation hermeneutics (including scholars such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1476993X11420783">Boesak 1997</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1476993X11420783">Richard 1995</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1476993X11420783">2007</xref>: 436). Yet, Moore determines that ‘none of the aforementioned works engage with, or even allude to, postcolonial theory or criticism as they situate Revelation in relation to empire’. Other scholars, Moore claims, have at least ‘one foot in this space’, including <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1476993X11420783">Friesen 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1476993X11420783">Frilingos 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1476993X11420783">Westhelle 2005</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1476993X11420783">Keller 1996</xref> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1476993X11420783">Moore 2007</xref>: 436; see bibliography for noted works). Hence, while we may note a consistent movement in scholarship from history to theory, a methodology like postcolonialism depends on both the historical and the theoretical approaches.</p>
<p>While the ideology of colonialism is relevant to the book of Revelation, Moore contends that the ideology is better regarded as imperialism:<disp-quote>
<p>Imperialism denotes the multifarious, mutually constitutive ideologies (political, economic, racial/ethnic, religious) that impel a metropolitan centre to annex more-or-less distant territories and that determine its subsequent dealings with them. Imperialistic activities are the conduct of war and the enlargement of empire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1476993X11420783">2007</xref>: 437, 451).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>By this definition, Revelation appears to be an ‘anti-imperial(istic)’ document, as it proclaims the spread of worldwide authority (or <italic>imperium</italic>) from the Roman emperor to the ‘heavenly Emperor and his Son, the co-regent’ (see 19.16).</p>
<p>Further, in describing his view of ‘empire’, Moore asserts that what we have in the book of Revelation is ‘imperialistic dualism’. This is described in his words:<disp-quote>
<p>In its concern to maintain intact the binary partition separating imperial metropolis and Christian periphery, Revelation, though passionately resistant to Roman imperial ideology, paradoxically and persistently reinscribes its terms, to the extent that Roman imperial ideology (like subsequent European imperial ideology) can itself be said to have pivoted around an integrated series of dualistic distinctions between metropolis and periphery, civilized and barbaric, and so on (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1476993X11420783">Moore 2007</xref>: 451).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Yet, with Thompson, Moore contends that Revelation maintains this ‘binarism’ for the purpose of upsetting the ‘recognized order’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1476993X11420783">2007</xref>: 451; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1476993X11420783">Thompson 1990</xref>: 185). There is a ‘spectacular reversal’ created by the author—a reversal of power between the ‘elites and the non-elites’, and between Rome and Christianity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1476993X11420783">2007</xref>: 451). The strict divisions of power and authority (or the ‘binary separation’) becomes less distinctive because of the ‘elaborate mimicry’ established by the author. That is, John creates an ‘other empire’ of God and of the Lamb, which ‘blurs the boundaries between the two empires until it becomes all but impossible to decide where one leaves off and the other begins’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1476993X11420783">2007</xref>: 451). Moore declares that remarkably, ‘the divine empire that Revelation proclaims is anything but independent from the Roman Empire. Instead, it is parasitic on it’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1476993X11420783">2007</xref>: 451).</p>
<p>In addition, Moore presents the postcolonial concept of ‘hegemony’, which is ‘domination by consent’; thus, it is the active participation of a dominated group or a colonized people (even a socially lower class) in their own subjugation. In Moore’s opinion, hegemony was the reasonable situation in Asia Minor at the time of the writing of Revelation. The people of the area were not colonized by Rome by force, but by ‘invitation’. As we have already seen, the principal cities of Ephesus, Pergamum and Smyrna, for example, voluntarily competed for rank and reputation and imperial favor. Honors and loyalties were measured against that of the neighboring city, and the main vehicle for the demonstration of devotion was through the imperial cult, or the temples of worship of Roman emperors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1476993X11420783">2007</xref>: 439). However, John asserts that there is only one authority in the world that is worthy of human devotion and service, and it is not the Roman imperial authorities. This strong belief moved his work beyond first-century society and turned it into a concept about the ‘relationship between deity and hegemony’. For this reason, Friesen agrees that John’s text was ‘not simply anti-Roman; it was anti-empire’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1476993X11420783">2001</xref>: 213-14).</p>
<p>With these features of postcolonial studies in mind, it is not difficult to see how and why scholarship tends to place the ancient text of Revelation among those texts that we now consider to be empire or postcolonial studies, liberation or contextual writings. To summarize its place in such literature, Moore writes that,<disp-quote>
<p>more than any other early Christian text (prior to Tertullian, at any rate), Revelation epitomizes the theo-imperialist orientation that enabled the Roman state effortlessly to absorb Christianity into itself, to turn Christianity into a version of itself, to turn itself into a version of Christianity—notwithstanding the fact that Revelation is also ostensibly more hostile to Rome than any other early Christian text (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1476993X11420783">2007</xref>: 451).</p>

<title>Revelation: Now and Yet to Come</title>
<p>Postcolonial interpretations of Revelation have drawn parallels between the experiences of modern-day colonized people and the experiences of the varied subjugated people groups in the Roman Empire. Liberation theologians have challenged the use of selected parts of the New Testament that are used to support modern repressive empires or ruling governments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1476993X11420783">Porter and Westfall 2011</xref>: 2). Further, Malina and Pilch argue that students of the book of Revelation must be aware of ‘re-contextualization’, which is the implied multiple ways different readers understand a document as a result of reading it in varied social contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1476993X11420783">2000</xref>: 21). On the reverse, the ‘de-contextualized’ meaning is to read a document ‘ahistorically’, for merely aesthetic or literary purposes. By reading a ‘re-contextualized’ Revelation we may understand the text as a communication to the first-century Christian believers in Asia Minor, both Jewish and Gentile people living in the Roman Empire, who were very different from us. Yet, on another level, modern readers must also grant meaning to the text in view of the diverse Christian communities in this century, whatever their dominant social system may be (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1476993X11420783">Malina and Pilch 2000</xref>: 22).</p>
<p>Schüssler Fiorenza challenges modern audiences with the key question, ‘what will Revelation do to us if we surrender our imagination to its dramatic action?’ She writes that ‘a theological interpretation of the New Testament has to assess the impact of John’s world of vision and dramatic symbolic action on the contemporary reader and audience’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1476993X11420783">1985</xref>: 198). For example, Schüssler Fiorenza notes that in our day, we do not try to convince Christians to show ‘persistent resistance and loyal faithfulness unto death’ in modern societies that do not persecute religious differences. Yet, there are still those modern readers who can discover in the text some justification for ‘prejudice and injustice’ in contemporary society. The message of Revelation must be ‘translated’ into our literal contemporary situations properly where it can be used to move humanity to a more appropriate rhetorical response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1476993X11420783">1985</xref>: 199).</p>
<p>A contrast to the postmodern view is offered by Gordon Heath in his contribution to a recent volume entitled <italic>Empire in the New Testament</italic>. As an historian, interested in imperialism and Christianity, Heath delves into the early Church Fathers’ attitudes about the Roman Empire. By looking at these texts, Heath leads us back to the ancient writings that can affect what we think about empire, and specifically how the Roman Empire affected early Christianity. The ancient writers make worthy claims about Christianity and the Roman Empire that are often neglected in current research.</p>
<p>The Church Fathers, Heath demonstrates, were both supportive of the Empire and were critical of it. Historically, ‘there was an element of criticism of Rome in early Christian literature, but that the criticism did not include an outright rejection of the benefits of Roman rule’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1476993X11420783">2011</xref>: 262). From this ancient literature, we see not only a degree of sympathy for the imperial government (see Romans 13, for example), but the nature of the later Christian communities in the empire after the Emperor Constantine was ‘not a radical departure’ from those that existed before his confirmation of the Christian movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1476993X11420783">Porter and Westfall 2011</xref>: 16). The greatest resistance to the Empire was the repudiation of the Christians to yield to the demands of the Empire in regards to idolatry. That is, the worst persecution was the result of the Christians refusing to submit to emperor-worship. Polycarp, the Bishop of Smyrna, is a good example of the faithful believers who would not declare that ‘Caesar is Lord’. The writings of the New Testament made it very clear that a person had to make a choice; the imperial authority’s demand for ultimate loyalty was rebuked by Christian believers. Therefore, the New Testament writers were ‘successful in inculcating convictions that would lead to the martyrdoms of the second, third and fourth centuries’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1476993X11420783">Heath 2011</xref>: 274-75).</p>
<p>Heath writes that he is ‘concerned’ about the theories of postmodernism because they are not always consistent with the intentions of the ancient authors. While it seems rather lucid that John had the Roman Empire in mind when he penned Revelation, other New Testament authors and their intentions are not so clear. It is quite possible that specific theories related to imperialism, empire and the New Testament are predicated on the assumption that the New Testament writers were all ‘anti-empire’; and that their anti-empire reactions appear to be comparable to late twentieth-century anti-imperial sentiments. It is conceivable that a reader of today could take the ideologies of the present opposition to imperialism, convey them back nineteen centuries, and apply them to a completely different kind of people, different period of time and problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1476993X11420783">2011</xref>: 277). Heath confronts modern readers of Revelation with a thoughtful point: we assume that the New Testament writers were anti-imperial ‘because we are’ (ibid.).</p>
<p>In our modern world, in western society, in a time when empires today are at their ‘peak’ of power, Heath asks, ‘just what is a Christian to think about empire?’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1476993X11420783">2011</xref>: 259). The answer, in part, seems to be found in the ancient writings of the earliest Christians who declared that Christians had ‘dual citizenship’ in both the earthly empire and in the divine empire. To be good citizens, first-century Christians had to be loyal to a human ruler (Caesar) while never being completely absorbed into the political, social and religious systems. Ultimately, their loyalty was established elsewhere, and the tension that existed for them still exists for Christians today (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1476993X11420783">2011</xref>: 279).</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>This article is the final essay in a three-part series concerned with an analysis of current scholarship and anti-imperial rhetoric in the writings of the New Testament. We have focused on the challenges and the inspiration of the book of Revelation. Questions about the last book in the canonical Bible can persist, and we considered a variety of approaches in an attempt to answer some of these questions. While the book is considered to be the ‘clearest and most overt example of resistance to the Roman Empire in the NT’, a diversity of opinions survives as to how modern readers should understand and apply John’s apocalyptic literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1476993X11420783">Porter and Westfall 2011</xref>: 14).</p>
<p>The first article in our series was an analysis of how the writers of canonical Gospels and the book of Acts were actively involved with the Greco-Roman society around them; we noted their use of diachronic language and images that were anti-imperial in nature. As a result of the pressing social, religious and political situations, the New Testament authors composed politically-charged documents that required the use of subversive language and imagery. Further, the words and mission of the Apostle Paul that we see in the book of Acts are carried on from the work of Luke into Paul’s own letters, and this was reflected in the second article on anti-imperial rhetoric in the New Testament epistles. Recent studies of the New Testament epistles have uncovered intentional words, phrases, ideology and imagery that carry the weight of anti-imperial rhetoric. While it is impossible to neglect the Jewish nature of some of the New Testament epistles, both mild and overt rhetoric challenges the worship of human emperors and the accepted propaganda of the Roman imperial authorities.</p>
<p>We have observed that scholarly interest in early Christianity and the Roman Empire is growing. Historical research is critical to our understanding of the Roman imperial context, and the historical spotlight has been shining on three very different, though intertwined, religious factions in the late first-century <sc>ce</sc>: the imperial cult of the Roman Empire, Judaism and the early Christian church. More recent socio-cultural ideologies help us to understand the thoughts and forces that influenced the ancient writers who lived, wrote (and perhaps even martyred) within these deeply connected cultures. Current biblical scholarship engages the New Testament writings historically, ideologically and literarily to better comprehend the life and mission of Jesus Christ, and to better understand how Christians are to follow him today.</p>
