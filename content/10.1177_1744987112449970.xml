<p>This paper shares the challenges of developing and evaluating an educational intervention (VIP) using simulation in an undergraduate nursing programme.</p>
<p>The authors set their study in the context of the current research evidence related to the use of simulation in the education of healthcare practitioners with particular emphasis on nursing education and the use of technology.</p>
<p>The research evidence base around simulation is limited with a very biased focus to date on effectiveness (BEME review of high fidelity simulators) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1744987112449970">Issenberg et al., 2005</xref>). In most research related to the use of simulation there is little explicit underpinning educational theory yet ontology and epistemology perspectives influence all research. Studies that do utilize underpinning theory in research with simulation typically use the scientific paradigm which, as the authors of this paper suggest, lead to a focus on quantitative measures. As a result this fails to capitalize on some of the rich research questions that would enhance our understanding of learning in context and transferability of learning from one context to another. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1744987112449970">Ringsted et al. (2011)</xref> suggest that a conceptual theoretical framework is required in order to identify an appropriate research approach. There is a need to ask more ‘how’ and ‘why’ questions as opposed to ‘Does this work?’ or ‘Which is better?’. However, there has been a recent acknowledgement of what has been achieved around research with simulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1744987112449970">Issenberg et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1744987112449970">McGaghie et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>This paper identifies some of the tensions in the literature related to simulation for example in the use of language by making very explicit their definition of simulation. If there is no consensus around the use of language even among experts then there will be understandable challenges of sharing and conducting multicentre trials around the use of simulation between both uniprofessional and multiprofessional groups.</p>
<p>The authors weave our current understanding of the classification of simulators into their study and share how technology can be used to support learning and provide useful data on behaviour sequences. The educational theories underpinning their educational innovations relate both to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1744987112449970">Engstrom’s (2010)</xref> activity theory or socio-material theory where the interaction with the system or material context in which the sequence of behaviours takes place can be explored. The authors do take a rather narrow view of fidelity and realism and this could have been explored in more depth in relation to the educational value and different approaches to realism evidenced in the literature. However, they clearly identify that their paper is about the evaluation of an intervention rather than research and use Kirkpatricks’ levels. This shares the dilemma faced by all educationalists – what is the measurable impact of one single educational intervention on patient outcome? The authors explore the use of indirect measures such as self-efficacy by the students of their competence and self-reporting of the impact of the intervention on their practice. The recognition of human factors on safe performance was captured using qualitative thematic analysis as part of the evaluation of the intervention. The authors do identify the increased awareness students gained from the intervention using simulation. This corroborates with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1744987112449970">Maran and Galvin’s (2003)</xref> concept of the ‘prepared novice’ as a positive advantage from the use of simulation.</p>
<p>One of the useful outcomes of this study has been the iterative improvements and expansion of the intervention over different cohorts of students. This enabled them to address some very real challenges in terms of logistics, in the size of the datasets obtained and of turning this into meaningful real-time information that supports student development over time and giving different perspectives of staff experience with simulation. The capability of technology to support student nurses learning in a customized fashion will engender further challenges as well as innovations.</p>
<p>One of the outcomes from their study might be to research ‘why’ or ‘how’ technology could be used to prevent skill decay or fade.</p>
