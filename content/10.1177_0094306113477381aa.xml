<p>In <italic>Of War and Men</italic>, Ralph LaRossa traces the “culture of fatherhood” and the “conduct of fatherhood” from 1941 to 1960 using a variety of historical and cultural sources including television programs, magazines, advertisements, war letters, and scholarly studies among others. Interpreting fatherhood through the lens of World War II and its aftermath, and reinterpreting the war through the eyes of fathers and families, the book covers a great deal of historical ground, which readers will likely see as either a feature or a bug. The author characterizes the book as a study of the immediate and enduring effects of World War II on fatherhood and fathering. During the two pivotal decades examined, fatherhood endures several literal and figurative wars or struggles: World War II, the Korean War, the Cold War, the battle for civil rights, and a battle to define American masculinity. These various “wars” capture a greater focus in the latter half of the book. The book is a cultural history of fatherhood in a post-war period, but arguments about how “the war” affected fatherhood and fathering—not just the assertion that it did—were sometimes difficult to ascertain, especially during the discussions of fatherhood and fathering in the late 1950s and 1960s.</p>
<p>Parts I and II of the book set the stage by describing the immediate effects of World War II and its aftermath on fathers and their families. The discussion of how father status privileged men in the military context was especially interesting in light of the evolving stratification of wartime masculinity based on service to the war effort abroad or at home in the war industries. Not only were fathers initially exempted from the draft, they were also given preference in how quickly they were brought home once the war had ended, ahead of some wounded in action. LaRossa also addresses the sharp racial divide in the country, and the impact of the war on various national origin groups including Japanese Americans, Chinese Americans, Italian Americans and others, and on African Americans in particular.</p>
<p>Parts III and IV diverge from direct engagement with the war and the effects of military service and delve more deeply into the cultural reflections of fatherhood in the post-war period. Fathers were expected to be economic providers—and when engaged in domestic activities, were often portrayed as inept, bumbling buffoons. They also were, in the early 1950s it seems, more involved in childrearing than assumed. But by the late 1950s, fathers seem to have retreated from domesticity (and even from the pages on the second edition of Dr. Spock’s <italic>The Common Sense Book of Baby and Child Care</italic>). In the interim, we learn that even with the retreat to suburban living, proportionately more fathers commuted to jobs in the suburbs rather than in the city. As patterns of work and fathering evolved in the post-war decade, the advent of Little League baseball ushered in an organized way for fathers to be involved in their children’s lives (so long as those children were sons), without being subject to the womanly chores of cooking, bathing, cleaning, and dressing children.</p>
<p>The title of the book suggests it will include a stronger argument linking war in general and World War II in particular to the culture of fatherhood moving into the post-war period in the 1950s than is present. Especially in the latter half of the book, the war serves as a backdrop occasionally referenced as lurking in the background, but not central to fatherhood or fathering. The thoughtful scholarship on fatherhood and fathering in the civil rights era was relatively disconnected from the earlier sections of the book, with only fleeting reference to the war. Although the issue of African Americans’ segregated service in the World War II military was discussed early on, missing was an equivalent discussion of the integration of the military between World War II and the Korean War, a forgotten war indeed. The murder of Emmett Till, the Montgomery bus boycotts, and <italic>Brown v. Board of Education</italic> were watershed moments in civil rights history, but so too was the true integration of the armed forces. The lack of a more explicit connection between war, integration and the discussion of fatherhood during the civil rights era was surprising.</p>
<p>LaRossa also develops a somewhat confusing storyline about the trajectory of “modern” fatherhood. Initially, we are told that fathers were expected to play a more active role in their children’s lives in the pre-war years. World War II complicated this trend by leaving many families without fathers either temporarily or permanently. For the men who returned from war, their re-integration to family life was complicated and variable. Some became doting, involved fathers, while others became withdrawn from family life, either because of the psychic wounds suffered in war, or their growing involvement in college or career. Throughout the 1950s, fathers became less engaged, but not as much as lore might suggest. Some fathers appear to have been actively involved in raising their children, yet increasingly by the late 1950s the image of fathers became that of the aloof breadwinner, and some evidence suggests men’s behaviors followed suit. The book closes with a detailed discussion of the Nixon-Kennedy election that emphasizes Kennedy’s <italic>bona fides</italic> as a war hero and virile, yet tender father, adoring and doting over his young daughter. Although the pattern of evolution, retrenchment, and re-emergence of the “modern” involved father is documented with rich and fascinating cultural indicators, there is little theory mobilized to explain or understand these trends. Documenting that fatherhood in the post-war era did not always live up to stereotypes is important, but ultimately it seemed the parts in this book were truly greater than their sum.</p>
