<p>We begin by thanking our contributors to this special edition on inpatient safety. Their research and clinical innovations define areas of safety that are critical to both practice and psychiatric nursing science. Although the push toward evidence-based practice has given priority to studies employing the highest level of evidence, there are some areas of psychiatric nursing that simply do not have a large set of data to support decision making. The articles in this issue illustrate a range of approaches nurses might use to gather data; data that can then be used to build the evidence base of inpatient psychiatric nursing. The articles also demonstrate how the combined efforts of researchers, practitioners, and service users inform important issues of inpatient safety and provide guidance to those who confront safety issues on a daily basis.</p>
<p>At the most basic level, safety demands that staff and patients are free from harm. Safety is connected to reduction of aggression and violence, which in turn is associated with reducing the use of coercive practices, particularly seclusion and restraint. Toward these ends, inpatient nurses have employed an array of methods to both reduce aggression and build a unit culture that supports proactive approaches to patient care, such as recovery and trauma-informed care. In this issue, Suzanne Goetz and Elizabeth Taylor-Trujillo account their organization’s journey through such changes, carefully documenting the methods and processes involved in reducing violence and building a recovery-oriented treatment philosophy. In doing so, the authors bring the multimethod approach to life as they discuss both the successes and setbacks for particular innovations. As more units move toward multimethod approaches for restraint reduction/culture building, it will be important for nurses to innovate within the core strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1078390312441369">Huckshorn, 2004</xref>) and bring forward enhancements that both maintain safety and move nursing closer to recovery-oriented, patient-centered care.</p>
<p>Psychiatric nurses’ efforts to address safety issues are evident in both the literature and the American Psychiatric Nurses Association (APNA) Member Bridge. Here, nurses working in the field regularly raise issues around safety, such as one-to-one surveillance, safety rounds, or handling contraband. In their article, Diane Allen, Alexander de Nesnera, and Deborah Robinson raise two important issues (falling and choking) and also detail how their facility dealt with the safety risks. Their article is an exemplar for using data to identify a clinical problem, searching the literature for evidence, applying the evidence on best practices to the clinical arena, and then determining the outcomes of the effort. Their article is also an exemplar for bringing a previously unrecognized safety concern (choking) to the fore, which may then result in further research. As inpatient nurses raise awareness of safety concerns, the specialty needs to encourage initiatives similar to Allen and her colleagues and also encourage reports on the use of the evidence and quality improvement outcomes so we might build the evidence base for our practice.</p>
<p>Nurses use a variety of methods to deal with risk arising from aggressive behaviors. One of these has been the use of pro re nata (PRN) medications to quell behaviors that are escalating and not responding to nonpharmacologic interventions. Drs. Pamela Lindsey and Kathleen Buckwalter ask an important question in exploring psychotropic PRN use with geriatric populations—that is, how often are nonpharmacologic interventions attempted and documented prior to the administration of PRNs. Reporting on a retrospective chart review of PRN use on two gero-psychiatric units, the researchers found that documentation around PRNs often fails to detail why the medication was given, the response, or the nonpharmacologic interventions that were attempted prior to PRN initiation. Judicious and appropriate use of PRNs is an important element of maintaining safety. However, the findings of Lindsey and Buckwalter suggest that psychiatric nurses should be not only examining documentation practices but also receiving additional training in competencies around PRN administration.</p>
<p>Inpatient safety also rests with nurses’ proactive approaches to maintain an environment that supports positive interactions with patients. An important aspect of a proactive approach is the degree to which patients are involved in healing activities and therapeutic encounters. In her article, Marion Janner discusses an innovative program, Star Wards, which contains 75 practical suggestions about how inpatient staff can increase meaningful activities, reduce patient boredom, and encourage patient–staff engagement. As Ms. Janner explains, Star Wards was conceived following her own inpatient psychiatric admissions and her vision of a psychiatric ward that employed talking therapies, supported patients, and had activities that aligned with recovery. The article demonstrates how Ms. Janner collaborated to disseminate the program and evaluate its results and as such is an exemplar for how service users, clinicians, and researchers can work together to bring significant innovation to inpatient psychiatric treatment.</p>
<p>No doubt most psychiatric units are invested in violence prevention and restraint reduction. Still, aggressive incidents do happen, and both patients and nurses can be targets for this violence. In her article, Dr. Patti Zuzelo addresses the impact of violence on nurses—how they come to perceive risks and how they deal with the aftermath. Following a violent attack, inpatient nurses are expected to recover, often quite quickly. In her qualitative interviews with nurses who have been assaulted (or witnessed a peer being attacked), Dr. Zuzelo demonstrates how ramifications of an aggressive attack often linger and that at times nurses struggle with ways to keep caring for patients who have just assaulted staff. Her article reminds us of the complexities of dealing with risk, the aftermath of aggression, and the need to devise best practices to help staff and the patient group deal with incidents of aggression.</p>
<p>Nurses strive to create inpatient psychiatric units that are healing and recovery oriented. They are dedicated individuals who have adjusted their practice to the demands of brief stays, rapid patient turnover, increased documentation requirements, and open admission policies. In the midst of all these changes, nurses have also maintained safety as a key priority. The safety strategies nurses develop and employ should not only be recognized but also organized in a way that contributes to an evidence base that supports their use. Measurement needs to be streamlined so it is within reach of even small staff groups, and dissemination of all levels of evidence needs to be supported and encouraged.</p>
<p>In some instances, university–hospital collaborations might boost design, data collection, and dissemination efforts on new initiatives. Inpatient psychiatric nursing has not been the focus of a great deal of psychiatric nursing research, yet the multiplicity of safety concerns highlight the need for funding and research in this area. Also, with the coming of the Doctor of Nursing Practice, there will be a larger workforce adept at collecting evidence for practice. Inpatient nurses should work within APNA to build the platforms for translating evidence into practice and informing practice with hospital-generated data. These articles provide a great roadmap for the initiative.</p>
