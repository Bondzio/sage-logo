<abstract>
<p>In this work a new generation of bioceramic personalized implants were developed. This technique combines the processes of solid freeform fabrication (SFF) and combustion synthesis (CS) to create personalized bioceramic implants with tricalcium phosphate (TCP) and hydroxyapatite (HA). These porous bioceramics will be used to fill the tibial bone gap created by the opening wedge high tibial osteotomy (OWHTO). A freeform fabrication with three-dimensional printing (3DP) technique was used to fabricate a metallic mold with the same shape required to fill the gap in the opening wedge osteotomy. The mold was subsequently used in a CS process to fabricate the personalized ceramic implants with TCP and HA compositions. The mold geometry was designed on commercial 3D CAD software. The final personalized bioceramic implant was produced using a CS process. This technique was chosen because it exploits the exothermic reaction between P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> and CaO. Also, chemical composition and distribution of pores in the implant could be controlled. To determine the chemical composition, the microstructure, and the mechanical properties of the implant, cylindrical shapes were also fabricated using different fabrication parameters. Chemical composition was performed by X-ray diffraction. Pore size and pore interconnectivity was measured and analyzed using an electronic microscope system. Mechanical properties were determined by a mechanical testing system. The porous TCP and HA obtained have an open porous structure with an average 400 µm channel size. The mechanical behavior shows great stiffness and higher load to failure for both ceramics. Finally, this personalized ceramic implant facilitated the regeneration of new bone in the gap created by OWHTO and provides additional strength to allow accelerated rehabilitation.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0885328211404938" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>A valgus high tibial osteotomy (HTO) is the treatment of choice for medial knee osteoarthritis that may be performed with a lateral closing wedge or a medial open wedge osteotomy technique.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0885328211404938">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0885328211404938">2</xref></sup> In recent years, the medial opening wedge technique has been favored over the lateral closing wedge osteotomy to avoid co-morbidity associated with the fibular osteotomy from the latter procedure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0885328211404938">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the original technique described for an opening wedge osteotomy, an iliac crest cortico-cancellous graft was required to fill the gap. This had the disadvantages related to the donor site such as, post-operative pain, hematoma, sepsis, and discomfort when wearing clothes. The bone gap created during the osteotomy could be left free, or filled with autograft, or allografts.</p>
<p>In OWHTO, a medially based gap is created in the tibial metaphysis that many surgeons prefer to fill with bone or implant materials. This implant is used as a wedge placed into the osteotomized opening site of the tibia in the treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0885328211404938">Figure 1</xref>).
<fig id="fig1-0885328211404938" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>The implant used to fill the gap in the open wedge tibial osteotomy.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0885328211404938-fig1.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>Porous beta tricalcium phosphate (β-TCP) and HA are very promising osteoconductive and biocompatible ceramics bone substitutes. Bioceramics with β-TCP and HA are bioactive materials, providing a biocompatible surface, while the bone formation on them is osteoconductive. The material properties of β-TCP and HA are much like the inorganic phase of bone, which constitutes 60–70% of human bone.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0885328211404938">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0885328211404938"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0885328211404938">6</xref></sup> The macro-porosity of the material facilitates bone ingrowth. The resorption characteristics depend on the mineral composition and the degree of sintering as well as the porous structure and distribution.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0885328211404938">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0885328211404938"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0885328211404938">9</xref></sup> Resorption of α-, β-TCP is much faster than that of HA. It is very important to note that TCP, whether using granules or a wedge, is not intended for load bearing and therefore an OWHTO should always be supported by an internal or external fixation. It was demonstrated that the lateral wedge osteotomy fixed with internal fixation is significantly more rigid and stable than external fixation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0885328211404938">10</xref></sup> Porous bioceramics with β-TCP and HA should facilitate the colonization of bone cells (osteoblast, osteoclast, and osteocyte) and possess properties and characteristics that enhance their attachment, proliferation, migration, and expression of native phenotypes.</p>
<p>The ceramic wedge characteristics and properties such as porosity, surface area to volume ratio, pore size, pore interconnectivity, structural strength, shape (or overall geometry), and biocompatibility are often considered to be critical factors in their fabrication.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0885328211404938">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0885328211404938">12</xref></sup> There are many conventional processes for the fabrication of ceramic, metal, and polymer biomaterials. Several processes, such as Sol–Gel, are used in the biomaterials industry to provide ceramic biomaterials with a block, cement or granule form. The limitations and difficulties encountered with conventional fabrication techniques for producing ceramic wedges with appropriate geometry, pore size, interconnection between pores led to the research for alternative fabrication methods that are capable of providing ceramic wedges with controlled micro and macro structure.</p>
<p>In order to fabricate a personalized or customer implant, a combination of two fabrication processes was developed in this work: (i) Freeform fabrication (FFF) or rapid prototyping (RP) and (ii) CS. FFF or RP is a key group of prototyping technologies with the ability to rapidly fabricate complex 3D physical structures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0885328211404938">13</xref></sup> To build specific micro and macro geometry, RP process is based on the use of data from 3D physical objet created by CAD using CT-Scan or MRI images of the bone structure. RP systems process CAD data by mathematically slicing the computer model of the final desired object into thin even layers.</p>
<p>One of the most popular RP processes is the 3DP technology. In 3DP technology, an inkjet print head sprays a binding agent over a layer of powder, after which a fresh layer of metal powder is rolled over the first, merging the two layers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0885328211404938">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0885328211404938">15</xref></sup> The process is repeated until the entire object is built, which must be fully dried before being removed from the loose powder.</p>
<p>CS, or self-propagating high-temperature synthesis (SHS), is the oldest and most famous thermal reaction, which has been used in several applications (Aerospatiale, medical, etc.). In 1967, Merzhanov and his collaborators developed and improved the concept of CS to fabricate several metallic or ceramic materials. Compared with conventional processes, the most observable advantages of the CS are: the high reaction temperature generated by the combustion giving purer products; the exothermic SHS reaction avoids the need for expensive processing facilities and equipment; the time of the exothermic reaction is short and the cost of the process is low; materials with different compositions can be synthesized in one step by utilizing the chemical energy of the reactions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0885328211404938">16</xref></sup> Because of the inherent simplicity of this manufacturing system as well as its capability of creating net shape devices, one can envision chair side or surgical ward device manufacture where clinicians can create custom implants during the course of a procedure where only a basic mold is needed. The material is synthesized in a sterile condition due to the high temperature of reaction and the reactions last for only a matter of seconds. Thus, CS offers a chance for the rapid manufacture of affordable, individual biomedical devices that could reduce patient recovery time.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0885328211404938">17</xref></sup> These advantages make SHS an efficient and economical technique for the production of advanced ceramics with different phases and compositions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0885328211404938">18</xref></sup> In this paper, the RP technique was combined with CS. The RP process with 3DP technique was used to build a Zirconia mold representing the desired shape. RP with EDM technology was also used to make second mold with metallic phase. Theses molds were subsequently used in the CS to develop personalized or customer ceramic biomaterials. Both of molds were filled by the reactance powders and installed into the chamber of the CS to make implant with desired shape. This personalized bioceramic will be implanted on the arthrostic patients treated by the opening wedge high tibial or femoral osteotomy.</p>

<sec id="sec3-0885328211404938"><title>Personalized implant molds design</title>
<p>One sample was collected from the bone of an adult male human. It was taken from the proximal tibial chondyle. The bone was provided from the Institute of Anatomy and Biology, University of Ottawa, and no fixation procedure or chemical treatment was used. The bone sample was placed into the sample holder of a desktop fanbeam micro CT scanner (μCT-20, Scanco Medical AG, hospital Ste-Justine, Montreal) and scanned at medium resolution (600 X-ray projections with 512 × 512 pixels bitmap image, 18 µm resolution). Integration time was set to 200 ms. Three hundred slices of the proximal tibial sample were scanned, with each slice representing 30 µm-thick segments of the sample. Once the scans were complete, 2D slices of the sample were viewed.</p>
<p>To segment the slices into a 3D model, a volume of interest (VOI) was selected in a program of the scanner's software (SliceOmatic 4.2, TomoVision, Centre de recherche du CHU Sainte-Justine, Canada). A 3D segmentation of the VOI was done with a Sigma-Gauss value of 1.2, a support value of 2, and a threshold value of 200. Once segmentation was complete, a 3D model of the bone was created and saved into a seg.aim file.</p>
<p>The bone was visualized as a virtual 3D geometric model. Commands were used to first read the seg.aim file into memory and then convert it to an ASCII 3DP (STL) file and export it to 3D modeling program (Catia V5R20, Dassault systems) in order to create the defect representing the opening wedge osteotomy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0885328211404938">Figure 2</xref>).

<p>Based on this defect, two 3D models of the mold representing the negative of the osteotomy gap shape were developed, which is required for RP technologies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0885328211404938">Figure 3</xref>). Finally, the virtual mold’s structure was completed and transferred to the RP process.

<sec id="sec4-0885328211404938"><title>Free form fabrication process</title>
<p>Two types of RP were used (3DP and EDM) to fabricate different molds (<italic>n</italic> = 2) with different materials. To validate if the reactance powders will be stick with the mold surfaces after the combustion two different molds were made with metallic and ceramic compositions.</p>
<p>The 3DP technique uses a Laser Ink-jet printing technology for processing powder materials. 3DP allows the processing of a wide variety of powder materials including polymers, metals, and ceramics. The technique should be capable of producing spatially and anatomically accurate 3D objects that fit the intended spaces at the implant site. During fabrication, a laser printer head is used to print a liquid binder onto thin layers of powder. Printing of a ceramic mold was performed with a 3D-powder printing system (Z 410, Z-corporation, École Polytechnique, Montreal) using Zircon powder (ZrO<sub>2</sub>) and 20% phosphoric acid as the liquid phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0885328211404938">Figure 4</xref>(a)). The printing procedure was carried out at room temperature. The internal contour of the Zircon ceramic mold structure corresponded to that of the defects created by the opening wedge osteotomy. A metallic stainless steel mold was also developed using electrical discharge machining (EDM) (EDM Wire Robofil 290, Elimetal Inc. Montreal). This RP technology uses a 3D numerical model of the desired geometry with a laser cutting system for subtractive material from a stainless steel block (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0885328211404938">Figure 4</xref>(b)).

<sec id="sec5-0885328211404938"><title>Combustion synthesis process</title>
<p>CS or SHS is a material fabrication technology in which the synthesis of compounds and composites is accomplished by propagation of a combustion front across the sample. This CS technique provides rapid net shape processing. When compared with conventional powder metallurgy operations, CS not only offers shorter processing time, but also excludes the requirement for high temperature sintering. One of the major advantages of the CS technique is the high reaction temperature that results in higher purity of the products by volatilizing low boiling point impurities or moisture. Another feature associated with CS is the controlled porosity of the final product. Our collaborators from the Advanced CS and Engineering Laboratory (ACSEL)), Colorado School of Mines have extensive experience in conducting SHS or CS research of a wide range of advanced materials.</p>
<p>The biomaterial CS reaction system investigated in this study was as follows:

<p>Reactant powders with the following characteristics: CaO (325 mesh, 99.99% pure), P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> (100 mesh, 99.99% pure) (Interpore International, CA, USA) were weighed according to the required reaction stoichiometry (x,y) and placed in a polyethylene container, along with Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> mixing balls, and mixed at a 3:1 Ca:P (TCP) and 3:2 Ca:P (HA) ratio in a ball mill for a minimum of 12 h, to ensure homogeneity throughout the reactant mixture. The reactant mixtures were cold pressed at 2000 psi and 4000 psi in a stainless steel uniaxial die to produce uniform cylindrical sample pellets of 12 mm in diameter and 10 mm in length. Reactants were pressed according to the amount of initial relative density (green density) desired, typically ranging from 45% to 70%. All preparation work was done in a desiccated argon atmosphere due to the strong hygroscopic and reactive nature of P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>. Twenty cylindrical samples of each composition (TCP and HA) were created in different atmospheres and process parameters using the CS technique (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0885328211404938">Table 1</xref>).

<p>Subsequent to reactant preparation, the ‘green’ reactant sample was placed in a combustion container, shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0885328211404938">Figure 5</xref>. Each cylinder was then reacted in an argon atmosphere by heating a tungsten filament to the point of ignition at the bottom of the ‘green’ reactant powder compact. This experimental set up allows control of the heat input and atmosphere, while measuring pressure changes due to the reaction as well as the combustion temperature of the reactant mixture. Data gathered from this system enables determination of the reaction thermodynamics, based upon product characterization. CS reactions using this system generally are less than 10 s from initiation to completion.

<sec id="sec7-0885328211404938"><title>High temperature treatment</title>
<p>To achieve <italic>β</italic>-TCP and HA bioceramics, the specimens have to be heat treated to a high temperature.</p>
<p>On account of the weak exothermic heat and low combustion temperature of the <italic>x</italic>CaO + P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> reaction, combustion can only be initiated by preheating the compact powders. It is found experimentally that when the preheating temperature of the powder compact is raised to 200°C, the combustion front is able to propagate. The cylindrical specimens were heat treated in an experimental stove (sx2-1013, from Zufa Ltd., USA). During the high temperature treatment, too fast a temperature change may lead to thermal expansion mismatch and a fragmented structure. Therefore, the temperature had to been raised very slowly (about 160 min) between room temperature and 200°C, and 180 min to 600°C, followed by 200 min to 1200°C, and maintained at this temperature for 3 h. The cooling process had to be slow and carefully performed to room temperature to obtain <italic>β</italic>-TCP and HA bioceramics.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-0885328211404938"><title>Mechanical testing protocol</title>
<p>Four bioceramic groups with HA and β-TCP phases and with similar porosities were tested.</p>
<p>All 80 specimens (<italic>n</italic> = 20 in each of the two group) were surface ground with a GP-25 Grinder Polisher (EXAKT Technologies Inc., Montreal) using a very fine 1200 grit carbide paper to produce smooth, flat surfaces for static and cyclic loading tests. A Rapid Infinity Camera was used to assess planeness. Following grinding, the height and diameter of each ceramic cylinder was measured using a vernier caliper. Specimens were compressed axially until failure on the mechanical test system (Model ELF 3200, Bose Inc., Boston, USA) to assess stiffness and load to failure.</p>
<p>For the cyclic testing, the load was applied vertically on the top surface of each specimen. The mechanical testing was conducted using a displacement control machine. Each specimen was loaded from 0 to 60 N 10,000 times at a frequency of 1 Hz simulating the load bearing in 4 weeks of normal human activities. Data was recorded every 10 ms. A compressive static load was also applied vertically on the top surface of each specimen at a rate of 2 mm/min with a rectangular rod attached to the testing system grip (ASTM F1160-91).</p>
<p>Native cadaveric bones (<italic>n</italic> = 3) operated by opening wedge osteotomy were also mechanically tested until a failure. For each compression cycle, load (N) and displacement (mm) were determined simultaneously using data collection software (LabView 5.0.1, National Instruments, Austin, TX) through a Ni-DAQ data acquisition board interfaced to a PC computer and saved on a spreadsheet. Maximum load, minimum load, maximum displacement, and minimum displacement of each test run on a specimen were used for calculation of the average stiffness and average load to failure of each group of specimens.</p>

<sec id="sec9-0885328211404938"><title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>Statistical calculations were performed using Microsoft Excel software. The data were normally distributed in all cases. Therefore, we chose a parametric test to compare the two groups.

<p>Prior to the mechanical characterization, samples were examined on the X-ray diffraction system (LEGO® NXT System, Montreal) using Cu Kα in 2<italic>θ</italic> − <italic>θ</italic> scans ranging from 5° to 55° 2<italic>θ</italic>. The powders from the HA and <italic>β</italic>-TCP specimens were mounted separately onto a slides using the double sticky-tape method and the 10 most intense peaks from the resultant spectra were identified. A number of 2<italic>θ</italic> peak matches for crystalline <italic>β</italic>-TCP and HA were seen for each calcium phosphate samples used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0885328211404938">Figure 6</xref>). The broad base of the peaks indicated the presence of amorphous phases of CaP as well. The ratios of HA/TCP for the samples obtained was 1.56.

<p>Quantitative microstructural analysis was performed on the synthesized, porous β-TCP, HA. The porosity was measured using image analysis (PAXIt Image Analysis Software, Villa Park, IL) on an Olympus GX Series inverted metallographic microscope. We only measured the larger pores (&gt;1 µm due to resolution of the microscope). It was done using consecutive cross sections in the product sample assuming uniform porosity. This is valid due to the kinetics of the SHS reaction which limits how the gasses generated can move in the molten zone of reaction. The limited thickness of the molten zone during combustion results in a uniform porosity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0885328211404938">Figure 8</xref>).
<fig id="fig8-0885328211404938" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><p>Micrograph of cross-section porous hydroxyapatite.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0885328211404938-fig8.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>Their interconnecting pore structure with 70% total open porosity and a pore size ranging from 100 to 400 µm was in a range, which allows vascularization and bone ingrowth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0885328211404938">Figure 8</xref>). The smaller pores in the range of 1–10 µm are more suitable for fluid flow and diffusion to improve the metabolic environment. The amorphous component of the CaP precludes the use of Archimedes as the pellets tend to dissolve into particles due to hydrolysis in an aqueous solution. At the same time, we cannot use gas porosimetery as the biomodal distribution of the pores prevents its use.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0885328211404938">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>The distribution of pores is uniform in the cross section, while the pores are highly interconnected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0885328211404938">Figure 9</xref>). There are also many isolated small pores interspersed in the matrix, and these pores are nearly spherical, which may be the result of transient liquid phase sintering. The pore shape is anisotropic: the pores are elongated in the direction of the propagation wave.

<p>The main problem in the fabrication of porous ceramic implants is to custom-make the biomaterial with adequate micro and macro architecture in a relatively short time for each specific patient. Having comfortable and perfectly fit implants should not be a luxury, but should instead be affordable to everybody.</p>
<p>The concept of porosity in a ceramic implant is very important because it permits bone ingrowth and gives a permanent bond between living tissues and the implant. It also provides a desirable firm fixation between living tissue and the ceramic implant. Therefore, it helps the rapid recovery of the patient. However, it is not easy to mimic the micro and macro structure of a real bone to produce a customized ceramic implant. For these reasons, it was necessary to find solution for the fabrication of a personalized ceramic implant with acceptable micro structure.</p>
<p>A personalized ceramic implant may be beneficial in bone surgeries such as orthopedic and maxillofacial. A personalized bioceramic may decrease patient pain as it better mimics the existing boney structure. Since it is custom-fit, the bioceramic provides a good support and promotes growth of bones within the implant. Since the ceramic implant fits well with the patient, there is no more need for the doctor to shape the implant during the surgery. The surgery is then performed more quickly and the patient can leave the operation room in a shorter time after the surgery. For these reasons it was necessary to develop a method to manufacture customized or personalized ceramic implants with micro and macro architecture similar to bone. These requirements resulted in the selection of coupling RP and CS to build a personalized, porous bioceramic implant in a short time.</p>
<p>RP and advanced medical imaging have a huge impact on the design of medical implants and building medical instruments. Advanced medical imaging with CAD programs was used to build the 3D model of the patient's anatomy. Using computed tomography scanning (CT) data of a patient's anatomy was converted into a mathematical solid model of the bone. Using a commercial 3D modeling program, the shape of the osteotomy was generated and the final 3D model of the mold representing the gap created by the osteotomy was developed.</p>
<p>Precise metallic (stainless steel) and ceramic (ZrO<sub>2</sub>) molds of the implant were then quickly generated using two RP technologies (3DP and EDM). These molds were subsequently used in the CS process to build the final porous personalized bioceramic implant.</p>
<p>Similar to the methods to create cylindrical samples, calcium oxide and P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> powders were mixed and placed in the molds and appropriately compressed. Ignition was conducted in an argon atmosphere. The resulting synthesized form was structurally intact β-TCP and HA.</p>
<p>It was very easy to introduce the metallic mold into the combustion container, but some parameters must be better controlled. The final personalized bioceramic has a complex heterogeneous 3D shape that is difficult to machine. However, the problem with a ZrO<sub>2</sub> mold was the difficulty to press the powders in the mold, and also there were some impurities due to the high temperature of the reaction on the surface of the mold.</p>
<p>The quality of bioceramics has been characterized by its chemical and phase composition, mechanical properties, and microstructure. The microstructure of porous materials, that is, the volume, density, and size of pores and inter-connections and specific surface area, acts on the degradation and bone ingrowth of materials. The analyses of microstructures and phases showed that there was a continuous pore distribution, while the elemental distribution was ideal for facilitating physiological liquid proliferation. Mechanically, the HA exhibited a higher stiffness than the β-TCP.</p>
<p>A biomechanical study could be done to assure the validity of this concept. After the bone controlled resection, the remaining cavity could be filled with a porous personalized bioceramic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0885328211404938">Figure 10</xref>). This structure could take over the load-bearing function of the bone tissues until the bioceramic will break down and is replaced by newly formed bone. Internal fixation must be used to assure the stability of the implant.

<p>A combination of RP with CS is useful for generation of bioceramic structures with desirable micro and macro morphology for OWHTO.</p>
<p>This combination could be expanded to the production of customized implant for different controlled or noncontrolled defect sites. Further work to validate and extend the combination of RP and CS processes for other medical application such maxillofacial, dentistry, and orthopedic surgeries is currently in progress.</p>
