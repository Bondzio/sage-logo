<p>For several decades, the developmental and educational trajectories of African American males have been a contentious and well-studied topic in the social sciences. In <italic>The Truly Disadvantaged</italic> (1990), William Julius Wilson advanced our understanding of the various ways structural conditions and federal policies shape the life course outcomes of African American males. Acknowledgement of resilient African American males has been presented in various empirical research articles but there remain few bodies of work, academic or literary that detail the processes and mechanisms that shape resilient outcomes for African American males.</p>
<p>In <italic>The Other Wes Moore,</italic> Moore beautifully articulates the complexity of urban life by highlighting how issues of poverty, community violence, and educational opportunities shape life course outcomes for African American males. Moore artfully interweaves two similar life narratives; his own and that of another African American male who coincidentally has the same name. In addition to their name, the young men shared similar demographic characteristics: poverty, a fatherless home, and violent streets and police involvement. Alternating between two narratives which, at times felt like one character, brought attention to the fact that while the choices the individual makes are a reflection of their environment they are not necessarily deterministic of one’s future.</p>
<p>One way in which to approach this book is to utilize <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1473325012472130b">Bronfenbrenner’s (1979)</xref> ecological systems theory to examine the accumulation of risk contributors and the presence of protective factors in relation to the varying outcomes we see between the author and his counterpart. A series of concentric structures – <italic>micro</italic>-, <italic>exo</italic>-, and <italic>macro</italic>systems – directly and indirectly affect development, with the individual youth situated at the focal point of influence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1473325012472130b">Bruyere and Garbarino, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1473325012472130b">Garbarino, 2000</xref>). Understanding the complex interplay of influences may shed some light on how and why these young men had such different life outcomes.</p>
<p>Moore’s eight chapter text is divided into three major parts. Moore devotes the first part to exploring the phenomenon of the absentee fathers and their impact on family dynamics, socio-economic status, and overall stability. In the first chapter, Moore brings our attention to two key points of interest. First, there are many reasons why African American fathers may not be a part of the family system and may include death; a fact rarely discussed in the larger discourse regarding the African American family. However, as a microsystem issue, the reader is reminded that financial and social supports that fathers provide, regardless of why they are absent, has a positive impact on the spouse and the children. Second, Moore highlights the exosystem issues of parental stress, economic, social, and structural challenges African American single mothers face when raising their sons; a role that is seemingly more robust than any current definition of motherhood presents. For example, Moore draws on a brief vignette of his counterpart’s mother and how she lost a federal Pell Grant, which forced her to drop out of the prestigious Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, MD. Her dreams of completing her undergraduate education and leaving the tough streets of Baltimore were cut short. It is at this very juncture we see how the other Wes Moore’s life could have taken a different course. This chapter could have been enhanced with a rich discussion around federal education policies and their impact on the African American community.</p>
<p>The second chapter provides insight into how the author and his counterpart navigate their urban terrain. Moore explores how neighborhood conditions such as poverty, gangs, community violence, and drugs become a common aspect of daily life as these young men follow a ‘code of the street’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1473325012472130b">Anderson, 1999</xref>) which dictates how they interpret and respond to conflict in their neighborhood. Moore also introduces an added layer of stress which many single African American mothers face: protecting their sons. Chapter Three contextualizes the neighborhood experience within the context of adolescent development. The allure of popularity, sports, and drugs were often in conflict with educational achievement. It is in this chapter where the author and his counterpart seem most similar. Although the author was afforded the opportunity to attend a prestigious prep school, his interest in being accepted on the streets of the Bronx most closely mirrored the experiences of his counterpart in Baltimore.</p>
<p>In the second part titled ‘Choices and Second Chances’ the reader continues to see how the author and his counterpart struggle to manage normal adolescent processes within the context of constrained choices. In Chapter Four, Moore lays the foundation for understanding how urban street life shapes identity development for young African American males. Like most adolescents, the author and his counterpart ‘try on’ identities as they seek to find themselves. This process is, however, complicated as much of their identity development is connected to their embodiment of street culture. In particular, developing a healthy concept of masculinity is influenced by neighborhood messages about what it means to be a man.</p>
<p>Social work scholars will appreciate the attention paid to how choices are influenced by multiple microsystem issues. For example, Moore explores how role models, negative or positive play a large role in shaping how these young men think of themselves and the world around them. Perhaps the most compelling statement in this chapter is when Moore states, ‘these forks in the road can happen so fast for young boys; within months or even weeks, their journeys can take a decisive and possibly irrevocable turn’ (p. 95). This is precisely the tension many young African American males face when growing up in the inner city. This discussion recognizes the plight of young African American men who are confronted with their immediate physical and social needs in contrast to planning for the future. In many instances, chronic community violence produces fatalistic thinking for African American males which impedes thoughts about their future.</p>
<p>This chapter culminates with life altering choices. A desire to make a quick drug sale sends the author’s counterpart to jail whereas the author’s decision to avoid a confrontation with racist teenagers protects him and his friend from injury and retribution at school. There are several factors that influence these choices: (1) The author has access and utilizes a support system that holds him accountable; and (2) he now has the ability to visualize a future beyond high school – a factor that forces him to evaluate his behavior as not to jeopardize his future. The author’s counterpart, on the other hand, is more concerned about meeting his immediate needs – a decision that is partially influenced by his lack of conceptualization about the future.</p>
<p>The final part of the book titled, ‘Path’s Taken and Expectations Fulfilled’ is an extension of the previous section on choices. Chapter Seven begins with a vignette from a conversation the author had with his counterpart that set the tone for this section. The author asks his counterpart, ‘Are we all just products of our environment?’ He responds, ‘I think we’re products of our expectations, other’s expectations that you take on as your own’ (p. 126). In my view, this is one of the most important points this book makes because it forces the reader to consider what ‘other’ means. On one hand, ‘other’ can refer to expectations of family, friends, the community or school hold or conversely, expectations that broader society has for African American men. Understanding ‘others’ expectations may provide a lens with which to examine how choices are constructed for African American men. For example, the author’s counterpart joined and successfully completed Job Corp (a job training program for disadvantaged teenagers and young adults). One could posit that his desire to provide for his family and to be a functional member of society led to his completion of the program. However, his need to adequately provide for his family superseded the benefits and societal messages about the legal employment which led to his return to selling drugs. The final chapter is the most predictable as the reader can trace how social supports, school environment, neighborhood experiences and social networks at each developmental stage have shaped the behaviors, attitudes and beliefs of both men. As the author makes great strides in education his counterpart enters prison for the final time on murder charges.</p>
<p>The author purposely avoids discussing what made the difference between him and the other Wes Moore; a decision I find to be a strength and weakness of the book. As strength, omitting this discussion may deter the reader from using Moore’s academic and career achievements as a societal bar with which to compare all other urban African American males. As such, the reader is forced to think critically and holistically about their lives and how close they came to having the opposite outcomes. On the other hand, the author could have provided more in-depth descriptions of the conditions, people, and experiences that impacted both men. From a research perspective, each identified condition could be a springboard for intervention and prevention research grounded in personal narratives.</p>
<p>As an African American social work scholar, I appreciated the emphasis on choice and how choices are constrained by environmental conditions. Having been raised in rural North Carolina, much of my life was shaped by opportunities, some that I initiated and others that were decided for me. Central to my academic success was an abundance of social supports, particularly at home, which provided a buffer between me and opportunities for negative social engagement. The author underscores the fact that much of his academic and career success is in part due to caring, supportive adults who enabled decisions and choices that steered him towards positive future outcomes.</p>
<p>In sum, the important issues this book raises through narratives are crucial and relevant to social work research. The rich, detailed accounts provide a clear understanding of the mechanisms and processes involved in shaping the life course outcomes of the author and his counterpart. The socio-ecological systems theory provides a useful framework for looking at the relationships between proximal and distal factors that had the most influence on the experiences of these men. This text challenges the notion that resilience is simply an individual characteristic that happens in a vacuum. The ability to make positive choices that benefit one’s current and future life is in part dependent on external influences like family support, good schooling and positive role models. Moore’s text is inspiring and challenges the reader to rethink current discourse regarding the foundational experiences of urban African American males.</p>
