<abstract>
<p>HIV clinicians today need to move from focusing on viral suppression to a chronic disease model in which comorbid conditions and risk factors are comprehensively identified and addressed to reduce rates of serious non-AIDS-related morbidity and mortality. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of comorbid conditions in an Australian HIV-positive population. Of 180 patients included, there was a median CD4 count of 0.520 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>. The majority (88%) of patients were currently receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). There were high rates of failure to attend clinical appointments (30%), current smoking (42%), hypertension (16%), and dyslipidemia (17%). Significant rates of dipstick-positive proteinuria (16%) and elevated blood glucose (15%) were recorded. Risk factors were commonly not addressed by the treating clinician. There is an urgent need to systematize detection and management of high-prevalence comorbid conditions to prevent premature mortality associated with serious non-AIDS events. </p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Medical management of patients with HIV has been transformed since the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). HIV-positive patients with access to HAART should now have a life expectancy approaching that of HIV-negative individuals.<sup>

</sup> With the prevention of opportunistic infections by maintenance of immune function through HAART, we have entered a new era of HIV management as a chronic disease.

<title>Methods</title>
<p>A retrospective study was performed of all HIV-1-infected patients who attended an outpatient Sexual Health and HIV Clinic in Nambour, Queensland, Australia, in 2009. All 180 patients attending the clinic were included in this study. Data were collected by review of patient records and the institution pathology database. The study was approved by the institutional human research ethics committee. </p>
<p>Two types of data were collected on each patient (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1545109711418832">Table 1</xref>):</p>

<title>Hypertension</title>
<p>The definitions of hypertension and dyslipidemia were defined by the Australian Therapeutic Guidelines (eTG complete [Internet]. Melbourne: Therapeutic Guidelines Limited; Accessed 2010, February&lt;https://online-tg-org-au.cknservices.dotsec.com/ip/&gt;). Normal blood pressure was &lt;120/80 mm Hg and target treated blood pressure levels were &lt;125/75 for patients with proteinuria, &lt;130/80 for patients with any associated conditions or end-organ damage, and &lt;140/90 for other patients. Treatment and target lipid levels were defined according to patient risk per Australian Therapeutic Guidelines. </p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1545109711418832">
<title>Proteinuria</title>
<p>Proteinuria was assessed by urinary dipstick analysis. An algorithm guiding the investigation of abnormal dipstick results was used by the clinic, and compliance with this algorithm was assessed in the study. The algorithm recommends repeat testing of all patients with trace protein on urinary dipstick in 3 months and further investigation of all patients who have more than trace protein in their urine. In patients with greater than trace protein, a protein–creatinine ratio is performed and referral to a specialist nephrology service is indicated if &gt;100 mg/mmol is detected.</p>

<title>Australian Alcohol Guidelines</title>
<p>Current Australian guidelines for alcohol consumption were taken from the Australian Government Department of Health and Ageing Web site, www.alcohol. gov.au, which recommends no more than 2 standard drinks on any day and no more than 4 standard drinks on a single occasion.</p>

<title>HIV-Specific Results</title>
<p>In all, 88% of patients (n = 158) studied were currently receiving HAART. Median CD4 counts were good with a median value of 0.520 cells/mm<sup>3</sup> (27%) and an interquartile range (IQR) of 0.400 to 0.700 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>, and only 13 patients had a CD4 count less than 0.200 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>. The median nadir CD4 count was 0.228 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>. Twenty-eight percent of patients receiving HAART had a detectable HIV viral load during 2009. To avoid detecting “viral blips” that have been observed with the recent introduction of the highly sensitive Roche Cobas Amplicor assay, a detectable viral load was defined as &gt;200 copies/mL. The presence or absence of side effects related to HAART was documented in 42% patients receiving HAART. The clinician’s impression of adherence was reported in 85% patients, with 72% of patients recording adherence with HAART and nonadherence recorded in 13%. A genotypic resistance analysis (GRA) had been performed (at any time) in 32% of patients. </p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Identifying high rates of psychiatric symptoms, failure to attend clinic appointments, substance abuse, and risk factors for serious non-AIDS-related conditions such as cardiovascular disease, this study clearly demonstrates the challenges of providing comprehensive care to HIV-positive patients in Australia, today. In addition to multiple pathologies, the focus of the clinician is often on multidrug antiretroviral regimens with complex drug interactions, reducing attention on preventative approaches for comorbid conditions. Few HIV clinicians in Australia are experienced in the management of chronic disease and aging populations, which in combination with a lack of engagement of HIV-positive patients with general practitioners, may lead to the underinvestigation and treatment of risk factors for long-term non-AIDS–related conditions. </p>
<p>It is of concern that a viral load was detectable in 28% patient on HAART. As the study recorded data over a 1-year period, it is likely that some patients with a detectable viral load were initiating HAART and therefore not fully suppressed, resulting in a detectable viral load on treatment. Future studies will record the date of HAART initiation for patients with a detectable viral load.</p>
<p>This study revealed comprehensive screening for coinfection with viral hepatitis but inadequate screening for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and latent TB. Vaccination rates should be increased to reduce the number of patients that remain susceptible to hepatitis A and B. Screening of men who have sex with men (MSM), which constitutes a large majority of the study population, for STIs including syphilis, gonorrhea, and chlamydia is recommended annually, with increased screening for patients who are at increased risk (STI testing guidelines for MSM, www.racp.edu.au, Australasian Chapter of Sexual Health Medicine). This study demonstrated 3 new cases of chlamydia diagnosed in 40 patients screened in 2009. It is likely the low screening rate would have missed other cases of chlamydia. Screening for syphilis and gonorrhea was also low. </p>
<p>Screening for the presence of latent TB by TST is recommended at initial patient assessment for all HIV-positive patients by the DHHS) Guidelines for the use of antiretroviral agents in HIV-1-infected adults and adolescents. Concerns among HIV clinicians regarding the use of interferon-γ release assays in screening HIV-positive patients are reduced with recent evidence supporting the sensitivity of this test in HIV patients.<sup>

</sup> Of the 25 patients who were screened, the positive screen rate of 28% indicates that there are likely to be a significant number of patients who have not been screened and who do have latent TB. Therefore, the introduction of routine QuantiFERON-TB Gold testing of all patients attending Clinic 87 in the future will be one outcome from this study. </p>
<p>The prevalence of current cigarette smoking in this study (42%) is dramatically higher than that of the general Australian population (15.6%).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1545109711418832">19</xref>
</sup> This study documented a record of smoking status in 79% patients, but a formal discussion on smoking cessation was only recorded in 53% smokers. HIV clinicians may not feel confident in their ability to provide smoking cessation advice.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1545109711418832">20</xref>
</sup> The development of resources and clinical algorithms to guide HIV clinicians in smoking cessation interventions is currently underway in Queensland. </p>
<p>A significant proportion of patients in this study did not have screening for hypertension and dyslipidemia in 2009. Of those that were hypertensive or had dyslipidemia documented, treatment was not always initiated, and treatment targets were not met in a significant proportion who were treated. Cardiovascular risk calculation was underutilized. Sixteen percent of patients that had their blood pressure measured had documented hypertension. This is consistent with the documented rates of hypertension in the Australian population of similar median age, and the proportion untreated are also consistent with Australian data.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1545109711418832">21</xref>
</sup> In a patient group with a high prevalence of cardiac risk factors, modifiable risk factors require increased attention to reduce future cardiovascular morbidity. </p>
<p>Of the 53% patients who had urine dipstick analysis performed, an extremely high number (56%) had protein detected by dipstick testing in their urine. The majority (41%) had only trace protein, but 16% had 1+ or greater protein detected. Even trace protein on urinary dipstick has been identified as a significant hazard for the development of end-stage renal disease, although this has not been assessed in HIV-positive cohorts.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1545109711418832">22</xref>
</sup> Previous studies have documented microalbuminuria or proteinuria in 31% HIV-infected patients, but the value of microalbuminuria in predicting progression to overt proteinuria requires longitudinal studies. At this point, progression does appear to occur in at least a proportion of patients with microalbuminuria and HIV, but the value of interventions is not clear.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1545109711418832">23</xref>
</sup> Smoking is identified as a risk factor for renal impairment and proteinuria and may contribute significantly to the high rates of proteinuria in the HIV-positive population.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1545109711418832">19</xref>
</sup> Mineral bone disease occurs at increased rates in HIV-positive populations, and a progressive reduction in bone mineral density related to the duration of HIV infection has been observed.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1545109711418832">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1545109711418832">25</xref>
</sup> Bone disease occurs at an earlier age than in the HIV-negative population and is multifactorial in origin.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1545109711418832">26</xref>
</sup> The European AIDS Clinical Society (EACS) recommends risk stratification for osteoporosis screening based on conventional risk factors and the World Health Organization Fracture Risk Assessment Tool. Patients in this study group have risk factors for mineral bone disease including high alcohol use and smoking. It is likely that HIV infection is also a secondary risk factor although the quantification of this risk is not validated at this point.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1545109711418832">27</xref>
</sup> Screening for osteoporosis was performed only in 3 patients, despite 12% patients having a documented fracture, 5 of which were identified as osteoporotic. As the HIV population ages, screening and treatment for osteoporosis needs to be addressed, with the development of consensus guidelines for clinicians to follow. From the deficiencies in clinical care of HIV-positive patients identified by this study, a care plan has been developed to facilitate comprehensive nursing and medical assessment of all relevant clinical parameters and risk factors. This care plan will be used at each HIV clinical visit. HIV clinics need to institute regular auditing to identify areas of deficiency in their current clinical practice and to ensure that their clinical practice is improving. A further study will be performed at this clinic in 12 months after the introduction of the care plan to assess changes in the parameters assessed in this study. </p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Systematization of HIV clinical care by the development of clinical care plans and HIV-specific algorithms for the investigation and management of comorbid conditions and risk factors would be expected to lead to more rigorous and comprehensive patient assessment and management and allow for the development of auditable standards and benchmarking between HIV clinics. As the HIV population in Australia ages, there will be a need for multidisciplinary HIV care and increased engagement and communication with primary care providers. Whole patient care is both an organizational and clinical challenge for HIV clinicians today. </p>
