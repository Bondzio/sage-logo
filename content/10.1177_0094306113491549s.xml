<p>In December 1992, lawyers rummaging through files at a police station in suburban Asunción discovered Paraguay’s <italic>Archivo de Terror.</italic> It recorded a dark history of the kidnapping, torture, and murder of political dissidents by the infamous dictator, Alfredo Stroessner. Bringing the records to light began a process of healing in which the nation still struggles to overcome decades of secrecy and fear. But simply exposing brutality does not create a democracy. In <italic>Guerrilla Auditors: The Politics of Transparency in Neoliberal Paraguay</italic>, Kregg Hetherington analyzes a second wave of transparency; this seeks to promote democracy by making public records, documents, and titles available to all. Analyzing peasant activists’ attempts to use these documents in their own defense, Hetherington provides an important perspective on the difficult transition in the effort to create a new Paraguay. But the work has importance outside this small nation, offering larger lessons about neoliberal movements and the negotiation of power and reality.</p>
<p>For decades, the European model of participatory democracy has emphasized transparency in decision-making. In the neoliberal political movements of the late twentieth century, this transparency became conceptualized as a free-flow of information, akin to the free-flow of value through markets. Soon after the fall of the Stroessner dictatorship in 1989, there was a clamor for access to records of land, business, and government transactions. Transparency of records was viewed as the antidote to the history of state secrecy; it could force change, deter corruption, and put the state at the service of the common good.</p>
<p>The first actors to demand transparent governing were the educated urban opposition to Stroessner’s Colorado Party. These activists had earned their reputations in decades of struggle against the authoritarian state, and with the opening of the Archivos de Terror, demanded access to the more mundane records through which the government controlled information and power. Hetherington terms these activists “new democrats.” Infused with hope and energy by the <italic>apertura</italic>, they sought to rationalize political discourse and in doing so, institutionalize democracy.</p>
<p>Hetherington’s work focuses less on the political machinations of these new democrats, than on organizing among the country’s disenfranchised small farmers. Long excluded from the political struggles of Asunción, they have lived under a regime of <italic>caudillo</italic> politics that dictated access to rural land and power. Whether under the rule of the Colorado or the opposing Liberal party, peasants had been excluded from politics and subject to the dictates of the state. Struggling to subsist from basic agriculture, they had been allowed small parcels of land in exchange for quietly accepting their marginal status.</p>
<p>Since the fall of Stroessner in 1989, the clearest change in rural Paraguay has been the rapid imposition of a system of capitalist agro-industry. Twenty years ago Paraguay was insignificant in its soybean production; today it ranks as the world’s fourth largest producer—in a country the size of California. Small farmers have been shunted aside as lands have been bought up, cleared, and put into production.</p>
<p>Studying with farmers on the margins of the system, in an area rife with conflict between soybean corporations and peasant farmers, Hetherington carefully documents the tentative steps they take to move beyond a system of <italic>caudillismo</italic>, into the new movement for transparency and power. He works closely with one small group who set out to defend their land and their livelihood in the archives of the national land reform agency.</p>
<p>In doing so, the work explores conflicts that bedevil democratic movements throughout Latin America. As political allegiances line up in the neoliberal era, Hetherington points out that the urban political elites neither understand nor trust <italic>campesinos</italic>. Educated activists fighting for democracy see peasants as an undependable undifferentiated mass, whose allegiance is dictated by pragmatic decisions in a material world. After all, Paraguay’s new democrats assert, Stroessner’s peasants remained silent provided they had access to a modicum of land.</p>
<p>Hetherington challenges the neoliberal concept of transparency, which assumes that facts achieve some objective reality in the form of documents. Peasants see land as the fixed object, and their relation to land contrived in a world of multiple titles, lost files, and labyrinths of government offices. Documents, whether as an identity card, a land title, or a paper ballot, become a means of negotiation of these relations.</p>
<p>Hetherington provides an artful and fascinating description of the process by which his primary informant uses documents to negotiate relations skillfully in the theater of the bureaucrat’s office. One example stands out. As peasants squat on the floor or stand against the wall, the <italic>gerente</italic> hears each landholder’s complaint, sends an aid for the file, and places the documents on the desk. Discussion proceeds with the open file, unread, on the desk. The social relationship, not the paper, is the source of power. The group’s energy and power is lost the moment any individual peasant breaks from the group, approaches the desk, and shifts attention to the document. Having watched the impotence of peasants and native peoples in these bureaucratic farces, I am grateful to Hetherington for his analysis. I better understand my own experience and see how it could have been different.</p>
<p>Hetherington’s research brings a new perspective to research of Paraguay’s rural power structure. To date, sociologists have emphasized the use of this kind of direct force, termed <italic>mbareté</italic>, in asserting control over Paraguayan <italic>campesinos</italic>’ access to resources. Backed by political ties to the ruling party in Asunción, <italic>caudillos</italic> asserted total control over peasants’ lives, and enforced their rule with violence: arbitrary jailing, beatings, and murder. This work shifts the analysis to the struggle of peasants in the negotiation of meanings. Nevertheless, <italic>mbareté</italic> is evident even in this work. In one remarkable instance, police raid a community, soybean farmers burn peasants’ homes and crops, and two peasants are murdered. It is evident that the negotiations over documents and their meanings take place in the context of and under the threat of this direct violence. Moreover, as the author is well aware, this incident underscores the research and informs analysis. How do we understand these murders and the negotiation of meaning in the bureaucrat’s office as aspects of the same system; how do they relate? As we gain insight into the analysis of negotiated meanings it will be important to attend to the reality of <italic>mbareté</italic>, which still acts directly on peasant and anthropologist alike.</p>
<p>Good work raises new and important questions. The process by which rural people negotiate meanings is well described and explored here, and this is a great deal, but it calls out for the same work to be done with other groups in this conflicted setting. The concept of “new democrat” needs more description and analysis. What relation do they have to the Liberales who have for generations alternated power with the Colorados? <italic>Campesinos</italic> are suspicious of both groups, as they represent the power structures that have excluded peasants from the process of negotiation. Do peasants have anything to gain from joining forces with these new democrats, given that the system has historically excluded their voices? One can only hope that this research trajectory continues, as it will yield useful and important work.</p>
