<p>This book offers an introduction to how managerialism and business schools in the US are at least tacitly complicit in the ongoing financial crisis. Perhaps most importantly Robert Locke and J-C Spender present some practical steps as to how this current predicament might be redressed. <italic>Confronting Managerialism: How the Business Elite and Their Schools Threw Our Lives out of Balance</italic> builds on and updates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1350507612445413">Locke’s (1996)</xref> largely under-appreciated work and is organized into six thought-provoking chapters.</p>
<p>The opening chapter offers a broad historical overview of the development of management, managerialism and business schools in the US up until the end of the 1960s. Locke and Spender assert management emerged from the workshop during the mid-1800s and that the process of managing, in the broadest possible sense, is now essential to all forms of modern society. But managerialism is defined as something altogether different: the unjust and inequitable situation where a professional caste of managers deprives others of their decision-making power. Managerialism, according to the authors, is closely linked with unilateral managerial prerogative and challenges the very fabric of the US’s democratic capitalism. US’s business schools are put forward as being inspired by their German predecessors and having come into being around the end of the 1800s. While the latter sought to prepare managers for work by teaching management as a ‘practical’ subject the former instead studied management as an object. The narrative is spun that Operational Research’s perceived success during World War II led consulting firms, private foundations and government agencies to call for a change in the syllabi of US business schools. This pressure compelled a turn towards the ‘new paradigm’ and the application of ‘science’ to management which hastened US business schools’ divorce from practice.</p>
<p>The second chapter continues where the first left off. Locke and Spender explain that during the 1970s Operational Research’s failure to account for the human dimension was increasingly scrutinized and through the 1980s US business schools’ penchant for positivism, more generally, was brought into question. In particular, a growing chorus both from Japan and elsewhere believed the predominant thinking had for too long been left unproblematized. The veracity of the widely held assumption that US business schools played a key role in promoting enterprise in the 1980s is also queried. Rather it is alleged US business schools had a propensity to produce abstract theories that were published in spurious journals and the reason for the emergence of places like Silicon Valley was mainly due to the military-industrial-academic complex (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1350507612445413">Giroux, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>The third chapter contends that both managerialism and US business schools have morally failed. Locke and Spender tentatively explore a number of other alternatives to managerialism such as Islam, German co-determination and Chinese Neo-Confucianism. Yet a lack of critical engagement with the relevant literature constrains the persuasiveness of this argument. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1350507612445413">Bell (2008)</xref> frames Chinese Neo-Confucianism as entwined with the Chinese Communist Party and China’s own nascent managerial class. Nevertheless, with the turn to the more familiar topic of the relationship between the academy and US business schools firmer ground is found. Locke and Spender detail a subtle shift from what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1350507612445413">CP Snow (1960)</xref> called the clash of ‘two cultures’ between the sciences and the humanities to something more insidious: the sciences <italic>and</italic> the humanities versus money <italic>and</italic> managerialism. US business schools, it is argued, are amoral and have profited most from this new conflict.</p>
<p>The fourth chapter analyses the US car industry as a specific example of the negative impact of managerialism. Locke and Spender propose that in the decades after World War II the US car industry adopted a short-term, financial-driven approach. In contrast their Japanese competitors tended to embrace a long-term, relationally orientated approach, one of the offshoots of which is that, even though the US car industry was initially more successful than their Japanese rivals, soon this situation was reversed. The US car industry deemed more ‘flexibility’ as essential to effectively combat this threat but a history of adversarial industrial relations put paid to this. Germany’s more constructive response through co-determination shows what could have been achieved in the US if a less combative attitude to labour had been taken. In the end, managerialism hindered the US car industry.</p>
<p>The fifth chapter turns its attention to the links between, on the one hand, managerialism and business schools in the US and, on the other, the ongoing financial crisis. In many ways it is here Locke and Spender are most timely. US banks, it is claimed, expanded their reach into other countries while concomitantly measuring their performance in a narrow, balance sheet fashion. Locke and Spender reason US business schools are complicit in this as they provide the investment funds of Wall Street and the City of London with eager personnel who have strong quantitative skills but weak morals. US business schools focus on the ‘new paradigm’ and reified ‘knowledge’ left little time for a more rounded education, in the truest sense of the term, which may have brought about a more positive state of affairs.</p>
<p>The sixth chapter concludes this book. Locke and Spender surmise that some of the responsibility for the ongoing financial crisis lies at the feet of US business schools. US business schools’ predilection for ‘hard facts’, quantification and inclination for favouring a firm-entity perspective all serve managerialism. The authors echo calls to rectify this by more equitably distributing wealth but they also offer two smaller ideas which may aid this. First, management in nonfinancial firms should be strengthened to decrease the number of predatory takeovers. Second, participation in selecting CEOs and boards should include a wider body of stakeholders. US business schools can support this by serving the community at large and taking on managerialism. Whether they are up to this challenge only time will tell. The authors urge for a better regulated and more participatory mode of capitalism.</p>
<p>Personally I enjoyed the penultimate and ultimate chapters the most. These two chapters make a sizeable contribution to the burgeoning literature examining management, managerialism and business schools in the US. Although there is still room for further research here. Locke and Spender delimit managerialism as merely a situation where a professional caste of managers deprives others of their decision-making power. Perhaps a more inclusive understanding of managerialism as a verb (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1350507612445413">Parker, 2002</xref>) might have yielded further insights.</p>
<p>Locke and Spender’s Herculean effort produces an engaging and highly readable <italic>tour de force</italic>. This book is likely to be of immense value to anyone with an interest in management, managerialism and business schools in the US as well as being an excellent addition to a range of undergraduate and postgraduate courses.</p>
