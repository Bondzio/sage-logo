<p>We have read with interest the meta-analysis by Lupi et al., Biodegradable versus durable polymer drug eluting stents in coronary artery disease: Insights from a meta-analysis of 5834 patients, recently published in this journal.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2047487313484123">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>The article covers an important topic and as research fellows at a high-volume interventional cardiology centre we were very interested in that paper; the authors concluded that the new technology biodegradable stents do not provide any benefit in reducing late stent thrombosis.</p>
<p>Unfortunately we realized that, while interesting, the findings presented in the paper are considerably biased by serious methodological drawbacks which made the analysis differ considerably from the current evidence for several reasons:
<list id="list1-2047487313484123" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Studies of various quality levels can either mask or have an adverse effect. The quality of included studies, for example the study of Xu et al., is low and could have biased the results, as reported in the Cochrane Collaboration guidelines.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2047487313484123">2</xref></sup> The authors should have evaluated the methodology more accurately; they declare no publication bias in their funnel plot for mortality; at a closer inspection, however, a marked asymmetry in the lower left-hand corner is evident, suggesting markedly biased results.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The meta-analysis by Lupi et al. has findings contrasting with the results of the well conducted randomized LEADERS trial,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2047487313484123">3</xref></sup> which clearly indicated that the very late stent thrombosis risk was strikingly reduced by the biodegradable-polymer platform at a long-term follow up. These results were confirmed in a large scale meta-analysis published recently.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2047487313484123">4</xref></sup> Furthermore, new evidence of the safety and efficacy profile of biodegradable polymer stents is also available. In addition, having included the mortality outcome, the authors did not mention the results of the LEADERS trial at the longest available follow-up for late thrombosis outcome. This arbitrary exclusion/inclusion process might have driven the analysis towards the spurious findings on late stent thrombosis.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The authors failed to demonstrate the publication bias for outcomes other than mortality. Considering the arbitrary exclusion of some studies, the question arises why, in the paper by Lupi et al., the publication bias stratified for late stent thrombosis is not displayed.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The conclusions on late thrombosis are merely speculative. The authors made an inference on late stent thrombosis but there were only few reported events followed by many inestimable results in the forest plot; therefore, a definitive conclusion could not be made. Additionally, large confidence intervals found around the overall estimates, including the identity line, confirm the inconclusive findings on stent thrombosis in the meta-analysis by Lupi et al.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>In conclusion, we believe the methodology employed in the article biased the results, which are against the current evidence of literature. Therefore, the findings of this meta-analysis should be interpreted with strong caution.</p>
