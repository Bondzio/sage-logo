<abstract>
<p>This article explores WalMart’s impact on the retail sector in the counties in which it is located, as well as in surrounding counties, by examining the number and size of retail outlets, by retail category. Using statewide data as well as a case study incorporating econometric modes, we find that the main impact of the entrance of a WalMart primarily falls on competitive big box stores. Furthermore, we find that the long-run adjustment to the entrance of a WalMart takes between 18 and 36 months.</p>

<p>The impact of the entrance of a WalMart into a metropolitan area, especially a relatively small one, has been controversial for many years. The controversy springs from the typical economic growth versus community culture argument concerning the “inevitable” loss of many treasured small retail establishments.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0891242412463817">1</xref></sup> This article examines this issue within two different contexts. The first extends the existing statistical studies of this impact along the lines of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0891242412463817">Sobel and Dean (2008)</xref> but using county-level rather than state-level data. The second uses a case study that focuses on a small metropolitan area (Muncie, Indiana) that already had a significant number of big box retailers and a regional mall before WalMart opened its first store. We plan to exploit the opening of individual WalMarts in certain Indiana counties to establish clusters of counties that fall within easy driving distance of a particular WalMart. This permits the analysis of the effect of a WalMart entrance on other local businesses within the county as well as in adjacent counties, a frequent question addressed in earlier studies. Our results indicate that contrary to conventional wisdom, the biggest impact of the entrance of a WalMart in a locality is on other big box stores or malls, not on mom-and-pop retail stores.</p>
<sec id="section1-0891242412463817">
<title>Literature Review</title>
<p>The examination of the impact of new forms of retailing on local retail establishments has a long tradition—beginning, perhaps, in the late 19th century with the introduction of mail-order giants such as Sears, Roebuck and Co. In the 1920s and 1930s, these studies expanded to cover the impact of chain stores (F. W. Woolworth, W. T. Grant, Ben Franklin, and others). Studies of malls and discounters were a natural continuation of earlier studies. By the 1990s, estimating the impact of a WalMart’s entry into a local retail market had become a bit of a cottage industry. The threads in this agenda include measuring a WalMart store’s impact on the price level of retail goods; its impact on existing, especially mom-and-pop, retail establishments; and its impact on local wages, employment, and working conditions and on the local social structure.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0891242412463817">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, the WalMart website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://Walmartstores.com/download/3097.pdf">Walmartstores.com/download/3097.pdf</ext-link>) focuses exclusively on the studies that examine the impact of WalMart on retail prices. These studies find that consumers, especially low-income ones, save up to $18 billion a year by shopping at WalMart or at the stores of rivals who have been forced to lower their prices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0891242412463817">Business Planning Solutions, Global Insight Advisory Services Division, 2007</xref>). The geographic question implicitly raised by this analysis is this: “How and where do customers use these savings?” If they spend part of this newly found savings, it could lead to the creation or expansion of businesses both locally and far afield. Furthermore, this spending impact could extend beyond retail establishments into the health, recreation, or tourism sectors. For example, perhaps some spending could be directed into financial markets; this would result in a wider disbursement both sectorally and geographically. A mom-and-pop recreational business coming into existence far away from any WalMart may be just as much a result of this aspect of WalMart as the closing of a directly competitive mom-and-pop business on the local main street of a town with a new WalMart. However, this would not show up if a study focuses on just a particular county.</p>
<p>The critical literature suggests that WalMart sales often come at the expense of downtown smaller scale retail establishments. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0891242412463817">Stone (1988)</xref> found, for Iowa, clear negative impacts on towns in the surrounding area: Towns within a 20-mile radius of the WalMart stores saw total retail sales drop an average of 25% within five years of the opening of the nearest WalMart. However, the retail employment impact was generally positive in the town where the store was located, in part because of the employment added by WalMart itself and employment in activities complementary to the presence of a WalMart, such as pizza parlors, movie complexes, and other businesses. These segments of the retail market can benefit because shoppers from adjacent counties increase the frequency of trips to the WalMart town and shop in the complementary outlets. Later studies have suggested that this positive impact can be short-lived in places where WalMart has followed a saturation policy by placing multiple stores in adjacent counties. It is also the case that WalMart would be expected to differentially affect the sales of stores carrying food, general merchandise, furniture, building materials, and miscellaneous retail goods. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0891242412463817">Stone, Artz, and Myles (2002)</xref> extend the area of study by looking at the effect of WalMart Superstores’ impact on food stores in Mississippi as one example of a narrowly focused impact analysis. These studies are part of a large, primarily case study–based literature on WalMart’s entrance effects.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0891242412463817">3</xref></sup></p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0891242412463817">Goetz and Rupasingha (2006)</xref> introduced another important dimension to the long-run impact of WalMart and other big box operations. Most big box stores are national, or at least regional, operations. They are often headquartered in a distant location. Many activities, including legal, financial, accounting, and marketing decisions, are run from the corporate headquarters. On the other hand, local retailers are likely to buy these services from local printers, law firms, advertising firms, and accounting firms. To the extent that local retailers decline, one would expect employment in these business services to decline as well. In other words, there might be a negative impact on employment even if all displaced workers obtained employment at WalMart. Goetz and Rupasingha go one step further with this argument and posit that service club memberships may also decline as an important part of their base is lost and that big box management is less likely to be interested in such memberships.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0891242412463817">Hicks and Wilburn (2001)</xref> found that the entrance of a WalMart store led to a modest increase in the number of retail establishments, a permanent retail employment increase of roughly 54 workers, and no impact on retail wages. They also found that entrance of a WalMart in a contiguous county reduces retail employment in a county. In a nearly contemporary study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0891242412463817">Basker (2005)</xref> performed a similar analysis of a much larger sample of U.S. counties. She employed an instrument to control for endogeneity, using proxies of the planned entrance date for each store location. She reports that after an initial increase in retail employment, this effect dissipates in approximately three years to a 55-worker increase, with a modest reduction in the number of small retail firms.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0891242412463817">4</xref></sup> Basker also found very modest impacts of WalMart entrance on adjoining counties.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0891242412463817">5</xref></sup></p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0891242412463817">Sobel and Dean (2008)</xref> tested the impact of WalMart on the composition of small businesses, employing both detailed cross-sectional estimates and a spatial-autoregressive estimate. The authors find no reduction in small businesses attributable to WalMart, a result similar to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0891242412463817">Basker’s (2005)</xref> finding. This study is particularly interesting in that it addresses specifically the impact on small businesses, using spatial methods of analysis. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0891242412463817">Hicks (2009)</xref> provides a comparison of the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0891242412463817">Stone (1988)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0891242412463817">Sobel and Dean (2008)</xref>, using a county-level econometric study of Iowa. He finds no evidence that WalMart affected small businesses within the decade after WalMart began opening stores in Iowa. The question, then, is this: “If small retailers are not affected, then what kinds of retail establishments, if any, <italic>are</italic> affected?”</p>

<title>The State Before WalMart</title>
<p>The Indiana of the 1980s was no stranger to chain stores and had fully participated in the anti-chain store revole of the 1920s and 1930s. Across the country, the threat posed by such chains was sufficiently ominous to motivate associations of small retailers to successfully lobby for anti-chain store legislation in at least a dozen states. Indeed, Indiana’s anti-chain store taxes or graduated license taxes survived judicial review in 1931—one of the few judicial successes of the period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0891242412463817">Lebhar, 1952</xref>). But by the end of World War II, the nationwide expansion of chain stores was as well entrenched in Indiana as anywhere in the country. Suburban malls became the new bogey in the 1950s, a decade that also saw the advent of the first big box stores, often “membership outlets” such as Fedco, Gemco, and Memco. Target often used these stores as leverage points to enter new markets. The following quote from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0891242412463817">Ghemawat and Mark (2006)</xref> captures the long-term controversy over the introduction of new retail formats:
<disp-quote>
<p>History also provides perspective on the current clamor around WalMart. When catalog pioneers Sears and Montgomery Ward seemingly threatened small-town retailers with extinction in the 19th century, those retailers mounted an energetic counterattack. The rise of chain stores in the 1920s also provoked outcries from independent dealers and whole communities, resulting in 13 states passing chain store tax laws. The lesson for WalMart is that successful new retailing formats tend to provoke vigorous reactions—in the nonmarket as well as the market sphere.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>To clarify the distributional pattern of retail establishments in Indiana, the raw number was normalized to establishments per 1,000 residents.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0891242412463817">6</xref></sup> The raw and normalized data for total retail establishments are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0891242412463817">Table 1</xref> for the state, covering the period 1977 to 1997.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0891242412463817">7</xref></sup> The number of very small establishments fell significantly in this period. Other size classes increased over the period. Our interest is in whether the county patterns of change over this period will reveal anything about the impact of WalMart on other big box stores as well as on smaller establishments. To answer this question requires a baseline, which we develop here.</p>

<title>Scope of Our Study</title>
<p>Given this environment and history, this study focuses on the short-term impact of WalMart on retail establishments and employment in Indiana. Here, the short run is defined as the time interval between the opening of a WalMart in County X and the opening of the next WalMart within a two-county distance, with no less than one intervening county. Thus the methodology begins with finding the earliest opening dates for WalMart stores in the selected counties in Indiana and then the time intervals from those dates to the openings of subsequent WalMarts nearby. A baseline of changes in employment with respect to different sized retail establishments before the entrance of a WalMart will be determined using data on establishment and employment patterns in the retail and business services sectors of each of the surrounding counties for the periods immediately prior to the openings.</p>
<p>The retail hinterland of an existing store is likely to truncate in the direction of a new store. In the time frame of interest to us, almost no WalMarts had grocery operations, so our focus in on the general merchandisers. By the time WalMart enters many of the medium to larger cities of the Ohio Valley and surrounding states, these towns had already had years of experience with other large general merchandise discount houses, including Kmart, Zayres, and Hills (both of the latter were acquired by Ames). Some of these stores had more than 30 years’ presence before WalMart arrived but closed shortly thereafter. None of these stores fits the mom-and-pop retailer definition often used in other studies.</p>
<p>After the opening of a particular WalMart, these employment changes can take some time. Thus, although previous models have used five-year lags of WalMarts per capita at the state level to allow the effects of WalMart to become visible, for our approach this is not a usable variable. Therefore, we will use a lagged dummy variable structure instead. This permits an estimate of the duration of retail adjustment.</p>

<title>Empirical Analysis of the Impact of WalMart on Employment</title>
<p>To examine WalMart’s impact on employment in surrounding counties, we consider statewide data and a regional case study. To do so, we wish to model the impact WalMart and WalMart Supercenters have on the number of retail stores, by size category, in a county. This presents a few concerns regarding the treatment of the WalMart variable in an empirical model, the degree to which we can or should treat the endogeneity of the WalMart entrance decision, and the speed of adjustment of markets to a new WalMart. Of particular interest in this research are the size of the affected firm (is it a big box or mom-and-pop store?) and the length of time before the impact of a WalMart is felt by the retail sector.</p>
<p>To answer these questions, we report on two separate empirical models, involving what we believe are fairly straightforward strategies. The first of these is the simple disaggregation of the retail sector by firm size. We ask how many firms opened or closed as a consequence of a new WalMart, and we do so in separate empirical tests employing similar models. Second, in all the reported estimates provided in this study, we aggregate WalMarts and WalMart Supercenters. However, we treat the time dimension separately in our two reported samples. First, we use a simple approach that counts the number of years since the opening of a WalMart store. This approach has been employed elsewhere (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0891242412463817">Hicks, 2007a</xref>). In the second approach, we look at a small region, on which we can apply a more qualitative analysis. Here, we treat the lagged entrance of a WalMart store, testing successive annual lags from <italic>t</italic> to <italic>t</italic> − 3. This is similar in concept to the polynomial distributed lag approach used by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0891242412463817">Basker (2005)</xref>, but unlike her approach, we do not include cumulative effects.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0891242412463817">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>In this article, we do not make endogeneity corrections for the entrance of a WalMart. There is considerable analysis of this matter, but it is not yet a settled matter.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0891242412463817">9</xref></sup> In lieu of a formal identification strategy for the empirical section, we augment our analysis with a more detailed explanation of the speed of adjustment and of the type of firm affected. This is not an uncommon departure from a more formal identification approach, but it does offer certain concerns that can be addressed by the specific analysis provided for entrance impacts on firms by size.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0891242412463817">10</xref></sup> In other words, if we observed significant endogeneity bias in the impact, then that would fall across firms of all sizes. For example, if a WalMart entered a fast-growing county, the traditional endogeneity concern, the bias introduced by failure to identify this equation, would be in the direction of more retail firms, without regard to size. As we shall shortly report, that is not what has occurred. Thus, we believe that in our modeling efforts, the endogeneity problem that has appeared across the existing literature is largely ameliorated by our choice of firm size in the model, the results we report, and a more closely explained case study approach.</p>
<p>In our case study approach, we look not only at retail overall but also at the specific subsectors of the industry by size. Here we try to better explain what has happened in the region’s retail structure and what type of firms might have been affected by a WalMart presence, along with the speed of adjustment estimates. This is necessarily a much more limited question.</p>
<p>Our models also treat more common econometric issues involving both temporal and spatial autocorrelation. We explain these in more detail for each. The following sections outline two models. The first of these we call the state model, since it includes all 92 Indiana counties. The second, we call the substate model, since it is performed on six counties only. Both models include a pooled cross section and time series model, which we specify separately. The substate model includes a more detailed case study examining a cluster of counties surrounding a metropolitan area of Muncie, Indiana.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0891242412463817">
<title>The State Model</title>
<p>The state data set is a pooled cross section and time series data set that includes retail establishments by employment size and by county for the years 1989 to 2002.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0891242412463817">11</xref></sup> As such, it is subject to both time series and spatial-autocorrelation issues that must be addressed. Separate dummies are used for WalMarts (WMD) and WalMart Supercenters (WMSD). Since it is likely that it will take some time for the impact of either type of WalMart to be measurable, the dummy variable is multiplied by a time variable; that is, simply the number of years that have passed since the opening of either type of store (WMD × TIME and WMSD × TIME). Importantly, this single variable measures the number of years since the opening of each WalMart within a county and is not an interaction term in the traditional sense.</p>
<p>The dependent variables are the number of establishments in each size class (NES<italic>n</italic>). Data suppression issues limit the model to total retail outlets in county business pattern size categories of <italic>n</italic> = 1 to 4, 5 to 9, 10 to 19, 20 to 49, 50 to 99, 100 to 249, and 250 or more. An order one autoregressive variable is used to deal with temporal autocorrelation, AR(1). We define surrounding counties as those with a shared border or that meet at a point. The average number of establishments of the same size (<italic>n</italic>) in surrounding counties is used in an attempt to control for spatial effects of retail establishments (NES<italic>n</italic>C). A variable measuring total establishments of all types in each country is used as a scalar (EST). As indicated above, there are many factors affecting county growth in Indiana. For each county, a trend variable is used to attempt to capture these effects. The pull (or gravity) factor is defined as retail payroll per capita relative to (divided by) the state average, and measures the underexploited (PULL &lt; 1) or overexploited (PULL &gt; 1) potential for retail sales based on the share of local income spent on retail relative to the statewide share. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0891242412463817">Table 3</xref> provides the summary statistics by county of the mean establishment counts by size, probabilities of a WalMart or WalMart Supercenter, and the total establishment counts.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0891242412463817">Table 4</xref> shows the results of this estimation on the number of retail establishments after the introduction of WalMart in each county separately. The time trends are highly autoregressive, and the general trend picks up much of the change in establishments. WalMart seems to have had some effects, but not in all size classes. The most significant measured effect (both economically and statistically) is for the size class 100 to 249 (an increase of 0.475). This is the size class that appears to encompass WalMarts located in nonmetropolitan counties. Thus, the interpretation is that WalMart’s presence cost the average county 0.525 establishments in the first year but added a total of 1.21 establishments over the time of our sample. Just as important, it appears that WalMart’s effect basically falls on big box stores, which are most likely owned by out-of-state corporations. Thus, WalMart might be replacing, for the most part, stores with nonlocal management. This seems to contradict a widely held belief that WalMart hurts locally-owned subsidiary business establishments such as local printers, lawyers, financial institutions, or marketing firms.</p>

<p>Separate analysis (not reported here) restricted to nonmetropolitan counties indicates that TREND accounts for most of the changes in establishment counts. WalMart seems to have little effect on establishments of 49 workers or fewer, to have a small negative effect on establishments of between 50 and 99 employees, to reduce the number of establishments having between 100 and 249 workers by about 0.5 per year after opening, and similarly to reduce the number of competing firms by about 1.5 per year in the 250-and-more category. Since most WalMarts are in this category, the net effect is a loss of 0.5 establishments per year, a finding that is nearly identical to the results reported above, which indicates that it is the competitive big box stores that are primarily affected.</p>

<title>The Substate Model</title>
<p>To examine the more localized effects of the entrance of a WalMart, we present a case study involving those counties adjoining Delaware County in east-central Indiana. This case study focuses on providing an econometric study of a smaller, substate region. In this effort, we seek to understand whether or not a WalMart entrance results in changes to local retail structure that persists or that evolves over time. Our area of exploration is the counties of Blackford, Delaware, Grant, Henry, Jay, Madison, and Randolph. The largest of these counties, Delaware, had a 2010 population of fewer than 125,000 residents. The first two WalMarts enter this cluster in 1991. There were already 15 large retail establishments in Delaware County in 1990, including five big box discount stores. Thus, this cluster will give us a chance to examine the impact of WalMart on other big box operations as well as on small retailers (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0891242412463817">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<p>Though not an exhaustive list, this representation demonstrates a few characteristics of WalMart entrance that echo our earlier findings as well as those of other researchers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0891242412463817">Hicks, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0891242412463817">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0891242412463817">Hicks &amp; Wilburn, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0891242412463817">Sobel &amp; Dean, 2008</xref>). In general, we observe two features from this set of regressions. The first is that the changes to industry structure following a WalMart entrance are small. This is not immediately apparent, however, without exhaustively testing each category of retailer. For example, although we observe a large decline in small retail establishments almost immediately following a WalMart entrance, and for a year afterward, this is accompanied by growth in Year 2 of larger retail operations. Thus, the anecdotal decline in small businesses following a WalMart entrance may really be a pattern of post-WalMart entrance consolidation or expansion of smaller retailers into a larger size category.</p>
<p>When observing WalMart’s effect on retail subcategories, we see a very modest effect on small general merchandise, food, and furniture stores, including at least some instances where growth in the number of firms in a category occurred. We found no evidence of structural change beyond those reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0891242412463817">Table 4</xref> (and many noneffects are reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0891242412463817">Table 4</xref> as well). The changes in magnitude reported here are roughly consistent with the creation of a small strip mall: Out-parcels of larger stores replaced smaller, existing stores. Actual employment growth in retail is certainly possible in this scenario.</p>
<p>This is consistent with the argument presented in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0891242412463817">Hicks and Wilburn (2001)</xref> that WalMart stores created multicounty retail centers in more rural areas. In terms of employment, the largest potential loss is among large and medium-sized big box stores. Indeed, the loss of 0.2 competing big box retailers (general merchandise stores of 250-449 employees) included employment losses that dwarf all other effects. Importantly, since this includes a WalMart, the actual loss is greater than 1.0 big box retailer. It would seem that the largest effect of WalMart is on competing big-box format stores and continues for some time after a WalMart entrance. In the decade after our sample, the two largest big box stores, Sears and Kmart, declared bankruptcy, but Sears remained in place, and Kmart closed only one of two stores in Delaware County.</p>
<p>The other finding is the temporal adjustment to a WalMart entrance. We know the precise dates when WalMart entered, and we make no special allowance for the month, but we find immediate and first-year impacts the most common. We find 29 industries that had changes in structure in the year of WalMart’s opening and in the subsequent year. This dropped to eight in the second year and only three in the third year. We found no evidence of a fourth-year effect. Thus, it appears that the industry’s structural adjustment to a WalMart entrance is largely complete between 18 and 36 months of a new store opening.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0891242412463817">
<title>Summary and Conclusions</title>
<p>In this study, we address the questions of how the entrance of WalMart affects the local retail structure. This is not a new question, but our contribution is in testing several refutable hypotheses in the aggregate, along with a reinforcing case study involving Indiana.</p>
<p>In the first part of our study we find that there are mild economies of scale in retailing, captured especially in metropolitan area counties. We also find that WalMart does not appear to influence either the number of establishments per 1,000 or the number of employees per 1,000 in the retail sector. The analysis finds no significance of any variable for the pattern of establishment data, a lack of significance of adjacency with positive signs and significance for urban, early WalMart entrance and higher population areas. This suggests that mom-and-pop establishments are not affected by the presence of a WalMart.</p>
<p>In the state-level analysis we find that WalMart’s presence costs the average county 0.525 establishments by the end of our study period. In this part of the study it appears that WalMart’s effect is basically on big box stores, which are most likely owned by out-of-state corporations. Thus, WalMart predominantly might be replacing stores already characterized by nonlocal management. This seems to contradict a widely held belief that WalMart hurts locally-owned subsidiary business establishments.</p>
<p>In our case study, we focused on the largely rural areas surrounding the Muncie Metropolitan Statistical Area in east-central Indiana. We find that there is little evidence of widespread loss of retail establishments. Instead, we find the possibility that growth in the size or the displacement of small firms has occurred. Consistent with our state study, the largest impact in terms of employment effects occurs with the loss of competing big-box format stores. It is the Ames Department Stores, Sears, and Kmarts that seem to have suffered most when WalMart arrived. In other words, it is not the small, downtown retailers that were most affected but rather the direct competitors of WalMart that were the main losers. As such, the local retail sector demonstrates a consistency during the long-term trend, which has seen a movement from department stores to chain stores to shopping malls to membership stores to big box stores. And finally, we find that as a whole, the impacts that do occur generally run their course between 18 and 36 months of a new WalMart opening.</p>
