<abstract>
<p>Enhancement of the surface electrical conductivity is desirable in a number of applications where composite structures are exposed to environments with high electrical activity. A high surface conductivity is desirable on aircraft that can be subject to lightning strikes or in manufacturing environments where static build up can produce safety issues. This article considers the addition of various conducting fillers to a thermoplastic to enhance the conductivity of the polymer matrix. The thermoplastic is one which is conventionally used to toughen epoxy resin composites. It was found that enhancement of the resin matrix depends on the filler, method of processing and subsequent thermal treatment. Conducting data are presented on the blends containing carbon nanotubes, nanographite and carbon black in various proportions and doped and undoped with additional conducting salts. The latter have been added to the resin so as to enhance conduction between the filler particles. While the levels of conductivity are significantly lower than those observed with a pure metal skin, values are achieved, which would allow discharge of electricity within relatively short periods of time.</p>

<p>Enhancing the surface conductivity is a desirable objective for composite manufacture both in the aerospace, turbine energy generation and the electric industry. Lightning strikes and the effects of static electrical discharge are more of a problem with composites than with metal structures.</p>
<p>While most aircraft have an outer conductive aluminium skin, planes such as the Boeing 778 and the Airbus 380 contain high levels of composite structure. Aircraft often trigger lightning when flying through a heavily charged region of a cloud. The composite nose cones of many commercial aircraft are protected by imbedding metal strips in the surface of the composite.</p>
<p>Generally, the first contact with lightning is at an extremity, usually the nose cone or a wingtip. As the plane continues to fly through the areas of opposite charges, the lightning transits through the aircraft skin and exits through another extremity point, frequently the tail. In this instance, the lightning flash originates at the airplane and extends away in opposite directions. To reduce the damage from lightning strikes, it is necessary to allow the current to flow through the skin from the point of impact to some other point, without interruption or diversion to the interior of the aircraft. Estimates show that each commercial airliner averages one lighting strike per year.</p>
<p>Lightening strikes can induce problems with the electrical circuits and the effects of lightening strikes have been theoretically examined.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1464420712440528">1</xref></sup> To minimize the damage from lightening strikes, fine copper or aluminium microgrids are usually imbedded close to the outer skin of the composite. This approach is effective in reducing damage to electronic equipment housed within the fuselage and protecting vital items such as fuel tanks. Without some type of shielding, or conductive path, the electrically insulated carbon fibre/epoxy composites can be damaged, particularly at the entry and exit points for the strike. The energy deposited in a typical lightning strike involves tens of kV and 10,000–200,000 amps, occurring in a fraction of a second. More than 99.5% of natural lightning strokes measured display peak current of less than 150,000 amps.</p>
<p>The approach of imbedding copper mesh in the top most layer of the carbon fibre composite structure, while reducing the problem of lightning strikes, adds additional manufacturing costs and weight to the structure. The copper mesh provides the conducting paths close to the surface and increases the rate of electrical discharge from the matrix.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1464420712440528">1</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1464420712440528">4</xref></sup> Copper has an electrical conductivity of the order of 5.96 × 10<sup>7 </sup>S/m and aluminium an electrical conductivity of 3.5 × 0<sup>7 </sup>S/m. The conductivity of graphite in its basal plane is 3 × 10<sup>5 </sup>S/m, which while being two orders of magnitude lower than that of a metal, is still sufficiently high to allow discharge the current in times of the order of 10<sup>−7</sup> s. The thermoset resin will have a conductivity of the order of 10<sup>−12</sup> S/m with discharge times of the order of seconds or even minutes. For effective conduction in the surface layer of the composite, a target electronic conductivity of the order of 10<sup>2</sup>–10<sup>4 </sup>S/m is desirable to achieve protective screening. Protection of delicate electronic devices is often achieved by depositing metal films on the inner surface of the containers in which they are housed.</p>
<p>The current growth in wind turbines has created large composite structures which similarly require protection against static discharge. In both, the aerospace and wind turbine industries, thermoplastic toughening of epoxy resins is used to form the matrix for many structural components.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1464420712440528">5</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1464420712440528">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>Epoxy resins are intrinsically brittle materials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1464420712440528">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1464420712440528">10</xref></sup> and toughening using thermoplastics is a now an accepted approach for the design of carbon fibre–epoxy structural components. While the initial blend of thermoplastic and epoxy resin is miscible, the process of cure causes the thermoplastic and epoxy resins to phase separate and a variety of morphology may be generated which depend on the composition of the matrix, the molecular weight of the thermoplastic and its functionality.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1464420712440528">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1464420712440528">7</xref></sup> Enhancement of the mechanical properties is observed to occur around the composition at which a co-continuous phase structure is produced. Selective incorporation of conducting materials into the thermoplastic phase would allow the creation of percolation paths which would enhance the intrinsic conductivity of the epoxy and thermoplastic matrices. Pre-dispersion of conducting fillers within the thermoplastic phase provides a convenient method of increasing conductivity of epoxy resin based composites.</p>
<p>In this article, a variety of potential intrinsically conducting materials are investigated in a thermoplastic polyethersulphone (PES) matrix. The effects induced as a consequence of the processing method used to create the precursors fibres are explored. A simple method for the enhancement of the conductivity of carbon fibres is also explored. For completeness, two other engineering thermoplastics were investigated; polyetheretherketone (PEEK) and polyetherketoneketone (PEKK). Conceptually, fibres of these composite blends would be incorporated in the epoxy and create conducting paths in the final cured matrix.</p>
<p>The study also investigates a simple treatment to enhance the conductivity carbon fibre reinforcement which would avoid the necessity of incorporation of the thermoplastic fibres.</p>

<p>A number of fillers were investigated in an attempt to increase the conductivity of the thermoplastics resin, these include: multi-wall carbon nanotubes, conducting carbon blacks and exfoliated graphite flakes. A low molecular weight conducting salt, tetrathiafulvalene-7,7′,8,8′-tetracyanonitroquinodimethane (TTF:TCNQ) was added to certain of these composites to enhance the conductivity of the base resin phase.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1464420712440528"><title>Preparation of samples for measurement</title>
<p>A master batch of PES with the appropriate filler was created by adding the filler to a 10% w/w solution of the polymer in chloroform. The blends were then transferred to a 7 cm diameter dish and the solvent left to evaporate over night on a desiccator attached to a vacuum. The solid obtained by evaporation was then ground into a powder using a coffee grinder and discs pressed with thicknesses ranging from 0.5 to 1.2 mm, using a 13 mm IR dye and a compaction pressure of 5000 tons. Five samples of each formulation were created and the average values reported.</p>
<p>Materials with different compositions were created by blending the master batch with appropriate quantities of polymer using a process of dry blending which was carried out over a period of 2–3 h. The mixture of solids was placed in a large ceramic cylinder sealed at both ends and rolled for a period of 4 h. The cylinder contained large pebbles which had been subjected to acid cleaning. The blend process was carried out until powder was homogeneous in appearance.</p>
<p>Solutions blends were created as for the master batch, but the final compositions were created without further processing other than grinding the solid obtained on evaporation.</p>

<sec id="sec5-1464420712440528"><title>Measurement methods for electrical conductivity</title>
<p>The primary method used for electrical measurement was the four-point probe technique,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1464420712440528">11</xref></sup> and involves clamping the sample in a defined configuration and contacts are made via four spring-loaded metal probes, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1464420712440528">Figure 1</xref>. A current was passed between probes 1 and 4 and the resultant voltage measured using probes 2 and 3. In order to obtain consistency of data, typically five separate measurements would be made of each sample.

<p>The surface electrical conductivity of the typical carbon fibre composite is defined by the electrical conductivity of the carbon fibres and the contacts which one makes with another. To enhance the surface conductivity and reduce the risk from lightning strikes, enhancement of the rate of static discharge across the surface is desirable. The challenge is therefore to increase the surface conductivity of the composite and a number of approaches are explored in this article.

<list-item><p>Doping of the thermoplastic matrix to increase the matrix conductivity.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>Separate experiments were conducted to assess the maximum enhancement which might be obtained by adopting each of these strategies. An acceptable level of conductivity for rapid discharge would be 10<sup>4 </sup>S/m and this would give discharge times of the order of 10<sup>−6</sup>–10<sup>−9</sup> s.</p>
<sec id="sec7-1464420712440528"><title>Embedding a polymeric conducting layer in the surface</title>
<p>This approach mimics that of embedding copper mesh in a polymer matrix. For this to be effective, conductivities of the order of 10<sup>2</sup>–10<sup>4 </sup>S/m are desirable within the surface of the film. Intrinsically, conducting polymeric materials with densities of ∼1.5 g/cm<sup>3</sup> are significantly lighter than copper, which has a density of 8.9 g/cm<sup>3</sup>. The electrical conductivity of copper is 5.69 × 10<sup>7 </sup>S/m; however, the surface conductivity imparted by the embedded mesh will be expected to be significantly lower due to the insulating nature of the resin and would lead to values of the order of 10<sup>4 </sup>S/m being observed depending on the thickness of the surface resin layer and nature of the matrix. Hence, replacing a copper mesh by a polymeric conducting polymer would achieve an important weight saving, provided an acceptable level of surface conductivity can be achieved. The most readily available and potentially useful polymeric intrinsic conductor is the doped polypyrrole. The polymer is grown electrochemically and is available either as a powder or a thin film, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1464420712440528">Table 1</xref>. The thin film might be embedded in the top layer of a composite, whereas the powder might be extruded to form fibres which could be embedded in the surface, analogous to the use of copper mesh.</p>
<sec id="sec8-1464420712440528"><title>Conductivity of polypyrrole</title>
<p>Polypyrrole is an intrinsic polymeric conductor and is available either as a thin film or in a compressed powder form. Thin films were produced at Strathclyde using a method described previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1464420712440528">12</xref></sup> and purchased from BASF. Polypyrrole in powder form was obtained from Sigma–Aldrich, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1464420712440528">Table 1</xref>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec9-1464420712440528"><title>Electrochemically synthesized polypyrrole</title>
<p>Thin films of polypyrrole created at Strathclyde were grown using gold on chrome electrodes and a potential between 0.68 and 0.8 V. The film thicknesses obtained varied with the growth voltage and are summarized with the conductivities in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1464420712440528">Table 2</xref>. Films were grown with different thicknesses and different growth potentials. The conductivity of the films varied with the growth voltage, confirming previous observations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1464420712440528">12</xref></sup> The growth voltage controls the nature of the polymer which is created and the level of incorporation of the doping ions. For comparison purposes, measurements were made on a commercial polypyrrole film obtained from BASF, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1464420712440528">Table 1</xref>. Measurements were made on five strips cut from the same piece of film. A small variation is observed in the values reflecting typical changes in the surface conductivity as a consequence of the growth method. The variations in the values for the Strathclyde grown films are within an acceptable scatter for this type of production method. The lower values obtained from the BASF films may be attributed to differences in the method used for the growth of the films, both materials having been obtained using sodium salt of <italic>p</italic>-toluene sulphonic acid as the electrolyte. Thin films of the powdered polypyrrole obtained from Sigma–Aldrich were prepared using an IR disc press. Five discs were prepared and measured, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1464420712440528">Table 2</xref>.

<p>The lower values of the conductivity for the compressed discs may be attributed to the resistance between the individual particulate on the overall conductivity. In previous studies,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1464420712440528">12</xref></sup> it has been noted that changes in the degree of quaternization of the nitrogen atoms has a significant effect on the electrical conductivity. The thin films of both the Strathclyde and BASF materials were exposed to various concentrations of nitric and hydrochloric acids, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1464420712440528">Table 2</xref>. In the case of HCl doping, the conductivity is observed to increase for both the BASF and Strathclyde grown films. The increase in conductivity is attributed to an increase in the quaternization of the nitrogen and the increased mobility of the chloride ion. The decrease in the conductivity in the case of the BASF film is attributed to ion exchange and a lower mobility of the larger nitrate compared with the chloride ion. The ion exchange of the larger <italic>p</italic>-toluene sulphonate by the smaller chloride ion is accompanied by a 12.8% loss of thickness of the film and a 24.6% loss of mass.</p>
<p>The conductivity achieved with the doped polymer is ∼10<sup>−4</sup> of that of pure copper, but will approach values which would be comparable for an embedded copper mesh. The embedding of an intrinsically conducting polymer close to the surface represents a possible approach to increasing the surface conductivity of insulating composites.</p>

<p>Similar to the acid treatment of the polypyrrole, enhancement of the conductivity of the carbon fibres was observed to decrease after treatment with the highest acid concentration. Studies by Nohara et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1464420712440528">13</xref></sup> on the effects of acid treatment of carbon fibres have shown that HCl does not significantly modify the topography of the fibre surface and no defects were introduced. However, HNO<sub>3</sub> exhibited increased surface roughening and etching consistent with its oxidative action. The electrical conductivity values obtained are significantly higher than those observed with the intrinsically conducting polymers. The acid treatment of carbon fibres may therefore be a simpler approach to enhancing surface conductivity rather than attempting to embed conducting polymers in the surface. The highest value observed ∼14,612 S/m is only 0.03% of that of copper, but are 10 times that of the intrinsically conducting polymer. The acid treatment of carbon fibres therefore presents a process which could be used for the enhancement of surface conductivity without increasing the weight of the structure. Previous studies of the acid treatment of carbon fibres for use of these materials as pH sensors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1464420712440528">12</xref></sup> have indicated that there is a slow reduction in the conductivity over a period of a year, but the changes which occur are typically less than 10% of the initial value. Clearly, contact with alkaline species will increase the pH and will lower the surface conductivity.</p>

<sec id="sec11-1464420712440528"><title>Enhancement of the conductivity of the matrix</title>
<p>Whether copper mesh or acid-treated carbon fibres were used, the main inhibition to surface conductivity will be the matrix material. Epoxy resins are toughened with thermoplastic and this provides a suitable method of introducing conducting fillers into the matrix. In principle, incorporation of nanotubes into the thermoplastic matrix should achieve a very high conductivity; however, the relative high costs of nanotubes indicate that alternative approaches should be sought. In this study, enhancement of the conductivity was explored using nanographite as the main conducting additive. Nanographite is produced by exfoliation of graphite flake, and while exfoliated to the level of grapheme is not necessarily achieved, the material created will have dimensions approaching those of a single layer thickness. The dispersion of the nanographite in the polymer matrix is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1464420712440528">Figure 2</xref>, and is consistent with the manufacturer’s claims of exfoliation of the graphite to a nanodimensions. The electron micrographs would suggest that the platelets are in the stack of ∼10–20 platelets.
<fig id="fig2-1464420712440528" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Scanning electron micrographs of exfoliated nanographite platelets.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1464420712440528-fig2.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>This material is relatively cheap and hence of practical interest. Studies were undertaken of dispersions produced by solution blending of the nanographite and the thermoplastic. At low-polymer loading, the electrical conductivity was comparable to that of the polymer, but increased to a significant level once the loading had exceeded 20%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1464420712440528">Figure 3</xref>.
<fig id="fig3-1464420712440528" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>Conductivity of solution blended and dry blended nanographite discs.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1464420712440528-fig3.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>A more practical approach was to dry blend the polymer and nanographite which was then pressed into a disc. The dry blending was carried out by mixing the polymer and nanographite for a period of about 4 h in a continuously rotated cylinder which was loaded with large acid-cleaned pebbles. The conductivity data for discs with varying amounts of nanographite are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1464420712440528">Figure 3</xref>. The percolation threshold is approximately 8%, with the highest conductivity being 7.4–9.2 × 10<sup>2 </sup>S/m when the loading was 80%. With the dry blending, percolation is achieved at lower concentrations. At low concentrations, there is minimal overlap between the nanographite flakes, and the conductivity is proportionally lower than at higher concentrations where a percolation network is established. In order to ascertain the maximum possible conductivity achievable, discs of pure nanographite were also made. The maximum conductivity achieved was 1 × 10<sup>3</sup> S/m for the 80% nanographite composite.</p>
<p>The solution blended material will be expected to have achieved better exfoliation of the nanographite platelets allowing greater polymer penetration between layers and a higher loading is necessary to achieve connectivity. The dry blended material will be less well exfoliated and pre-existing platelet contacts allow conductivity to be achieved at lower loadings.</p>
<p>These values are higher than those for the polypyrrole thin films, but lower than those observed for the acid-modified carbon fibres. The pure nanographite had a conductivity of 6 × 10<sup>4 </sup> S/m<sup>−1</sup>. If we assume that the limiting conductivity is a consequence of the barrier to free-electron mobility between flakes, then it may be possible to increase the conductivity by blending nanographite with carbon nanotubes. Carbon nanotubes have a very high aspect ratio and can extend over distances of several microns.</p>
<sec id="sec12-1464420712440528"><title>Nanographite blended with carbon nanotubes</title>
<p>A matrix containing 10% of nanographite was selected for this study and varying amounts of carbon nanotubes were directly dry blended with the nanographite, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1464420712440528">Figure 4</xref>. As with the nanographite, the mixture was rolled in a cylinder with large clean pebbles for a period of 4 h. The conductivity of the pure nanotubes was found to be 8.3 × 10<sup>2 </sup>S/m, which is approximately two orders of magnitude less than the pure nanographite, which has a conductivity of 6.2 × 10<sup>4 </sup>S/m. The apparent low conductivity of the nanotubes may be attributed to a lack of active contacts allowing easy electron transfer between individual carbon nanotubes. The conductivity of individual nanotubes have been reported to be 2 × 10<sup>5 </sup>S/m, which is significantly higher than the values measured for compressed discs of the material.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1464420712440528">13</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1464420712440528">15</xref></sup> The loss of conductivity reflects the major effects which fibre contacts have on the bulk conductivity. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1464420712440528">Figure 4</xref> indicates that starting from a base conductivity of 5 × 10<sup>2</sup> S/m, the conductivity rises to a value of ∼1.45 × 10<sup>3</sup> S/m with the addition of 10% nanotubes, after which there is no further enhancement in conductivity achieved.

<p>The observed enhancement in the electrical conductivity may be attributed to the ability of the rod-like nanotubes to bridge some gaps between the platelet structures of the nanographite.

<p>The nanotubes are an order of magnitude smaller than the graphite flakes, but are able to interact with the surface of the flakes providing an easy path for electron transfer between flakes.

<sec id="sec13-1464420712440528"><title>Nanographite blended with conducting carbon black</title>
<p>Blends of nanographite and conducting carbon black were investigated as a less expensive alternative to the use of carbon nanotubes. The conductivity of 10% nanographite with increasing quantities of conducting carbon blacks (Vulcan XC72 and Vulcan XC605) were measured, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1464420712440528">Figure 6</xref>. The conductivity was observed to decrease with increasing levels of carbon black in both cases. The conductivity of the pure carbon black was found to be 6.5 × 10<sup>2 </sup> S/m in the case of the Vulcan XC72 and 4.5 × 10<sup>2 </sup> S/m for Vulcan XC605. These values of conductivity are lower than the values for nanographite (6.2 × 10<sup>4 </sup> S/m), which indicates that conductivity enhancement cannot be achieved by the use of carbon black alone. The observed decrease in the conductivity with increased carbon black loading can be attributed to the disruption which the carbon black introduces between the platelets and decreases the number of effective contacts. The carbon black particles are spherical, although in principle they can form conducting paths they appear to be less effective than the nanoplatelets or nanotubes.

<p>In practice, the incorporation of the conducting phase would be by extrusion of fibres of the thermoplastic phase.

Fibres were created with varying amounts of nanographite with compositions in the range 0–70% of nanographite. The conductivity data, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-1464420712440528">Figure 11</xref>, indicates that as with the blends an increase is observed with the increase in nanographite level.
<fig id="fig11-1464420712440528" position="float"><label>Figure 11.</label><caption><p>Variation of conductivity with %nanographite for bended and extruded (▪) materials.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1464420712440528-fig11.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>It can be seen from the graph that the conductivity exponentially increases with the increase in graphite concentration, as expected. Both graphs follow the same curve, though the conductivity of the extruded material is always less than that of the directly blended material. For purposes of comparison, the 40% blends will be discussed. The directly blended material at this loading level has a conductivity of 7.2–7.7 × 10<sup>3 </sup>S/m compared with a conductivity of 4.0–6.5 S/m, which is a difference of three orders of magnitude. The possibility exists that nanographite could be lost during the extrusion process; however, microanalysis indicated that there had been no loss of carbon during the extrusion process and therefore the loss in conductivity must be attributed to a fewer number of contacts between the graphite sheets in the extruded material compared with the compressed samples. A sample of 10% nanographite blend was extruded a total of three times and a progressive decrease in the conductivity was observed going from 4.0 to 6.5 S/m after the first extrusion to a value of 4.7–5.2 × 10<sup>−6</sup> on the third extrusion. The extrusion process will increase the alignment in the extrusion direction and appears to be aiding the dispersion, inserting polymer between the platelets, leading to a lowering of the conductivity.</p>
<p>The loss in conductivity is probably also a consequence of degradation of the platelets on extrusion but could also be related to effects in the polymer phase. A sample was exposed in an oven for an hour at 270 °C, the temperature of the extruder die. The conductivity was found to fall from 5.2 × 10<sup>2 </sup>S/m to 1.2–1.4 × 10<sup>2 </sup>S/m and did not drop further after subsequent exposure overnight which implies that the matrix is not a determining factor in defining the conductivity.</p>
<p>SEM images of the materials of the extruded material indicated that a better dispersion of the platelets was being achieved, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-1464420712440528">Figure 12</xref>. In an attempt to bridge between the graphite platelets, carbon nanotubes and carbon black were added to the 10% nanographite to see if the after-processing conductivity could be improved, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1464420712440528">Table 5</xref>. There is a small increase with the addition of 5% nanotubes and a slightly greater increase with the addition of 20% carbon black.

An additional factor in blends of materials would be differences in work function between components such as nanographite, nanotubes and carbon black.

The density of PEEK is 1.263 g/cm<sup>−3</sup> for the amorphous and 1.400 g/cm<sup>−3</sup> for the crystalline phase.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1464420712440528">23</xref></sup> The measured value for the blend is 1.37 g/cm<sup>−3</sup> which implies that the matrix contains some amorphous material but also contains a significant amount of crystalline material. The initiation of crystal growth has been studied by Park and Kim<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1464420712440528">22</xref></sup> who have shown nucleation occurring from the surface of the carbon fibre and growing into the matrix. Kalika and Krishnaswamy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1464420712440528">20</xref></sup> have studied the influence of crystallinity on the dielectric properties of PEEK and at room temperature and observed that there was a large effect of the crystalline phase on the sub- <italic>T</italic><sub>g</sub> − <italic>β</italic> relaxation process. The strength of the <italic>β</italic> relaxation process was substantially decreased and the relaxation frequency moved to higher temperatures. Increase in the degree of crystallinity is inhibiting the charge migration in the matrix. However, in these blends, it is increasing the conductivity of the composite. This implies that the growth of microcrystallites from the surface of the nanographite is increasing the connectivity of the platelets in the case of the PEEK. This argument is consistent with the findings of Park and Kim<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1464420712440528">22</xref></sup> in terms of the effects of crystallinity on the mechanical properties of similar composite materials. The PEKK blend has a low density of 1.22 g/cm<sup>−3</sup> and this would be consistent with a lower crystallinity and smaller driving force for achieving connectivity than in the case of PEEK. As these are the most conductive materials, the density levels cannot be wholly responsible for the conductivity levels reported. However, the PES copolymer has a density of 1.35 g/cm<sup>−3</sup> which would imply that it should exhibit a positive effect from crystallization on the connectivity of the graphite platelets. The conductivity data clearly indicate that this is not the case. It would therefore appear that in this latter case, crystal growth does not aid the achievement of connectivity of the nanographite platelets. The presence of crystalline regions would increase the possibility of interfacial polarization effects which will also influence the observed level of conductivity.</p>
<p>Studies of the effects of the addition of carbon nanotubes to PEEK and compatibilized blends with a PES-type copolymer reflect the large effects which small amounts of such materials can have on the physical properties.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1464420712440528">19</xref></sup> The addition of small amounts of carbon nanotubes leads to an increase in the electrical conductivity of the composites, a 1% addition raising the conductivity from 10<sup>−3</sup> S/m to a value of 10<sup>−2</sup> S/m. Studies of mechanical properties indicate that incorporation of the carbon nanotubes is significantly influencing the morphology of the composite and hence the physical properties. Similar effects have been reported for other PES and PEKK systems.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1464420712440528">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1464420712440528">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>A detailed study of the effects of the incorporation of fillers on the crystallization of these blends will be the subject of a future paper.</p>

<p>The aim of this study was to explore ways in which the conductivity of a toughened carbon fibre composite might be enhanced to give it greater surface conductivity. Although studies on model systems indicated that some candidate systems might provide enhanced conductivity, processing of the materials using a twin screw extruder produced materials with relatively low conductivity. Acid treatment of carbon fibre significantly enhanced the conductivity of the fibre and provides a potential method of achieving the desired enhancement of the surface conductivity. The introduction of TTF/TCNQ can has a significant effect in increasing the ability for charge hopping between conducting entities to occur. Enhancement in conductivity can be achieved using nanotubes and carbon black. The enhancement using nanotubes was not as dramatic as had been expected and comparable enhancement was obtained using relatively cheap conducting carbon black. Comparison of the PEEK, PEKK and PES copolymer reveals the possible effects that crystallinity can have on the connectivity of the nanographite platelets. In the case of PEEK, the crystalline growth enhances the connectivity, whereas in the case of the PEKK and PES copolymer a lower level of connectivity is achieved.</p>
