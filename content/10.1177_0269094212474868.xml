<p><bold>Reviewed by:</bold> Deian Hopkin, National Library of Wales, UK</p>
<p>This is an optimistic book. Writing at a time when participation in local elections, parliamentary by-elections and, most recently, elections to the new local Police Commissioners, are at an all-time low, Hugh Atkinson suggests that local democracy is actually alive and well. He argues that the well-documented decline in formal involvement in politics has been countered by an increase in informal participation and in community activity of all kinds, albeit less well described or clearly analysed. He draws on the metaphor offered by the distinguished American political scientist Robert <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269094212474868">Putnam (2000)</xref> in his influential study of American civil society, <italic>Bowling Alone: The Collapse and Revival of American Community,</italic> where the civic space is compared to a garden, capable of being cultivated by assiduous enthusiasts. Putnam had observed that the palpable decline in the membership of formal organisations was offset by increased involvement in individual participation in the activities for which such organisations were designed; the eponymous illustration was the sport of bowling where he observed there were far more individual bowlers than members of bowling organisations. The metaphor was, indeed, intended as an antidote to his more dismal analysis.</p>
<p>In a sense this is Hugh Atkinson’s theme too. While there may be apathy in the observable levels of voting, turn-out, membership or formal subscription, there is much more activity beneath the surface. While formal political organisations are in obvious decline, he argues that voter panels and neighbourhood groups thrive and that there is renewed interest in local referenda and the like. While Conservative Governments in the 1980s and 1990s encouraged public participation in the delivery of local services, not least through the development of broader-based local school governing bodies, the election of the Labour Government in 1997 altered the intellectual rationale, even expressing it in an early form of ‘localism’, something which, in the current debate over the virtues or other of the ‘Big Society’ is often overlooked. The notion of the citizen as consumer was as clearly articulated by the Blair Government as the present Coalition Government, while the use of customer satisfaction surveys was given even greater emphasis than hitherto. It was also the Labour Government which began the development of academies, free of local authority control, now supplemented by ‘free’ schools, both of which reduce even further the power of local authorities and, it is argued, enhance the influence of citizens. And it was under Labour that the first local mayor was elected, a process which is gradually developing as a counter to the councillariat.</p>
<p>In order to demonstrate the evolution of formal and informal public engagement, the book is divided into seven sections, ranging from a discussion of theories of community engagement through to an analysis of formal and informal ways of engaging and including a brief discussion of regeneration, sustainability and public engagement with these topics. The style is accessible, if occasionally heavily structured, while the material is drawn from a wide range of current and recent research. This is a synopsis rather than a piece of empirical research but it provides a useful route to understand what is being said and argued in the field and offers a distinctive view of local democracy.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the quite extensive account of participation and engagement does omit one important element, presumably because insufficient research evidence is available. Levels of participation are given in absolute or relative numbers, such as the number of voluntary organisations and the number of volunteer hours per head of population in Burnley or Harrogate, or the levels of participation in the Duke of Edinburgh’s Award scheme. What we do not discover are the socio-economic characteristics of these participants. How many of the local activists were graduates, for example, or belonged to the professional classes? Indeed, it would be rather surprising if they were not; for example an analysis of the early 20th-century members of the Independent Labour Party, precursors of the modern Labour Party, has revealed a disproportionately high proportion of professional and middle-class members and a corresponding absence of unskilled or semi-skilled workers despite the rhetoric and claims of the party as a vehicle for the working class. That, of course is familiar to political scientists who have studied left-wing and revolutionary movements from Russia to China but it is also familiar to students of pressure groups. A correlation, therefore, with such socio-economic variables might reveal the true extent of contemporary participation in local democracy and degree to which it is really a ‘public’ activity or a congeries of private acts.</p>
<p>It might also be argued, of course, that active participation in the public sphere is related to the ability to participate. Recent evidence in a survey of the use of the Internet in Wales, for example, reveals that while 73% of the population appears to have access to the Internet and thus to a range of important facilities and sources of knowledge, the remainder who have no such access are drawn very largely from the poorest 10% of communities and are the very people who are likely to suffer most as local libraries and other facilities close. If access to new technology is largely restricted to those who have the requisite financial resources and personal skills, might this not also be the case with civic participation, whether school management or even voluntary groups?</p>
<p>This is a book dealing with the decade and a half from 1997, but the analysis and conclusion might have been even more revealing if the time frame were longer. Reference is made, on numerous occasions, to the policies and attitudes of ministers and political leaders in the Thatcher and Major eras. The question is how far the most recent policy proposals, not least the Big Society, are a return to unfinished business and the direction of travel which Nicholas Ridley or Eric Pickles, as the controversial leader of Bradford Council, were advocating with such passion in the 1980s?</p>
<p>Finally there is an inter-generational issue. Again, it would be valuable to learn something of the age profile of the activists to which Hugh Atkinson and others have referred. One of the problems of seeking to explain individual behaviour within society is the speed with which the cultural parameters are changing. Civic engagement in the past has relied on physical contact and communication, notably through canvassers and street campaigners. However, as we have seen in the US and elsewhere, social media are becoming an ever more effective way of engaging electors although it is much more difficult to measure their presence. We do not know, for example, how differently young people behave in the political arena given their reliance on social media and mobile communications and the degree to which they interact with invisible groups and associations spread across far wider geographical boundaries; this might well be a topic Hugh Atkinson and others might examine in future.</p>
<p>This is a useful analysis which brings together a number of strands in support of a central argument which departs from much received opinion and offers a counter to those who argue that local democracy is failing. Whether the current fashion for informal participation and voluntarism lasts the pace is another matter because a longer historical perspective shows how there is an ebb and flow in the organisation of local public affairs. Indeed we have yet to discover what the true impact of the current, deep cuts in public expenditure and the intriguing dichotomies between centralisation and privatisation will have on the structures of local democracy and the appetite for participation in it. But that is a different subject for another day.</p>
