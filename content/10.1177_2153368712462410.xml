<abstract>
<p>This is an empirical study which uses a multifactorial risk framework to investigate the factors that influence the prevalence and frequency of offending by indigenous Australians (as measured through self-reported arrest rates). The study uses regression modeling of data from the 2002 National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Survey to estimate the effects of a range of individual, family, and community factors on indigenous arrest rates. The study considers a range of explanatory factors and includes both “standard” and “culturally specific” influences. Drawing upon the works of Homel, Lynch, and Herd, Broadhurst, and other Australian researchers, the study investigates the influence of multiple risk factors (including factors such as cultural strength and connection to community) and assesses whether these play a part in explaining the interaction between the indigenous population and the Australian criminal justice system.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The overrepresentation of Aboriginal people in the criminal justice system has emerged as one of the most intractable social issues facing contemporary Australia. In all Australian states and territories, arrest and imprisonment rates of the indigenous population far exceed those of the nonindigenous population. In 2011, the national indigenous imprisonment rate was 14 times greater than the nonindigenous rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2153368712462410">Australian Bureau of Statistics [ABS], 2011</xref>). The rate differential was greatest in Western Australia (WA), where the imprisonment rate of indigenous adults was more than 18 times that of nonindigenous adults. Arrest rates also vary markedly. In 2006 in WA, the annual arrest rate for the indigenous population was 15 per 100 residents, compared with 2 per 100 for the nonindigenous population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-2153368712462410">Fernandez, Walsh, Maller, &amp; Wrapson, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Researchers have made repeated attempts to identify and explain the reasons for this disparity. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-2153368712462410">Cunneen and Robb (1987</xref>) provided a dual explanation for the overrepresentation of Aboriginal people. They attributed cause to a combination of socioeconomic factors and overpolicing (or, at least, <italic>differential</italic> policing that in turn led to higher contact levels) and argued that both of these factors were influenced by “a strong historical continuity in the position of Aboriginal people in white society” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-2153368712462410">Cunneen &amp; Robb, 1987</xref>, p. 220). The landmark Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody (RCIADIC; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-2153368712462410">Johnston, 1991</xref>) also attributed cause to systemic factors as well as to higher rates of offending. Both of these factors were, in turn, underscored by underlying social and economic circumstances. According to the RCIADIC:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>The single significant contributing factor to incarceration is the disadvantaged and unequal position of Aboriginal people in Australian society in every way, whether socially, economically or culturally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-2153368712462410">Johnston, 1991</xref>, volume 1, p. 15).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Although disadvantage (social and economic) is popularly viewed as the most dominant “cause” of racial disparities in arrest rates, some scholars have argued that drug and alcohol abuse are more important, contemporary causes of indigenous contact with the justice system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-2153368712462410">Homel, Lynch, &amp; Herd, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-2153368712462410">Pearson, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-2153368712462410">Weatherburn, 2008</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-2153368712462410">
<title>Theoretical Explanations for Indigenous Overrepresentation</title>
<p>There are disputes at a theoretical level concerning the mechanism/mechanisms through which disadvantage and other factors lead to overrepresentation in the justice system. At least three traditional criminological theories—strain theory, social control, and social disorganization—attribute <italic>different</italic> connective processes between disadvantage and crime. Other theoretical perspectives (e.g., labeling theory, subculture theory, and conflict theory) have also been used to provide an explanation for the overrepresentation of indigenous people in the justice system. Some, like conflict theory, concentrate less on social disadvantage and more on power relations, while others focus on the interaction effects of dealing with formal criminal justice interventions (labeling; systemic bias; net widening).</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2153368712462410">Broadhurst (1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2153368712462410">2002</xref>) is one of the few researchers to have tested one theory of indigenous offending (culture conflict) against another (socioeconomic/strain theory). Using a comparative, cross-jurisdictional approach, he assessed various measures of “cultural strength” (e.g., population size, land occupation, language and land retention) and measures of socioeconomic “stress” (e.g., unemployment, poor housing, low incomes, alcohol problems) against a range of crime measures. Indicators for each theory were found to be highly correlated with state punitiveness (i.e., arrest rates and imprisonment rates). In his earlier work, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2153368712462410">Broadhurst (1997</xref>) found cultural strength and stress to be highly correlated to the extent that “either index could be regarded as interchangeable” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2153368712462410">Broadhurst, 1997</xref>, p. 461). He concludes that an <italic>integrated</italic> conflict-stress model is more useful in explaining Aboriginal criminalization.</p>
<p>Broadhurst’s (1997, 2002) synthesised, multifactorial explanation is constructive in that it considers a range of interrelated issues which define the context of modern Aboriginal life. These issues include the effects of social and economic marginalization, the effect of discrimination and systemic bias within the justice system, the history of colonization and links between welfare intervention and criminalization.</p>
<p>Other Australian researchers have also recognized the interrelatedness of factors associated with indigenous offending. Using a developmental/risk-factor framework, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-2153368712462410">Homel and colleagues (1999</xref>) drew on a variety of data sources (including data from the Queensland Sibling Study and supplementary data from interviews with indigenous community workers) to enumerate a number of “standard” risk/protective factors that indigenous people share with the mainstream community (such as child abuse, school failure, the quality of parenting, and the supportive family &amp; social environments) as well as other factors that were argued to be specific to indigenous Australians. The researchers hypothesized that a number of other “culturally specific” factors were likely to be associated with indigenous offending. These included forced removals, (welfare) dependence, systemic racism, substance use, and some cultural features. As protective factors against offending, they identified aspects of cultural resilience, personal controls, and family controls. The study itself did not undertake complex statistical analyses, though it called for such work to be done so as to make “explicit the many connections between such phenomena as forced removals or institutionalized racism on the one hand, and specific community characteristics, family processes or oppositional behaviours on the other” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-2153368712462410">Homel et al., 1999</xref>, p. 192).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-2153368712462410">
<title>Quantitative Studies</title>
<p>Few empirical studies of indigenous offending have successfully included the sorts of standard and culturally specific factors that Homel and his colleagues have advocated. One important reason for this has been the lack of suitable data sets; another obstacle is the challenge of defining suitable/valid measures for each of the proposed explanatory factors.</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-2153368712462410">Walker and McDonald (1995</xref>) undertook one of the earliest post-RCIADIC studies that linked Aboriginal interaction with the justice system with some of the more traditional or standard risk factors associated with higher offending rates. Linking imprisonment data to education and employment, the researchers reasoned that crime was problematic in Aboriginal communities because of a lack of employment and educational opportunities. They argued that policies aimed at improving social and economic conditions were far more likely to have an effect on reducing indigenous imprisonment rates. Subsequent research has confirmed a strong association between indigenous arrest rates and employment status, and there have been repeated calls for improvement to indigenous labor force participation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2153368712462410">Borland &amp; Hunter, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-2153368712462410">Hunter, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Three subsequent quantitative studies have made further inroads into the inclusion of a broader range of standard and culturally specific factors in the analysis of the causes of indigenous offending. Making use of self-report data collected by the ABS through the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander (NATSI) surveys, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-2153368712462410">Hunter (2001</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-2153368712462410">Weatherburn, Snowball, and Hunter (2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-2153368712462410">2008</xref>) engaged in multivariate statistical analyses to model the influence of a range of factors on indigenous contact with the justice system. In the earlier study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-2153368712462410">Hunter (2001</xref>) used data from the 1994 survey to estimate a model of arrest rate (i.e., the likelihood that a person being arrested in the previous 5 years). Of the variables included in the model, six were identified as having major significance: gender, age, labor force status, alcohol consumption, whether a victim of an assault and educational attainment. Hunter’s results were robust in that the findings did not change much when the analysis was applied to subgroups of the population. There was little difference between sexes, between young and old, and between those who had been imprisoned and not.</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-2153368712462410">Weatherburn and colleagues (2006</xref>) used data from NATSISS 2002 survey to estimate two models of indigenous contact with justice—one which modeled (ever) being charged by police and the other which modeled being imprisoned. Like <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-2153368712462410">Hunter (2001</xref>), Weatherburn et al. found that alcohol and substance misuse, employment options, and educational attainment were three of the most significant factors to influence both outcomes. Other factors, such as financial stress, overcrowded living conditions, and being a member of the “stolen generation,” were also found to increase the risk of being charged or imprisoned.</p>
<p>The same researchers undertook a further study of the correlates of indigenous arrest, again using the 2002 NATSISS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-2153368712462410">Weatherburn et al., 2008</xref>). Their models included factors such as economic stress, welfare dependence, and unemployment. They found that these factors were strongly correlated with whether or not an indigenous respondent has been arrested and with the number of times an indigenous respondent has been arrested in the past 5 years. Alcohol abuse was identified as the strongest correlate.</p>

<title>Limitations of Previous Studies</title>
<p>Each of these NATSISS-based studies represents an advance on past empirical studies of indigenous overrepresentation. The works complement the sociological analyses provided by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-2153368712462410">Homel et al. (1999</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2153368712462410">Cunneen (2001</xref>) and provide the statistical rigor and empirical evidence-base needed to drive policy changes. Notwithstanding, these studies have been incomplete in that the range of standard and culturally specific risk and protective factors included in analyses has been limited. Apart from the inclusion of variables on forced removal and welfare dependence, the range of risk/protective factors included in the analyses are fairly typical of those known to affect delinquency generally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2153368712462410">Farrington, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-2153368712462410">Loeber &amp; Farrington, 1998</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section5-2153368712462410">
<title>What Kinds of Culturally Specific Factors?</title>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-2153368712462410">Homel et al. (1999</xref>) propose a range of culturally specific factors that could and should be added to the standard lists typically used in risk factor research. Practices such as the structured use of fighting and swearing behaviors, congregating (and drinking) in public spaces, and the separation of authority between parents and police were identified as “cultural practices” that either directly or indirectly increase the likelihood of coming to the attention of the police. However, not all “cultural practices” are seen as risk factors. Other aspects of culture, such as factionalism, negotiability, and mobility, are argued to offer resilience or protection from police and justice-system contact. Land claims, too, are argued to offer protection. According to the researchers, the existence of land claims “strengthen Aboriginal communities by giving them a voice, coalescing individuals and groups, and giving rise to strong Aboriginal organizations which in turn provide sites of resistance and stronger definitions of community” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-2153368712462410">Homel et al., 1999</xref>, p. 190).</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2153368712462410">Broadhurst (1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2153368712462410">2002</xref>), too, identifies land occupation/recognition, language retention, and participation in Aboriginal cultural activities as “cultural factors,” which have links to indigenous overrepresentation. In his earlier work, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2153368712462410">Broadhurst (1997</xref>) argues that cultural strength (or cultural identity), as identified by these factors, acts as an indicator of the degree of resistance and potential conflict between Aboriginal people and the dominant society. Under a conflict-stress model, cultural strength is seen as a risk factor rather than a protective factor, acting on indigenous–justice relations in the same direction as socioeconomic and related stress factors. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2153368712462410">Broadhurst (1997</xref>) demonstrates that cultural stress and socioeconomic stress are highly correlated—both with each other and with high levels of involvement in the justice system. In his later work, however, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2153368712462410">Broadhurst (2002</xref>) explores the concept of “frontier” and presents a more nuanced argument where cultural strength (the best proxy for this was land retention) is seen to have a protective effect against crime, if not criminalization. In other words, cultural strength is seen as having a dual role—as a form of social capital and as an indicator of stress and culture conflict.<sup>

<sec id="section6-2153368712462410">
<title>Community strength</title>
<p>Broadhurst’s recognition that cultural strength may also have a protective effect fits into broader notions that community strength works in a positive direction and leads to improvements in well-being.</p>
<p>Various disciplines have investigated the notion of community strength and its ability to maintain and enhance individual and collective well-being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2153368712462410">Black &amp; Hughes, 2001</xref>). Notions of community sustainability, community resilience, community capacity, and health all point to the “capabilities” of communities to maintain and enhance positive outcomes. Community strength, in terms of the ability to meet community challenges or to act within communities for the well-being of its members, depends largely on the relationships which members have with each other, the relationships they have with other groups, the ways in which they are able to access resources, and their confidence in dealing with them. Relationships between people, organizations, and systems are recognized as important ingredients of community strength (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2153368712462410">Black &amp; Hughes, 2001</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-2153368712462410">
<title>Social capital and indigenous communities</title>
<p>Although there is consensus that social relationships are good for individuals and communities and help reduce crime, the mechanism (theory) by which this occurs and extent to which this occurs remain hot issues among researchers. For example, there has been great debate about the notion of social capital. It has been criticized for being too vague a concept and for having inadequate measurement tools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2153368712462410">Brough, Henderson, Foster, &amp; Douglas, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-2153368712462410">Hunter, 2004</xref>). Some scholars have also recognized that there is a “dark side” to social capital (e.g., as in mafia networks). It is not yet clear whether social capital has a role to play in understanding and overcoming indigenous disadvantage in Australia. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-2153368712462410">Hunter (2004</xref>) argues that “the lack of clarity in the conceptualisation of social capital [. . .] is what makes it potentially dangerous” (p.18). He advocates for a more modest conceptualization and a clearly formulated theory of social networks because, for indigenous Australians, “the composition of social networks is likely to be crucially important” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-2153368712462410">Hunter, 2004</xref>, p. 19).</p>

<title>Purpose of the Study</title>
<p>The principal objective of this study is to investigate influences on Aboriginal offending using self-reported data. The study uses the 2002 NATSISS to estimate the influence of various individual, family, and community factors on both participation and frequency levels. Given the richness of the survey, it was possible to identify and/or construct a number of culturally specific risk factors in order to explore the role that these factors may play in the interaction between Aboriginal people and the Australian justice system.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-2153368712462410" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>The study employs a multifactorial framework in which a range of personal, family, and community factors are included in statistical models. Culturally specific risk factors have been identified through reference to works by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-2153368712462410">Homel et al (1999</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2153368712462410">Broadhurst (2002</xref>). A number of these risk factors (e.g., cultural strength and community connectedness) have not previously been included in empirical studies.</p>
<sec id="section10-2153368712462410">
<title>Analytical Strategy</title>
<p>Regression models are used to estimate the effects of the various explanatory factors on the level of indigenous “offending,” as measured through self-reported arrest rates. Arrest rates in this study are partitioned along two criminal career dimensions—prevalence and frequency of arrest—each being modeled separately. Modeling of the prevalence of arrest distinguishes between individuals who have <italic>ever</italic> been arrested by police and those who have not. Modeling of the frequency of arrest, on the other hand, differentiates between individuals on the basis of the number of arrests that accumulate over a given period. A number of studies have demonstrated that different sets of risk factors are associated with participation in offending versus frequency offending (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-2153368712462410">Nagin &amp; Smith, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-2153368712462410">Patternoster &amp; Triplett, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-2153368712462410">Smith, Visher, &amp; Jarjoura, 1991</xref>).</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-2153368712462410">
<title>Data</title>
<p>The data for this study are sourced from NATSISS 2002 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2153368712462410">Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2004</xref>). NATSISS 2002 was an interview-based survey conducted in 2002–2003 and administered Australia-wide to Aboriginal people aged 15 years and over. A total of 9,359 persons and 5,887 households located in various urban, rural, and remote settings responded to the survey.</p>
<sec id="section12-2153368712462410">
<title>Explanatory Factors</title>
<p>Many of the explanatory variables included in the model were selected on the basis of extant research on the causes and correlates of offending (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-2153368712462410">Loeber &amp; Farrington, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-2153368712462410">Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention, 1986</xref>). As with any analysis, the “choice” of explanatory factors was restricted by data availability. Of particular relevance is the impact of systemic factors (e.g., police harassment, discriminatory practices/treatment by police and/or other elements of the criminal justice system). While there is no doubt that these factors play an important part in determining the nature and extent of relationships between indigenous people and the justice system, the size of that impact cannot be assessed by the present study because no data were collected about these factors. It is worth noting that the NATSISS 2002 survey contained never-before-collected information on individual- and family-level stress factors. This reflects increased community and research interest in the effects of stress on human development and family functioning.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-2153368712462410">
<title>Dependent Variables</title>
<p>Separate measures of the prevalence and frequency of arrest were derived from survey questions. As a measure of prevalence, the study used responses to whether an individual had ever been formally charged by police. As a measure of the frequency of contact, the study used individual responses to the number of times a person had been arrested by police in last 5 years. As <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-2153368712462410">Table 1</xref> shows, the distribution of the frequency of arrest is highly skewed, with almost 60% of cases having a count of zero, indicating that they had not had any contact with police during the last 5 years. However, in 6% of cases, individuals stated that they have been arrested 5 or more times in the last 5 years.</p>

<title>Independent Variables</title>
<p>Independent variables for the models were derived from the responses to various survey questions and are organized into personal/individual characteristics, factors that related to family or family-context and those related to community- or neighborhood-contexts in which individuals live.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-2153368712462410">
<title>Personal Factors</title>
<sec id="section16-2153368712462410">
<title>Sex</title>
<p>Of the 9,359 respondents, 43% were male and 57% were female.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-2153368712462410">
<title>Age</title>
<p> Age ranged from 15 to 75 years. One quarter of respondents were below 25 years of age. A categorical variable was created which comprised individuals aged under 20 years (YOUTH = 1)</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-2153368712462410">
<title>Early onset</title>
<p>Respondents were asked about the age at which they were first formally charged by police. In all, 21% said that they were first charged between the age of 8 and 14 years. These individuals were flagged as early onset offenders (EARLY_ONSET = 1).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-2153368712462410">
<title>Alcohol misuse</title>
<p>Respondents were asked about alcohol consumption level during the last 12 months. Those who reported high-risk consumption levels (as per relative risk levels stipulated by National Health and Medical Research Council guidelines) were flagged as being alcohol misusers (ALCOHOL = 1).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section20-2153368712462410">
<title>Substance misuse</title>
<p>Two variables were derived from questions about substance use—SUBEVER and SUB12. SUBEVER was based on responses to a question about whether a person had “ever used substances for non-medical purposes.” The type of substances included in this question included illicit drugs, medicated drugs, petrol, and other inhalants. SUB12 was based on a question about whether a person had used these substances (for nonmedical purposes) during the last 12 months. In all, 22% of respondents admitted to <italic>ever</italic> abusing substances in this way and 13% reported substance misuse <italic>in the last 12 months</italic>. Note, however, that for a large proportion of respondents (44%), that is, those living in remote areas, the extent of substance misuse could not be ascertained because the ABS did not release substance use survey responses for this group. This was because prevalence rates for people living in remote areas were deemed too low to permit publication. As a consequence, the large and nonrandom nature of missing cases for the SUBEVER and SUB12 variables required special consideration in the analysis (described in more detail in a later section).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section21-2153368712462410">
<title>Unemployment</title>
<p>Respondents who indicated that they were in the labor force but were “unemployed” were flagged as such (UNEMP = 1). Just over 10% of respondents were unemployed.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section22-2153368712462410">
<title>Education</title>
<p>Respondents with postsecondary qualifications were coded as EDUC = 2 (23%); respondents who reached Year 11 or Year 12 were coded as EDUC = 1 (17%), and those with education levels below Year 10 were coded as EDUC = 0 (60%).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section23-2153368712462410">
<title>Acute financial stress</title>
<p>A number of questions about financial stress were used to determine whether respondents were subject to <italic>acute</italic> financial stress. Respondents with three or more of the following were deemed to have experienced acute financial stress: being unemployed; living in a single-parent family; cash flow problems; having experienced days without any money in the last 12 months; and having used strategies to meet basic living expenses in the last 12 months. In total, 28% of respondents fell into the acute group.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section24-2153368712462410">
<title>Victimization</title>
<p>Respondents who reported being the victim of a physical or threatened violence in last 12 months were flagged accordingly (VICTIM = 1). It was not possible to discern actual violence from threats of violence or to distinguish different forms of violence (e.g., family violence, sexual assaults, etc). One-quarter of respondents reported being the victim of violence.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section25-2153368712462410">
<title>Factors Related to Family Context</title>
<sec id="section26-2153368712462410">
<title>Stolen generation</title>
<p>Respondents were asked whether they or their family members had been removed from their natural family. Just under 1 in 10 respondents reported that they had been removed personally and 43% had their relatives removed.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section27-2153368712462410">
<title>Acute family stress</title>
<p>Respondents were asked about whether they had been stressed by a range of family/community events during the last 12 months. Stressors included divorce/separation, death of family member or someone close, serious illness or disability, serious accident, alcohol or drug problems, mental illness, job problems, violence, trouble with police, gambling, overcrowding at home, pressures of cultural responsibility, and racism or discrimination. Responses regarding each of the stressors were accumulated. Respondents who reported eight or more stressors during the 12-month period were flagged as having experienced acute family stress (ACUTE_FAM = 1). In all, 9% of respondents fell into the acute group.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section28-2153368712462410">
<title>Single-parent family</title>
<p>Persons who indicated that they lived in a single-parent family were identified accordingly (SINGLEP = 1).</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section29-2153368712462410">
<title>Factors Related to Community</title>
<sec id="section30-2153368712462410">
<title>Cultural strength</title>
<p>In line with earlier works (i.e., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2153368712462410">Broadhurst [1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2153368712462410">2002</xref>]; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-2153368712462410">Homel et al., 1999</xref>), an indicator of an individual’s cultural strength was derived from responses to several key questions. These were whether a person spoke an indigenous language; whether they identified with clan, tribal, or language group; whether they recognized homelands; and whether they had attended cultural event/events in the last 12 months. Respondents who answered positively to at least three of these questions were coded as having “strong” culture (SCULT = 1). About half (52%) of respondents fell into this group.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section31-2153368712462410">
<title>Community connection</title>
<p>Similarly, an indicator of each individual’s sense of community connectedness was derived from the responses to several NATSISS questions. Pertinent questions included whether the person had support in a time of crisis; whether they participated in sport/physical activity in last 12 months; whether they were involved in social activities in last 3 months; and whether they perceived their community/neighborhood to be relatively problem free. Respondents who answered positively to three or more of these questions were coded as having a “strong” connection to community (SCOMM = 1). Half of all respondents fell into this category.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section32-2153368712462410">
<title>Geographical location</title>
<p>Only broad geographical groupings were released with survey data. These were major cities, inner regional, outer regional, and remote/very remote. In all, 44% of respondents were located in remote/very remote areas.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section33-2153368712462410">
<title>Crime problems</title>
<p>Respondents were asked not only about the existence of neighborhood/community problems but also the nature of these problems. Cases where specific crime problems were identified (i.e., where respondents stated that there was theft and/or damage to property and/or illegal drugs and/or family violence and/or assault and/or sexual assault) were coded as having crime problems (CRIME = 1). Neighborhoods or communities with other problems, such as the presence of youth gangs or problems with neighbors, were not considered to be crime prone, however, they were included in the derivation of the community connection variable (above).</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section34-2153368712462410">
<title>Statistical Methods</title>
<p>Bivariate analyses were initially undertaken to examine the effect of each of the variables described above on (i) the prevalence of arrest (ever charged) and (ii) the frequency of arrest (number of arrests in last 5 years). Results are described in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-2153368712462410">Table 2</xref>. Logistic regression models were then used to determine the relative influence of each potential explanatory factor on the prevalence of <italic>ever</italic> being charged by police. All 9,359 cases, unweighted, were included in the analysis. All of the explanatory variables described above were included in initial models and a method of backward selection was employed.</p>

<sec id="section35-2153368712462410">
<title>Missing values</title>
<p>Several variables (alcohol misuse, substance misuse, and being part of the stolen generation) had substantial numbers of cases with missing values. In order to retain as much information as possible, the affected variables were treated and retained. Treatment consisted either of creating additional variables that accommodated the missing values or creating additional values or “levels” within existing variable. These variables/levels were then tested for statistical significance and, where there was evidence of an effect, the additional variables/levels were retained. Of the three variables most affected by missing values, only being part of the stolen generation emerged as having significant missing value effects.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section36-2153368712462410">
<title>Remote area issues</title>
<p>Data about substance use was not available for individuals living in remote area. This not only generated a large number of missing values in the substance misuse variable (which was handled as described above) but the systematic, nonrandom distribution of missing values in the data meant that it was necessary to check whether this had an impact on other factors in the model. Using an approach similar to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-2153368712462410">Weatherburn, Snowball, and Hunter (2006</xref>), the study undertook a form of sensitivity analysis, running separate regression models for the total population and the nonremote cases (only) and then checking for significant deviations in parameter estimates between models.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section37-2153368712462410">
<title>Interactions</title>
<p>A number of interactions between explanatory variables were also included in the logistic regression models to test for potential <italic>differential</italic> effects between certain factors and to assess the <italic>interrelatedness</italic> of many risk factors—a point made by some researchers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-2153368712462410">Homel et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-2153368712462410">National Crime Prevention, 1999</xref>). Included were interactions between gender and family stress, gender and financial stress, gender and victimization, alcohol misuse and substance misuse as well as culture and crime, culture and community.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section38-2153368712462410">
<title>Modeling Frequency of Arrest</title>
<p>Ordinary least squares (OLS) regression was used to model the frequency of police arrest. A total of 3,239 cases were included in the analysis. Owing to the skewed distribution of the data on frequency of arrest, the log transformation of the dependent variable (FRARREST+1) was modeled. Age was included in OLS modeling as a continuous variable. Missing values were treated in the same way as in the logistic regression models. As previously, the collinearity of potential explanatory variables was also checked and found not to be significant. This was the case for all variables, including those derived from other variables (e.g., financial stress).</p>
</sec>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section39-2153368712462410">
<title>Results</title>
<p>A descriptive summary of factors influencing both the prevalence and frequency of police arrest are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-2153368712462410">Table 2</xref>. Males were more likely than females to be arrested by police (they accounted for 43% of the original survey sample but 64% of those ever charged by police). Males also had a higher frequency of offending than females. They accounted for 76% of high-frequency offenders (i.e., those arrested 3 or more times in the last 5 years), as compared to just 24% of women. Young people comprised just 8% of those ever arrested by police, yet they accounted for 14% of the survey sample. This underrepresentation is not surprising and arises because prevalence is a cumulative and not age-based measure. As individuals get older, the opportunity and thus likelihood of ever being arrested by police increases.</p>
<sec id="section40-2153368712462410">
<title>Prevalence of Arrest</title>
<p>Results from the logistic regression model of the prevalence of arrest are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-2153368712462410">Table 3</xref>. The results show that gender, high-risk alcohol consumption, and substance misuse have the most significant influence on the prevalence of indigenous arrest. Odds ratios indicate that the likelihood of ever having contact with the justice system for males is about 4 times that of females. High-risk alcohol consumption and, separately, substance misuse (ever) are factors that more than double the risk of ever being arrested by police.</p>

<p>Other individual factors, such as being unemployed and being subjected to acute financial stress, also increase the odds of ever being arrested by police. However, the effects of these factors are somewhat smaller than those that can be attributed to gender, alcohol use, and substance misuse. Being a recent victim of an assault, too, is associated with a greater likelihood of being charged by police. As the results show, the odds of police arrest for assault victims are almost twice that of nonvictims.</p>
<p>Of lesser (but still statistically significant) influence are factors related to family circumstances, such as being part of the stolen generation and being subjected to acute family stress. Each of these factors as well as living in an outer regional or remote location, increases the odds of arrest by a factor of 1.3–1.5.</p>
<p>Not all of the factors incorporated in the model operate to increase the risk of contact with police, however. A higher level of education, for instance, is associated with reduced likelihood of police arrest. It is notable that the “protective” effect of education appears to be greatest upon reaching senior high school. As the results show, the odds ratio for individuals reaching senior high school (SHS) grades is the same as that for those individuals attaining a postsecondary level of education, suggesting that, at least in terms of the likelihood of ever being arrest by police, attaining tertiary qualifications is of marginal value.</p>
<p>Variables which measure the strength of cultural ties and connection to community were also found to be significant factors in the model and both appear to offer separate, protective effects against police arrest. Indeed, the odds ratios associated with each of these factors appear to be comparable with those associated with educational achievement to senior high school.</p>
<p>Several factors were found not to be significant in the model. Neither living in a single-parent family nor in a crime-prone community appeared to affect the likelihood of police arrest. Interaction terms, too, had no significant effect in the model. None of the interactions between gender and other factors, nor those between culture and crime and culture and community were significant. Owing to issues of missing data for substance use in remote areas, interactions between alcohol misuse and substance abuse could only be tested for the nonremote sample (and not the total survey sample). Even for this group, the interaction terms did not produce statistically significant effects.</p>

<p>As one might expect, gender (masculinity) was found to be a strong determinant of the frequency of arrest and, as the results in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-2153368712462410">Table 4</xref> show, it has one of the largest parameter estimates. Also highly predictive of an elevated frequency of arrest is early contact with police. As <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-2153368712462410">Table 4</xref> also shows, the frequency of arrest of “early onset” individuals (i.e., those who were first arrested by police when very young—between the ages of 8 and 14 years) is significantly higher than that of other individuals, independent of all other factors. Another influential factor is unemployment: individuals who were unemployed had a significantly higher frequency of arrest than those who were either employed or not considered part of the labor force.</p>
<p>There were a number of other personal factors included in the model that, like unemployment, were found to influence both the prevalence <italic>and</italic> the frequency of arrest. These include alcohol use, experiencing acute financial stress, and being a recent victim of an assault. Substance misuse, too, influenced the frequency of arrest, though to a much lesser extent. Note, however, that it is <italic>recent</italic> substance misuse, not <italic>past (ever)</italic> misuse that has particular effect.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that not all factors operated on the prevalence and frequency of arrest in the same way or to the same extent. <italic>Past</italic> substance misuse, for instance, did not have a significant influence on arrest frequency, despite it having a large influence on the prevalence of arrest (demonstrated earlier). There were several other factors that fell into this category. Being part of the stolen generation; having strong cultural ties and geographical location were factors that, like past substance misuse, did <italic>not</italic> have a significant effect on the frequency of arrest, despite having a demonstrated influence on the prevalence of arrest. In other words, these factors appear to influence initial involvement with police but not the extent of contact or its continuity over time.</p>
<p>As <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-2153368712462410">Table 4</xref> also shows, educational attainment and community connection are factors which independently show association with lower rates of arrest. Moreover, as protective factors, they are significant in affecting both the prevalence and frequency of arrest. Note, though, that the parameter estimate for education is smaller than that of community connection, suggesting that the protective effect of education is less than that of community connection.</p>

<title>Different Risk Factors, Different Dimensions</title>
<p>
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-2153368712462410">Figure 1</xref> brings together the results from the various analyses and demonstrates that there are a range of factors that have a statistically significant influence on indigenous arrest levels. The figure shows that some factors have an influence on just one dimension of indigenous “offending,” while other factors have a bearing on both the prevalence <italic>and</italic> frequency indigenous “offending.” Recent substance misuse, for instance, is identified as being a determinant of the frequency of arrest (but not of the prevalence of arrest), while past substance misuse (i.e., ever misused substances) is identified as being a significant determinant of the prevalence of arrest (but not frequency of arrest). Apart from serving as a useful reminder of the fact that there are both distal and proximal forces at work in shaping an individual’s behavior, this example also highlights the important distinction between “prevalence” and “frequency” of offending. This distinction has both theoretical and practical significance.</p>

</fig>
<p>At a theoretical level, distinguishing between criminal career “dimensions” facilitates the study of potentially different underlying causes and the development of comprehensive explanations or theories of crime and offending (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-2153368712462410">Piquero, Farrington, &amp; Blumstein, 2003</xref>). At a policy level, the distinction between these “dimensions” encourages a diversity of responses/action from government, providing justification for the development and provision of a variety of policy initiatives—some targeted at the <italic>prevention</italic> of offending (i.e., reducing participation), while others are aimed at reducing the frequency of contact among those who are already involved in the justice system. Early intervention programs are primarily focused on preventing participation in crime. Policies aimed at incapacitation or at reducing recidivism are implicitly based on an understanding that the individual frequency or rate of offending can be affected. The distinction between crime prevention and crime reduction policies also helps to distribute responsibility for action and intervention.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section44-2153368712462410">
<title>Common Risk Factors</title>
<p>Apart from identifying different risk factors for the separate “dimensions” of involvement with the justice system, the study also identifies a number of common or shared factors—gender, alcohol use, victimization, unemployment, financial, and family stress—which not only increase the likelihood of (any) contact with the system but also play a part in affecting the intensity or frequency of that contact over the life course.</p>
<sec id="section45-2153368712462410">
<title>Alcohol abuse</title>
<p>Alcohol abuse inevitably emerges as a critical risk factor. There is a plethora of evidence which demonstrates the caustic effect of alcohol on individual, family, and community functioning. Much has already been written in terms of criminal justice responses and future directions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-2153368712462410">Pearson, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-2153368712462410">Putt, Payne, &amp; Milner, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-2153368712462410">Weatherburn, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-2153368712462410">Weatherburn et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-2153368712462410">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-2153368712462410">Wundersitz, 2010</xref>). What this study further demonstrates is that any effort which addresses alcohol abuse is likely to have a dual impact on indigenous involvement with the justice system—reducing both the number of people who have contact with the justice system and the frequency of contact of those who are already involved with justice.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section46-2153368712462410">
<title>Victimization</title>
<p>The finding that victimization also increases both the prevalence and frequency of contact with the justice system is also a useful reminder of the overlap that exists between victimization and offending. Although this link is well established, the causal mechanisms that underlie the relationship are still poorly understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-2153368712462410">Lauritsen &amp; Laub, 2007</xref>). There is little doubt that the cycle of violence and abuse in indigenous communities and families is closely related to alcohol consumption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-2153368712462410">Wundersitz, 2010</xref>); however, it would be erroneous to attribute all cause to “grog.” The connection between victimization and offending in indigenous communities needs to be studied and understood in its own right, with policies to prevent indigenous victimization being explicitly connected to policies designed to curb violent offending.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section47-2153368712462410">
<title>Financial and family stress</title>
<p>Both financial stress <italic>and</italic> family stress emerge from the study as significant shared risk factors. The link between financial hardship and increased involvement in crime is well documented in the criminological literature. In addition, research has shown the effects of economic stress to be indirect as well as direct. For example, research by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-2153368712462410">Fergusson, Swain-Campbell, and Horwood (2004</xref>) and later by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-2153368712462410">Weatherburn and Lind (2006</xref>) show that economic stress affects involvement in crime <italic>indirectly</italic> through disrupted social (child rearing) processes.</p>
<p>The findings in relation to the effects of family stress on involvement with justice are relatively new, however. The 2002 survey was the first NATSISS to collect information on individual- and family-level stress factors. The inclusion of these items in the survey reflects accumulated research evidence and growing community interest in the effects of stress on human development and family functioning. Research and theory in the developmental psychology and developmental health have been particularly prominent in demonstrating that stress has a negative impact on the cognitive, social, emotional, and physical functioning of individuals over the life course (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-2153368712462410">Shonkoff &amp; Phillips, 2000</xref>). Despite these developments, researchers in the social sciences have been reluctant to accept biological explanations for the link between stress and criminal behavior. More often than not, social scientists have tended to absorb aspects of family stress into other indicators of family functioning and, in turn, show these to be linked to involvement in crime. However, the current research differs from other studies in that it distinguishes between family stress and other aspects of family functioning (e.g., single-parent family) and between family stress and economic stress. In so doing, the study findings show that family stress not only operates independently from these other factors but that it has a significant effect on involvement in the justice system in its own right.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section48-2153368712462410">
<title>Stolen generation</title>
<p>Study findings are broadly consistent with those of researchers working in the indigenous field who have asserted that factors related to family disruption are critical in driving high arrest rates among Aboriginal people. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2153368712462410">Dodson and Hunter (2006</xref>) focus not on family stress but on another family-related factor—the removal of people from their natural family (i.e., <italic>stolen generation</italic>). The authors identify this is as significant “culturally specific” factor, arguing that that “while many Australian families experience disruptions to their social fabric, the experience of the stolen generation is unique to Indigenous Australians” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2153368712462410">Dodson &amp; Hunter, 2006</xref>, p. 38). Using data also sourced from NATSISS 2002, they demonstrate that being involved in the stolen generations—either directly or indirectly through other family members—was highly correlated with both arrest prevalence and arrest frequency.</p>
<p>The current study, too, tested the link between being part of the “stolen generation” and involvement in the justice system. However, unlike <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2153368712462410">Dodson and Hunter (2006</xref>), the study found that removal from family was significant only in relation to the prevalence of arrest. Being part of the “stolen generation” did <italic>not</italic> significantly influence the frequency of arrest. Why do these findings differ from those of Dodson and Hunter, especially given that we use the same underlying data set? There are several possible reasons. First, Dodson and Hunter only considered correlations between being part of the stolen generation and the various measures of justice involvement. They did not undertake multivariate analysis and so they did not account the potential confounding effect of other factors. Second and related, it is likely that the inclusion of “other” factors in current models—particularly “family stress”—may have begun the process of disentangling the effects of being part of the stolen generation. If family disruption (and associated stresses) and stolen generation are interrelated, as Dodson and Hunter claim, then one would expect some interaction of these factors to exhibit take place in statistical models. The current study did not explore these interactions to any great extent; however, given the divergence of findings, it is clear that further research and analysis are warranted. As Dodson and Hunter concluded, “the effects of such disruptions are demonstrably ongoing and long-lived and <italic>need to be understood</italic>” (p. 38, italics added).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section49-2153368712462410">
<title>Protective factors</title>
<p>As well as identifying shared “risk” factors, the study identified two shared “protective” factors—education and connection to community—which operated to reduce involvement with the justice system. Findings in relation to the protective effects of education are consistent with the literature on the positive effects of education on life outcomes and accord with prior research on factors affecting indigenous arrest rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-2153368712462410">Hunter, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-2153368712462410">Hunter &amp; Schwab, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-2153368712462410">Weatherburn et al., 2006</xref>). Findings did show, however, that the influence of postsecondary/tertiary education on indigenous arrest levels was not as significant as that of secondary school education. This would seem to suggest that higher education is of marginal benefit in reducing involvement in justice. However, there may be other explanations for the effect observed. The findings may simply be a reflection of aging: young people attaining postsecondary qualifications are older than those in high school and are likely to have passed their “peak” of criminal activity (as per the typical age–crime curve). Given that they are more likely to be on the downward slide of the age–crime curve, the differential effect of education (or, indeed, any factor) on criminal involvement at that stage would also be less, therefore.</p>
<p>While the current study examined the influence of education on involvement in justice, it is worth recalling that the link between education (and also employment) and involvement in crime is bidirectional (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2153368712462410">Dodson &amp; Hunter, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-2153368712462410">Hunter, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-2153368712462410">Hunter &amp; Schwab, 1998</xref>). A number of these studies have shown that involvement in crime, and particularly <italic>early</italic> involvement in crime, also has a negative effect on educational outcomes (and employment). In the language of economists, involvement in crime hinders the process of human capital accumulation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section50-2153368712462410">
<title>Connection to community</title>
<p>The present study assessed the role of that connection to community plays in influencing involvement in the justice system. The study is one of the first to construct and analyze factors of this sort from NATSISS data. On this issue, findings accord with much of the literature which suggests that high levels of social participation and connectedness contribute to the overall well-being of society as well as to the resilience of individuals and communities. The findings give empirical recognition to the importance of social networks within indigenous communities and suggest that connection to community may be at least as influential as some of the more recognized protective factors (e.g., educational achievement) in reducing involvement in crime. While acknowledging that our understanding of social capital is still evolving (and its relevance to indigenous people is still the subject of much debate), the findings may be seen as tentative evidence that there are crime- and justice-related benefits to community connections and the accumulation of social capital which ranks equally with the accumulation of human capital.</p>

<title>Role of Other Culturally Specific Factors</title>
<sec id="section52-2153368712462410">
<title>Cultural strength</title>
<p>The study also assessed the role that cultural ties play, if any, in influencing indigenous involvement in the justice system. Here, the study followed Broadhurst’s approach, constructing a variable representing “cultural strength” and including it in various model/models. Overall, results indicate that “cultural strength” is protective and tends to reduce involvement in justice. This supports the view that cultural strength is a form of social capital and contributes positively to Aboriginal communities. However, its influence appears to be patchy—affecting only the prevalence of arrest (not the frequency of arrest) and only of people living in remote areas. It is difficult to know how to interpret this finding. On one hand, finding that cultural strength is protective is at odds with notions that culture brings conflict when a minority cultural group is subject to the influences of a dominant group. On the other hand, it confirms its role as a form of social capital. In a manner, the study has tested the relative strength (note, not relative merits) of two differing theories of Aboriginal overrepresentations—culture conflict versus socioeconomic adversity. On the evidence presented, there appears to be less of a case for culture conflict and a stronger case for socioeconomic explanations of indigenous overrepresentation in the justice system.</p>
</sec>

<sec id="section53-2153368712462410">
<title>Study Limitations</title>
<p>As with all research, the study has its strengths and weaknesses. On the plus side, the study has sought to understand involvement with justice through self-reported data rather than through official records. On the minus side, some readers may be critical of the study’s risk factor approach. Usual criticisms of the risk factor paradigm are that it is positivistic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2153368712462410">Case, 2007</xref>) and that interpretations of results are difficult. Establishing causality is made more difficult, if not impossible, by the cross-sectional nature of the survey data. Moreover, issues may be raised about internal validity, that is, whether or not the measures used in analysis match up to constructs. In an evaluation of the measures used in the NATSISS, however, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-2153368712462410">Weston and Gray (2006</xref>) found that the 2002 survey does a “good job” in measuring a range of aspects of family and community life. The authors acknowledge, though, that “family and community life is multi-dimensional and complex, and therefore very difficult to measure. Collecting such information in surveys is always a challenge but is particularly so for some sections of the Indigenous population” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-2153368712462410">Weston &amp; Gray, 2006</xref>, p. 37).</p>
<p>While it is acknowledged that the study suffers from shortcomings, the study also has strengths. The risk factor paradigm is but one approach in arriving at a more sophisticated understanding of the processes that lead to crime in Aboriginal communities and to elevated levels of contact with the justice system. The study has taken heed of calls to examine an array of more culturally specific factors. To the extent that these factors (both risk and protective) could be extracted from the available data, we have attempted to do this and have learnt something new from the process. As it stands, the study’s findings contribute to the growing body of empirical research which furthers current understanding of the positive and negative forces shaping interactions between Aboriginal people and the justice system. While we continue to learn something new from this kind of research, there is both hope and opportunity to affect change in what might otherwise be a forlorn cause—that of reducing Aboriginal overrepresentation in the Australian justice system.</p>
