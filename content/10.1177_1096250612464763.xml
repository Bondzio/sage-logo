<p><italic>Ms. Roberts has just been given a new iPad™ for her preschool classroom. She immediately begins to explore all the wonderful apps (computer applications) she can download for free and use with her children. Having taught for15 years, she has seen the changes in technology that have evolved throughout her teaching career. She remembers teachers using programs with older students such as Oregon Trail and Reader Rabbit. Although she believed these programs were able to maintain the students’ attention, she thought they presented closed activities and did not allow for much free exploration by students. Ms. Roberts wants to find apps that not only keep the children’s attention but also allows them to explore and make choices. Ms. Roberts recognizes that children in her classroom have a wide variety of learning needs that she wants the apps to address. She especially wants to find an app that will help Michael. Michael has difficulty maintaining attention, has limited receptive and expressive vocabulary, and has fine motor difficulties. Ms. Roberts browses the online app store where she finds hundreds of choices related to her search “apps for preschoolers.” She begins selecting, downloading, and previewing the apps. As she does so, she notices that many of the apps seem to be no better than flashcards and worksheets. While colorful and interesting, these apps may help Michael stay on task, but the flashcards and worksheets did not seem developmentally appropriate. Ms. Roberts is concerned whether the apps will help increase his ability to stay on task for longer periods of time as well as address his language and fine motor learning needs. She decides she will choose a handful of apps that she thinks might work for Michael and observe him while he uses them. After a few opportunities of observing Michael use the apps, Ms. Roberts realizes that if she continues to use her current approach to finding the best apps, she may not be able to find an app that is suitable for Michael.</italic></p>
<p>According to the Division for Early Childhood of the Council for Exceptional Children (DEC), technology applications have the potential to help young children with disabilities more easily participate in the general education curriculum as well as obtain access to the natural environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1096250612464763">Stremmel, 2005</xref>). DEC states that the use of technology in early childhood education settings may improve children’s quality of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1096250612464763">Stremmel, 2005</xref>). Not only can technology be used to improve instruction and access, but it may also provide a way to assess children’s understanding and development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1096250612464763">Mulligan, 2003</xref>). However, it has not been easy for the field to embrace the use of technology in early childhood settings.</p>
<p>Education has historically been plagued with a lag between newly discovered or better-understood aspects of teaching uncovered by researchers and the use of these findings in educational settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1096250612464763">Carnine, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1096250612464763">Dunst &amp; Trivette, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1096250612464763">Greenwood &amp; Abbott, 2001</xref>). Educational technology, specifically for young children, is not immune from this phenomenon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1096250612464763">Zevenbergen, 2007</xref>). Young children today are surrounded by a wide array of technologies used in multiple ways throughout their day (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1096250612464763">Bers, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1096250612464763">L. Z. Cooper, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1096250612464763">Parette, Quesenberry, &amp; Blum, 2010</xref>). Moreover, new terms related to technology are increasingly being added to our vocabulary. In 2010, the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1096250612464763">American Dialect Society (2011)</xref> named the technology term <italic>app</italic> as the word of the year. An “app” is a shortened form of the word application—what was previously referred to as a <italic>computer program</italic> or <italic>software</italic>. Apps can be used in a variety of technological devices. For example, mobile device apps are designed for use on smart phones (e.g., iPhone™, Droid™), tablet computers (e.g., iPads™), and e-readers (e.g., Kindle Fire™, Nook™), whereas online apps (i.e., web apps) are designed for personal computers that are connected to the Internet. From an educational standpoint, apps are what early childhood professionals use to deliver instruction.</p>

</fig>
<p>Apps are being created and adopted with astounding speed. In September 2009, Apple™ announced that more than 85,000 apps were available for download on the iTunes™ App Store (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1096250612464763">Apple Corporation, 2009</xref>). The number of apps for sale quickly increased to 500,000, a nearly 490% increase, with 18 billion reported downloads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1096250612464763">Seigler, 2011</xref>). This growth in the number of apps in the app store did not slow during the global economic recession, and in February 2012, Apple™ announced that the 25 billionth app had been downloaded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1096250612464763">Lowensohn, 2012</xref>). In turn, the marketplace has been flooded with software that claims to have educational benefits for young children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1096250612464763">Seigler, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1096250612464763">Shuler, 2009</xref>). An analysis of the iTunes™ App Store found that 60% of the most frequently downloaded educational apps targeted toddlers and preschool-age children as the primary user, and only 16% targeted elementary, middle, or high school students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1096250612464763">Shuler, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>If this trend has continued, then it is likely that there are tens of thousands of apps that are intended for young children available on the iTunes™ App Store alone (other devices have different marketplaces where apps are purchased; the iTunes™ App Store is the largest). The rapid innovation of smart phones and tablet computers as well as the growth in the number of apps intended for young children presents a unique challenge for the education field, especially because children are likely using apps at home as well as in child care and educational settings. Without research to support their educational use, early childhood professionals who adopt technology, including apps for smart phones and tablets, will likely experience problems with implementation.</p>
<p>Some early childhood professionals might assume that apps in the education category of a marketplace are developmentally appropriate. The reality is that many of these apps may be lacking essential design, instruction, content, accessibility, and individualization features that are characteristics of high-quality educational software. Moreover, the speed of innovation will likely increase, and practitioners can no longer be expected to wait for researchers to provide them with guidance on how to use emerging technology. Instead, early childhood professionals must use the guiding principles of early education and educational technology to become well informed and highly critical consumers of technology. In this article, we provide a framework to help practitioners to integrate technology in early childhood settings in ways that are developmentally appropriate, consistent with DEC Recommended Practices, and related to targeted educational goals and outcomes.</p>

<title>Critically Examining Apps</title>
<p>It could be easy to assume that apps created for young children are developmentally appropriate. These apps tend to target young children by their use of pictures and color, and publishers often market these apps as educational. However, many so-called educational apps lack design, instruction, content, and other vital features of high-quality educational software. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1096250612464763">Higgins, Boone, and Williams (2000)</xref> found that special education teachers usually had faith that software marketed for educational purposes would provide meaningful educational benefit to children with disabilities. Indeed, the allure of new technology can result in educators failing to be critical when selecting technology for use by children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1096250612464763">A. Cooper, 2004</xref>). Thus, early childhood professionals must thoughtfully evaluate educational apps and use existing guidelines for appropriate practice before integrating them into their classroom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1096250612464763">Travers &amp; More, in press</xref>). To do this, early childhood professionals should (a) evaluate accessibility, (b) identify how developmentally appropriate practices (DAPs) and apps intersect, (c) ensure content is suitable, and (d) determine relevance to children’s educational needs. Each of these steps is described in the following sections.</p>
<sec id="section2-1096250612464763">
<title>Examining Apps for Accessibility</title>
<p>Early childhood professionals must consider accessibility when designing instruction that will use apps. An accessible curriculum is one that provides all learners the opportunity to be engaged in activities that result in meaningful and positive educational outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1096250612464763">Lieber, Horn, Palmer, &amp; Fleming, 2008</xref>). One way to examine accessibility of apps is through the lens of universal design for learning (UDL). The UDL framework requires the design of flexible and accessible learning environments that provide equal access to the curriculum for all students, regardless of ability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1096250612464763">Center for Applied Special Technology, 2012</xref>). In the traditional teaching approach, planning begins with the selection of a curriculum based on a set of standards, followed by lesson preparation, and concludes with delivery of instruction that is effective for the majority of children in the classroom. Accommodations and lesson modifications for children with diverse learning needs are selected after the lessons are planned as a sort of contingency plan if instruction is ineffective for a few children with more specialized needs. UDL is distinctly different from the traditional approach (as well as other methods of curricular and instructional design) in that it establishes accessibility at the forefront of curriculum/lesson design, rather than selecting accommodations or modifications after the fact. Essentially, a UDL approach starts with ensuring accessible environments and ends with alignment of curriculum and content standards to guide lesson plan development.</p>
<fig id="fig6-1096250612464763" position="anchor">
<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1096250612464763-img2.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>There are seven principles of UDL that educational software must adhere to in order to be consistent with the UDL framework. They are (a) equitable use, (b) flexibility in use, (c) simple and intuitive, (d) perceptible information, (e) tolerance of error, (f) low physical effort, and (g) size and space for approach and use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1096250612464763">Mason, Orkwis, &amp; Scott, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1096250612464763">Scott, McGuire, &amp; Shaw, 2001</xref>). “Equitable use” requires early childhood professionals to ensure that all children, regardless of ability or behavior, have equal access to the device(s) and app(s). “Flexibility in use” means the device and apps are designed in a manner that ensures children with a range of preferences and abilities can use the device and apps with minimal adult assistance. Apps are considered to be “simple and intuitive” when they are designed in a manner that makes it easy for young children to understand. Early childhood professionals can examine apps for “perceptible information” by ascertaining whether any child, regardless of sensory ability, receives educational benefit from using the app. More specifically, perceptible information usually is conveyed through animation, sound, video, and/or tactile feedback (e.g., vibration). “Tolerance for error” means that the app minimizes negative (but not necessarily corrective) feedback when the child makes errors. If the design of the app allows physically comfortable use and minimizes fatigue in children, then it is consistent with the principle of “low physical effort.” Last, if sufficient size of the device enables successful use, and if sufficient physical space is provided for one or more children to use the device/app (including students with atypical physical development), then the UDL principle of “size and space” is achieved.</p>
<p>UDL principles align with the DEC Recommended Practices. DEC recommends that adults design classroom areas and materials to foster engagement through child interests via a responsive classroom environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1096250612464763">Wolery, 2005</xref>). In addition, DEC Recommended Practices state that planning should occur before strategies are implemented and that technology be used in ways that increase teaching and learning effectiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1096250612464763">Wolery, 2005</xref>). Early childhood professionals should rely on the DEC technology recommendations and the UDL principles to ensure accessibility of apps prior to use in the classroom. The examination of app accessibility is critical for ensuring high-quality and developmentally appropriate learning experiences for young children. For example, an app may require extensive fine motor manipulation to obtain educational benefit or may only be compatible with devices that do not provide tactile feedback. Such an app might not be a good choice for most young children, and it may be especially difficult for a child who has, for example, cerebral palsy. Early childhood professionals should only use apps that allow sufficient access.</p>

</fig>
<p>The matrix presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1096250612464763">Figure 1</xref> can be used to evaluate accessibility of apps. In this matrix, we outline the types of questions regarding accessibility that early childhood professionals can ask themselves when evaluating apps. <italic>Rather than using a trial and error approach to determine educational effects of an app, Ms. Roberts can use the matrix to determine whether the apps meet the basic principles of UDL. If she finds an app that clearly does not meet the principles, then she can delete the app from her device and move on to evaluate the next potential app. Once she finds a few apps that meet most of the UDL principles, she can begin using them in the classroom. However, a decision about whether the app ought to be used should not hinge entirely on accessibility. Ms. Roberts can increase the likelihood of finding an app that will provide educational benefits if she also conducts a critical evaluation of the content of the apps she is considering for Michael.</italic></p>

<title>DAP and Apps</title>
<p>Early childhood professionals must examine apps to determine whether they align with DAPs. DAP is an approach that affirms the child as an active participant in the learning process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1096250612464763">Copple &amp; Bredekamp, 2009</xref>). When DAP is implemented in an early childhood setting, the child constructs meaning and knowledge by interacting with materials as well as people. The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1096250612464763">National Association for the Education of Young Children (2009)</xref> highlights key points of DAP, including meeting children where they are, implementing teaching practices that are age appropriate and appropriate to a child’s current development, utilizing socially and culturally responsive teaching practices, and challenging children enough to promote progress in the natural environment. Given the speed of technological innovation and the presence of technology in society, it is important for early childhood professionals to remember that DAP extends beyond traditional teaching situations to include seamless integration of technology in all early childhood settings.</p>
<p>According to DEC, technology should be used to increase children’s access to learning activities in the natural environment as well as to enhance child development in the motor, cognitive, communication, social, adaptive, life skill, play, health, and academic domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1096250612464763">Stremmel, 2005</xref>). DEC also recommends technology practices that focus on learning outcomes that enhance independence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1096250612464763">Stremmel, 2005</xref>). To adhere to DAP and DEC recommendations, early childhood professionals must be prepared to scrutinize apps to determine whether they support or limit achieving the educational goals of young children with disabilities. We suggest evaluating apps for developmentally appropriate content to ensure they support DAP.</p>
<fig id="fig8-1096250612464763" position="anchor">

<sec id="section4-1096250612464763">
<title>Examining Apps for Content</title>
<p>To be considered developmentally appropriate, apps should (a) be based on the child’s interest, (b) allow the child to make choices, and (c) address the child’s learning needs at their current stage of development while simultaneously challenging the child to continue to grow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1096250612464763">National Association for the Education of Young Children, 2009</xref>). DEC suggests that DAP requires professionals to consider not only the child’s developmental age but also his or her chronological age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1096250612464763">Wolery, 2005</xref>). The content of the app should be related to the child’s Individualized Education Program (IEP)/Individual Family Service Plan (IFSP) goals and outcomes, and be challenging enough for the child to make progress in the general curriculum all the while ensuring the content is not so difficult that it elicits frustration. To meet these requirements, early childhood professionals must first understand each child’s strengths and interests to determine whether the content of an app will aid in achieving educational goals. For example, if a child with autism prefers animation of a specific animal or cartoon character, then evaluating an app for content should begin with searches for educational apps that include the preferred animal or character. In addition, to ensure a child’s interest in the instructional content, the app should be interactive, allow for problem-solving opportunities, include open-ended discovery, and encourage creative play (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1096250612464763">Boone &amp; Higgins, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1096250612464763">Nikolopoulou, 2007</xref>). Early childhood professionals may need to frequently change the apps they use as well as the amount of time allowed for child use to ensure that content remains challenging and interesting to the child. It is not sufficient, unfortunately, to select an app based on its incorporation of these features. Apps should also be inspected for characteristics to avoid.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>“Early childhood professionals should consider whether the app includes socially appropriate language, excludes acts of violence, and refrains from cultural stereotypes.”</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Educational apps should avoid rote memorization and should not be a version of an electronic worksheet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1096250612464763">Haugland, 2005</xref>). Many popular educational apps for preschool children require rote responses, so early childhood professionals should consider evaluating the types of cues and responses an app uses. For example, the app <italic>Educator Alphabet 1 for Kids</italic>™ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1096250612464763">Education Electric, 2010</xref>) presents a screen with a capital letter along with audio of a voice that says the name of the letter on the screen. When the child touches the next button, the subsequent letter of the alphabet appears. This feature of the app allows the child to rapidly click the next button causing the letters appear more quickly than the audio (a major design flaw). Essentially, the content of this app is the digital equivalent of flashcards, and therefore is not consistent with content that is DAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1096250612464763">Haugland, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1096250612464763">National Association for the Education of Young Children, 2009</xref>). In contrast, the app <italic>Dexteria</italic>™ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1096250612464763">BinaryLabs, 2011</xref>) helps children develop fine motor skills that are prerequisites for writing and cutting with scissors. While interacting with the app, children are required to pinch and tap objects that move around the screen as these objects become increasingly smaller and faster moving. <italic>Dexteria</italic>™ also provides opportunities for children to trace letters and numbers. The difficulty levels of the activities adjust in accordance to the child’s responses, presenting games that increase in difficulty based on the child’s demonstrated skill level. <italic>Dexteria</italic>™ also keeps track of daily scores, supporting early childhood professionals with data that can be used to chart children’s progress (more about the important feature is discussed later).</p>
<p>No discussion of the developmental appropriateness of apps would be complete without evaluating the social and cultural responsiveness of the content. Early childhood professionals should consider whether the app includes socially appropriate language, excludes acts of violence, and refrains from cultural stereotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1096250612464763">Nikolopoulou, 2007</xref>). There are many popular apps for young children that violate these basic principles. Examples of violence can be seen in the popular app <italic>Angry Birds</italic>™ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1096250612464763">Rovio, 2009</xref>), which requires the user to seek revenge by knocking down structures to destroy the pigs that have stolen the bird’s eggs. Another example of violence is found in the popular app <italic>Talking Tom Cat</italic>™ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1096250612464763">Outfit 7, 2012</xref>). <italic>Talking Tom Cat</italic>™ encourages children to hurt Tom the cat by poking it and yanking on his tail, causing him to scream in pain. These apps may seem benign and children will likely find them enjoyable, but early childhood professionals must consider whether these are the kinds of messages that should be conveyed to young children in educational settings. In contrast, <italic>Smart Oral Motor</italic>™ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1096250612464763">Smarty Ears, 2011</xref>) asks the children to copy the funny faces of a duck as he makes the faces. These movements include puffing out cheeks, making the mouth into an “O” shape, puckering lips, and moving the tongue in a variety of ways. This app, if used in conjunction with a mirror and adult guidance, allows the children to practice oral motor skills in a way that is playful as well as socially and developmentally appropriate.</p>
<p>Early childhood professionals should carefully evaluate feedback and language used in apps to ensure the language is appropriate for children. Care should also be taken when using free (i.e., “lite”) apps as they often contain advertisements that appear on some or all screens. The content of these advertisements may be unsuitable for young children and, in most cases, can result in automatic redirection to a commercial website when clicked or tapped. This does not mean that free or lite apps should never be used. Rather, it demonstrates the importance of reviewing the app’s content for all potentially negative content before use in educational settings. It may be necessary to either purchase the full, advertisement-free version of the app, or seek out alternative apps that present similar content in more developmentally appropriate ways.</p>
<p><italic>With the information about app content evaluation and DAP at her disposal, Ms. Roberts can evaluate the content for accessibility and make an informed educational decision. Rather than trial and error approaches to integrating apps into her daily instruction for Michael, Ms. Roberts can evaluate the handful of accessible apps for content that is (a) interesting and likely to sustain attention, (b) socially and culturally appropriate, and (c) completely free of inappropriate content. She quickly realizes that Dexteria</italic>™ <italic>will be much more effective for Michael because it is responsive to his abilities. Dexteria</italic>™ <italic>also gives him more than one way to respond and uses themes, language, and content consistent with DAP. Ms. Roberts also finds that Dexteria</italic>™ <italic>may better maintain Michael’s attention because it gradually increases in difficulty and presents learning concepts in a playful, game-like format.</italic></p>

<sec id="section5-1096250612464763">
<title>Examining Apps for Individual Learning Needs</title>
<p>DEC recommends that the use of technology be related to the student’s instructional objectives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1096250612464763">Stremmel, 2005</xref>). When an app has been determined to be accessible and is developmentally appropriate, then early childhood professionals should begin to evaluate whether the app includes features that allow customization to meet the unique learning needs of each child. Early childhood professionals should examine whether the app requires or teaches prerequisite skills (e.g., tapping, pinching, zooming, waiting, etc.) to ensure the child benefits from the app’s educational content. If a child uses assistive technology, early childhood professionals must explore whether the assistive technology is compatible with the device and/or app prior to using it for educational purposes. It is likely that most apps will have limited features to allow for a customizable user experience. However, even if customizing features are lacking, early childhood professionals still may be able to provide an individualized experience through instructional planning and organization.</p>
<p>Individualized instruction can be achieved by aligning an app that targets the skills to be learned with the child’s daily schedule and routines. For example, if a child has a goal related to matching or categorizing, the early childhood professional could select an app that incorporates (i.e., embeds) practice in matching as part of a game. Similarly, if a child had an outcome of increasing vocabulary, an app may be selected with many visual pictures on the screen so that the child and adult can talk about colors, shapes, objects, and/or directional concepts (i.e., up, down, on, over, under). By choosing apps that embed opportunities for practicing targeted skills, early childhood professionals can use apps as a context for teaching skills that are part of a broad intervention plan designed to help the child make progress in the general curriculum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1096250612464763">Travers et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1096250612464763">Figure 2</xref> contains the Preschool App Evaluation Guide. This guide is a checklist that incorporates the critical features early childhood professionals should look for when evaluating apps for educational purposes in classrooms. Using the guide, early childhood professionals can evaluate apps by rating them for the accessibility, content, and individualization features that have been outlined. The guide includes directions for the individual who will rate the apps as well as a space for the title and price of the app. Each key area is followed by a list of features that the rater should evaluate and a place to write section scores and the overall score. The guide also includes an area for handwritten notes (e.g., “might be good for student with vision impairments”). After the rating guide has been completed for a pool of potential apps, scores can be compared and early childhood professionals can use these scores to help decide which app might be most appropriate. Apps with the overall highest score might be chosen or, alternatively, apps that rated particularly better in a critical area (e.g., accessibility) may be preferred. The use of the Preschool App Selection Guide will be helpful for early childhood professionals such as Ms. Roberts.</p>

<title>Ms. Roberts Finds an App</title>
<p><italic>Ms. Roberts collects data related to Michael’s challenging behaviors and discovers that these behaviors often occur during transition periods in the classroom. She finds an app called Choiceworks</italic>™ <italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1096250612464763">Bee Visual, LLC, 2012</xref>) and thinks it might help Michael with transitions. Her evaluation of the app’s features reveals that it has most of the features on the checklist, so she decides to use it to make a visual schedule for Michael. Each morning Ms. Roberts and Michael sit down together and plan what he wants to do for his center activities. They select pictures and place them on a schedule created in the app, similar to the classroom picture schedule. Then, Michael moves to each center according to his self-selected schedule. Ms. Roberts sets the timer feature of the app to help Michael remember to remain at center until time is up. Then the timer reminds Michael that it is time to switch to the next activity. She gradually increases the time required in a center each day until he is independently able to stay engaged at a center for the required 5 min. As Michael completes each center, he is able to check it off on the schedule in the app. Ms. Roberts examines her data and concludes that Choiceworks</italic>™ <italic>is helpful in increasing Michael’s time on task, reducing the frequency of problem behaviors occurring between transitions.</italic></p>

<title>Lesson Planning for Using Apps in the Classroom</title>
<p>An activity-based intervention approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1096250612464763">Pretti-Frontczak &amp; Bricker, 2004</xref>) will allow early childhood professionals to embed multiple and variable opportunities to use apps into daily activities/lessons in an effort to achieve educational goals. Embedding involves systematically giving children opportunities to practice skills related to IEP goals/IFSP outcomes within routine activities in conjunction with observational data collection for progress monitoring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1096250612464763">Pretti-Frontczak &amp; Bricker, 2004</xref>). To embed learning opportunities, early childhood professionals need to follow the child’s lead and interests to create multiple and varied opportunities to practice skills as well as to provide timely feedback vital to learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1096250612464763">Grisham-Brown, Pretti-Frontczak, Hawkins, &amp; Winchell, 2009</xref>). This individualized teaching practice is effective for children with and without disabilities in early childhood settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1096250612464763">Craig-Unkefer &amp; Kaiser, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1096250612464763">Grisham-Brown et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1096250612464763">Wolery, Anthony, Caldwell, Snyder, &amp; Morgante, 2002</xref>) and should be extended to include activities that use technology. To embed apps into classroom activities, early childhood professionals need to plan strategically for effective implementation. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1096250612464763">Figure 3</xref>, we present a sample of how Ms. Roberts plans to embed opportunities to practice various targeted skills with apps during the activities of the school day. Once apps have been identified and deemed appropriate, planning should include (a) selecting apps that can support lessons and themes, (b) deciding how the apps can be used in conjunction with other teaching strategies (e.g., direct instruction, modeling, scaffolding), and (c) developing a data collection plan for assessing the child’s learning when apps are used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1096250612464763">Newby, Stepich, Lehman, &amp; Russell, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1096250612464763">Stremmel, 2005</xref>). This is just one example of how a planning worksheet derived from activity-based intervention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1096250612464763">Pretti-Frontczak &amp; Bricker, 2004</xref>) can be used by early childhood professionals who want to embed instruction that uses technology into daily activities.</p>

</fig>
<p><italic>Ms. Roberts made a chart to help her plan the use of apps throughout the day for Michael and used it to guide her lesson planning (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1096250612464763">Figure 4</xref>). To start, she listed the classroom schedule in the appropriate column. Then, she identified the major goals/outcomes in Michael’s IEP and listed them in the appropriate row. Next, she wrote the names of the apps that scored well during her evaluation and aligned them with the proper developmental domain. Ms. Roberts considered whether one of the identified apps could address Michael’s learning needs (i.e., IEP goals) during each of the day’s activities. If an app could be embedded, she wrote the corresponding number for the app. If no app could be embedded, she left the box empty. Empty boxes served as indicators to Ms. Roberts that she might need to investigate whether and how technology might be integrated into activities to support learning as well as how many opportunities in the day Michael had to practice the skills related to his IEP goals. Ms. Roberts referred to the matrix when planning her lessons (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1096250612464763">Figure 4</xref>) and prepared to collect observational data during these opportunities. She also made sure to train her support staff to use the apps during the various activities of the day. All that was left to do was evaluate the effects the apps had on Michael’s educational progress and to rely on those data for making decisions.</italic></p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Educational research will likely never be able to keep pace with technological innovation. It therefore will become increasingly important that early childhood professionals rely on existing knowledge to effectively evaluate and integrate emerging technology in the natural environment rather than waiting for a broad platform of research to inform their teaching practices. Although educators are better informed about how to integrate technology into educational settings than in previous decades, the reality is that poorly designed educational software still is commonplace (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1096250612464763">Boone &amp; Higgins, 2005</xref>). No matter how well it is designed, technology cannot replace human interaction or a teacher and parent’s attention to each child’s unique needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1096250612464763">L. Z. Cooper, 2005</xref>). Still, integrating technology in early childhood settings is an essential aspect of early learning and yields greater academic success in later years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1096250612464763">Judge, Puckett, &amp; Bell, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>The recent popularity and availability of tablet and handheld computers, as well as the number of apps available in the marketplace, represent how rapid technological innovation leads to unique challenges for early childhood professionals. There is a growing consensus that early childhood professionals must be able to successfully integrate technology into their classrooms and that critical consumption of technology is an important trait of today’s early childhood professionals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1096250612464763">Jensen &amp; Kiley, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1096250612464763">National Association for the Education of Young Children, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1096250612464763">Travers &amp; More, in press</xref>). The effectiveness of educational technology is directly related to the extent that a teacher aligns the goals of his or her instruction with learner characteristics, software design, and implementation of educational technology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1096250612464763">Sivin-Kachala &amp; Bialo, 2000</xref>). Simply handing a device loaded with apps purported to have educational value to a child does not ensure educational benefit. Careful evaluation of app content in relation to individualized instruction is essential to ensuring children are learning in a manner consistent with DAP. To achieve the best possible outcomes, apps should be selected based on universally designed curriculum to assure access to meaningful participation in daily routines and activities for young children with disabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1096250612464763">DEC, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1096250612464763">Horn &amp; Banerjee, 2009</xref>). However, a one-time examination of apps will not be enough to ensure appropriateness. Early childhood professionals will need to periodically reevaluate existing and new apps to ensure they meet the standards previously outlined. Critical evaluation of apps along with strategic lesson planning derived from an activity-based approach will likely result in better educational outcomes.</p>
