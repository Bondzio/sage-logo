<abstract>
<p>White police officers and undergraduate students mistakenly shoot unarmed Black suspects more than White suspects on computerized shoot/don’t shoot tasks. This bias is typically attributed to cultural stereotypes of Black men. Yet, previous research has not examined whether such biases emerge even in the absence of cultural stereotypes. The current research investigates whether individual differences in chronic beliefs about interpersonal threat interact with target group membership to elicit shooter biases, even when group membership is unrelated to race or cultural stereotypes about danger. Across two studies, participants with strong beliefs about interpersonal threats were more likely to mistakenly shoot outgroup members than ingroup members; this was observed for unfamiliar, arbitrarily formed groups using a minimal group paradigm (Study 1) and racial groups not culturally stereotyped as dangerous (Asians; Study 2). Implications for the roles of both group membership and cultural stereotypes in shaping decisions to shoot are discussed.</p>

<body>
<p>One of the most critical decisions a police or military officer can make is to shoot or not shoot a criminal suspect. In such circumstances, an officer must determine within a split second whether a suspect is armed and dangerous. Like all human beings, police and military officers are fundamentally motivated to protect themselves from harm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0146167212450516">Kenrick, Griskevicius, Neuberg, &amp; Schaller, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0146167212450516">Neuberg, Kenrick, &amp; Schaller, 2011</xref>). Consequently, officers are highly motivated to identify and self-protectively shoot armed suspects with malevolent intentions. At the same time, however, those officers must avoid shooting unarmed, innocent bystanders. Unfortunately, people are imperfect, and errors are inevitable. As a result, there will undoubtedly be times when an officer mistakenly assumes that a suspect is armed and subsequently mistakenly shoots an unarmed individual. Such mistakes can produce devastating outcomes in which an innocent bystander is killed.</p>
<p>Although the death of an innocent person is cause enough to warrant research into the factors shaping decisions to shoot, understanding shooter decisions becomes even more critical when one considers the broader social implications of certain types of mistakes. In particular, when mistakes occur within an interracial context (e.g., when a White officer shoots an unarmed Black suspect), the consequences are compounded by societal issues surrounding racism, affecting large communities and interracial relations as a whole. Communities may rise up in protest, and police departments may be accused of racist and discriminatory practices.</p>
<p>Because of this, over the past decade, numerous lines of research have focused on the role of race in shaping decisions to shoot or not shoot suspects (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0146167212450516">Correll, Park, Judd, &amp; Wittenbrink, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0146167212450516">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0146167212450516">Kenworthy, Barden, Diamond, &amp; del Carmen, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0146167212450516">Plant, Peruche, &amp; Butz, 2005</xref>). This research has revealed a consistent pattern: On computer tasks, White Americans, including college students and police officers, mistakenly shoot unarmed Black suspects more than White suspects (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0146167212450516">Correll, Park, Judd, Wittenbrink, Sadler, et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0146167212450516">Plant &amp; Peruche, 2005</xref>). In line with the general public’s speculation about racism and discrimination, this bias typically has been attributed to racial stereotypes prevalent in American culture: Because Black men are stereotyped as dangerous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0146167212450516">Devine, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0146167212450516">Devine &amp; Elliot, 1995</xref>), people assume Black men are armed and therefore shoot them. Indeed, impressive evidence has accumulated revealing the role of racial stereotypes about aggression and criminality in shaping decisions to shoot Black men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0146167212450516">Correll et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0146167212450516">Correll, Park, Judd, &amp; Wittenbrink, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0146167212450516">Fleming, Brandy, &amp; Kimble, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0146167212450516">Glaser &amp; Knowles, 2008</xref>). This literature suggests that shooter biases are largely influenced by cultural stereotypes—prevailing beliefs about specific groups that are idiosyncratic to the local culture.</p>
<p>In the current research, we offer a unique perspective on shooter biases by suggesting that although cultural stereotypes implying that a group is dangerous may be sufficient to produce shooter biases, they are not necessary. We do not argue against the role of cultural stereotypes in shaping decisions to shoot. Rather, we suggest that there are strong theoretical reasons to suspect that, in addition to those cultural stereotypes, there are other factors that can facilitate biased decisions to shoot members of a racial outgroup. In particular, we hypothesize that, for certain types of individuals (those who are particularly concerned about protecting themselves from danger), basic ingroup/outgroup distinctions are sufficient to elicit shooter biases.</p>
<sec id="section1-0146167212450516">
<title>Self-Protection Concerns and Outgroup Bias</title>
<p>Shooter biases are thought to reflect self-protective responses to potential dangers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0146167212450516">Correll, Wittenbrink, Park, Judd, &amp; Goyle, 2011</xref>). Indeed, this is a predominant explanation offered by researchers for why people mistakenly shoot unarmed members of racial groups that are culturally stereotyped as dangerous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0146167212450516">Correll, Park, Judd, &amp; Wittenbrink, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0146167212450516">Correll, Urland, &amp; Ito, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0146167212450516">Fleming et al., 2010</xref>). Cues of potential danger (such as cultural stereotypes about criminality and aggressiveness) promote decisions and behaviors designed to reduce chances of physical harm to oneself, even if it means increasing the chances of harming others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0146167212450516">Haselton &amp; Nettle, 2006</xref>). Because of the severe costs (e.g., death) that may accompany failure to shoot an armed criminal suspect, danger cues bias people toward shooting suspects even when those suspects are unarmed.</p>
<p>Although cultural stereotypes about a target may be one factor influencing a perceiver’s perceptions of danger, whether a perceiver evaluates another person as dangerous should also be influenced by the perceiver’s own characteristics. For example, people differ substantially in their general perceptions of threat. Some individuals generally believe that their world is a dangerous place full of interpersonal peril, whereas other individuals tend to be less concerned with interpersonal threat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0146167212450516">Schaller, Park, &amp; Faulkner, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0146167212450516">Schaller, Park, &amp; Mueller, 2003</xref>). Individual differences in chronic perceptions of danger should have influences on the degree to which one behaves in a self-protective manner. People chronically concerned about interpersonal threat may be quicker and more likely to engage in self-protective behaviors. Thus, to the extent that shooter biases reflect self-protective concerns, individual differences in beliefs about interpersonal danger are likely to have strong influences on decision to shoot.</p>
<p>Evolutionary perspectives of self-protection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0146167212450516">Kenrick et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0146167212450516">Neuberg et al., 2011</xref>) suggest that heightened concerns about interpersonal threat should only lead to self-protective biases in response to certain individuals. Not all people are equally likely to pose a threat, and it would be highly counterproductive to respond to all individuals in a self-protective manner. Danger-avoidant responses can hinder progress toward other fundamental goals (e.g., forming and maintaining coalitions and friendships) if implemented indiscriminately in response to every person one meets. Consequently, individual differences in concerns about interpersonal threat may influence self-protective biases only in response to targets that might be suspected of posing threats to physical safety.</p>
<p>Throughout human evolutionary history, a common source of physical danger has been intergroup conflict. Competing coalitions have posed significant threats to oneself and one’s group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0146167212450516">Baer &amp; McEachron, 1982</xref>). One implication of this is that concerns about interpersonal threat should be projected more strongly onto members of an outgroup than members of one’s ingroup. Thus, members of outgroups may be especially likely to be viewed as potential sources of danger among individuals concerned about physical threat. Consistent with this hypothesis, prior research has shown that individuals who believe the world to be a dangerous place overperceive threat in the faces of outgroup members, but not ingroup members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0146167212450516">Maner et al., 2005</xref>), and they assume that dangerous unknown others are more likely to be members of an outgroup than ingroup (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0146167212450516">Miller, Maner, &amp; Becker, 2010</xref>). Applying this to shooter biases suggests that individuals who are particularly concerned about interpersonal danger may be more likely to display self-protective shooter biases in response to outgroup members than ingroup members.</p>
<p>It is important to note that this perspective does not imply that cultural stereotypes implying that a group is dangerous need be present for self-protective shooter biases to emerge. Concerns about interpersonal threat should elicit self-protective biases in response to outgroups generally, even in the absence of cultural stereotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0146167212450516">Miller et al., 2010</xref>). That is, even when there are no preexisting cultural stereotypes linking a specific outgroup with danger, concerns about physical threat may promote the creation of such outgroup–danger associations. Consequently, concerns about interpersonal threat may lead to self-protective shooter biases in response to outgroup members who are not culturally stereotyped as physically dangerous.</p>
<p>Moreover, this perspective does not imply that race need be the cue that signals coalitional status. Rather, race may be just one potential cue of group membership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0146167212450516">Cosmides, Tooby, &amp; Kurzban, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0146167212450516">Kurzban, Tooby, &amp; Cosmides, 2001</xref>). Concerns about interpersonal threat should heighten self-protective responses to members of an outgroup, regardless of the way in which groups are identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0146167212450516">Miller et al., 2010</xref>). Indeed, the propensity for perceiving outgroup members as a source of physical threat may be so ingrained that individuals who are concerned about danger display self-protective biases in response to outgroup members even when the groups have only recently been formed and group membership lacks strong personal or cultural meaning. In sum, for individuals high in beliefs about interpersonal danger, simply categorizing others as outgroup members (even when group membership has nothing to do with race or cultural stereotypes implying danger) may be enough to elicit self-protective shooter biases.</p>

<title>Overview</title>
<p>In two studies, we tested the hypothesis that, for individuals high in beliefs about interpersonal danger, outgroup membership would be sufficient to elicit shooter biases, even when the outgroup lacks preexisting cultural stereotypes about physical danger. Study 1 tested this hypothesis by using a minimal group paradigm. Study 2 tested this hypothesis by examining shooter responses to members of a racial outgroup not culturally stereotyped as dangerous. We predicted that individuals chronically concerned about interpersonal threat would mistakenly shoot unarmed outgroup members more than ingroup members.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0146167212450516">
<title>Study 1</title>
<p>Minimal group paradigms (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0146167212450516">Gramzow &amp; Gaertner, 2005</xref>) afford opportunities to test for intergroup biases in the absence of cultural stereotypes. If the groups have just been formed within the laboratory, there cannot be preexisting cultural stereotypes about the specific groups. Any stereotypes that do emerge (such as an association between outgroup membership and danger) must be created by the individual only after group categorization has occurred. Thus, in Study 1, participants performed a shoot/don’t shoot task used in previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0146167212450516">Plant et al., 2005</xref>), but rather than responding to targets varying in race, participants responded to targets varying according to newly formed minimal group membership. This allowed for a strong test of the hypothesis that, even in the absence of preexisting cultural stereotypes, participants chronically concerned about interpersonal threat would be more likely to mistakenly shoot members of the outgroup than their ingroup.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section5-0146167212450516">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>Ninety-nine undergraduates (age = 18-24; 68 women; 79% White, 7% Black, 2% Asian, 8% more than one race, 4% other) participated for course credit.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0146167212450516">1</xref></sup> One additional person participated, but due to computer malfunction that participant’s data were not recorded.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0146167212450516">
<title>Materials</title>
<p>Stimuli consisted of 12 White, male faces displaying neutral expressions used in previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0146167212450516">DeWall, Maner, &amp; Rouby, 2009</xref>). Two versions of each face were created in which an object (Version 1: gun, Version 2: neutral object) was superimposed alongside the face (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0146167212450516">Plant et al., 2005</xref>, for a detailed description of stimuli). In addition, consistent with previous minimal group research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0146167212450516">Bernstein, Young, &amp; Hugenberg, 2007</xref>), stimuli were placed on both red and green backgrounds.</p>
<p>The shooter task consisted of one practice and three experimental blocks. During the practice block, participants performed 12 trials in which they saw pictures of only target objects (guns or neutral items). During each experimental block, participants saw 24 faces (6 of each background and object combination). Each picture appeared in a random location on the screen until participants made a response or until a 630-ms time limit was reached. If the participant made a wrong response or the trial timed out, an “ERROR” message was displayed for 1,000 ms.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0146167212450516">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>To create minimal groups, participants underwent a procedure used in previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0146167212450516">Bernstein et al., 2007</xref>). Participants completed the Big Five Inventory questionnaire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0146167212450516">John &amp; Srivastava, 1999</xref>). The experimenter supposedly scored the questionnaire (in reality, questionnaires were never scored) and informed participants that they had a red or green personality (randomized across participants). Participants were then given a red or green sticker to wear (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0146167212450516">DeSteno, Dasgupta, Bartlett, &amp; Cajdric, 2004</xref>, for a similar procedure).</p>
<p>For the shooter task, participants were instructed to shoot individuals paired with guns (by pressing “A”) and to not shoot individuals paired with neutral items (by pressing “L”) as quickly and accurately as possible. Participants were told that background colors denoted targets’ personalities. Thus, ingroup targets had a background color the same as the participant’s personality (e.g., red for a red personality); outgroup targets had a different background color (e.g., green for a red personality).</p>
<p>Last, participants completed the Belief in a Dangerous World Scale (BDW; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0146167212450516">Altemeyer, 1988</xref>). The BDW is a 12-item measure examining chronic beliefs about interpersonal danger. Scoring high on this measure indicates greater beliefs that the world is a dangerous place where one is a potential target of interpersonal harm (e.g., “There are many dangerous people in our society who will attack someone out of pure meanness, for no reason at all”). Average scores across all 12 items, after reverse scoring appropriate items, were calculated for each participant (α = .80).</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0146167212450516">
<title>Results</title>
<p>On average, 17.7% of each participant’s trials were excluded due to not responding within the 630 ms window or responding in under 300 ms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0146167212450516">Plant et al., 2005</xref>). Two participants had a high number of trials removed (greater than 3 <italic>SD</italic> above the mean), and two participants had BDW scores greater than 3 <italic>SD</italic> above the mean; those participants’ data were excluded.</p>
<p>In a mixed-model General Linear Model (GLM), percentage of incorrect responses was predicted from target object (gun vs. neutral item; within-subjects), target group (ingroup vs. outgroup; within-subjects), BDW (continuous, between-subjects), and all interactions. As predicted, we observed a three-way interaction between target object, target group, and BDW, <italic>F</italic>(1, 93) = 3.54, <italic>p</italic> = .06, partial η<sup>2</sup> = .04.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0146167212450516">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>Follow-up analyses examined responses to armed and unarmed targets separately. Analyses of armed targets revealed no significant effects, all <italic>p</italic>s &gt; .60. For unarmed targets, there was a significant interaction between target group and BDW, <italic>F</italic>(1, 93) = 5.43, <italic>p</italic> = .02, partial η<sup>2</sup> = .06. Subsequent analyses examined simple effects of target group at 1 <italic>SD</italic> above and below the mean of BDW (<italic>M</italic> = 2.85, <italic>SD</italic> = .51; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0146167212450516">Aiken &amp; West, 1991</xref>). Participants high in BDW (1 <italic>SD</italic> above the mean) mistakenly shot unarmed outgroup targets more than ingroup targets, <italic>F</italic>(1, 93) = 5.10, <italic>p</italic> = .03, partial η<sup>2</sup> = .05 (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0146167212450516">Table 1</xref>). Among participants low in BDW (1 <italic>SD</italic> below the mean), there was no effect of target group, <italic>F</italic>(1, 93) = 1.09, <italic>p</italic> = .30, partial η<sup>2</sup> = .01.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Participants with strong beliefs about interpersonal danger were more likely to mistakenly shoot outgroup than ingroup members. Because minimal groups were used, those shooter biases could not have been influenced by preexisting cultural stereotypes. Thus, Study 1’s findings suggest that, for individuals who believe the world to be a dangerous place, shooter biases can occur even in the absence of cultural stereotypes about danger and criminality.</p>
<p>Although we observed biases associated with shooting unarmed targets (as was predicted), no biases were observed for armed targets. This is consistent with some previous research demonstrating shooter biases only for unarmed targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0146167212450516">Correll et al., 2002</xref>—Study 3; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0146167212450516">Peruche &amp; Plant, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0146167212450516">Plant &amp; Peruche, 2005</xref>). However, other research suggests that people display shooter biases for armed targets as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0146167212450516">Correll et al., 2002</xref>—Study 2; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0146167212450516">Plant et al., 2005</xref>). Prior to speculating why we might have observed effects for unarmed targets only, we chose to examine whether the difference between armed and unarmed targets replicated in Study 2. Nevertheless, as a whole, Study 1’s findings provide initial support for the hypothesis that for certain individuals (those concerned about interpersonal threat), outgroup membership may be sufficient to elicit shooter biases.</p>

<title>Study 2</title>
<p>As mentioned previously, the vast majority of research on shooter biases has focused on responses to targets varying in race. To link the current research with this literature, Study 2 was designed to examine shooter biases in response to targets that varied in race rather than minimal group membership. In many contemporary societies, race serves as a salient signal of group membership. Race often is linked with patterns of association, cooperation, and competition—the same cues that evolved to signal coalitional status. From an evolutionary perspective, the categorization of race is a by-product of an evolved mechanism aimed at categorizing others in terms of coalitional status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0146167212450516">Cosmides et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0146167212450516">Kurzban et al., 2001</xref>). Thus, individual differences in concerns about danger that promote self-protective biases in response to minimal outgroups may also promote biases in response to racial outgroups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0146167212450516">Maner et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0146167212450516">Miller et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0146167212450516">Schaller, Park, &amp; Faulkner, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0146167212450516">Schaller, Park, &amp; Mueller, 2003</xref>). Applying this to shooter biases suggests that individuals who are particularly concerned about interpersonal danger may be more likely to mistakenly shoot unarmed racial outgroup members than racial ingroup members.</p>
<p>Although we hypothesized that culturally held racial stereotypes about danger are not necessary to elicit shooter biases, we also hypothesized that those cultural stereotypes can be sufficient to elicit shooter biases. That is, although individual differences in chronic concerns about interpersonal threat can influence decisions to shoot unarmed outgroup targets in the absence of cultural stereotypes, cultural stereotypes pertaining to criminality and aggressiveness should also influence decisions to shoot unarmed targets. Indeed, both social learning and evolutionary perspectives suggest that self-protective shoot/don’t shoot decisions should be influenced by danger-related stereotypes that preexist within one’s culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0146167212450516">Correll, Park, Judd, &amp; Wittenbrink, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0146167212450516">Miller et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Thus, consistent with prior research, in the current study, White participants responded to White targets (ingroup members) and Black targets (outgroup members culturally stereotyped as dangerous), and also Asian targets. We chose to include Asian targets because they served as a useful comparison to Black targets. Asian and Black targets are similar in that, with respect to White participants, they are both racial outgroups. Yet, the local cultural stereotypes associated with Black and Asian Americans were very different. A group of 30 students from the same university in which the current study took place were asked to list common cultural stereotypes of Black, Asian, and White men. A higher percentage of students listed concepts associated with danger (e.g., violent, aggressive, hostile) when thinking of cultural stereotypes pertaining to Black men (93.3%) than White men (3.3%) or Asian men (0%) (McNemar tests: Black vs. White, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001; Black vs. Asian, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001; White vs. Asian, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .99).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0146167212450516">3</xref></sup> Thus, although Black targets represented a racial outgroup culturally stereotyped as dangerous, Asians targets represented a racial outgroup not culturally stereotyped as dangerous.</p>
<p>Because both Black and Asian targets were members of outgroups, we hypothesized that White participants with strong beliefs about interpersonal threat would mistakenly shoot unarmed Black and Asian targets more than White targets, conceptually replicating Study 1 findings. However, because Black men were culturally stereotyped as dangerous, we also predicted that participants, on average, would mistakenly shoot unarmed Black targets more than White and Asian targets, conceptually replicating findings from other published studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0146167212450516">Correll et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0146167212450516">Correll, Park, Judd, &amp; Wittenbrink, 2007</xref>). Thus, Study 2 examined the contributions of multiple factors (cultural stereotypes, group membership, chronic concerns about interpersonal threat) in shaping shooter biases.</p>

<title>Participants and procedure</title>
<p>A total of 50 White undergraduates (age = 18-21; 32 women) were given the same shooter-task instructions from Study 1 by a White experimenter. Stimuli consisted of 15 male faces (5 Black, 5 White, 5 Asian) displaying neutral expressions. As in Study 1, two versions of each face were created (one gun, one neutral object). The shooter task consisted of one practice and six experimental blocks. During the practice block, participants saw 6 pictures (one of each race and object combination). During each experimental block, participants saw 30 pictures (5 of each race and object combination). All faces were displayed on gray backgrounds. All other aspects of the shooter task were identical to Study 1. After the shooter task, participants completed the BDW (α = .80).</p>

<p>The most conservative test of the group membership hypothesis is a comparison of responses to targets differing in group membership (ingroup vs. outgroup) but not cultural stereotypes about danger.

<p>The most conservative test of the cultural stereotype hypothesis is a comparison of responses to targets differing in danger-related cultural stereotypes but not outgroup status (i.e., both are outgroups relative to the participant).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Study 2 provides further evidence for the influence of group membership and chronic concerns about danger on shooter biases while also conceptually replicating previous findings demonstrating a role of cultural stereotypes in shaping those biases. Participants concerned about interpersonal threat mistakenly shot racial outgroup members (Black and Asian targets) more than ingroup members (White targets). Thus, Study 2’s findings conceptually replicated Study 1’s findings. However, Study 2’s findings were also consistent with previous research highlighting the importance of cultural stereotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0146167212450516">Correll, Park, Judd, &amp; Wittenbrink, 2007</xref>); participants were more likely to shoot targets of an outgroup culturally stereotyped as dangerous (Black men) than other targets (White and Asian men). Thus, these findings indicate that several factors play roles in shaping race-based shooter biases.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that, for participants chronically concerned about interpersonal threat (those high in BDW), the effects of group membership and cultural stereotypes on shooter biases were additive. That is, although high BDW participants displayed self-protective shooter biases in response to both racial outgroups (Asian and Black targets), they were still more likely to mistakenly shoot members of an outgroup culturally stereotyped as dangerous (Black targets) than members of an outgroup lacking danger-related cultural stereotypes (Asian targets). Indeed, the absence of an interaction between belief in a dangerous world and outgroup target race (Black vs. Asian) suggests that high BDW participants were just as sensitive to cultural stereotypes as low BDW participants. That sensitivity simply added to the effect of group membership (ingroup vs. outgroup) on shaping shooter biases. This may reflect differences in the ways in which people determine another person’s level of threat. Individuals who are not chronically concerned about their safety (those low in BDW) may base their perceptions of threat solely upon the overt stereotypes that are continually reinforced in their culture. In contrast, individuals who are highly concerned about their physical safety may base threat perceptions upon both overt cultural stereotypes <italic>and</italic> more subtle signals of potential danger such as group membership. This is not inconsistent with our overall hypothesis that for some individuals (those high in BDW) outgroup membership can elicit shooter biases even in the absence of cultural stereotypes about danger; indeed, high BDW participants were more likely to mistakenly shoot Asian targets (an outgroup not culturally stereotyped as dangerous) than White targets. Rather, it indicates the independent, yet additive, nature of different factors (cultural stereotypes, group membership) in shaping shooter biases.</p>
<p>Consistent with Study 1’s findings, Study 2’s findings demonstrated shooter biases only for unarmed targets; no biases were observed for armed targets. As mentioned previously, some studies have found effects for both unarmed targets and armed targets (i.e., people accurately shoot armed Black targets more than White targets; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0146167212450516">Correll et al., 2002</xref>—Study 2; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0146167212450516">Plant et al., 2005</xref>); others, however, have found effects of target race only for responses to unarmed targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0146167212450516">Peruche &amp; Plant, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0146167212450516">Plant &amp; Peruche, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0146167212450516">Correll et al., 2002</xref>—Study 3). Thus, across studies, biases on the shooter task appear to be most evident when targets are paired with neutral items. This may be due to participants’ high levels of base-rate accuracy (e.g., participants responded correctly on approximately 83% of the trials). As a consequence, moderators (e.g., individual differences in BDW, cultural stereotypes) may have more room to decrease than increase accuracy. Still, it will be important to further investigate the roles of group membership and cultural stereotypes on decisions to shoot when those responses are appropriate (such as when targets are armed).</p>

<title>General Discussion</title>
<p>The current findings provide the first empirical evidence for the hypothesis that, in the absence of preexisting cultural stereotypes pertaining to physical threat, outgroup membership can be sufficient to elicit shooter biases for certain types of individuals. Participants with strong beliefs about interpersonal threat were more likely to mistakenly shoot outgroup members than ingroup members. Study 1 demonstrated this bias for unfamiliar, arbitrarily formed groups—groups for which preexisting cultural stereotypes were not available. Study 2 demonstrated this bias for racial groups not culturally stereotyped as dangerous within the local population (Asians). Thus, shooter biases cannot be explained solely by the activation and application of preexisting cultural stereotypes.</p>
<p>This research highlights the importance of considering multiple causes of shooter biases. Typically, shoot/don’t shoot research has focused on the role of cultural stereotypes about different races (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0146167212450516">Correll et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0146167212450516">Correll, Park, Judd, &amp; Wittenbrink, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0146167212450516">Fleming et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0146167212450516">Kahn &amp; Davies, 2011</xref>). Consistent with previous research, in Study 2, participants mistakenly shot members of an outgroup culturally stereotyped as dangerous (Black men) more than members of an outgroup not culturally stereotyped as dangerous (Asian men). However, the current findings demonstrate that shooter biases are not exclusively driven by cultural stereotypes about danger. Rather, cultural stereotypes may reflect just one of many factors signaling threat that shape decisions to shoot. It is, we argue, the perceptions of danger that ultimately facilitate self-protective decisions and behaviors that lead to increased mistakes for shooting unarmed targets. Those perceptions of danger may stem from multiple facets of personality and intergroup psychology, including, but not limited to, preexisting cultural stereotypes. The current research indicates that self-protective shooter biases also depend on individual differences in people’s tendencies to perceive threat in their environment as well as potentially evolved predispositions to categorize others into ingroups and outgroups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0146167212450516">Cosmides et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0146167212450516">Kurzban et al., 2001</xref>). Perceptions of danger can also be influenced by a range of other factors, and those factors may also play a role in shaping shooter biases (e.g., a target’s sex, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0146167212450516">Plant, Goplen, &amp; Kunstman, 2011</xref>; threat cues within the environment, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0146167212450516">Correll et al., 2011</xref>). Focusing efforts on understanding only one specific factor leaves us blind to the broader and more ultimate cause of shooter biases, in turn limiting the scope of methods potentially capable of reducing those biases. Thus, future research in this area would be benefited by simultaneously examining multiple potential causes of shooter biases.</p>
<p>The current research also begins to reveal the interactive versus independent effects of certain factors underlying shooter biases. For example, in Studies 1 and 2, outgroup membership (in the absence of danger-related cultural stereotypes) led to shooter biases only among individuals relatively high in their concerns about interpersonal threat (i.e., group membership interacted with belief in a dangerous world). In contrast, Study 2 revealed that cultural stereotypes have an effect on shooter biases independent of individual differences in concerns about danger. These findings are similar to those of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0146167212450516">Miller et al. (2010)</xref>, who observed minimal outgroup categorization biases only among individuals with strong beliefs about interpersonal threat, but racial outgroup categorization biases (i.e., categorizing threatening individuals as Black rather than White) among White participants generally. This may reflect the fact that because danger-related stereotypes about specific races are so pervasive in today’s culture, there may be less room for individual differences (such as BDW) to shape self-protective responses when those cultural stereotypes are present. Future research would benefit from a continued investigation of the interactive versus independent nature of various target and perceiver characteristics.</p>
<p>An aim of the current research was to examine the necessity of cultural stereotypes about danger for eliciting shooter biases. Cultural stereotypes are those stereotypes that are commonly held within a local culture and pertain to established groups within that culture (e.g., prevailing beliefs about specific racial groups). Findings from the current studies suggest that cultural stereotypes about danger (though sufficient) are not necessary for producing shooter biases in response to members of outgroups. However, our findings do not rule out the necessity of stereotypes more broadly for eliciting shooter biases. A stereotype is a cognitive generalization about a social category that links members of a group to a specific attribute. Such cognitive associations may be formed at any time and need not be based in one’s culture. Even when groups lack cultural meaning, one can still form associations between groups and specific attributes. Thus, individuals in the current studies who were chronically concerned about interpersonal threat may have quickly formed stereotypes linking outgroup members with danger soon after group categorization occurred (even when there was no cultural information pertaining to those groups, as in Study 1). It is possible that the formation of such stereotypes may be an underlying mechanism for the shooter biases observed in the current studies. Investigating whether stereotypes (broadly speaking) mediate shooter biases is a worthwhile goal for future research.</p>
<p>Although we focused primarily on the shooter biases displayed by White individuals, the current findings may have implications for shooter biases displayed by individuals who belong to racial groups culturally stereotyped as dangerous (e.g., Black individuals). Prior research suggests that Black men, particularly those with stereotypical features, are mistakenly shot more on computer tasks by both White participants and Black participants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0146167212450516">Kahn &amp; Davies, 2011</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0146167212450516">Correll et al., 2002</xref>). This is consistent with the idea that cultural stereotypes can be sufficient to elicit shooter biases: Because Black individuals in American society are aware of the danger-related cultural stereotypes about their own racial group, they should, on average, display a propensity for mistakenly shooting unarmed Black targets. However, integrating this finding with the current research suggests a potentially intriguing moderating effect of belief in a dangerous world. Whereas Black individuals low in concerns about interpersonal threat may show the typical racial shooter bias that is consistent with cultural stereotypes (i.e., mistakenly shooting Black men more than White men), Black individuals high in concerns about interpersonal threat may, in fact, display no (or very little) racial shooter bias. For those individuals, the perceived danger of Black targets generated by cultural stereotypes may be offset by the perceived danger of White targets linked with outgroup membership. That is, the effects of cultural stereotypes, which promote shooter biases in one direction, may be counteracted by the additive effects of group membership, which promote shooter biases in the opposite direction. The current investigation provides a useful springboard from which to directly test this speculation.</p>
<p>Future research would also benefit by examining shooter biases in response to groups specifically culturally stereotyped as <italic>non</italic>-dangerous. Study 1 provided evidence for shooter biases in response to a novel group for which no preexisting cultural stereotypes existed. Study 2 provided evidence for shooter biases in response to Asians—a racial group that although lacking cultural stereotypes pertaining to danger also likely lacked cultural stereotypes pertaining to safety. Thus, the current studies provided evidence for shooter biases in the absence of both threatening and nonthreatening cultural stereotypes. Yet, some groups may be associated with cultural stereotypes that specifically designate the group as nonthreatening (e.g., kindergarten teachers, the elderly). It seems unlikely that people chronically concerned about physical threat would mistakenly shoot unarmed targets belonging to outgroups with nonthreatening cultural stereotypes (e.g., nurturance, warmth). In fact, Study 2’s findings suggest that both people who are and are not chronically concerned about interpersonal threat are sensitive to cultural stereotypes. Thus, an outgroup’s nonthreatening cultural stereotypes may offset any effect of group membership on shooter biases. Future studies would benefit from investigating shooter biases in response to groups with a wide range of cultural stereotypes.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the current research provides important insight into the psychological factors shaping split-second decisions that have life-or-death consequences. Very little research has examined potential factors unrelated to cultural stereotypes shaping such decisions (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0146167212450516">Correll et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0146167212450516">Plant et al., 2011</xref>). By examining the combined roles of group membership, individual differences, and cultural stereotypes, the current research provides a more nuanced and complete understanding of shooter biases.</p>
