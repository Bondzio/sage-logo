<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Over the past 15 years, striking new settlement patterns have emerged that have brought about unprecedented geographic dispersion in the population of approximately 45 million Hispanics in the United States. “Traditional” destination states have attracted relatively smaller shares of the immigrant and native-born Hispanic population in recent years as U.S. Hispanics have increasingly shifted to new areas of the country. In 1990, 10 states or areas were home to 81% of Hispanics in the United States—Texas, California, New York, New Jersey, Florida, Illinois, Massachusetts, Maryland, Virginia, and the District of Columbia. But the share of new Hispanic immigrants settling in these destinations declined from 86% to 69% between 1985-1990 and 1995-2000 and the share of “internal” migrants from elsewhere in the United States to these states fell from 68% to 47% among foreign-born Hispanics and from 52% to 46% among U.S.-born Hispanics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1077558712457242">Frey, 2005</xref>). Nationally, the percentage of the population that is Hispanic grew nearly 40% between 1990 and 2000 (from 9% to 12.5%), whereas in “new” destination states such as Nevada, Georgia, and North Carolina, the percentage nearly doubled to more than tripled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1077558712457242">Guzman, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1077558712457242">Frey, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Disparities in access to health care among Hispanics and other racial/ethnic groups have long been recognized to be substantial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1077558712457242">Derose, Bahney, Lurie, &amp; Escarce, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1077558712457242">Escarce, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1077558712457242">Kapur &amp; Escarce, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1077558712457242">Lees, Wortley, &amp; Coughlin, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1077558712457242">Sambamoorthi &amp; McAlpine, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1077558712457242">Stewart &amp; Silverstein, 2002</xref>). While insurance coverage, language, nativity, and other individual-level sociodemographic characteristics contribute to these disparities, research has increasingly shown that where Hispanics live may also play an important role in explaining differences in access to health care. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1077558712457242">Kirby, Taliaferro, and Zuvekas (2006)</xref>, for example, find that a substantial portion of disparities in use between Whites and Hispanics is accounted for by neighborhood racial and ethnic composition, after controlling for individual characteristics as well as neighborhood socioeconomic status and health care supply. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1077558712457242">Gresenz, Rogowski, and Escarce (2009)</xref> find that living in an area with a relatively high concentration of Spanish speakers or Hispanic immigrants is associated with better access to care among Mexican immigrants, regardless of insurance status, but worse access to care among uninsured U.S.-born Mexican Americans.</p>
<p>The importance of community-level factors to access to health care among Hispanics suggests that the health care experiences of Hispanics in new destinations may be different from those of Hispanics in traditional destinations. To date, only a handful of studies have assessed the health care experiences of Hispanics living in new destinations. Using data from the Community Tracking Study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1077558712457242">Cunningham, Banker, Artiga, and Tolbert (2006)</xref> found that Hispanics in new destinations were less likely than those in major Hispanic centers to have health insurance, live near a safety net provider, have a usual source of care, and have a physician visit in the prior 12 months. In addition, Spanish-speaking Hispanics were especially disadvantaged in new destinations. In a qualitative study of rural Midwestern communities with growing Hispanic populations, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1077558712457242">Blewett, Smaida, Fuentes, and Zuehlke (2003)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1077558712457242">Casey (2004)</xref> documented considerable barriers to access and unmet health care needs.</p>
<p>This study compares the health care experiences of Hispanics in the United States in new and traditional destinations. Our analysis focuses on working age (18-64 years) U.S.-born Mexican Americans and Mexican immigrants living in metropolitan areas. We limit our analyses to Mexican Americans because there are substantial differences in Hispanic populations across subgroups defined by country of origin, and Mexican Americans comprise the largest subgroup. The U.S. Census Bureau estimates that there were 44.3 million Hispanics in the United States in 2006 and that 28.3 million were of Mexican origin.</p>
<sec id="section2-1077558712457242">
<title>New Contribution</title>
<p>This study makes a substantial contribution to our understanding of the factors that influence access to care among Hispanics, the nation’s largest and fastest growing vulnerable group, and provides specific insight into whether programs or policies are needed to address disparities for the numerous Hispanics who have settled in new areas of the country. It is the first study to assess a wide range of measures of access, utilization, and quality of care for people of Mexican origin in new and traditional destinations, to control for multidimensional measures of health status in analyses, and to explore the extent to which any observed differences in access across destinations can be explained by differences in health care market and sociodemographic characteristics of the location.</p>

<title>Conceptual Framework</title>
<p>To frame our analyses, we draw on the behavioral model of health care access and utilization developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1077558712457242">Andersen (1968)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1077558712457242">Andersen and Newman (1973)</xref> and later extended by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1077558712457242">Andersen (1995)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1077558712457242">Davidson, Andersen, Wyn, and Brown (2004)</xref>. The Andersen behavioral model emphasizes the importance of individual-level need, predisposing factors, and enabling factors. Need factors refer to variables that capture medical need for care, that is, health status. Predisposing factors refer to variables that influence individuals’ preferences for health care or inclination to seek care, including sociodemographic characteristics such as age, gender, education, marital status, family size, nativity, and acculturation. Enabling factors refer to variables that facilitate or hinder individuals’ ability to obtain care, including family income, health insurance coverage, and language. The expanded model includes contextual determinants such as characteristics of the social, economic, structural, and public policy environment, which may be especially important for low-income populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1077558712457242">Andersen, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1077558712457242">Davidson et al., 2004</xref>).</p>

<title>Data Sources</title>
<p>The primary source of data is a geocoded version of the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey Household Component (MEPS-HC) for 1996, 1997, and 2000-2006. MEPS is a nationally representative survey sponsored by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ). It is administered in English and Spanish, and it collects the most detailed information available on access to care and health care utilization and expenditures as well as limited information on quality of care. MEPS also contains detailed information on respondents’ socioeconomic and demographic characteristics, including place of birth, and on health status. AHRQ has geocoded the 1996, 1997, and 2000-2006 MEPS-HC data at the Census tract level.</p>
<p>MEPS uses an overlapping panel design in which respondents are interviewed multiple times over about 30 months to collect data spanning 2 calendar years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1077558712457242">Cohen et al., 1996/1997</xref>). The data are rearranged into yearly summary files that summarize information for 1-year observation periods. Therefore, each MEPS respondent can contribute up to two person-year observations. We link the geocoded MEPS data with contextual data from a variety of secondary data sources including the U.S. Census (1990 and 2000, for sociodemographic characteristics), the Area Resource File (for physician supply measures), the Bureau of Primary Health Care’s Uniform Data System (BPHC; for the location of federally funded safety net clinics), the Census of Governments (for measures of health and hospital spending per low-income population), and InterStudy Competitive Edge (for health maintenance organization [HMO] penetration rate). We describe the specific contextual measures we created below.</p>

<sec id="section6-1077558712457242">
<title>Study Sample</title>
<p>Our study sample includes 15,783 working age (18-64 years) U.S.-born Mexican Americans and Mexican immigrants living in metropolitan areas. We excluded respondents in nonmetropolitan areas because sample sizes are too small to allow for their separate analysis. We excluded individuals who were not observed for a full year period, generally as a result of death or institutionalization. Finally, we included only individuals in metro areas that we classified as either new or traditional destinations; we excluded individuals in destinations otherwise classified (see below).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1077558712457242">
<title>Approach</title>
<p>We use multivariate regression techniques to analyze differences in a wide range of measures of access, utilization, and quality of care for individuals in new versus traditional destinations. Our analyses proceed in two steps. We explore whether there are differences in access, use, and quality of care for individuals in new and traditional destinations controlling for individual sociodemographic characteristics but not for characteristics of the local area (Model 1, below). We then explore whether any differences observed are partially or completely explained by characteristics of the local area. Thus, we analyze outcome measures controlling for both individual and local area characteristics, including sociodemographic characteristics of the area and characteristics of the local health care market (Model 2, below).</p>

</sec>
<sec id="section8-1077558712457242">
<title>Dependent variables</title>
<p>The dependent variables in our analyses consist of measures of access to, use of, and quality of care. Access measures included variables indicating whether the subject reported having a usual source of care and whether the subject reported unmet need for or delay receiving care. Utilization measures included an indicator for whether the subject had any office-based visit during the year and indicators for any medical expenditures, any inpatient hospital stay, and any emergency department visit.</p>
<p>Our quality measures included subjects’ satisfaction with their usual source of care and with the health care they received during the preceding 12 months. Our measure of satisfaction with the usual source was an index that combined two 4-point scales indicating how much the usual provider asked about and showed respect for treatments that other doctors may be giving and how much the usual provider asked the person to help make decisions (Cronbach α = .71).</p>
<p>We measured satisfaction with health care over the past 12 months by combining the responses to four specific questions, each scaled from 0 to 4 (<italic>never</italic> to <italic>always</italic>), into an index. The four questions were the following: how often health providers in the past 12 months listened carefully to you, explained things so you understood, showed respect for what you had to say, and spent enough time with you. The index ranged from 4 (<italic>low satisfaction</italic>) to 16 (<italic>high satisfaction</italic>; Cronbach α = .88). We created and analyzed dichotomous indicators for the extremes of the distribution of the satisfaction indices (very satisfied, very dissatisfied).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1077558712457242">
<title>New/Traditional Destination</title>
<p>The key independent variable is an indicator for whether the metropolitan area where a person resides is a new or traditional destination. Researchers have used different approaches for categorizing immigrant destinations. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1077558712457242">Cunningham et al. (2006)</xref> classify the 60 mostly metropolitan communities in the Community Tracking Study as “new growth areas,” “major Hispanic centers,” or “other” based exclusively on the percentage of the population that was Hispanic in 1996/1997 (&lt;5% Hispanic, &gt;20% Hispanic, and 5% to 20% Hispanic, respectively). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1077558712457242">Kandel and Cromartie (2004)</xref> classify nonmetropolitan counties as “high-growth” if they experienced more than 150% growth in their Hispanic population from 1990 to 2000, with an absolute increase of at least 1,000 people; “established Hispanic” if more than 10% of their population was Hispanic in both 1990 and 2000; and “other” if they did not fall into either of these two categories.</p>
<p>We classify new and traditional destinations based on metro area–level estimates of the percentage of the population that was Hispanic in 1990 and the growth in percent Hispanic between 1990 and 2000 (based on U.S. Census data from 1990 and 2000). We use the following thresholds: <italic>Traditional</italic> ≥ 25% Hispanic in 1990; <italic>New</italic> ≤ 20% Hispanic in 1990 with growth of 2.5 percentage points or more between 1990 and 2000. Traditional metro areas thus range from 25% to 94% Hispanic. Among the metro areas with less than 20% Hispanic population in 1990, approximately one third have growth of 2.5 percentage points or more, so our threshold represents metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) in the top third of growth rates.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1077558712457242">
<title>Individual-Level Independent Variables</title>
<p>We include individual-level explanatory variables to control for predisposing, enabling, and need characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1077558712457242">Andersen, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1077558712457242">Andersen &amp; Newman, 1973</xref>). These included age, gender, age–gender interactions, indicator variables for educational attainment (e.g., no high school, some high school, high school graduate, some college, or college graduate), indicators for marital status (e.g., never married, married, widowed, or divorced or separated), family size, indicators for categories of family income (as a percentage of the poverty line), indicators for insurance status (uninsured, public, or private), length of time in the United States, and an indicator for language of the MEPS interview (English or Spanish). (The variable measuring limited English proficiency was not available for most years.) Additional individual-level covariates included a comprehensive set of health status measures spanning four domains: (a) indicators for functional, cognitive, and social limitations; (b) an indicator for vision or hearing problems; (c) indicators for self-rated general and mental health (5-point scales, excellent to poor); and (d) indicators for the count of chronic conditions (including depression, diabetes, hypertension, arthropathies, asthma, anxiety, migraine, disease of lipid metabolism, HIV, cancer, angina, and 12 other chronic conditions; we included a count of chronic conditions as opposed to condition-specific indicators because of the limited prevalence of many of the specific conditions in the sample).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1077558712457242">
<title>Contextual Characteristics</title>
<p>In Model 2, we include a range of area-level covariates to capture characteristics that are likely to affect access, use, and quality of health care, including sociodemographic characteristics and health care market characteristics of the local area. Sociodemographic characteristics include the percentage of the population in the Census tract with income less than the federal poverty line, the percentage with less than a high school degree, the percentage that is Hispanic, and the percentage that is foreign born. The latter two variables are meant to capture potentially important differences across locations in unmeasured factors—which may include, for example, the supply of Spanish-speaking physicians—that are likely to influence access to care and to be correlated with the ethnic composition of the population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1077558712457242">Gresenz et al., 2009</xref>). We also control for region (Northeast, Midwest, West, South) and MSA population size. Health care market characteristics include the HMO penetration rate (either MSA level or state level, depending on data availability for the year of observation), the availability of primary care physicians (the county-level physician-to-population ratio for general internists, family physicians, and general practitioners who finished training and whose main professional activity was patient care), and the availability of the health care safety net, which we measure with the number of Bureau of Primary Health Care–funded health care clinics in the county, scaled to the low-income population, and the level of local government spending on health and hospitals in the metro area, scaled to the low-income population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1077558712457242">Gresenz, Rogowski, &amp; Escarce 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1077558712457242">Marquis, Rogowski, &amp; Escarce, 2004</xref>).</p>

<title>Estimation</title>
<p>We estimate a set of probit models using the sample of U.S.-born Mexican Americans and another set for Mexican American immigrants. All regressions are weighted using weights that reflect the complex design of the MEPS survey as well as survey nonresponse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1077558712457242">Cohen et al., 1996/1997</xref>). All models included indicators year of the MEPS data. Due to the design of the MEPS, subjects could contribute up to two person-year observations to the analyses. We used both person-year observations in our analyses of access and utilization measures. However, we used one observation per subject in our analyses of satisfaction because these ratings are very highly correlated over time. Standard errors are adjusted for clustering due to the design of the MEPS and for the use of more than one person-year observation for the same individual using a Huber-White sandwich estimator.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1077558712457242">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1077558712457242">2</xref> provide descriptive statistics for the sample of working-age Mexican Americans in metropolitan areas (pooled across all years) stratified by nativity (U.S.-born vs. foreign-born). Among U.S.-born Mexican Americans, 65% report having a usual source of care, 5% report an unmet need or delay receiving medical care, and 4% report an unmet need or delay receiving needed prescription drugs in the past 12 months. By comparison, among foreign-born Mexican Americans, less than half report having a usual source of care (48%), and 4% and 2% report an unmet need or delay for medical care or prescription drugs, respectively. U.S.-born Mexican Americans report higher rates of health care use compared with immigrant Mexican Americans. For example, 71% of the U.S.-born report having any medical expenditures compared with 58% of immigrants (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). U.S.-born Mexican Americans are more likely to report satisfaction with their usual source of care and with care over the past 12 months (47% and 50%, respectively) compared with immigrants (43% and 41%, respectively; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05 for both comparisons). U.S.-born and foreign-born Mexican Americans in the sample also vary sociodemographically. For example, 67% of foreign-born Mexican Americans have less than a high school degree, compared with 25% of U.S.-born (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). Immigrants were more likely to report being uninsured (48% vs. 26%, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). Chronic conditions and limitations (functional, social, cognitive) were more likely to be reported by U.S.-born Mexican Americans compared with immigrants (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). However, the U.S.-born were more likely to report excellent or very good self-rated health and mental health (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .05).</p>

By construction, new destination metro areas have a smaller share of the population that is Hispanic. In traditional metro areas, an average of 55% of the population was Hispanic in 2006, compared with 14% in new destinations. New destination metro areas have a smaller percentage of people living in poverty (10% compared with 19% in traditional metro areas) and have a smaller percentage of people who have less than a high school education (11% compared with 21% in traditional metro areas). The primary care physician supply is greater in new destinations, though HMO penetration is lower. There are no statistically significant differences in measured aspects of the local safety net—the number of BPHC sites per low-income population and local health and hospital spending per low-income population. Finally, new destination sites are more likely to be in the Midwest and less likely to be in the West compared with traditional destinations.</p>

<p>We find that immigrant Mexicans in new destinations are more likely to have an inpatient discharge (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .01), an emergency department visit (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .05), and any medical expenditures (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) compared with immigrant Mexicans in traditional destinations (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1077558712457242">Table 4</xref>, Model 1).

<p>When we control for characteristics of the local area (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1077558712457242">Table 4</xref>, Model 2), we find fewer statistically significant effects among Mexican immigrants, but for the U.S.-born, most of the statistically significant effects identified in Model 1 remain and the point estimates of the effects of living in a new destination are larger compared with those from Model 1. Among Mexican immigrants, those in new destinations are more likely to have any medical expenditures compared with those in traditional destinations (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). Among the U.S.-born, the point estimate of the effect of living in a new destination on having an unmet need for medical care is larger in Model 2 compared with Model 1, as is the effect of living in a new destination on the probability of having a low satisfaction with care. In addition, Model 2 results for the U.S.-born show a statistically significant (negative) effect of living in a new destination on the probability of reporting high satisfaction with care over the past 12 months (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) and, further, on the probability of reporting having a usual source of care (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .05).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We found that health care outcomes for U.S.-born Mexican Americans are worse in new destinations than in traditional destinations even after adjusting for a wide range of individual characteristics. Specifically, in models with individual but not contextual characteristics, we found that U.S.-born Mexican Americans who reside in new destinations are more likely than their counterparts in traditional destinations to report unmet need or delay in receiving needed medical care and prescription drugs. U.S.-born Mexican Americans in new destinations are also more likely to report a low level of satisfaction with care. We found no difference in health care utilization outcomes (e.g., use of office-based services, hospital use) between U.S.-born Mexican Americans in new and in traditional destinations.</p>
<p>Interestingly, our findings for Mexican immigrants were not as clear cut. We found no difference between Mexican immigrants residing in new versus traditional destinations in the probability of having a usual source of care, reporting unmet need, and satisfaction with care. However, immigrants who resided in new destinations were more likely than their peers in traditional destinations to be admitted to the hospital, have an emergency room visit, and have any medical care expenditures.</p>
<p>At first blush, these findings suggest that Mexican immigrants may enjoy better access to care in new destinations than in traditional destinations. An alternate explanation, however, is that higher rates of hospital admission and emergency room visits reflect worse access to ambulatory care for immigrants in new destinations. Reduced access to effective ambulatory care has been shown to be associated with higher rates of hospital admission and emergency room visits for ambulatory-care sensitive conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1077558712457242">Billings et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1077558712457242">Bindman et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1077558712457242">Weissman, Gatsonis, &amp; Epstein, 1992</xref>). If this alternative explanation is correct, it is reasonable to ask why Mexican immigrants in new destinations did not report access problems or low satisfaction with care more often than their counterparts in traditional destinations. Because survey responses reflect how actual care compares to expected care, high satisfaction can occur with poor-quality care among individuals who have low expectations of care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1077558712457242">Dayton, Zhan, Sangl, Darby, &amp; Moy, 2006</xref>). Consequently, to the extent that immigrants have low expectations of health care, even minimal levels of access to care and limited quality of care may clear thresholds for satisfaction, resulting in insensitivity of measured assessments to differences in the local health care system.</p>
<p>Adjusting for both individual characteristics and measurable contextual characteristics eliminated most of the differences in use between immigrants in new and traditional destinations, so that the only significant difference that remained was in the probability of having any medical expenditures. By contrast, these adjustments heightened differences between U.S.-born Mexican Americans in new and traditional distinctions and resulted in new significant differences in the probability of having a usual source of care and in the probability of having a high index of satisfaction with care. In both cases, U.S.-born Mexican Americans in new destinations were at a disadvantage relative to those in traditional destinations. The directions of these changes are not surprising when we consider that new destination metro areas had lower poverty rates, higher mean educational attainment, and a higher supply of primary care physicians than traditional destination metro areas. Thus, compared with traditional destinations, new destinations had measurable characteristics that are generally associated with better access and higher quality of care.</p>
<p>Naturally, new destinations are also likely to differ from traditional destinations on unmeasured characteristics that may be associated with worse access and lower quality for Hispanics in particular. For instance, the supply of Hispanic or Spanish-speaking physicians and other culturally competent providers may be more limited in new destinations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1077558712457242">Casey, 2004</xref>). There may be a less welcoming and potentially more hostile climate toward immigrants in new destinations, including more pronounced levels of discrimination and, consequently, lower levels of trust in health care providers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1077558712457242">Cristancho, Garces, Peters, &amp; Mueller, 2008</xref>). Finally, social service and supportive social networks and community organizations that serve Hispanics and immigrants may be less well developed in new destinations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1077558712457242">Harari, Davis, &amp; Heisler, 2008</xref>). Because data on these characteristics were not available for our study, however, we are unable to determine whether they matter.</p>
<p>The finding that U.S.-born Mexican Americans report higher rates of unmet need for care and lower satisfaction with care in new compared with traditional destinations, whether or not we adjust for measured contextual factors, merits comment. An intriguing possibility is that many U.S.-born Mexican Americans continue to depend on social networks and Hispanic physicians to access health care, and these are likely to be in shorter supply in new destinations. At the same time, U.S.-born Mexican Americans may be unable to take advantage of any social service and community organizations that focus on assisting immigrants.</p>
<p>Our study has several limitations. First, there may be unmeasured individual characteristics that are correlated with both a person’s propensity to move to a new destination and to use health care. The main example of such a factor is health status, since better health may be associated with ability and willingness to move to a new destination as well as with lower utilization. Fortunately, the comprehensive health status measures in MEPS help limit the potential for bias from self-selection due to unmeasured differences in health status.</p>
<p>Second, because our analyses focus only on metro areas, our findings are not generalizable to rural areas in new destination states, where many Hispanics have settled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1077558712457242">Kandel &amp; Cromartie, 2004</xref>). However, the overwhelming majority of Hispanics in the United States live in metro areas.</p>
<p>Third, our assessment of quality of care was limited to satisfaction measures, because MEPS data are insufficient for studying differences in care processes or intermediate health outcomes among our subpopulations of interest. In a related vein, we could not assess whether the differences in care between new and traditional destinations that we found affected health status.</p>
<p>Finally, our definition of new destinations included metro areas where as many as 20% of the population was Hispanic in 1990, which may seem high for a “new” destination. We chose this definition because we needed sufficient sample sizes of U.S.-born Mexican Americans and Mexican immigrants in new destinations to conduct the analyses. Nonetheless, we conducted sensitivity analyses where we required new destinations to have less than 7.5% Hispanics in 1990, and these models confirmed key findings.</p>
<p>Large numbers of immigrants from Latin America have settled in areas of the country that have little history or experience with such influxes, and many U.S.-born Hispanics have moved to these areas as well. The changes in migration patterns and the resulting emergence of large communities of Hispanics in new destinations pose challenges not only for states and municipalities and their health care delivery systems but also for the migrants themselves, particularly with regard to their ability to access care. Additional research to identify the characteristics of new destinations that influence Hispanics’ access to and satisfaction with care adversely, which would facilitate targeted policy interventions. Finally, we underscore that our data come from the period before the passage of anti-immigrant legislation in several states, including both new and traditional destinations. These laws may result in reduced access to care for Hispanics, both immigrant and U.S.-born, with potential negative consequences for their health.</p>
