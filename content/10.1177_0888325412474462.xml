<abstract>
<p>What is specific in the efforts of the Slovenian state institutions to handle the current economic, political, and cultural crisis in the country? The answer is searched for in the media representations of the building of a new government in February 2012. The analysis is focused on five major functions of modern states: security provision, regulation of macro-economy, administration, reproduction of human resources, and environmental protection. The source of primary information for the analysis and argumentation is the daily newspaper <italic>Delo</italic> (Labor). Relevant publications in the newspaper were differentiated by applying two criteria: first, predominant reference to one of the five functions of the state; second, if the article contains no alternative (1) or presents a strong alternative to a given situation, event or opinion related to the state functions (5) on a 5-point scale. The analysis identifies a large share of publications focusing on the administrative function of the state and rather limited share of publications on security issues and environmental protection. The analyzed publications contain only modest efforts to present and discuss alternatives to political situations and opinions. The hypothesis about alleged colonization of politics by mass media is falsified.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>A team was commissioned by the United Nations to put a diagnosis on the global social situation in 2011. The authors could not find a more precise title for their report than “The Global Social Crisis.” The major dimensions of the crisis were outlined: economic recession, rise of unemployment, impoverishment, and food shortages. The necessary responses to the crisis situation were divided into measures taken (to be taken) by international organizations and measures taken (to be taken) by states for the management of the situation. Specific dimensions of the second option<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0888325412474462">1</xref></sup> will be discussed further in detail.</p>
<p>Currently, the stress on the capacities of states to manage local manifestations of global processes does not surprise. However, during the 1990s slogans requiring the full retreat of states from the economy or from other action spheres were typical expressions of the then-predominant neo-liberal ideology. The major argument referred to the progressing globalization. It was supposed to make the market arrangements the perfect solution for all economic, political, and cultural problems at the global, regional, and local level of social structures and processes.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0888325412474462">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>Slogans claiming fast decrease of the relevance of states provoked many questions and debates already before the global financial, economic, and social crisis that started in 2008. Reality obviously deviated from the neo-liberal claims since states were most often active and efficient managers of manifold problems on the territories of their sovereignty and in international relations.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0888325412474462">3</xref></sup> However, the failure of major international organizations and associations (United Nations, WTO, World Bank, International Monetary Fund, G8, G20) to reach efficient coordination of their efforts to manage the first wave of the global financial and economic crisis changed the situation. The crisis came as a surprise and immediately revealed the regional and global relevance of national egoisms and the primacy of national interests in crisis management. The signal was unmistakably clear and made the raising of strategic questions a matter of necessity: Did we witness a return of the state as crucially relevant crisis manager? Was exactly the return of the state the core of the recent efforts to upgrade the efficiency of crisis management?<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0888325412474462">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>The global, regional, and local experience proved the above questions to be highly topical and inadequate at the same time. Now it is common knowledge that the potential of powerful global (IMF, G-20) and regional actors (EU, ASEAN) for crisis management should not be underestimated at all. Simultaneously, it also became clear that states are really rather important crisis managers and will remain so for long. Without the radical intervention of the U.S. federal state into the economy by practically nationalizing major immobility companies, without the state-dictated devaluation of the British pound, or without the decisive intervention of the German government in support of the German car makers, the impacts of the global financial and economic crisis on these national economies would be much more devastating. Therefore, the key conceptual issue is not <italic>if</italic> the state relevance in managing crisis situations deserves attention but <italic>how to conceptualize</italic> the capacities of states for handling local, regional, and global crisis situations. Against this background, the return to traditional conceptions of the functions of states became very much needed in order to open the way for a systematic analysis of the present-day states as crisis managers.</p>
<p>An influential attempt to revitalize traditional concepts concerning the functions of states was undertaken already by experts of the World Bank in the <italic>World Development Report 1997</italic>. The <italic>Report</italic> summarized the experience from the turbulent events during the first half of the nineties. At that time, experts from the World Bank used to keep to radical neo-liberal “big-bang” and “fast retreat of the state from economy” strategies when advising decision makers in the rapidly changing Eastern European societies.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0888325412474462">5</xref></sup> However, the World Bank analysts soon came to the conclusion that exactly such experience underlines the need for return to the relevance of the state both in theory and practice. The message of the experts was clear: the traditional functions of states as crucially important crisis managers had not lost their relevance. But these functions had to be defined and implemented in full accordance with the new conditions of rapidly progressing globalization as well as with the changes in the conditions for crisis management in the states themselves. Taking into account the failures of neo-liberal ideology in the self-correcting powers of global markets, the experts announced the need to rethink and to really pay due attention to the new relevance of nation-states. The scientific and practical conclusions mostly referred to the functions of the state. With some reformulations, the discussions in the <italic>Report</italic> were focused on the following five major functions of modern states:<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0888325412474462">6</xref></sup></p>

</list>
<p>During the golden years of globalization at the beginning of the new millennium, the arguments and conclusions from the <italic>World Development Report 1997</italic> were largely neglected. The global financial and economic crisis made them rather topical and relevant in scientific and practical terms anew. However, the changing economic, political, and cultural circumstances urged to ask about the efficiency of states as crisis managers in more specific ways: How efficient are states in performing their major functions under different local conditions of crisis management?</p>
<p>The bulk of the following analysis and argumentation is focused on the local conditions and processes in Slovenia. After a series of political defeats of the then ruling center-left government, preliminary elections were announced in the country for 4 December 2011. The diagnosis of the situation of Slovenian society given in the electoral program of the right-wing Slovenian Democratic Party (SDS) was alarming: “Slovenia is in an economic, social and political crisis. Europe and the West are also in a crisis. The crisis in Slovenia is deeper.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0888325412474462">7</xref></sup> The statement is particularly relevant for further analysis and argumentation since the diagnosis was formulated by the party that later became the major partner in the coalition supposed to govern Slovenia till 2015. Given the alarming diagnosis, one could expect that most of the problems facing the country would require urgent interventions by the Slovenian state after the new government had been formed. Such interventions unavoidably have variants due to diverse options for action and to diverging interests of social groups represented by political parties. So, one could expect intensive debates about alternatives in crisis management by the state exactly during the period in which the aims, means, and potential effects of the policies of the new Slovenian government had been clarified, discussed, negotiated, and decided.</p>
<p>There is hardly any better way to possibly verify or falsify this assumption than to get into a detailed content analysis of the major mass media in the country. For this purpose, the publications in the major Slovenian daily <italic>Delo</italic> (Labor) in February 2012 were selected. The aims of the content analysis were threefold: first, to identify specifics of the local media representations of the above-defined five functions of the Slovenian state and the ways they are being performed; second, to identify specifics of the involvement of mass media in the local political process by offering public space for discussion of alternatives in decision making and practical action as this is usual in developed democracies;<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0888325412474462">8</xref></sup> third, to test in this way the assumption about the alleged colonization of politics by mass media.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0888325412474462">9</xref></sup> All three aims were operationalized on the basis of the assumption that the representations of political processes constructed and spread by mass media substantially influence political decision making in European societies.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0888325412474462">10</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0888325412474462">
<title>Conceptual Framework</title>
<p>The guiding theoretical idea of data collection and analysis is that three major types of actors are involved in the present-day politics in advanced European societies. Slovenia undoubtedly is one of them.</p>
<p>The first type of actors is represented by the group of <italic>increasingly professionalized politicians</italic>. Since the declaration of independence of Slovenia in 1991, the leading representatives of this group have step by step established and stabilized their positions in the new Slovenian political system. They rotate in the changing governments and in taking key functions in the state apparatus. Whatever the political orientation or organizational affiliation of the individuals belonging to this group, all of them are strongly motivated by the desire to gain and use political power. They draw the legitimacy of this desire from the aspiration that each of them as a person and particularly their political formations (basically political parties) have the best projects for governing Slovenian society, its action spheres, or at least some of its localities. The motivations, patterns of orientation, and behavior of the representatives of the group of professionalized politicians, their informal networks and formalized organizational affiliations, specific interests and behavioral patterns, mutual affinities and animosities, and coalitions and confrontations make out the <italic>party politics</italic> in Slovenia. The principles and practices of party politics in Slovenia do not basically differ from those in other democratic societies in Western Europe.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0888325412474462">11</xref></sup> However, there are also some similarities of Slovenian party politics with the achievements and problems of party politics in other Central and Eastern European countries as well.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0888325412474462">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>The persons belonging to the group of professionalized Slovenian politicians are well aware of the multiple influences of a large range of domestic and international factors that facilitate or hinder the materialization of their desire to gain and use political power. Among these numerous factors, two are related to the existential dependence of politicians and political parties on the opinion and action of other domestic groups. They are rather different. The first one is the group of <italic>mass media communicators.</italic> The group is small in numbers but well institutionalized and rather influential in present-day information societies. In this group, the journalists specialized as political commentators—or mass media communicators specialized in politics—have the capacity to substantially influence public opinion on political matters.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0888325412474462">13</xref></sup> The outcome of their professional activities is the development of a new kind of politics that has the capacity to complement, correct, or orient traditional party politics. This modern pattern of coordination and mutual influencing of politics and mass media is conditionally called <italic>media politics</italic><sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0888325412474462">14</xref></sup> because of the substantial role of mass media in its formation and implementation.</p>
<p>In reality, party politics and media politics are closely connected and they influence each other to the extent that there is no clear dividing line between them. Politicians need mass media in order to attract and guide the political support of voters by using the channels of mass media. The neglect of mass media by politicians or political formations usually has dramatic consequences for their presence in the political landscape. On their part, mass media need politicians as communicators attracting the attention of the voters. In the commercialized media landscape, the attention of the voters—or lack of it—to specific media channels or specific types and topics of media communication has financial implications for the media. Thus, the mutual interest and mutual dependence of politicians and the representatives of mass media are well based on rational calculations concerning their common interests in all dimensions of economic well-being, political influence, and professional prestige.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0888325412474462">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>The mutual interest of politicians and mass media communicators in media politics has its deep roots in the dependence of both groups on the voting constituencies and—which is the same in practical terms—on the audience of the mass media. The voting constituency/mass media audience has the real power in democratic information societies to elevate politicians or political groupings to the top of political life as well as to doom individual politicians or political groupings to oblivion. The voting constituency/mass media audience might give bonuses to specific media or media channels or to ruin mass media institutions. As seen from the opposite point of view, the voting constituency is captive of the adequate or inadequate decisions of governing politicians in present-day representative democracies. Being the audience of the powerful mass media, the same voting constituency is captive of mass media’s tremendous capacities to inform, misinform, and manipulate. Most people representing the voting constituency/mass media audience are aware of this double captivity and react with varieties of trust and mistrust, and approval and disapproval, to politicians and mass media. But the millions of people making up the voting constituency and mass media audience in democratic societies are also realistic enough to know that they cannot abolish the power of politicians and the “fourth power” of mass media. It is a widely shared view that modern democracies need both party politics and media politics for their efficient functioning.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0888325412474462">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>This triple mutual dependency of voting constituency/mass media audience, politicians, and mass media can be schematically presented as follows by taking the present-day Slovenian society as an example (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0888325412474462">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>Until the independence of the country in 1991, the Slovenian political system was dominated by state/party politics in socialist Yugoslavia. Slovenian mass media were basically expected to propagate the strategy and tactics of the ruling party. It was merged with the then Yugoslavian state institutions and did not have legally recognized opposition. The development of a pluralist party system after independence came about in parallel with the establishment of constitutionally independent and step-by-step-privatized mass media. In the area of print media, the privatization is practically completed. Therefore, the print media system is increasingly expected to take its own stance in defining achievements and problems of Slovenian society and in orienting actions for handling the challenges facing the country. Moreover, because of the advances in communication technology, Slovenian politicians are now pressed by the circumstances to actively cooperate with the mass media. Without this cooperation, politicians could not efficiently reach with messages their voting constituency that is a major part of the mass media audience.</p>
<p>The Slovenian mass media are also pressed by the technological and political circumstances and by the impact of market relations to actively search the cooperation with politicians. The reason is simple: the mass media audience is existentially interested in the ideas and actions of politicians. Thus, the new political and cultural situation in Slovenia is practically very much influenced by the cooperation of political actors and mass media. Their symbiotic interpretation of the challenges facing the national society is their response to the needs and desires of the voting constituency to be oriented in political matters. This is the major moving force of both party and media politics in post-socialist Slovenia.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0888325412474462">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>The fundamental question that arises in this context concerns the real autonomy and the real political relevance of Slovenian mass media. Being legally independent and in some areas also privatized (the print media), do mass media really manage to develop and present their <italic>autonomous perception and interpretation</italic> of the challenges facing Slovenian society? Do mass media adequately perceive the needs and desires of their audience in the country? What is the extent to which Slovenian mass media are able to develop and propagate <italic>their own</italic> alternative interpretations and suggestions for resolving the problems currently facing Slovenian society? In order to tentatively answer the complex and complicated questions, an exploratory study was designed and implemented.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0888325412474462" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methodology</title>
<p>During the period of building a new government, strategic issues concerning the development of Slovenian society, its action spheres, and social groups come to the fore of public debate in all their complexities. After the building of the government, the “business as usual” of governmental politics is no more primarily focused on political strategies but more on political tactics as a rule. This is the reason why the case study was carried out exactly and only in February 2012. During this month, the new government of the center-right coalition was formed in the contexts of very intensive political debates and negotiations following the preliminary elections held on 4 December 2011.</p>
<p>The daily <italic>Delo</italic> was selected as the source of primary information for analysis and interpretation because it is the most analytic and—in relative terms—politically balanced independent private newspaper in Slovenia at present. All publications in the February 2012 issues of the newspaper were analyzed from the point of view of their thematic content and the messages they convey. In operational terms, the guiding questions of the analysis of each publication were the following: First, does the publication explicitly refer to any of the above differentiated functions of the modern state? Second, if the answer was basically positive, to which of the five functions the publication referred most? Third, did the thematically relevant publication just describe situations, problems, events, and opinions of public figures or did the publication also discuss and convey some alternative views? Fourth, if the publication contained an attempt to present any alternative, how strong was the attempt to present alternatives to views in party politics concerning state functions?</p>
<p>The collected primary information was typified according to the operationalized concepts of five major functions of the modern democratic states:</p>

<list-item><p>developing cultural and educational initiatives for environmental protection.</p></list-item>
</list>
</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The registration of the primary information was organized along a scale taking into account both the purely informative function of mass media as well as its relative autonomy to develop, present, and discuss alternative views. The scale had five points starting with 1 (the publication item contains only description of situation, event, opinion of public figures, or statements of organizations without any alternative interpretations or suggestions concerning functions of the state in the published item) to 5 (strong alternative interpretations and suggestions in the published item). The points 2, 3, and 4 referred to intermediary stages of the intensity of alternative interpretations and suggestions concerning functions of the state. The authors of alternative interpretations or suggestions could be journalists, invited specialists, politicians from both the ruling groups and the opposition, anonymous participants in public opinion polls, etc. The crucial point in the selection and interpretation was the fact of deviation of the content of the item from the simple description and neutral information about situations, events, and opinions.</p>
<p>Following the above-outlined methodological strategy, the analysis and interpretation of publications in the February 2012 issues of the Slovenian newspaper <italic>Delo</italic> stressed the criterion of <italic>direct</italic> concern of a published item with one of the five functions of the state in various specific situations. The focus on the direct relation to these functions is crucially important since all situations and events in present-day Slovenia—like in all modern societies—are related to state institutions and their functioning in one way or another. For instance, cultural life and sport are heavily supported by the Slovenian state. But the numerous publications on the pages specially dedicated to culture and sport of <italic>Delo</italic> were only taken into account in cases of explicit presentation and discussion of relationships between state institutions and institutions, events, or personalities relevant for the action spheres of culture and sport.</p>
<p>As seen from the point of view of the traditional differentiation and even opposition of quantitative and qualitative methods in the study of mass media, the suggested methodological approach is of a hybrid type by intention. Measurements serve the qualitative analysis and interpretations while the qualitative analysis and interpretations make the meaningful quantifications possible indeed.</p>
<p>No supplements to <italic>Delo</italic> were taken into account.</p>

<sec id="section4-0888325412474462">
<title>Empirical findings</title>
<p>By applying the elaborated criteria of selection, 274 published items were identified that explicitly and directly presented and discussed situations, events, persons, or processes related to the five functions of the Slovenian state. At first glance, it is striking to notice how unevenly these functions have been covered by publications in <italic>Delo</italic> during the times of the building and the first activities of the new Slovenian center-right government. Nearly half (47 percent) of the relevant publications covered only or exclusively the administrative function of the Slovenian state. On the opposite side, the state functions of providing domestic and international security and environmental protection were only covered each by 6 percent of the publications (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0888325412474462">Figure 2</xref>).</p>
<fig id="fig2-0888325412474462" position="float">

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0888325412474462-fig2.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>Taken closely under scrutiny, the uneven distribution of media items covering the functions of the Slovenian state is quite logical. Following Thomas Hobbes’s narrative, the Leviathan state had been first introduced by people’s decision to protect their lives, property, and dignity. Neither lives nor property or human dignity are endangered in Slovenia at present. Both international and domestic security is currently seen as unquestionable in Slovenian society. Therefore, it is understandable why the topics related to the provision of security by the Slovenian state are not high on the political agenda and consequently in the representations of mass media. However, it is taken for granted that both the security politics and its coverage by the mass media would change under changing domestic or international circumstances.</p>
<p>The same applies to the function of environmental protection by the Slovenian state. From time to time there are critical voices and debates focusing on the efficiency of this protection. But it is nearly agreed in the country that there are no current or immediately looming existential environmental risks facing Slovenian society. Consequently, the <italic>frequency</italic> of reporting and debates on these issues on the pages of <italic>Delo</italic> in February 2012 was pretty low. Undoubtedly, an environmental catastrophe of whatever kind would immediately change the frequency of media’s coverage of environmental issues and policies of environmental protection.</p>
<p>Quite in contrast to the modest quantitative coverage of security and environmental issues, the administrative management of political structures and processes was in the very center of numerous debates. Should the Ministry of Culture continue to exist autonomously since culture is widely regarded in Slovenia as the historical backbone of the nation and of its recently acquired statehood? Or, given the need to rationalize state administration and public expenditures, should the Ministry of Culture join the newly established super-Ministry of Education, Science, Culture, and Sport? Should the office of attorney general remain with the Ministry of Justice or, following some arguments in favor of administrative rationalization, should the office be put under the umbrella of the Ministry of Interior? Where is the most efficient placing of economic diplomacy—with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs or with the Ministry of Economy?</p>
<p>Questions of this kind always accompany the establishment of new governments and the reorganization of governments. The related debates do not concern organizational structures and efficiency alone. Impacts of interest groups and positions of functionaries are subject to discussions as well. This makes the administrative reshuffling of state structures particularly relevant for politicians, administrators, and their personal networks. Correspondingly, the institutional reshufflings provoke intensive public interest. <italic>Delo</italic> adequately responded to this public interest by offering its readership a large number and often quite sizable articles and other materials on related topics.</p>
<p>Still another reason for the intensive coverage of the administrative function of the Slovenian state is connected to the broad relevance of the administration of fiscal policies and budget expenditures. Exactly during the period of economic crisis, the public was very much interested in the ways in which the disequilibrium of the Slovenian state budget could or should be handled. Which groups are going to pay most in terms of taxes and how this should be practically achieved? Which groups are going to take advantage or will be disadvantaged by the upcoming budget cuts and exactly by what administrative measures? The public interest in these key issues of the state administration is genuine. Each mass media system has to respond to this public interest adequately. If this does not happen, the audience would turn its preferences to the competitors in the media landscape.</p>
<p>Last but not least, some reasons for the intensive debates on administration issues concern the policies of state investments for maintenance and modernization of public infrastructure. Practically everybody in the country is interested in these issues in one way or another.</p>
<p>Thus, there were clearly identifiable strategic and situational reasons for the rather uneven coverage of specific functions of the Slovenian state in <italic>Delo</italic> during the case study. The interpretation of the findings about the intensity of alternatives discussed in the context of each state function is much more difficult and leaves many questions open. For instance, the media coverage of issues of domestic and international security of the Slovenian state is marked by a rather uneven distribution of data along the 5-point scale. Uncommented descriptions of events, persons, and proposals without mentioning any alternative widely predominate in the reporting on these issues. Critical comments about what has happened and particularly comments presenting some kind of alternative interpretation or suggestion for alternative scenarios of what might happen are extreme rarities in the media coverage of this function of the state (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0888325412474462">Figure 3</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>The case is exactly opposite that of the media coverage of issues related to the function of environmental protection by the Slovenian state. The share of publications covering these issues was modest but the discussions of alternative suggestions, decisions, and actions concerning environmental protection were quite intensive as compared to the discussions on security issues. The explanation of the difference is relatively simple. The achievements of the young Slovenian state in providing domestic and international security to the nation are widely recognized. But the current debates on the environmental sustainability of electrical power production in the country reveal, for instance, uncertainties and offer opportunities for intensive criticisms and suggestions of alternatives. It is also a common knowledge in the country that the issue of the efficient treatment of industrial and household wastes has still not been satisfactorily resolved. Alternative visions on this issue are regarded as normality.</p>
<p>It is somewhat surprising to notice that the media coverage of problems, decisions, and actions related to the governmental function of taking care of the reproduction of human resources lacks publications containing strong alternatives. This function of the state is the closest to the everyday needs, desires, and experiences of Slovenian people. The explanation of the phenomenon could be twofold. First, governmental interpretations, decisions, and actions related to problems of the reproduction of human resources of Slovenian society basically meet the needs and expectations of the population. Second, mass media (<italic>Delo</italic>) are not particularly sensitive to alternative interpretations, decisions, and actions in the areas of reproduction of human resources. Both hypothetic explanations seem to be unrealistic but their proof would require a more detailed longitudinal study.</p>
<p>It is intriguing to interpret the statistical pattern of the publications on the administrative functions of the state. The publications are evenly distributed along the values of the 5-point scale. This might be due to the relatively large number of publications on these issues since sets containing large numbers tend to produce more equalized distributions. However, the equalization might be also the effect of a trend towards a well-balanced reflection of mass media on the issues under scrutiny. Both hypotheses would require testing in future studies too. Additional studies are also needed for a meaningful explanation of the deviation of the value for the fourth position of the scale covering the macro-economic regulatory function of the state. Most probably, the phenomenon is due to the short period of observation and the relatively small number of publications dealing with this function of the state.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The high concentration of published items related to the administrative functions of the Slovenian state is a phenomenon that is not due to a specific situation alone. It is indicative of a trend in both politics in Slovenia in general and media politics in the country in particular. The trend is towards interpretation of politics as administration first of all.</p>
<p>Any attempt to explain the predominant interpretation of politics as administration by referring to the history of Slovenian society would certainly fail. The modern history of the small Slovenian nation is not particularly marked by national unity. This became dramatically obvious in the ideological, political, and military divisions and confrontations during the Second World War and in its aftermaths.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0888325412474462">18</xref></sup> These historical memories still divide the Slovenian nation. However, how relevant are these historical divisions for present-day politics in Slovenia? If taken all together, the analyzed publications in <italic>Delo</italic> do not provide any hint about influential political formations and political programs representing extreme left or extreme right positions. No politically relevant slogans for nationalization of productive private property or for total privatization of state-owned assets could be detected in the publications. There were no identifiable leftist or rightist political programs for economic, political, and ideological centralization or for any kind of radical liberal or anarchist decentralization. To the contrary, the registered basic statements of all relevant political forces are strikingly similar. The identifiable differences concerning current politics are predominantly of a tactical nature. This might lead to the conclusion that the well-known programmatic differences concerning the events during the Second World War and thereafter remain basically without any important practical consequences for the current everyday politics. This is the political mood at the moment. Domestic or international events could change the situation overnight.</p>
<p>Another well-known and clearly identifiable dividing line still concerns traditional political attitudes towards the Catholic Church. But taking the publications in <italic>Delo</italic> as indicative of the cultural situation at present, this dividing line between traditionalists and progressive-minded has hardly any consequences for the present-day practical politics in the largely secularized Slovenian society as well. Once more, changes in the ideological and political situation in the country might invigorate the historical controversies concerning the role of the Catholic Church in Slovenian society once more.</p>
<p>A large interview given to <italic>Delo</italic> by Zoran Janković who is leader of the “Positive Slovenia” electoral platform clearly exemplifies the blurred division between left and right in present-day Slovenian politics. Janković’s electoral platform attracted the largest share of votes at the general elections held on 4 December 2011. He received the mandate to build a coalition government. Since Janković used to present his electoral platform as leftist, the coalition government was expected to have center-left political orientation. However, his attempt at building government failed. Instead, a center-right governmental coalition was successfully built. In the interview, Janković explains why his—supposedly leftist—parliamentary fraction has not voted in support of the new center-right governmental coalition: “If the office of attorney general would have been returned back to the Ministry of Justice and the Ministry of Culture would be preserved, I would support the government.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0888325412474462">19</xref></sup> This is a telling example for the most often rhetoric or only tactical division between the political left and political right in present-day Slovenian politics. In this respect, Slovenia undoubtedly shares some basic features of domestic politics with most post-socialist countries.</p>
<p>As for international politics, despite the political rhetoric, one may also find it difficult to identify any relevant differences in the practical strategy and tactics of the political parties in Slovenia. The geopolitical situation of the country is clearly defined. Given this strategic clarity concerning geopolitics, all political forces in the country represent only one ideology in international politics. This ideology refers to the national interests. They dictate the efforts to balance and mediate between the European East and West, to firmly keep to the strategic alliances with the West, and do the best to improve the economic and political relations with the BRICS countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa), etc. The political continuity of Slovenian governments concerning the construction of the South Stream gas pipeline is a perfect example of such well-balanced international policies focused primarily on the national interest.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0888325412474462">20</xref></sup> The isolated identifiable differences concerning foreign policy are of a tactical nature although they are being overstressed from time to time in political debates. In his inauguration speech, the new minister of foreign affairs in the center-right government Karl Jerjavec mostly had the task to underline the continuity with the international politics of the previous center-left government.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is understandable why present-day Slovenian politics is in its core understood and practiced not as an area for testing of alternative political visions but as state administration. Certainly, politics in the country also includes clashes of interest groups. But these clashes are very rarely related to strategically different interests in domestic and international politics. They are mostly clashes between well-differentiated but also fluctuating clientelist networks.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0888325412474462">21</xref></sup> This makes the building of governments on the basis of large coalitions unavoidable. As a result, the governments are and will probably remain unstable in the future.</p>
<p>The situation of media is not simple in this context.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0888325412474462">22</xref></sup> Media cannot invent strategic political alternatives if they are not widely spread in society, articulated in the programs of political parties, and identifiable in their politics. That is why strong political alternatives made public by the media or presenting the standpoint of journalists are rarities in Slovenia. The majority of politically focused publications in <italic>Delo</italic> either uncritically describes situations and events or neutrally reproduces positions of politicians and political parties. The autonomous politically relevant opinions of journalists or other specialists published in <italic>Delo</italic> only as exceptions represent strategic political alternatives. Typically, they contain information about the administrative handling of the issues. This type of the media coverage of Slovenian politics is definitely not the result of isolated personal choices but of the self-imposed professional constraints of the widely and loudly praised modern type of reporting. It is described by the journalists themselves in a rather critical way: “not of the entirety, interesting and relevant, but some kind of balanced reporting, whatever this evasive and ideologically manipulative expression might mean.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0888325412474462">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>Given this diagnosis of the status of media in present-day Slovenian politics, do the Slovenian media really deserve the metaphoric description as the fourth power? Could the current political scene in Slovenia be described as shaped by two types of politics, namely, party politics <italic>and</italic> media politics? Can one have good reasons to talk about colonization of Slovenian politics by mass media? The adequate answers cannot be of one color alone. But they are certainly closer to the negative than to the positive assessment. Mass media in Slovenia as exemplified by <italic>Delo</italic> during the period under scrutiny are still predominantly guided by party politics. Only peripherally can the media play an autonomous role in shaping politics.</p>
<p>One may have an understanding why this is the case. The crucial reason is not the lack of freedom of expression or the blatant lack of professionalism on the part of journalists. Freedom of mass media in Slovenia is undeniable. The professionalism of journalism in the country—some exceptions notwithstanding—is basically satisfactory. However, the very strong concentration of Slovenian politics in the programmatic and practical center makes the search for and representation of alternative ideas by mass media rather difficult tasks. This situation of political programs and media coverage of politics might be interpreted as a sign for a high level of cultural and political integration of Slovenian society and for the lack of potentially centrifugal cultural and political forces in it. This interpretation would go too far given the historical heritage of the nation and the normal clash of interests in the everyday struggle for economic, political, or cultural dominance in society. Another interpretation might take the identified deficit of debates on strategic alternatives as indicative of problems with the development of innovative ideas and their testing and implementation in Slovenian society.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The results of the exploratory study presented in the paper cannot serve as a basis for generalizations. However, the analysis provokes a series of serious questions concerning the content and style of Slovenian politics and the role of mass media in this specific political context. These questions should guide longitudinal studies. It would be very desirable that the presented case study on the media reflection of the building and first steps of the new government in Slovenia would be repeated regularly. The longitudinal study will most probably document the development of more influential media politics in the country not as an alternative to the party politics but as its complement.</p>
