        <p>In a critique of Conversation Analysis’ treatment of context, Waring, Creider, Tarpey and
          Black invite us to see that, when understanding some stretch of interaction, speakers’
          retrospective reports might be helpful. Two standard responses to Waring et al.’s argument
          are that 1) people’s personal accounts of contingent and fleeting moments of interaction
          are of a different order of event from the actions they produce in situ, and are matters
          of analysis in their own right; and that 2) CA does use context, insofar as any analyst
          works with scenes in a culturally familiar landscape, bolstered (sometimes) by
          ethnographic accounts for help with local terminology or institutional agendas.</p>

  <body>
    <p>Conversation Analysis (CA) is wary of ‘context’ for two reasons – because it is boundless,
      and so too easy a recourse for just any interpretation; and, more positively, because CA is
      committed to analyse what the people in the scene make visible to each other – that, after
      all, is how social life is lived out. Controversies continue, but for those who practise CA
      themselves, the matter seems largely settled. Heritage’s memorable formulation that it is a
      speaker’s communicative action that is ‘both context-shaping and context-renewing’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1461445611433959">Heritage, 1984</xref>: 242) has passed into CA
      folk wisdom: conversation analysts are happy to use the word ‘context’ in the sense of things
      visible to the analyst or made live by the people in the scene themselves. Otherwise, not.</p>
    <p>Nevertheless the notion that invisible ‘context’ <italic>must</italic> be important is so
      embedded in the social sciences (and what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1461445611433959">Silverman, 1993 [2001]</xref>) memorably calls the ‘romantic’ end of qualitative analysis)
      that it insists on rematerializing into the debate. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1461445611433959">Waring et al. (2012)</xref> have re-issued the challenge.
      Sympathetic to CA, they nevertheless find its evidential base wanting, and enter a plea for
      taking as context people’s retrospective accounts of what they were up to. The authors
      helpfully bolster their theoretical claims with four empirical examples of analysis of given
      episodes, allowing us to see the value that the participants’ retrospections add.</p>
    <p>In what follows I shall rehearse two standard objections: that Waring et al. are too trusting
      of people’s retrospective accounts of what happened, and that there is in any case a profound
      difference between individuals’ undemonstrated inner feelings, hopes and intentions, even when
      accurately recalled, and the visible ‘participants’ concerns’ which are available for public
      consumption; and, furthermore, CA does indeed already use informants’ testimony, but as a
      matter of ethnographic scene-setting where necessary, or as a way of applying CA findings to
      vernacular interests. None of these objections is new, so the reader will be taken in this
      article only on a tour over some familiar ground.</p>
    <sec id="section1-1461445611433959">
      <title>1. Retrospective reports: Useful and less useful things people might tell you</title>
      <p>Waring et al. want to find ‘context’ in what they call ‘properties of immediate
        interactional situations’. Curiously, these turn out to be not strictly speaking properties
        of the immediate situation at all, but what comes out in people’s later commentary on it,
        well after the ‘immediate situation’ has evaporated. So the properties of the immediate
        situation – a promising sense of context – turn out to be people’s memories of what they did
        some time ago.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1461445611433959">1</xref></sup></p>
      <p>Such memories are well known to be unsatisfactory sources of evidence, for a number of
            reasons.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1461445611433959">2</xref></sup> At least
        three substantial ones have been extensively aired in the literature, and will come readily
        to the reader’s mind: people just aren’t very good at remembering things in general, let
        alone fleeting states of mind; they rely on general theories about why a given thing is
        done; and they may have reason consciously or unconsciously to polish, confabulate or
        dissemble about the thing that happened on a specific occasion. Waring et al. mention none
        of these problems.</p>
      <p>Asking people for their memories and interpretations of what was happening in a scene
        would, to the sceptical reader, seem to be the sorts of questions which at best yielded
        answers on how the speaker, in the here and now, glosses, summarizes, represents and
        interprets some parts of what might or might not have happened, seen from their own point of
        view and attending to their own interests. Such a question–answer exchange is, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1461445611433959">Edwards and Potter (1992</xref>, esp. Chapter
        4) observed 20 years ago, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1461445611433959">Heritage
          (1984</xref>, esp. Chapter 6) nearly 30 years ago, and Garfinkel immemorially, not so much
        an analytic aid, but rather the subject for <italic>more</italic> analysis in its own
        right.</p>
      <p>Could a proper ethnographic interview help? Yes, certainly, and it does. There is a
        legitimate and familiar ethnographer’s argument in favour of using informants – not to
        recall intentions and so on, but to explain terms and usages known only to members of a
        particular clique or sub-culture. Such recognizably ‘proper’ ethnographic interviews are
        occasionally done by Conversation Analysts, especially when they engage with specialized
        groups or professions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1461445611433959">3</xref></sup>
        Waring et al. themselves acknowledge the work of Anita Pomerantz in her and her colleagues’
        analysis of medical interactions, but they don’t acknowledge that this is primarily a matter
        of getting practitioners to explicate what is going on institutionally, not personally.</p>
      <p>In her 2005 chapter, Pomerantz very carefully lays out the pros and cons of participants’
        video-led commentaries. She wants inside information on the institutional problems that
        medical practitioners recurrently face. These problems might well be unknown or unsuspected
        by the analyst: for example, the need for the doctor to avoid saying something for which
        they might be sued later. Pomerantz (who we might take here to represent a broad stream of
        like-minded CA researchers) does CA to identify a practice (delicate broaching of a risky
        lifestyle choice, say) and explicate its workings (the use of pre-questions, hedges,
        perspective-display sequences and so on); and then, as a bonus, and as a matter of
        collaborating with people with different disciplinary commitments, she asks a doctor why
        this might be a good thing in the circumstances.</p>
      <p>The point to stress is that under her ethnographer’s hat, Pomerantz is asking about
        in-principle, <italic>institutional</italic> whys, that is, recurrent policy matters
        independent of personal contingency, and available to all members of the competent group.
        That means that she can take a doctor’s report to be valid and illuminating, without
        worrying about its <italic>personal</italic> relevance or accuracy. We learn something about
        what objectives doctors are working towards, what dangers lurk on either side, and why they
        set a course through them one way rather than another. The navigation itself, though, is
        there for us to analyse on tape and in the transcript.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="section2-1461445611433959">
      <title>2. Even supposing that speakers’ reports were accurate, what would they be accurate
        about?</title>
      <p>Waring et al. make a point of saying that CA doesn’t address ‘why’ questions. That’s not
        quite right, and not how <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1461445611433959">Silverman
          (1998)</xref> meant his reference to why questions to be understood. After all, Sacks’s
        question ‘why that <italic>now</italic>?’ is a familiar and much-invoked call to arms: an
        instruction to look carefully at what interactionally (and visibly) occasions a puzzling
        object. It generates plenty of CA answers to questions of the form ‘why is this action well-
        or ill-fitted here?’ or ‘what makes this utterance come across as performing such-and-such
        an action there?’, or indeed ‘what does it achieve interactionally to perform here an action
        of this sort?’. These are all questions whose answers will yield additions to the sum of
        generalizable knowledge about the workings of (anyone’s) interaction. On the other hand, it
        is true that CA concedes having nothing directly to say about ‘why does X invite Y to
        dinner?’ or ‘why does the teacher want pupil A and not pupil B to answer her question?’ and
        so on, where the answers, helpful as they might be to people with a stake in the real-life
        episode, will be in terms of ungeneralizable individual motivations and so unhelpful to the
        analyst looking for structures of action. Waring et al. want to claim that what their
        informants tell them will, by answering such questions, rectify a blind spot in CA. But
        there is no such blind spot. CA simply isn’t looking in that direction.</p>
      <p>Consider Waring et al.’s Example 1. Recall that it’s a sequence in which Judy offers Frank
        some advice about punctuation. ‘The CA analysis shows that throughout the sequence, both
        Judy and Frank orient to the event as one of advice giving and receiving’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1461445611433959">Waring et al., 2012</xref>: 482). Fair
        enough, and one could drill down to explicate how it comes across as doing it ‘gently’ (with
        a pre-question, a my-side telling, and so forth, all there in the transcript). Judy is asked
        to listen to the tape, and she says that she was worried about Frank’s lack of
            confidence.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1461445611433959">4</xref></sup> This
        means, according to Waring et al., that <disp-quote>
          <p>[w]e have a situation, therefore, where the participant’s concern is broadly inferable
            but not specifically displayed in the CA data and only comes to light in a subsequent
            interview. In this case, then, the talk-extrinsic data serve to specify what is broadly
            inferable from the initial CA analysis.</p>
        </disp-quote>
      </p>
      <p>Not at all. There may be a confusion over ‘concern’ here. What Waring et al. mean by Judy’s
        concern over Frank’s confidence (even supposing that this was indeed what she reported, and
        even supposing it’s a true account of what she felt four years ago) is not the same as what
        CA typically means by the term ‘participants’ concern’. For CA ‘participants’ concern’ just
        means what people seem to be up to, as they make evident to each other, and therefore
        available for study later. The closest we might come, in CA, is in the sense meant by
        Pomerantz in her use of video commentary. Pomerantz, as I noted above, is after
          <italic>institutional</italic> (public, knowable, constitutive of the institution itself)
        ‘concerns’, whereas Waring et al. are after <italic>personal</italic> concerns – worries,
        intentions, objectives and so on, knowable only to the individual themselves.</p>
      <p>What Waring et al. may claim is ‘broadly inferrable’ – in fact just simply ‘analysable’, or
        ‘identifiable’, with no ‘broadly’ about it – is Judy’s business of imparting advice in just
        the way she does. We don’t know her inner motivation, and don’t need to, to spot that it’s
        advice and to identify how she’s designing it. CA has no deficit to make up, no blind spot
        about Judy’s ‘real reasons’ – it just isn’t in the business of looking for them, unless, as
        the usual qualification goes, her motivation is made to matter by someone in the scene (and
        even then it’s not her <italic>actual</italic> motivation that CA has any handle on, but
        what is made of it by the participants).</p>
      <p>Take what Waring et al. promote as the still more revealing case of their Example 4. Recall
        that three people are talking about turning an adjective (here ‘American’) into a noun
        (‘Americanization’) or a gerund (‘Americanizing’). One speaker, Nina, makes a smile-voiced
        reference to ‘Californication’ in line 8 below.</p>
      <p>Extract copied from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1461445611433959">Waring et al.
          (2012)</xref>, p. 486</p>
      <graphic alt-version="no" id="img1-1461445611433959" position="anchor" xlink:href="10.1177_1461445611433959-img1.tif" xlink:type="simple"/>
      <p>Waring et al. ask Nina to comment on the tape. She reveals that when she said
        ‘Californication’ she meant it as a joke – she meant to refer to (what she thought was) a
        well-known song. According to Waring et al., that’s useful extra knowledge. But what Waring
        et al. claim for this revelation does not seem to me to pull much analytic weight. They want
        it to ‘correct’ CA’s reading of line 8 as playful, but no such correction is necessary –
        line 8’s playfulness is signalled by the smile voice, the inserted laughter particles and
        the hearably rude word. Whether Nina meant to refer to a song or to a film is unnecessary to
        tell the people in the scene that the reference is a jocular one (and it would be a jocular
        one even if there were in fact no referent at all – if Nina was simply making a new word
        up).</p>
      <p>Waring et al. also play the tape to T1 and ask for her account, and discover that T1
        recalls not having identified the song title. This is helpful, according to Waring et al.,
        because it corrects the CA reading of lines 9–12. T1 has repeated Nina’s word, but this time
        with a syntactic variant (‘-ization’ instead of Nina’s ‘-ation’). Analysis suggests that the
        turn is ambiguous: we can’t know whether T1 knowingly meant to move Nina away from the rude
        word, or simply didn’t register it as rude and was offering yet further playful variants.
        Waring et al. say that T1’s testimony now allows us to choose between those two – since T1
        now reveals that she didn’t recognize the song title at the time, so she must then have been
        just playing along. But again this seems an unnecessary step, indeed one that does damage to
        what happened <italic>at the time</italic>: in the scene as it played out, T1’s turn may
        well have been designed as, and come off as, ambiguous as to the two actions possibly in
        play. Certainly, it would have been so for Nina and anyone else present.</p>
      <p>And that captures exactly why retrospections about hidden knowledge, even if they might be
        accurate, are no help. What matters <italic>to the people in the scene</italic> is what they
        can see and, perforce, have to deal with.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="section3-1461445611433959">
      <title>Concluding comment</title>
      <p>Waring et al. make no play, in their argument, for a consideration of context in the sense
        of what they call its ‘broader social, political, and cultural situations’ (478). They cut
        themselves off from some strong arguments (for which they send the reader elsewhere) to the
        effect that a knowledge of pre-existing social structure, political situation and power
        relations must be made explicitly to inform the analysis of any given episode of social
        life. I don’t mean that such arguments would have won the day and reinstalled that sense of
        context as a necessary part of CA’s armoury; only that Waring et al. have ignored them, and
        so have some high-denomination cards missing from their hand. Or, more profitably, they
        might have invoked as context the kinds of bodily movements and physical affordances of the
        scene that are increasingly used in multi-modal CA (everything from dance movements, e.g.
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1461445611433959">Keevallik, 2010</xref>, through
        multi-site video links, e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1461445611433959">Licoppe and
          Dumoulin, 2010</xref>, to vehicle navigation instruments, e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1461445611433959">Haddington, 2010</xref>). The cards they do want to play –
        personal memory and interpretation – will strike at least some readers as ones with a lower
        and more uncertain value.</p>
      <p>Waring et al.’s project to reintroduce ‘context’ to CA by dint of remembered inner beliefs
        and motivations, revealed by later interview, is, I fear, not going to find favour. There is
        too uncertain a relation between reports and what happened, and in any case CA’s interests
        are in what is publicly transacted, not what is privately thought or felt. Nevertheless, the
        authors’ use of interviews does point us helpfully in the direction of applied CA work which
        collaborates with informants. It can certainly be worthwhile to make a bridge between how
        something is done in talk and what institutional interests it might serve; but that bridge
        needs to be laid on firmer ethnographic foundations than partial reports of what was going
        on in a vanished scene.</p>
