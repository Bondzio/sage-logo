<p>For long, Linda Putnam remained an enigmatic textual persona to me, a character in a play to which I was only a distant spectator. What struck me when I finally met her were the congruities and incongruities between the way I had imagined her to be and the way she came across in her office, in the classroom, in corridors, and at her home. Underneath her wealth of professional qualities, I discovered a mentor whose unremitting warmth, passion, care, and humanity were nothing short of inspirational. It is with great gratitude, therefore, that I reflect on the art of Linda’s mentoring here and its role in building <italic>Management Communication Quarterly</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0893318912451094">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Volumes have been written about the characteristics of a good mentor. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0893318912451094">Morris Zelditch (1990</xref>, quoted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0893318912451094">Powell &amp; Pivo, 2001</xref>) noted that mentors are
<disp-quote>
<p>advisors, people with career experience willing to share their knowledge; supporters, people who give emotional and moral encouragement; tutors, people who give specific feedback on one’s performance; masters, in the sense of employers to whom one is apprenticed; sponsors, sources of information about, and aid in obtaining opportunities; models of identity, of the kind of person one should be to be an academic. (p. 11)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>While this often-cited description is enlightening, I look at my mentee relationship with Linda like Tibetan Buddhists do. They refer to mentors as “teachers,” “masters,” or “gurus,” and have rather precise ideas about their qualities (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0893318912451094">Berzin, 2000/2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0893318912451094">Dorje, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0893318912451094">Mingyur, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0893318912451094">Trungpa, 1976/2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0893318912451094">1987</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0893318912451094">1991</xref>). “First of all,” Yongey Mingyur Rinpoche (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0893318912451094">2007</xref>, p. 247), a well-known Buddhist master, states, “the teacher must have been trained according to a lineage—otherwise, he or she may just be making up the rules or guidelines of practice out of his or her own pride, or perpetuating a misunderstanding of what he or she has read in books.” Hence, “When you work with a trained teacher in a lineage, you become part of the ‘family’ of that lineage. Just as you learned unspoken yet invaluable lessons from your birth family or the family in which you were raised, you will gain priceless lessons just through observing and interacting with a true lineage teacher” (p. 247). “In addition to having been trained in the disciplines of a particular lineage,” Mingyur Rinpoche goes on,
<disp-quote>
<p>a qualified teacher must also demonstrate compassion and, through his or her actions, subtly make clear his or her own realization without ever mentioning it. . . . Teachers who have had some experience never speak about their own accomplishments, but tend, instead, to speak about the qualities of their own teachers. And yet you can sense their own qualities through the aura of authority that envelops them, like the light reflecting from a nugget of gold. You don’t see the gold itself, but only the brilliance of golden light. (pp. 247-248)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Though I don’t want to suggest that Linda is a Buddhist guru, I believe she incarnates the above-mentioned qualities. Linda was a disciple of Ernest G. Bormann in the 1970s (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0893318912451094">Putnam, 2009a</xref>) and went on to change the course of organizational communication studies through her influential writings on the interpretive and critical/feminist turn, organizational conflict and negotiation, and, more recently, organizational discourse and the communicative constitution of organizations (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0893318912451094">Putnam &amp; Nicotera, 2010</xref>). As one of the field’s principal lineage holders, she ensures the continuation and advancement of our discipline by honing mentees’ knowledge of its history and academic skills. She instills in graduate students and junior faculty a scientific rigor that is vital to their careers and a work ethic that is grounded in conscientiousness and care for detail without losing the bigger picture of our field. Thus, many of the students she mentored have gone on to become prominent scholars themselves, such as Patrice Buzzannell and Angela Trethewey. What is more, Linda’s view of organizational communication studies is panoramic (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0893318912451094">Putnam, 2009b</xref>; see also the other essays in this forum). She brings awareness to the intersections between our discipline and management and organization studies or conflict and negotiation studies. In turn, Linda serves as a nexus for young scholars between areas of research that often cross countries. Her contributions to <italic>MCQ</italic> show how this venue has aided her in fulfilling this role. Examples are the forum on organizational communication in Brazil, which she edited with Adriana Machado Casali (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0893318912451094">Putnam &amp; Machado Casali, 2009</xref>), or some of her publications with junior scholars on questions related to organizational discourse (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0893318912451094">Putnam, Grant, Mickelson, &amp; Cutcher, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0893318912451094">Real &amp; Putnam, 2005</xref>). In addition, through her publications in the first volume of this journal (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0893318912451094">Knapp, Putnam, &amp; Davis, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0893318912451094">Putnam, 1988</xref>), she created a platform for starting academics aiming to study organizational conflict from a communicative point of view (e.g., see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0893318912451094">Burrell, Buzzanell, &amp; McMillan, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0893318912451094">Nicotera, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0893318912451094">Wilson &amp; Waltman, 1988</xref>).</p>
<p>Linda is also an extremely compassionate mentor. While I was her student, she always kept my interests in mind and tried to intuit what was important to me. Her kindness shone through particularly toward the end of my studies when my father, who was living in the Netherlands at that time, became very ill and eventually passed on. During this difficult time, she helped me stay on track and gave me the strength to carry on. It is for an important part due to her genuine care that I was able to finish my degree and obtain the faculty position I now hold. And since becoming a professor, she has remained a strong supporter of my career and is always just a phone call or e-mail away. What is perhaps most noteworthy about Linda, then, is that she is a scholar of great stature but never fails to express her concerns for the well-being of others, whether they are her students, university colleagues or staff, fellow scholars, or people outside of the academy.</p>
<p>As this forum illustrates, Linda’s impact on our discipline has been (and is) immense. Looking at the impressive body of research she has produced over the years, it becomes clear that our field would not be what it is today without her foundational work—and neither would <italic>MCQ</italic>. It is the sincere passion, dedication, and joy with which she does her work that continues to inspire me in my own research, teaching, and mentoring of students, as well as in my overall stance in life. Although I could catch glimpses of her brilliance when I first met her as a doctoral student, it is only in retrospect that Linda’s mentor qualities have become evident to me and that I can fully appreciate the value of her teachings and guidance. Like Mingyur Rinpoche wrote, it is as if the true brilliance of my teacher has revealed itself gradually or incrementally, and only now do I realize what blessing it is to be standing in her light.</p>
