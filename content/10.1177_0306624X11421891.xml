<abstract>
<p>It is widely believed that impairment in an ability to experience affective empathy for others is a central feature of psychopathy. The authors tested this assumption by covertly manipulating and measuring state experiences of emotional contagion and empathic concern in college undergraduates and male forensic inpatients. Surprisingly, they found little evidence of a negative association between psychopathy and affective empathy in either sample. In those instances in which associations were found, they tended to indicate that higher psychopathy was associated with <italic>increased</italic> affective empathy. Follow-up analyses also revealed that psychopathy was positively associated with pervasive experiences of sadness, anger, and fear, and negatively associated with pervasive experiences of happiness among nonforensic individuals. This research raises questions about existing conceptualizations of interpersonal affect in psychopathy and offers suggestions for advancing future understanding of the role-played by emotional processes in psychopathy.</p>

<p>Although psychopathy has no formal diagnostic entry in the most recent <italic>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0306624X11421891">American Psychiatric Association, 2000</xref>), it is a construct that has garnered much attention in clinical and forensic settings and is well established in experimental psychopathology. Most current conceptualizations of psychopathy view it as comprising an interpersonal-affective dimension that reflects an interpersonal style that is manipulative, grandiose, glib, and emotionally callous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0306624X11421891">Hare, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0306624X11421891">Hare &amp; Neumann, 2009</xref>). Many theorists, but not all (see, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0306624X11421891">Cooke &amp; Michie, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0306624X11421891">Cooke, Michie, &amp; Hart, 2006</xref>), also believe that psychopathy is characterized by an antisocial dimension that reflects tendencies to engage in rash and erratic aggressive, deviant, or criminal behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0306624X11421891">Hare, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0306624X11421891">Hare, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0306624X11421891">Vitacco, Neumann, &amp; Jackson, 2005</xref>). A significant amount of research portrays high-psychopathy individuals as exemplar antisocials—they hold little regard for social conventions, rules, or laws and lack both moral integrity and remorse in their dealings with others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0306624X11421891">Hare, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0306624X11421891">Neumann &amp; Hare, 2008</xref>).</p>

<title>Psychopathy and Empathy</title>
<p>Along with the aforementioned characteristics, the impaired capacity to experience empathy has been cast as one of the core defining features of psychopathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0306624X11421891">Blair, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0306624X11421891">Cleckley, 1941</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0306624X11421891">Dadds et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0306624X11421891">Soderstrom, 2003</xref>). Indeed, existing empirical work seems consistent with this proposition: Psychopathy is linked to lower physiological reactivity following observation of interpersonal distress (e.g., crying faces; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0306624X11421891">Blair, Jones, Clark, &amp; Smith, 1997</xref>), psychopathy is associated with difficulty in identifying discrete emotionality in others’ facial and vocal expressions (particularly expressions of fear and sadness; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0306624X11421891">Bagley, Abramowitz, &amp; Kosson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0306624X11421891">Blair et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0306624X11421891">Blair et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0306624X11421891">Del Gaizo &amp; Falkenbach, 2008</xref>), psychopathy is negatively associated with scores on various dispositional measures of empathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0306624X11421891">Mahmut, Homewood, &amp; Stevenson, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0306624X11421891">Sandoval, Hancock, Poythress, Edens, &amp; Lilienfeld, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0306624X11421891">Zagon &amp; Jackson, 1994</xref>), and psychopathy is positively associated with reports of positive valence in response to viewing sad images (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0306624X11421891">Ali, Amorim, &amp; Chamorro-Premuzic, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Although extant literature certainly appears consistent with the proposition that psychopathy is linked to an impaired capacity for empathy, it is important to evaluate these findings in light of current theoretical and empirical understanding of empathy phenomena. This is necessary given the term <italic>empathy</italic> has been used to label <italic>at least</italic> eight distinct, yet related, psychological states. The more common of these states found in the literature includes (a) accurately identifying what another person is thinking or feeling, (b) imagining what another person is thinking or feeling, (c) imagining how one would think or feel in the place of another, (d) aesthetically projecting oneself into the state of another person or object, (e) feeling the same thing as another, (f) feeling other-oriented concern for another, (g) feeling personally distressed by another’s negative situation, or (h) matching the behavioral posture of another (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0306624X11421891">Batson, 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0306624X11421891">2011</xref>). These states can be further categorized as <italic>cognitive empathy</italic> (a-d), <italic>affective empathy</italic> (e-g), or <italic>behavioral empathy</italic> (h; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0306624X11421891">Davis, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>Of these different forms of empathy, existing research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0306624X11421891">Bagley et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0306624X11421891">Blair et al., 2004</xref>) speaks most clearly to the link between psychopathy and the first type of cognitive empathy mentioned above (i.e., correct identification of emotional feeling in others). In contrast, the nature of the link between psychopathy and affective empathy is not clearly apparent from extant research. For example, both the association between psychopathy and lower physiological responding to negative emotional expressions and the association between psychopathy and higher ratings of positive valence in response to sad faces may reflect any number of affective empathy states described previously or none of them.</p>
<p>Research that reports negative associations between psychopathy and dispositional measures of empathy also prove limited due to the nature of dispositional empathy measures. Such measures rely on participants’ judgments of their own tendency to experience empathy across time and various situations. But such judgments may be inaccurate—they may not reflect a true tendency to respond empathically to others when placed in actual empathy-inducing contexts. Indeed, research by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0306624X11421891">Batson, Bolen, Cross, and Neuringer-Benefiel (1986)</xref> revealed that dispositional empathy measures do not necessarily (a) predict the intensity of genuine state empathy experiences following the experimental induction (manipulation) of state empathy or (b) predict the prosocial tendencies produced by such experimental inductions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0306624X11421891">Batson et al., 1986</xref>). Consequently, it is unclear whether the negative associations between psychopathy and dispositional measures of empathy would parallel the associations between psychopathy and measures of state empathy following experimental induction of empathy.</p>

<title>The Present Research</title>
<p>The present research sought to provide theoretical and empirical clarity to the possible link between psychopathy and an impaired capacity to experience affective empathy. To do this, we focused on two forms of affective empathy that have been emphasized in major theoretical and empirical work on empathy, yet have received little attention with regard to their relation to psychopathy: (a) feeling the same emotion as another and (b) feeling other-oriented concern for another (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0306624X11421891">Batson, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0306624X11421891">Davis, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0306624X11421891">Preston &amp; de Waal, 2002</xref>). The first, referred to by some as <italic>emotional contagion</italic>, is an affective experience that is evoked by and matches that of another (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0306624X11421891">Lishner, Cooter, &amp; Zald, 2008</xref>). Although many lower and higher order cognitive processes likely contribute to emotional contagion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0306624X11421891">Hoffman, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0306624X11421891">Lishner, Cooter, et al., 2008</xref>), perception of the actual or imagined emotional expressive behavior of others appears to be a primary antecedent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0306624X11421891">Hatfield, Cacioppo, &amp; Rapson, 1993</xref>).</p>
<p>The second form of affective empathy we examined is <italic>empathic concern</italic>, a specific affective experience best captured by terms such as “compassion,” “tenderness,” “sympathy,” and the like that one experiences <italic>for</italic> another (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0306624X11421891">Batson, 2011</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0306624X11421891">Davis, 1996</xref>). Empathic concern is evoked by perceiving need in others for whom no existing antipathy exists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0306624X11421891">Batson, Eklund, Chermok, Hoyt, &amp; Ortiz, 2007</xref>). Perception of vulnerable individuals or those with child-like characteristics appear to evoke empathic concern readily as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0306624X11421891">Batson, Lishner, Cook, &amp; Sawyer, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0306624X11421891">Lishner, Oceja, Stocks, &amp; Zaspel, 2008</xref>). Although empathic concern may co-occur with emotional contagion, it is different in that the person for whom empathic concern is experienced is unlikely to be feeling it. In contrast, emotional contagion involves the matching of affective experiences <italic>of</italic> another and so may reflect any number of discrete emotions depending on the parallel experienced emotion.</p>
<p>To determine whether psychopathy is indeed associated with an impaired capacity to experience emotional contagion and empathic concern, we developed a task based on the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0306624X11421891">Lishner, Cooter, et al. (2008)</xref> designed to covertly manipulate and assess both of these empathic states. This task was developed to achieve three important methodological aims. First, given concerns regarding the ability of popular dispositional empathy measures to accurately predict genuine state experiences of empathy (see, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0306624X11421891">Batson et al., 1986</xref>), we sought to manipulate state experiences of emotional contagion and empathic concern rather than rely on respondents’ own assessments of their tendency to experience these states across time and situation. Second, we sought to covertly elicit and measure these states in a manner that would minimize motivation to respond in a socially desirable manner. Third, we sought to establish a within-subject baseline and empathy induction comparison conditions. Such an approach was important because it allowed us to examine whether one’s degree of psychopathy was linked to one’s change in affective experience when presented with low and high empathy-evoking stimuli. By establishing this methodological condition, we could determine whether one is impaired in the ability to experience affective empathy per se (shows no relative change in reactivity across low- and high empathy–inducting stimuli) or whether one can experience affective empathy but is just generally less emotionally reactive (shows low reactivity to both low- and high empathy–inducing stimuli but shows relative change across both types of stimuli).</p>
<p>To test the hypothesis that psychopathy is associated with impairment in the experience of affective empathy, we conducted two preliminary studies. In Study 1, the affective empathy task was (a) administered to a pilot sample of undergraduate participants to ensure that the task could successfully evoke emotional contagion and empathic concern states and (b) was administered to a test sample of undergraduates whose levels of psychopathy also were evaluated. In Study 2, a second test of the hypothesis was made by administering the affective empathy task to a sample of forensic inpatients possessing a more moderate range of psychopathy.</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>Participants were 100 undergraduate students (<italic>pilot sample</italic>: 56 men and 44 women) and 153 undergraduate students (<italic>test</italic> s<italic>ample</italic>: 49 men and 102 women) enrolled in introductory psychology courses at a medium-sized Midwestern University. Participants volunteered to participate via an online scheduling system by selecting from a list of different studies that included the studies comprising Study 1. Study listings were identified by a code number and included a one statement description of the research (“Evaluate stimuli and complete questionnaires”). Those who chose to participate received partial credit toward a course research requirement in return for participation. To maximize participants’ sense of anonymity, they were not asked to indicate any identifying information other than their gender while completing the study. Although data about participants’ ethnicity and age were not recorded, casual observation suggested that the vast majority of participants were Caucasian and in their late teens and early 20s. Pilot sample participation occurred in a different academic semester than did participation in the test sample. Two female participants in the test sample were excluded from data analyses because they failed to complete some of the measures.</p>

<title>Measures</title>
<sec id="section7-0306624X11421891">
<title>Affective empathy task</title>
<p>The task instructions described its ostensible purpose as a task that measures liking of various stimuli. Participants were told that they had been randomly assigned to view 3 of 24 possible classes of picture objects and to read 2 of 12 possible news stories. In actuality, all participants were presented with the same 3 classes of pictures and 2 news articles. The 3 classes of pictures were images of everyday objects, places, and faces. The images were divided into six series. Each series consisted of three everyday objects, followed by three places, followed by three faces, for a total of 9 images in each of the six series (54 images total across all six series). Within each series, participants were asked to rank-order the 3 images in each class based on their relative liking of the images. In other words, in each series participants rank ordered the three everyday objects, then rank ordered the three places, and then rank ordered the three faces. After completing image rankings, participants read two brief news articles and rated how much they liked each. The reason for having participants rank and rate their preferences for the image and story stimuli was to distract them from the true purpose of the study, which was to covertly manipulate and measure affective empathy.</p>
<p>The covert manipulations of emotional contagion and empathic concern were accomplished by varying the three faces depicted in the last class of images of each image series (three neutral faces, three happy faces, three sad faces, three angry faces, three fearful faces, and three infant faces), and by having respondents read a relatively neutral story and a story about those in need.</p>
<p>Images in five of the six facial image sets were taken from the combined Japanese and Caucasian facial expression of emotion and Japanese and Caucasian neutral face picture sets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0306624X11421891">Matsumoto &amp; Ekman, 1988</xref>). All three faces in a set displayed the same emotional expression and were male. Two of the faces were Caucasian and one was Japanese. No single male face was used more than once. The sixth image set consisted of infant faces selected from the International Affective Pictures System (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0306624X11421891">Lang, Bradley, &amp; Cuthbert, 1995</xref>). The neutral story described the construction of a new recreation center in an anonymous community, and the need story described the plight of an older couple forced to move out of their home of 47 years due to rising property taxes. The order in which the facial image sets (but not the other image sets) were presented across the six series of pictures was counterbalanced as was the order in which the two stories were read.</p>
<p>At the end of each image series (immediately after ranking the faces) and after reading each story, participants completed a feelings questionnaire that they were told was designed to assess how they felt at various points in the study “because how you feel at any moment can sometimes affect how much you like or don’t like things.” Participants rated how they currently felt (1 = <italic>not at all</italic> and 10 = <italic>extremely</italic>) using items used in previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0306624X11421891">Lishner, Cooter, et al., 2008</xref>) to measure state feelings of happiness (<italic>joyful</italic> and <italic>delighted</italic>), sadness (<italic>sad</italic> and <italic>sorrowful</italic>), anger (<italic>angry</italic> and <italic>mad</italic>), fear (<italic>scared</italic> and <italic>afraid</italic>), and empathic concern (<italic>compassionate, tender</italic>, and <italic>sympathetic</italic>; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0306624X11421891">Batson, Fultz, &amp; Schoenrade, 1987</xref> for the original psychometric work on these items as well as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0306624X11421891">Batson, 2011</xref> for a partial summary of more than 25 social psychology experiments that have used these items to measure empathic concern). Thus, for each participant, completion of the affective empathy task resulted in ratings of each emotion (happiness, sadness, anger, fear, and empathic concern) immediately after presentation of each facial set (neutral, happy, sad, angry, fearful, and infant) and immediately after reading each story (neutral and need). Furthermore, use of the counterbalancing procedure described above ensured that any between-condition differences in self-reported emotion could only be attributed to differences in the presented faces or story.</p>

<title>Self-Report Psychopathy Scale–Version III (SRP-III)</title>
<p>Participants in the test sample completed the SRP-III (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0306624X11421891">Paulhus, Neumann, &amp; Hare, in press</xref>), which consists of 64 self-descriptive statements designed to assess psychopathic traits in noncriminal samples. Item responses may be aggregated into a single psychopathy score or four facet scores (callous affect, interpersonal manipulation, erratic lifestyle, and criminal tendencies). The SRP-III was designed to mirror the dimensional structure of the Psychopathy Checklist–Revised (PCL-R; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0306624X11421891">Hare, 2003</xref>), which is often used as the criterion for comparative studies on psychopathy measures in criminal and forensic samples. The SRP-III shows high internal reliability, possesses a factor structure similar to that of the PCL-R, and demonstrates convergent validity with other constructs that theoretically relate to psychopathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0306624X11421891">Williams, Paulhus, &amp; Hare, 2007</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section9-0306624X11421891">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>Participants were run in small groups of up to 15 individuals. On arrival, participants completed a consent form and a questionnaire packet consisting of the affective empathy task and a few filler personality questionnaires. Participants in the test sample also completed the SRP-III. To maximize anonymity, participants were instructed to indicate only their gender on the questionnaire and to place the completed questionnaire into a manila envelope. Participants were provided with a group verbal debriefing describing the purpose of the research. During debriefing, those in the pilot sample were also questioned about their beliefs regarding the purpose of the research and measures. No participants indicated awareness that their emotional reactions to the various critical stimuli were the primary focus of the study or indicated awareness that the study was designed to examine their empathic reactions. Prior to conducting this study, ethical approval was obtained from the University’s institutional review board.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0306624X11421891">
<title>Predictions</title>
<p>We predicted that the affective empathy task would evoke emotional contagion and empathic concern. First, we predicted that (a) participants would report higher levels of discrete emotion after viewing corresponding discrete emotional facial expressions (more happiness after viewing happy faces, more sadness after viewing sad faces, etc.) than after viewing neutral faces and (b) participants would report more sadness, anger, and fear after reading an article about those in need (feelings that would likely be similar to those felt by those described in the article) than after reading the neutral story. Such responses would be indicative of emotional contagion. Second, we predicted that (c) participants would report feeling more empathic concern after viewing infant faces than after viewing neutral faces and (d) participants would report feeling more empathic concern after reading about those in need than after reading the neutral article. Most importantly, given our primary theoretical hypothesis that psychopathy is associated with affective empathy impairment, and given predictions (a-d), we predicted that (e) participant difference scores indicating emotional contagion and empathic concern reactions would be negatively correlated with participant psychopathy scores.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0306624X11421891">
<title>Results and Discussion</title>
<p>For each facial set and story, five rating indexes of self-reported emotional experience were created by averaging the items used to assess happiness, sadness, fear, anger, and empathic concern (for a total of 40 index scores for each sample; .61 &lt; α<italic>s</italic> &lt; .97, mean α = .87). We computed test participant’s overall SRP-III scores by summing their responses to all of the items on the measure (α = .93). Psychopathy facet scores were also computed by summing responses to the items comprising each facet (callous affect, interpersonal manipulation, erratic lifestyle, and criminal tendency facet scores had αs of .80, .85, .83, and .74, respectively). Mean psychopathy scores are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0306624X11421891">Table 1</xref> and are consistent with previous research using the SRP-III in student populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0306624X11421891">Paulhus et al., in press</xref>).</p>

<title>Affective Empathy Reactions to Stimuli</title>
<p>Within each student sample, 2 (gender: males vs. females) × 8 (stimulus: neutral faces vs. happy faces vs. sad faces vs. angry faces vs. fearful faces vs. infant faces vs. neutral story vs. need story) mixed-measures ANOVAs were conducted to determine whether gender interacted with type of stimulus in affecting participants’ emotional reactions to the various stimuli. In the pilot sample, no significant Gender × Stimulus interactions were found for happiness, sadness, fear, or empathic concern, all <italic>Fs</italic>(7, 686) &lt; 1.63, <italic>p</italic>s &gt; .12. A significant interaction was found for anger, <italic>F</italic>(7, 686) = 2.32, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .03, such that both men and women reported feeling more anger after reading the need story than after reading the neutral story (both <italic>t</italic>s &gt; 4.84, <italic>p</italic>s &lt; .001), but the mean difference was larger for men than for women. In the test sample no significant Gender × Stimulus interactions were found for any of the five emotions, all <italic>Fs</italic>(7, 1043) &lt; 1.47, <italic>p</italic>s &gt; .18. Given that only one significant interaction between gender and the type stimulus was found and because this interaction reflected parallel and significant effects in both men and women, one-way, repeated-measures ANOVAs (stimulus: neutral faces vs. happy faces vs. sad faces vs. angry faces vs. fearful faces vs. infant faces vs. neutral story vs. need story) were conducted for each of the five emotions after collapsing across gender. These ANOVA’s revealed statistically significant differences among stimuli for all five emotions, all <italic>Fs</italic>(7, 693) &gt; 10.54, <italic>p</italic>s &lt; .001 and, all <italic>Fs</italic>(7, 1050) &gt; 11.77, <italic>p</italic>s &lt; .001, for each sample, respectively.</p>
<p>To more closely examine the effects of the stimuli on emotion ratings, difference scores were computed by subtracting emotion ratings made after the neutral faces from the respective emotion ratings made after the remaining faces. Similarly, difference scores were computed for the story stimuli by subtracting the emotion ratings made after the neutral story from the respective emotion ratings made after the need story.</p>
<p>As predicted, one-sample <italic>t</italic> tests revealed that presentation of happy faces increased feelings of happiness, sad faces increased feelings of sadness, and baby faces increased feelings of empathic concern in both samples, all <italic>t</italic>s &gt; 4.68, <italic>p</italic>s &lt; .001, and <italic>d</italic>s &gt; .38. Also as predicted, angry faces increased feelings of anger and fearful faces increased feelings of fear, but these effects were significant only in the pilot sample, both <italic>t</italic>s(99) &gt; 2.60, <italic>p</italic>s &lt; .02, and <italic>d</italic>s &gt; .26. These results are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0306624X11421891">Table 2</xref> along with other effects that do not address (pros or cons) the theoretical questions of interest. In sum, students generally experienced emotional contagion and state empathic concern in response to both pictorial and written affective empathy-evoking stimuli.</p>

<p>Although little evidence was found for the commonly accepted assertion that psychopathy is negatively associated with ability to experience affective empathy, casual examination of emotion ratings prior to computing emotion difference scores suggested that individuals with higher psychopathy tended to indicate feeling less positive emotion and more negative emotion more generally. Indeed, when emotion ratings of discrete emotion were summed across all eight stimuli, psychopathy and its facets were significantly correlated with overall lower ratings of happiness and overall higher ratings of sadness, anger, and fear, all |<italic>rs</italic>|(148) &gt; .18, <italic>p</italic>s &lt; .05 (after controlling for gender; see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0306624X11421891">Table 4</xref>).

<p>In summary, we found that the affective empathy task was generally effective at producing emotional contagion and empathic concern. Surprisingly, except for one instance, we found no evidence that psychopathic traits are negatively associated with affective empathy impairment. The one instance consistent with the impairment prediction was a negative association between callous affect and increased feelings of sadness in response to reading a story about those in need. In contrast to the general lack of negative association between psychopathic traits and affective empathy, we actually found a number of instances in which psychopathic traits were <italic>positively</italic> associated with affective empathy. Specifically, (a) criminal tendencies was positively associated with increased contagion of sadness, anger, and fear in response to reading about those in need and (b) interpersonal manipulation was associated with increased contagion of fear to reading about those in need. Although intriguing, it is important to keep in mind that given the number of correlations of theoretical interest (nine critical difference scores and five possible psychopathy scores, for a total of 45 correlations), it is possible that some of the 6 significant correlations (including the single significant predicted negative correlation) may be Type I errors. Finally, despite finding little evidence that psychopathy was associated with affective empathy impairment, follow-up analyses did suggest that psychopathy and its facets were positively associated with higher ratings of negative emotion (sadness, anger, and fear) and negatively associated with higher ratings of happiness more generally.</p>

<title>Study 2</title>
<p>As discussed earlier, an association of psychopathy and its facets with affective empathy impairment is a widely held assumption in clinical and forensic conceptualizations of psychopathy. Given the pervasiveness of this assumption in the field, we sought to provide a second test of the empathy-impairment claim. It is possible that failure to find support for the claim in Study 1 results from the nonforensic nature of the sample. As expected, student participants scored fairly low in overall psychopathy (<italic>M</italic> = 146.95, on a 320-point scale), a finding that was largely due to generally low scores on the criminal tendencies facet (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0306624X11421891">Table 1</xref>). In Study 2, we sought to address this potential limitation and provide a second test of the empathy-impairment claim by administering the affective empathy task to a group of forensic inpatients. As in Study 1, if the affective empathy-impairment claim is correct then we should find negative correlations between psychopathy scores and emotion difference scores that would be indicative of emotional contagion and empathic concern responses.</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>Participants were 60 male institutionalized forensic inpatients found not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect for various criminal offenses ranging from homicide to simple assault. At the time of the research, all participants were residing on a minimum-security or medium-security unit. As such, they were considered to be psychiatrically stable (not evidencing active symptoms of mental illness) and not engaging in dangerous behaviors. In return for their participation, inpatients received 2 L of soda. The ages of the inpatients ranged from 20 to 60 years (<italic>M</italic> = 34.90, <italic>SD</italic> = 9.36) and consisted of 36 Caucasians (60%), 19 African Americans (31.7%), 2 Hispanic Americans (3.3%), 2 Native Americans (3.3%), and 1 individual who did not fall into any of the previous categories (1.7%).</p>

<sec id="section20-0306624X11421891">
<title>PCL: Screening Version (PCL:SV)</title>
<p>Inpatient participants were assessed with the PCL:SV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0306624X11421891">Hart, Cox, &amp; Hare, 1995</xref>), which is a 12-item rater-based instrument designed to assess psychopathy in criminal, civil, and forensic samples. Each item is scored on a 3-point scale (0, 1, or 2). As such, total scores can range from 0 to 24. In addition to a total psychopathy score, the PCL:SV is composed of four facets (i.e., affective, interpersonal, lifestyle, and antisocial), which conceptually correspond to the callous affect, interpersonal manipulation, erratic lifestyle, and criminal tendencies SRP-III facets. The PCL:SV is a common measure of psychopathy and has been used in previous studies of forensic inpatients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0306624X11421891">Hill, Neumann, &amp; Rogers, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0306624X11421891">Vitacco et al., 2009</xref>).</p>

<title>Procedure</title>
<p>Each individual signed a consent form informing them of the nature of the study and their rights prior to any research participation. Forensic inpatients were administered the PCL:SV individually by a trained interviewer. Scores for the PCL:SV were obtained by using the interview data plus extensive collateral records by a trained research assistant under the supervision of a licensed psychologist possessing extensive clinical and research experience with the PCL:SV. The inpatients completed the same questionnaire packet (minus the SRP-III) and received the same general debriefing as the participants in Study 1. Prior to conducting this study, ethical approval was obtained from the hospital’s institutional review board.</p>

<title>Results and Discussion</title>
<p>As in Study 1, five rating indexes of self-reported emotional experience were created by averaging the items used to assess happiness, sadness, fear, anger, and empathic concern after presentation of the facial and story stimuli (for a total of 40 index scores; .64 &lt; αs &lt; .97, mean α = .84). We computed inpatients’ overall psychopathy scores by summing their responses to all of the items on the PCL:SV (αs = .71).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0306624X11421891">1</xref></sup> Mean psychopathy scores for inpatients are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0306624X11421891">Table 1</xref>. The base rate in the current forensic sample is somewhat lower than the average forensic patient presented in the PCL:SV manual (29.5th percentile; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0306624X11421891">Hart et al., 1995</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section23-0306624X11421891">
<title>Affective Empathy Reactions to Stimuli</title>
<p>As in Study 1, repeated-measures, one-way ANOVAs (stimulus: neutral faces vs. happy faces vs. sad faces vs. angry faces vs. fearful faces vs. infant faces vs. neutral story vs. need story) were conducted to examine differences in emotion produced by the various stimuli. ANOVAs revealed statistically significant differences among stimuli for happiness, sadness, anger, and fear, all <italic>Fs</italic>(7, 413) &gt; 2.83, <italic>p</italic>s &lt; .01, but not for empathic concern, <italic>F</italic>(7, 413) = 1.30, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .48.</p>
<p>To more closely examine the effects of the stimuli on emotion ratings, difference scores were computed by subtracting emotion ratings made after the neutral faces from the respective emotion ratings made after the remaining faces. Similarly, difference scores were computed for the story stimuli by subtracting the emotion ratings made after the neutral story from the respective emotion ratings made after the need story.</p>
<p>One-sample <italic>t</italic> tests revealed that presentation of emotional expressions and baby faces produced no significant mean change in congruent emotional responses or empathic concern, respectively, all <italic>t</italic>s(59) &lt; .87, <italic>p</italic>s &gt; .38. Reading the story about those in need did produce significant increases in sadness, anger, and fear, all <italic>t</italic>s(59) &gt; 2.59, <italic>p</italic>s &lt; .02, and <italic>d</italic>s &gt; .33, but not empathic concern, <italic>t</italic>(59) = 1.23, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .22 . These results are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0306624X11421891">Table 5</xref> along with other effects that do not address (pros or cons) the theoretical questions of interest. In sum, as a whole, inpatient participants exhibited little affective empathy (either emotional contagion or empathic concern) in response to the facial stimuli. Although reading about individuals in need did produce emotional contagion reactions (higher sadness, anger, and fear), reading the need story did not produce higher empathic concern.</p>

<p>If psychopathy is associated with affective empathy impairment, then psychopathy scores should be negatively correlated with the nine critical emotion difference scores indicative of emotional contagion or empathic concern (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0306624X11421891">Table 5</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0306624X11421891">Table 6</xref>, however, no significant negative correlations were found between overall psychopathy scores and any of these difference scores. Surprisingly, one significant positive correlation was found between psychopathy and feeling empathic concern in response to reading about someone in need, <italic>r</italic>(58) = .28, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0306624X11421891">2</xref></sup> Again, as in Study 1, we found little evidence that psychopathy was associated with affective empathy impairment. Indeed, if anything psychopathy was associated with <italic>increased</italic> affective empathy.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section25-0306624X11421891">
<title>General State Emotionality and Psychopathy</title>
<p>We also conducted follow-up analyses, like those in Study 1, in which emotion ratings of discrete emotion were summed across all eight stimuli. In forensic inpatients, however, psychopathy was not significantly correlated with overall ratings of any of the emotions, all |<italic>rs</italic>|(58) &lt; .17, <italic>p</italic>s &gt; .19.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0306624X11421891">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Despite using a forensic sample with higher overall psychopathy than the student sample tested in Study 1, we still found little evidence that psychopathy was associated with affective empathy impairment. Similar to Study 1, when psychopathy was associated with affective empathy reactions, the association tended to be positive, such that higher psychopathy was associated with greater affective empathy.</p>
<p>However, unlike the failure to support the affective empathy-impairment claim, a finding that was consistent across both studies, the positive associations between psychopathy and affective empathy seemed to depend on the nature of the stimulus perceived and the sample. For both inpatients and students, psychopathy showed no positive association with either emotional contagion or empathic concern reactions in response to facial stimuli, but the two samples did differ in their empathic responses to reading about those in need. Specifically, for inpatients, overall psychopathy was positively associated with higher state experiences of empathic concern, whereas some psychopathic traits tended to be positively associated with emotional contagion of sadness, anger, and fear among students. Although the positive associations between psychopathy and affective empathy reactions as a function of sample are certainly intriguing, it is important to keep in mind that the student and inpatient samples likely differed on a range of variables (e.g., age and presence of severe psychological disorders) that makes explanations for these discrepancies speculative.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section26-0306624X11421891">
<title>General Discussion</title>
<p>It is widely believed that affective empathy impairment is a core feature of psychopathy. Contrary to this belief, however, we consistently found little empirical evidence linking psychopathy with impairment in the experience of either emotional contagion or empathic concern in either a forensic inpatient sample or a nonforensic student sample. Instead, depending on the type of stimulus perceived and the participant sample that was tested, certain facets of psychopathy (interpersonal manipulation and criminal tendencies) were associated with <italic>greater</italic> affective empathy, a finding that is at odds with the affective empathy-impairment claim. Specifically, certain psychopathic traits in nonforensic individuals (interpersonal manipulation and criminal tendencies) were associated with emotional contagion of sadness, anger, and fear in response to reading about those in need. In addition to empathy-specific affective reactions, psychopathy also was positively associated with a more pervasive tendency to experience less positive-state emotion and more negative-state emotion across all stimuli in nonforensic individuals. Among forensic inpatients, psychopathy showed little association with affective empathy or general emotional reactions, except for a tendency to experience more empathic concern after reading about those in need. These differential associations between psychopathy and affective reactivity depending on forensic classification may be important to examine in future research.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section27-0306624X11421891">
<title>Implications and Future Directions</title>
<p>The present findings raise questions about the assumption that affective empathy impairment is a core feature in the constellation of interpersonal and affective dysfunctions linked to psychopathy. This is not to say that individuals with higher psychopathy are not more callous in their reactions to others. Indeed, higher psychopathy in nonforensic individuals was associated with higher overall negative affect and less overall positive affect following exposure to the (mostly social) stimuli used in the present study, emotional reactions that may reflect a more distant interpersonal emotionality toward others. This finding is notable in that clinical or forensic experts may inadvertently conclude that individuals with higher psychopathy are unable to experience affective empathy because experts compare the intensity of these individuals’ emotional reactions to those of individuals with lower psychopathy in response to the same high empathy–inducing stimulus. Failure to also compare both types of individuals’ emotional reactions in response to the same low empathy–inducing stimulus may create an incorrect understanding of what individuals with higher psychopathy are and are not capable of experiencing emotionally.</p>
<p>Other possibilities exist to explain some of the present findings. One possibility is that psychopathy measures may be inundated with negative emotionality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0306624X11421891">Lilienfeld &amp; Fowler, 2006</xref>). If this is true, then the associations between psychopathic traits and general affective negativity found in the present research would be partially explained by construct overlap in the psychopathy and emotion measures. A second point of interest that warrants discussion revolves around accurately assessing psychopathic traits in forensic populations. Although psychopathy is frequently evaluated in forensic populations, the relation between psychopathic traits and psychopathology is not well understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0306624X11421891">Morrissey &amp; Hollin, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0306624X11421891">Pham &amp; Saloppé, 2010</xref>). Concerns of false positives would warrant consideration of whether one were mistaking symptoms of psychosis with traits of psychopathy. If such false positives were present to some degree in the forensic sample used in Study 2, then their presence would undermine detection of meaningful relations between psychopathy and emotion within the sample. Future research will need to further address issues of appropriate measurement of psychopathy in forensic populations.</p>
<p>These findings illuminate four important conceptual and methodological conditions one should be vigilant of when interpreting existing and future work regarding the relation between psychopathy and affective empathy. First, it is essential to clearly determine which of the eight conceptualizations of empathy identified by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0306624X11421891">Batson (2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0306624X11421891">2011</xref>) one is seeking to understand. Failure to make the necessary distinctions among these various conceptualizations may lead to faulty conclusions about the link between psychopathy and empathy phenomena and undermine the corresponding operationalization of such phenomena.</p>
<p>Second, it is important to measure state emotional reactions to stimuli because existing dispositional measures of empathy do not necessarily predict genuine state experiences of empathy and corresponding prosocial behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0306624X11421891">Batson et al., 1986</xref>). There actually exists little evidence that dispositional measures of empathy predict changes in state emotion that would be indicative of genuine affective empathy experiences (e.g., increased sadness after viewing a sad face relative to viewing a neutral face). The findings of previous work, which reveal negative associations between dispositional measures of affective empathy and psychopathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0306624X11421891">Mahmut et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0306624X11421891">Sandoval et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0306624X11421891">Zagon &amp; Jackson, 1994</xref>), and the lack of negative association between state affective empathy and psychopathy found in the present research further underscores the very nature of this methodological limitation.</p>
<p>A third important methodological condition is to ensure that within-subject comparison of emotional reactions to empathy-evoking stimuli relative to neutral baseline stimuli is present. Without such comparison, one cannot distinguish between a reaction indicative of affective empathy (e.g., change in sadness after viewing a sad expression relative to viewing a neutral face) and a more general affective reaction that occurs across diverse stimuli (e.g., higher sadness to both sad and neutral faces). In other words, to demonstrate that impairment in affective processes, such as empathy, are linked to personality traits, such as psychopathy, it is necessary to provide evidence that one can empirically demonstrate the affective process and then show that a measure of the personality trait does indeed moderate the process.</p>
<p>A fourth methodological issue that warrants consideration is the relatively low levels of psychopathy in both samples. Even the forensic sample had relatively low levels of psychopathy compared with the normative sample from the PCL:SV manual. Subsequent research on affective empathy and psychopathy may consider evaluating samples with higher overall levels of psychopathic traits. That said, we view this research as preliminary as it comprises some of the first studies to evaluate specific affective empathic processes and psychopathy. It is our goal that this study will fuel additional studies focusing on the relation between psychopathic traits and various forms of affective empathy.</p>
<p>Of significant interest and contrary to established theory, we found evidence that psychopathy was linked to affective variation across a number of primary emotions (i.e., happiness, sadness, anger, and fear) but not variation in the experience of empathic concern. As psychopathy is positively associated with antisocial behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0306624X11421891">Leistico, Salekin, DeCoster, &amp; Rogers, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0306624X11421891">Neumann &amp; Hare, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0306624X11421891">Vitacco et al., 2005</xref>), whereas the experience of empathic concern is positively (and causally) associated with prosocial behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0306624X11421891">Batson, 2011</xref>) and possibly even the inhibition of antisocial behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0306624X11421891">Miller &amp; Eisenberg, 1988</xref>), our findings suggest that impairment in the experience of empathic concern for others does not explain the heightened antisociality found among individuals with higher psychopathy. Moreover, our counterintuitive findings regarding empathic concern suggest more rigorous empirical examination of the potential relation between psychopathy and social emotions may be prudent. In particular, the relation between psychopathy and the experience of embarrassment, shame, and guilt should be more systematically examined given impairment in these social emotions are thought to accompany psychopathy as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0306624X11421891">Hare, 1993</xref>).</p>
<p>In the present research, emotional experience was not assessed prior to stimulus presentation, so it is unclear whether the higher negative emotionality related to psychopathy in nonforensic individuals was induced by the stimuli or reflected temperamental aspects of psychopathy. If the pervasive negative emotionality of participants with higher psychopathy was indeed evoked by the stimuli, then it may be important to consider what type of stimuli trigger the increased negative emotionality. The stimuli used in the present research were primarily social in nature (faces of people and stories about people) and held no implications for punishment or reward of the participants (see, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0306624X11421891">Newman, Curtin, Bertsch, &amp; Baskin-Sommers, 2010</xref>). Evaluation of the association between psychopathy and emotional arousal to stimuli varying in social cues and whether social cues signal possible punishment or reinforcement may illuminate important moderators of the association.</p>

<p>Although inpatients’ overall Psychopathy Checklist: Screening Version (PCL:SV) scores yielded reasonable internal consistency, three of the four facet scales failed to do so (αs for the affective, interpersonal, lifestyle, and antisocial facets were .71, .54, .53, .46, respectively). Consequently, only overall psychopathy scores were used in subsequent analyses for Study 2.</p>
