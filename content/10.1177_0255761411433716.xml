<abstract>
<p>The purpose of this study was to investigate how instruction in the use of rhythmic nuances influences subsequent timings of a musical performance. Volunteer participants were asked to listen to and alter a performance of an excerpt from Mozart’s <italic>Concerto for Horn and Orchestra No. 2</italic> and Bach’s <italic>Suite Number 3 for Violoncello solo, Bourrèe Number 1</italic>. They used recently-developed software that allowed them to control the rhythmic timing of each of the performances without changing any other musical attribute. Forty music majors served as participants for both excerpts in a counter-balanced design. When, after practice, participants generated a performance with which they were pleased, it was saved as a pretest. Students in the treatment group for each piece were taught the rhythmic tendencies that have been identified in the finest performances of these excerpts and practiced them until they felt they were prepared to make a second recording, which was saved as the posttest. Control participants were instructed simply to practice more and to make another, better recording. All note onset data were calculated and analyzed to determine if the experimental groups had successfully integrated the given rhythmic tendencies into their performances. Results indicated that students in the experimental groups did indeed more closely reflect the model professional performances in their posttest performances of both experiments.</p>

<p>Most musicians make a distinction between music as notated on the printed score and the actual realization of that music in performance. Although whole fields of study are based on the examination of the printed page, few would argue with the assertion that the printed page is but a skeletal framework for the musical performance. Of course the notes are the most elementary aspect of music notation, and there is an almost limitless number of other symbols that are included on the printed page to help interpret the way each note should be played. Style, pitch, articulation, dynamics and, to a lesser degree, timing are all aspects that can be hinted at with musical symbols added to the score itself.</p>
<sec id="section1-0255761411433716">
<title>Background for the study</title>
<p>Musical timing has been investigated within the auspices of performance research dating back to the late 1960s (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0255761411433716">Gabrielsson, 2003</xref>). The importance of timing to the musical affect of the performance was greatly substantiated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0255761411433716">Palmer (1989)</xref>, who demonstrated a clear link between increased variations in timing inherent in a performance and the assessed musicality of that same performance. Numerous other lines of investigation have continued to explore this relationship at various levels. Some of this work focused on pianists’ performance of particular pieces of music. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0255761411433716">Repp (1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0255761411433716">1995</xref>) found patterns of timing in performances of <italic>Träumerei</italic>. Similar results were also found examining Debussy’s <italic>La fille aux cheveux du lin</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0255761411433716">Repp, 1997</xref>). No less important was work by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0255761411433716">Johnson (1997)</xref>, which substantiated that aspects of rhythmic variation were linked directly to increased assessments of musicality in performances of Mozart. This link was also examined from a different perspective when <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0255761411433716">Juslin and Madison (1999)</xref> removed different acoustical cues from piano performances (tempo, dynamics, timing variations, articulations) and found that removing timing patterns resulted in significant decreases in listeners’ abilities to decode emotional expressions of the performances.</p>
<p>Although there is a system of rhythmic variation that adheres to some kind of common practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0255761411433716">Clarke, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0255761411433716">Johnson, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0255761411433716">Palmer, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0255761411433716">Rose, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0255761411433716">Shaffer, 1984</xref>), attempts at a computational model to replicate this common practice or make rules that match expert performance have met with less than ideal success. One noteworthy attempt was made by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0255761411433716">Todd (1992)</xref>, wherein he coupled dynamic and rhythmic variations to create a musical performance model. Several follow-up investigations, however, found that, while the model worked in some instances, it just was not adequate to generalize beyond a very limited context. Technological capabilities have continued to expand rapidly; however, the overarching rules for expressive variation remain in large part unexplained. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0255761411433716">Sundberg, Friberg, and Bresin (2003)</xref> examined a system that introduces expressive deviations in a musical performance based on rules established by the operator. In this project, rules were created such that the program would replicate a performance of Mozart by a professional pianist. Though there were high correlations in some sections, other sections of the excerpt correlated very little. The researchers concluded that there would need to be different rules established for each section.</p>
<p>Though this rhythmic common practice is complicated (seemingly too complicated to quantify effectively in even a complex mathematical formula), there is ample evidence that rhythmic variations can be imitated and incorporated into people’s performances. In a project by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0255761411433716">Repp (2000)</xref>, pianists were given models of varied performances in terms of rhythmic nuance and it was found that the subjects could indeed imitate the models presented. Extending from this, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0255761411433716">Woody (2006)</xref> found that this imitation was not limited to just an aural model, but was also true with verbal instruction regarding concrete musical issues and imagery or metaphor as well. In fact, in a closely-related study, the effect of written and pictorial instruction in the use of specific rhythmic nuances influenced the timings of a musical performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0255761411433716">Johnson, 1998</xref>). Volunteer participants were asked to listen to and perform musically (using software and a midi-keyboard) an excerpt from Mozart’s <italic>Concerto for Horn and Orchestra No. 2</italic>. Subjects generated a rhythmic performance of the concerto with which they were pleased. They were then taught the rhythmic tendencies that have been identified in the finest performances of this excerpt and practiced them until they felt they were prepared to make a second recording, which served as a posttest. Results indicated that their rubato usage more closely reflected the model performance in the posttest. Following that study, a new set of subjects replicated these procedures, this time performing Bach’s <italic>Suite Number 3 for Violoncello solo, Bourrèe Number 1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0255761411433716">Johnson, 2000</xref>). Results indicated that both groups’ pretests as well as the control group’s posttest had almost no correlation with the model, while the results of the experimental group’s posttest significantly correlated with the rhythmic model.</p>

<title>Purpose</title>
<p>The purpose of the present pair of studies was to replicate and extend the two earlier investigations concerning the effects of training in the rhythmic variations characteristic of excellent professional performances on participants’ performances of musical selections by Mozart and Bach. A secondary purpose was to examine the efficacy of recently-developed real-time software for this type of data collection. Specific research questions to be answered were:</p>
<list id="list1-0255761411433716" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Is there corroborating evidence to support the assertion that rubato can be taught?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Do the results of these extensions using a different methodology replicate previous findings?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Is the new Application of the Continuous Response Digital Interface (CRDI) a valid instrument for this type data collection?</p></list-item>

<sec id="section4-0255761411433716">
<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section5-0255761411433716">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>Participants were 40 volunteer upper division and graduate music majors who had previously passed a screening procedure to establish an acceptable level of performance ability. All participants attended one of two large comprehensive universities either in the midwest or southeast United States. Subjects were randomly assigned to either the control (<italic>n</italic> = 20) or experimental (<italic>n</italic> = 20) groups. All human subject protections were observed. For experimental design purposes, subjects assigned to the control group in Study 1 completed that study first and at a later date were assigned to the experimental group in Study 2. Contrastingly, participants assigned to the experimental group for Study 1 first completed the tasks for Study 2 as control group participants.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0255761411433716">
<title>Experimental equipment and software</title>
<p>The instrument used in this investigation was a version of the Continuous Response Digital Interface (CRDI). Similar applications have been described in recently-published studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0255761411433716">Geringer, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0255761411433716">Geringer, MacLeod, &amp; Allen, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0255761411433716">Madsen, 2011</xref>). In the present application, CRDI software was programmed so that changes in dial position controlled the speed of the performance; that is, the participant controlled the instantaneous tempo of music in real time with the CRDI dial. Specifically, when a participant rotated the dial to the left, the audio presentation slowed in tempo. Conversely, when the participant turned the dial to the right, the music got faster. The dial was calibrated so that the full range (a 255-degree arc) corresponded to speed changes of ± 33%. No other aspects of the auditory stimulus were modified by the dial (pitch, timbre, etc. were not altered). The participant controlled the timing of the performance in its entirety. Dial movement data were collected every 0.3 seconds.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0255761411433716">
<title>Experimental stimulus</title>
<p>The musical excerpt used was the development section from Mozart’s <italic>Concerto for Horn and Orchestra No. 2</italic>, movement 1. This section contains six phrases and lasts approximately 60 seconds. The performance heard was electronically created with <italic>Finale</italic>, using string sounds for the accompaniment and horn sounds for the soloist. The decision to use an electronically-produced sound was to allow participants to begin with a technically-accurate (‘metronomic’) performance. Although every effort was made to make the stimulus sound as aesthetically pleasing as possible, it was evident that it was a synthesized performance.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0255761411433716">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>Music students participated on an individual basis. Participants entered the experimental laboratory and listened to a ‘technically-accurate’ performance of the excerpt while reading a three-line staff reduction of the score. The performance was generated by computer, which played the programmed notes in metronomically-perfect time at a preprogrammed tempo. Each participant then practiced using the CRDI apparatus to create what he/she determined to be a ‘musical’ performance, realizing that the only variable that could be modified was the onset timing of each note. Students were able to re-record their performance until they were satisfied with it in its entirety. When each participant determined that she/he had created a satisfactorily ‘perfect performance’ it was saved. This completed recording served as the pretest.</p>
<p>Each participant in the experimental group was then given a short lesson on rhythmic nuance. The lesson emphasized rhythmic tendencies (rubato) noted in professional performances which were judged to enhance the musical effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0255761411433716">Johnson, 1997</xref>). Each student was presented with this rhythmically-nuanced information, both graphically and in prose. Participants were then told that the task was to incorporate these rhythmic nuances into their own performance such that it would be musically enhanced. After the subjects indicated that they understood the task, they were left alone with the rhythmic information and their score, and used the information as they chose. Many participants chose to mark their score in some manner. The presentation of this information functioned as the treatment in this pre/posttest design.</p>
<p>Participants in the control group were given the following instructions:
<disp-quote>
<p>You now have the opportunity to again enhance the expressiveness of another performance of the <italic>Mozart Horn Concerto No. 2 in Eb</italic> by altering the timing of the performance. You can again speed up or slow down the entire performance wherever you feel it would make the performance more musical. You may use the score you used in your first attempt, or you may use a new one. There is no right or wrong way to do this. <underline>You may make as many attempts as you wish in order to achieve a musical performance</underline>.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>When participants believed that they understood the task for the second part of the experiment, they were again allowed to practice the excerpt for as long as they desired. When participants felt they had indeed achieved their best performance, they again recorded the excerpt. When the recording was exactly what they wanted it to be, their participation was considered complete. This last recording for both groups served as the posttest.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0255761411433716">
<title>Results</title>
<p>Standard deviations were calculated for each group’s pre- and posttest responses. These deviation scores were used as indicators of the degree to which each group modified the timing of the performance. A relatively low standard deviation would indicate less dial movement or less change of tempi from the original recording, while a higher standard deviation would indicate greater use of rubato. The standard deviations for the control group’s dial movements increased from pretest (39.73) to posttest (44.64). Standard deviations for the experimental group’s dial movements were lower (pretest = 34.57, and posttest = 37.01). This indicated less dial movement in the experimental group’s posttest than in either of the control group’s pre- and posttests, and little more than the experimental group’s own pretest. Although the overall deviations themselves were not larger, a careful examination of the deviation graphs showed substantially more <italic>minor</italic> adjustments in the experimental group’s posttest when compared to the other three conditions (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0255761411433716">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>Pre- and posttest timings for each 0.3 second sample of the students’ performances were used to calculate the mean CRDI for the two groups across participants. These group timings were compared to each other and to the model using the Pearson product moment correlation. All tests for both groups’ pre- and posttest performances indicated a moderately high correlation. However, when compared to the model timings, only the experimental group’s posttest showed a substantially higher correlation. When the experimental group’s posttest was compared to the model timings, the relationship was moderate and significant (<italic>r</italic> = .51). The experimental group’s posttest was the only data that correlated significantly with the model performance (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0255761411433716">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section12-0255761411433716">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>Participants were the same 40 volunteer upper division and graduate music majors who completed the previous study. Subjects were rotated so that those who had been in the experimental group in the first study were in the control group in the second study, and vice versa. Subjects actually completed the control portion of the study to which they were assigned as the control group first to help prevent previous experimental knowledge from affecting subsequent performances.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0255761411433716">
<title>Musical stimulus</title>
<p>For this study, the musical excerpt was Bach’s <italic>Suite Number 3 for Violoncello solo, Bourrèe Number 1</italic> (without repeats). This section contains seven phrases and lasts approximately 60 seconds. The performance was electronically created with <italic>Finale</italic> using a cello sound. Again, although every effort was made to make the stimulus sound as aesthetically pleasing as possible, there was no doubt that this was a synthesized performance.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0255761411433716">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>Procedures for this study directly paralleled those for Study 1, including the short lesson on rhythm. Each participant in the experimental group was given the short lesson on rhythmic nuance. The lesson emphasized rhythmic tendencies (rubato) noted in professional performances that were judged to enhance the musical effect. Each student was presented with this rhythmically-nuanced information, both graphically and in prose. Participants were then told that the task was to incorporate these rhythmic nuances into their own performance such that it would be musically enhanced. Participants in the control group were given the following instructions for the posttest:
<disp-quote>
<p>You now have the opportunity to again enhance the expressiveness of <italic>Bourrèe Number 1</italic> from Bach’s <italic>Suite Number 3 for Violoncello solo</italic> by altering the timing of the performance. You can again speed up or slow down the entire performance wherever you feel it would make the performance more musical. You may use the score you used in your first attempt, or you may use a new one. There is no right or wrong way to do this. <underline>You may make as many attempts as you wish in order to achieve a musical performance</underline>.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>As before, when participants believed that they had achieved their desired performance, they recorded the excerpt again. Their participation was considered complete with the completion of this second recording. This recording served as the posttest.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0255761411433716">
<title>Results</title>
<p>Standard deviations were calculated for each group’s pre- and posttest responses. These standard deviations were used as indicators for how much each group had modified the timing of the performance; a relatively low standard deviation indicates less dial movement or less change of tempi, while a higher standard deviation indicates more use of rubato. Standard deviations for the control group’s dial movements were 33.60 and 31.36 for the pretest and posttest, respectively. Standard deviations for the experimental group’s dial movements showed an increase from the pretest (32.18) to the posttest (41.51). This is an increase of more than 28% in dial movement for the experimental group’s posttest, compared to the other conditions.</p>
<p>Pre- and posttest timings for each 0.3 second sample were calculated as mean onset timings across all performances for each group. These group timings were compared to each other and to the model using the Pearson product moment correlation. All tests for both groups’ pre- and posttest performances indicated a moderately high correlation (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0255761411433716">Table 2</xref>). However, when compared to the model timings, all groups except the experimental group’s posttest showed a moderate (<italic>r</italic> = .40) to weak (<italic>r</italic> = .31) correlation. The correlation of the experimental group’s posttest to the model timings was still just moderate, but was the highest of the four comparisons (<italic>r</italic> = .55).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The most important finding of this study is that, by incorporating specific rhythmic variations into their performance, performances were made more musical. Data on the increased standard deviations of the experimental posttest in the Bach stimulus indicate that participants used more rubato in those conditions. Further, correlation results in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0255761411433716">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0255761411433716">2</xref> clearly illustrate additional levels of rubato. To clarify, with both the Mozart and Bach examples, the three performances that had no intervention had correlations with the model performances that were moderate at best. The experimental posttests showed substantive differences in both studies. Once again, this finding illustrates the fact that students can take a ‘pictorial model’ of rhythmic performance and incorporate that set of instructions directly into a musical performance.</p>
<p>This finding is similar to that of previous investigations. Indeed, similarities from the earlier projects with these replications corroborate previous research. Specifically, it seems clear that previous claims regarding the ability of students to incorporate specific rhythmic nuances into their performances rather quickly and accurately were well-founded. Although this study incorporates an entirely different technology, it should be noted that the previous work was done at two different times with two different examples, and has now been replicated several years later. In the original investigation teaching rhythmic variations using the Mozart excerpt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0255761411433716">Johnson, 1998</xref>), participants were able to incorporate model timings (<italic>r</italic> = .78, see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0255761411433716">Table 3</xref>). While that degree of correspondence was not reached here, students did increase in correspondence with the model (from <italic>r</italic> = .12 to <italic>r</italic> = .51). It also should be noted that the other numbers in the correlation matrix closely parallel those found in the previous investigation. The same applies to the Bach example (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0255761411433716">Tables 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0255761411433716">3</xref>). Though all correlations are a little higher, the patterns of performance are markedly similar to previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0255761411433716">Johnson, 2000</xref>).</p>

<p>In summary, we can draw some conclusions that add to the body of research on rubato: (1) this line of research has indicated that there is indeed common practice with regard to rhythmic performance (rubato) that is inherent to Western Art Music (Johnson, 1995). (2) It also appears that people can hear whether or not rubato is being used during a performance, even when they cannot define it or track exactly when and what it is (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0255761411433716">Johnson, 1992</xref>). (3) Furthermore, this common practice can be analyzed, and can be defined using empirical terms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0255761411433716">Johnson, 1996</xref>). (4) Additionally, these defined practices can be linked directly to what is considered to be a more musical performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0255761411433716">Johnson, 1997</xref>). (5) Finally, the two studies reported here add to the research by showing that these common practices of rhythmic nuance (rubato), once clearly defined, can be taught such that students of typical musical ability can apply them relatively quickly with only a little practice, thereby making their own performances more musical.</p>
<p>At this point, extant evidence suggests that simply conveying this knowledge of rhythm common practice to students is enough for them to mimic these patterns, where before they may have not even known they existed. This transfer of knowledge can arguably take place in an applied studio or an ensemble setting. Since one of the primary goals of music instruction is to teach students to perform more musically, the implications of these results would seem to be a crucial aspect of what effective teachers should choose to do. As a profession, we have spent a great deal of our energy explaining aspects of pitch and tone, but we seem to devote less attention on the temporal aspects of performance. We discuss the macro of pitch (right note) and to some degree the micro (intonation and raising and lowering certain scale degrees and parts of the chord in minute ways). Although we also work with the macro of rhythm, and even the micro slightly with metronomes, we almost never address the micro structures that should go around the beat. Clearly it is being done by the finest performers. This line of research indicates that these seemingly minor differences in timing not only deserve our attention, but that consequential increases in expressiveness can be achieved relatively easily.</p>
<p>Additionally, it appears that the recently-developed control software for the Continuous Response Digital Interface represents an important advancement in the field with numerous applications – control of temporal aspects of performance being just one of many. The present investigation constitutes a replication and extension of previous work, and as the results of this study parallel those of the original studies so closely, the level of confidence with regard to these former findings is increased. The current study appears to indicate that this new software is a valid and useful research tool. Application of these results could indeed have an important impact on music performance, pedagogy, and music listening as expressed in a model for meaningful listening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0255761411433716">Madsen &amp; Geringer, 2000/2001</xref>). Considering the enormous amount of time the music student spends in private instruction, rehearsal, and practice, the relationship of rhythmic nuance to perceived musicianship should play an important role in redefining how music is taught. Given that these results clearly demonstrate that rhythmic tendencies can be taught, it might be that rubato should receive even greater detailed attention in music education.</p>

<title>Effet de l’instruction de l’utilisation du rubato approprie sur les performances de mozart &amp; bach: la replication et l’extension</title>
<p>Le but de cette étude était d’étudier comment l’enseignement de l’utilisation de nuances rythmiques influences <italic>timing</italic> ultérieures d’une performance musicale. Volontaires ont été invités à écouter et à modifier une performance d’un extrait du concerto de Mozart pour cor et orchestre n° 2 et la Buorrée n° 1 de la troisième Suite pour violoncelle solo de Bach. Ils ont utilisé un logiciel récemment développé qui leur permettait de contrôler le <italic>timing</italic> rythmique de chaque performance sans changer aucun autre attribut de musique. Quarante étudiants de musique ont servi en tant que participants pour les deux extraits dans un design contrebalancé. Lorsque, après la pratique, les participants ont généré une performance avec laquelle ils étaient satisfaits, il a été enregistré comme un prétest. Les étudiants du groupe expérimental pour chaque pièce ont été enseignées les tendances rythmiques qui ont été identifiés dans les plus belles performances de ces extraits et de les pratiquer jusqu’à ce qu’ils estimaient qu’ils étaient prêts à faire un second enregistrement, qui a été enregistré comme le post-test. Participants du groupe contrôle ont reçu l’instruction simplement de pratiquer davantage et à faire un autre enregistrement amélioré. Toutes les données concernant l’attaque de la note (onset note) ont été calculés et analysés afin de déterminer si les groupes expérimentaux ont intégré avec succès les tendances rythmiques donnée dans leurs performances. Les résultats ont indiqué que les étudiants dans les groupes expérimentaux ont effectivement mieux assimiler les performances du modèle professionnel dans leur post-test des performances des deux expériences.</p>
