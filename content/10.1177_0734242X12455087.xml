<abstract>
<p>Strategies for enhancing environmental management are a key focus for the government in the UK. Using a manufacturing company from the construction sector as a case study, this paper evaluates selected interventionist techniques, including environmental teams, awareness raising and staff training to improve environmental performance. The study employed a range of methods including questionnaire surveys and audits of energy consumption and generation of waste to examine the outcomes of the selected techniques. The results suggest that initially environmental management was not a focus for either the employees or the company. However, as a result of employing the techniques, the company was able to reduce energy consumption, increase recycling rates and achieve costs savings in excess of £132 000.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The rising costs of resources, coupled with the growing realization of the environmental and economic benefits to be accrued from more sustainable approaches, is increasingly leading businesses to adopt these approaches. This is particularly true of energy-intensive industries such as manufacturing and construction. Studies in various countries have demonstrated increasing efforts to reduce, reuse and recycle waste in the construction industry, primarily through the use of design techniques and sustainable construction methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0734242X12455087">Ekanayake and Ofori, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0734242X12455087">Esin and Cosgun, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0734242X12455087">Rodriguez et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0734242X12455087">Tam and Tam, 2006</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0734242X12455087">De Palma and Dobes (2010)</xref> investigated the impact of various interventions among multiple case study companies and concluded that they had realized environmental and economic benefits. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0734242X12455087">Jiang and Tovey (2009)</xref> state that China’s building sector consumes around 25% of the country’s total energy supply and there are increasing calls for initiatives to conserve energy. However, there are barriers to progress. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0734242X12455087">Tan et al. (2011)</xref> argued that a key limitation in China to improved practices was the lack of a policy framework and legislation.</p>
<p>In the UK, over 90% of the materials used in the manufacturing and production processes are not included in the final product, and companies can spend up to 5% of their annual turnover on wastage in the form of unused materials, defects and inefficiency, energy and water consumption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0734242X12455087">EEF, 2009</xref>). Indeed, it is estimated that the UK could save around £6.4 billion annually through improved resource efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0734242X12455087">EEF, 2009</xref>). Thus, government has sought to introduce more stringent fiscal incentives and increased environmental legislation to encourage greater corporate responsibility for resource management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0734242X12455087">Defra, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0734242X12455087">2011</xref>).</p>
<p>The UK construction and demolition sector accounts for approximately 32% of all waste generated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0734242X12455087">Defra, 2010</xref>). Thus it is a key target for improved efficiency. Using a case study approach, this paper sets out to examine the efficacy of selected interventions on the sustainability of corporate environmental practices within the construction sector.</p>
<sec id="section2-0734242X12455087">
<title>The case study company</title>
<p>The case study company was established in 1969 and grew to become one of the largest manufacturers of off-site modular buildings in the UK. It is situated on a 16-acre site in Northamptonshire (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0734242X12455087">Figure 1</xref>), with two large manufacturing lines, as well as a large enclosed exhibition centre. At the time of the study, the company’s core business was the manufacture of modular buildings, such as bungalows and log cabins and thus serves as a good case study due to the increasing use of the modular style of constructing homes, worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0734242X12455087">Jaillon and Poon, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0734242X12455087">Lu and Yuan, 2010</xref>). At the time of the study (2007–2008), the company employed around 300 individuals, and had an annual turnover of £30 million.</p>

<sec id="section4-0734242X12455087">
<title>Interventionist techniques</title>
<p>The interventions were implemented over a two year period (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0734242X12455087">Table 1</xref>). Three main interventionist techniques were investigated, namely: (1) staff training in environmental management; (2) use of environmental teams; and (3) use of visual materials/aids.</p>

<sec id="section5-0734242X12455087">
<title>Formal environmental training</title>
<p>The use of training programmes as a means by which to educate and encourage the involvement of employees in environmental initiatives is common. However, there has been mixed results on whether formal training programmes are effective. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0734242X12455087">McDonald (2004)</xref> found that traditional methods such as formal presentations were more effective at providing lasting knowledge when compared with other methods, such as computerized learning systems. Alternatively, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0734242X12455087">Grodzinska-Jurczak <italic>et al.</italic> (2006)</xref> stated that knowledge alone has limited impact on environmental behaviour. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0734242X12455087">Perron <italic>et al.</italic> (2006)</xref> also noted that environmental training in several businesses has not had a lasting impact on the workforce.</p>
<p>The training sessions were comprised of a Microsoft Powerpoint presentation (IT Services) lasting for approximately 20 min, followed by a discussion. Approximately 16 members of staff were trained per session. The aims of the sessions were to highlight the following:</p>
<list id="list1-0734242X12455087" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Underlying reasons for undertaking environmental improvement activities within the construction sector.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>A business case for undertaking environmental improvement activities.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Current environmental initiatives already under way within the company.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Upcoming environmental initiatives that the company was planning to implement.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Sessions for the manufacturing line staff were held during March 2007, whereas those for office staff were conducted during October 2007 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0734242X12455087">Table 1</xref>). The content was tailored to align with the two main categories of staff in the company, namely those who worked on the manufacturing lines and the administrative staff, in order to ensure relevance to both. For example, for the administrative staff there was more emphasis on printing double-sided in order to reduce waste, whereas for those on the manufacturing line the need to check for leaks in equipment as a means of conserving energy was highlighted. An open forum/discussion session followed the presentation, allowing staff the opportunity to discuss any issues raised in the presentations and to also make suggestions on how to improve the environmental performance of the company.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0734242X12455087">
<title>Environmental teams</title>
<p>Environmental teams (a group of individuals responsible for promoting sustainable environmental management), have been shown to be an important driver for the effective implementation of sustainable environmental management in organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0734242X12455087">Moxen and Strachan, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0734242X12455087">Remmen and Lorentzen, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0734242X12455087">Tudor et al., 2008</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0734242X12455087">Remmen and Lorentzen (2000)</xref> demonstrated the importance of environmental teams in driving forward environmental projects within business. Teams are able to draw upon their knowledge and experiences, and put forward proposals on how to reduce the company’s environmental impacts, thus it is not essential for members of the team to have any specific environmental knowledge. Rather, a good understanding of their organization and the enthusiasm to learn and participate was found to be more beneficial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0734242X12455087">Johansson and Magnusson, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Putting individuals who have already ‘bought’ into the idea of environmental improvements in place as an environmental team can result in what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0734242X12455087">Lozano (2006)</xref> described as the ‘multiplier effect’. The team helps to provide support to other members of the workforce. The knowledge of team members can also be used to help in the development of environmental policies, targets, action plans, procedures and technologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0734242X12455087">Remmen and Lorentzen, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>The environmental team was formed from members of the manufacturing workforce. The workforce was informed about the upcoming voluntary role during the formal training sessions, allowing questions on the role to be raised and answered. In total, 11 individuals volunteered for the role, coming from various backgrounds, such as painters, plumbers, supervisors and inspectors. They underwent a one month trial period and were also given training in a wide range of environmental topics such as waste minimization; climate change; water; energy efficiency and sustainable living.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0734242X12455087">
<title>Use of visual materials/aids</title>
<p>The use of visual materials/aids (e.g. posters) in awareness campaigns has been found to influence the attitudes of individuals. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0734242X12455087">Sampei and Aoyagi-Usui (2008)</xref> argued that regular media coverage of an environmental issue such as climate change does have a significant impact on attitudes in the short term. However, once coverage of the issue stops, then this concern will often fade. Thus, an ongoing environmental update programme is required. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0734242X12455087">Grodzinska-Jurczak <italic>et al.</italic> (2006)</xref> note the importance of awareness as a motivator. The authors argue that the public became more environmentally conscious as a result and participated in more environmentally positive behaviour, such as recycling.</p>
<p>The raising of awareness was undertaken primarily through notices outlining strategies for resource efficiency. A notice board solely for environmental information was installed next to the existing Health and Safety board. Environmental awareness posters and other environmental information relating to the company’s waste strategy were placed on the notice board along with photo of the bins, as well as photos and descriptions of the locations of the environmental officers. In addition, as changes were made to systems in order to improve environmental performance, informative notices that detailed these changes were placed on the board, as well as on the walls of toilets throughout the site in order to reach the highest proportion of the workforce.</p>
<p>The information was updated on a regular basis in order to limit the over-saturation of information and to maintain interest.</p>

<sec id="section8-0734242X12455087">
<title>Survey methods</title>
<p>In order to examine the impact of the three interventions, three main research tools were employed, namely, (1) audits of waste arisings and energy consumption, (2) questionnaire surveys, and (3) narrative interviews. The tools were employed in an integrated manner. The questionnaires served to examine the reported behaviours of the staff, while the interviews gave perspectives on the views of the environmental officers. These reported behaviours were then validated using the findings of the audits, which were employed to examine actual behaviour.</p>
<sec id="section9-0734242X12455087">
<title>Audits of waste arisings, recycling and energy consumption</title>
<p>The audits were conducted between January 2007 and July 2008. They involved a combination of: visual inspections of the waste bins to identify the main waste types and examine levels of contamination (e.g. general waste in the recycling bins); and analysis of company documents to determine quantities of waste arising, recycling and energy consumption.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0734242X12455087">
<title>Questionnaires</title>
<p>Questionnaire surveys were utilized both before and after the intervention techniques were employed. The questionnaires sought to examine the attitudes and beliefs of staff towards resource efficiency within the company, as well as wider environmental management issues. They were piloted amongst a small number of employees to ensure any anomalies or ambiguous questions were rectified before full distribution. Based on the number of staff that had access to email, and the employees working on the manufacturing line that did not, 100 questionnaires were distributed electronically and 200 by hand to ensure all employees had access to a questionnaire. A base-line survey (survey 1) and a follow-up survey (survey 2) were undertaken. A total of 600 questionnaires were distributed. Overall, the return rates for surveys 1 and 2 were 27 and 20%,respectively. In total, survey 1 had more electronic copies returned (36%) than hard copies (18%), whereas for survey 2 there was equal participation from both.</p>
<p>Respondents were asked to state their job title on the questionnaire. Based on discussions with supervisors and staff at the company these job titles were then broken down into the following categories:</p>
<list id="list2-0734242X12455087" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>Directors/management</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Supervisors/foremen</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Administrative staff</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Technical staff</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Non-technical staff</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The data from the returned questionnaires was analysed using the statistical programme SPSS (version 11.5; SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Descriptive analyses were first undertaken to understand the composition of the workforce. Bivariate analyses (primarily correlations and chi-squared) were then conducted to examine staff behaviour and the underlying factors governing their behaviour.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0734242X12455087">
<title>Narrative interviews</title>
<p>Based in part on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0734242X12455087">Elliott (2005)</xref> narrative interviews were utilized to examine the experiences of the environmental officers. The interviews focused on the environmental officers’ stories, the aimed being for the interviewer to provide minimal prompting. However, a sheet with discussion headings was provided to the environmental officers a week before the interviews and this was used to act as a prompt based on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0734242X12455087">Elliott (2005)</xref>. Prompts included queries such as: Can you tell me how/when you started to become more interested in environmental issues? What made you decide to take on the role of environmental officer? How have your colleagues responded to you in your new role as environmental officer? The interviews lasted between 20 and 45 min, depending on how descriptive the officers were in their accounts.</p>
<p>Seven environmental officers were selected to be interviewed. They were invited to the interview one month in advance, and a mutually convenient time arranged. One week before hand each officer was asked to complete a consent form which detailed their rights and explained how the interview would be conducted. Audio recordings were taken to ensure accuracy was achieved and these were then transcribed. Analysis involved coding of the transcript to identify the key themes (e.g. the levels of support of colleagues and the rationales for these levels).</p>

<title>Results</title>
<sec id="section13-0734242X12455087">
<title>Waste arisings</title>
<p>Survey 1 sought to establish what environmental initiatives were already in place and the response of the workforce to them. It identified that the company produced a wide range of waste types, such as wood, metal, cable, polythene, card, expanded polystyrene, some electrical equipment, plastic containers, paint tins and insulating materials. The company had introduced coloured recycling bins around the site for the collection of cardboard and polythene. However, it was evident that these recycling points were not being fully utilized, as inspections of waste bins by the researcher highlighted that most of the cardboard and polythene was being disposed of with the general waste.</p>
<p>In addition to the recycling bins for cardboard and polythene, there were separate containers and skips for the collection of metals, cables and wood, which had been in place for many years. These facilities were regularly being used and in the correct way.</p>
<p>Efficiency in the use of resources on the manufacturing line was limited. Off-cuts of wood, insulation and other re-useable materials were simply disposed of, and there was limited consideration of how to obtain some value from the waste materials. In addition, materials such as paint and rendering, used to coat the exterior of the home for weather protection, were often wasted, with the materials not being correctly stored once opened. Overall the concept of resource efficiency (i.e. reducing wastage and recovering value, was not being explored.</p>
<p>As can be seen from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0734242X12455087">Figure 2</xref>, waste production gradually fell between January 2007 and July 2007. In August 2007, there was a significant drop in waste arisings, which can be attributed to a 2-week long company holiday, during which the manufacturing line was closed. Waste generation rose in October 2008 to levels not seen since March 2007. Nevertheless, levels still remained 20 tonnes below the production recorded in January 2007. Waste arisings largely stabilized after this point, with dips in waste production only seen during other holiday periods.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0734242X12455087-fig2.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>As the quantity of waste generated was influenced by unit production it was decided to normalize the waste data against the number of units produced. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0734242X12455087">Figure 3</xref> shows the normalized general waste data. It suggests that waste produced per unit manufactured fell between 2006–2008. A peak in waste production was seen well into the improvement programme in October 2007. This peak in waste per unit occurred during a company shut-down period and can be explained by maintenance work undertaken throughout the site in preparation for a new project which was to begin in 2008. Thus, although additional waste was being removed from the site, additional units were not being manufactured, skewing the waste per unit figures for this month.</p>
<fig id="fig3-0734242X12455087" position="float">

</fig>
<p>Due to the way in which general waste was collected and disposed of, namely in rear end loaders (REL), accurate weights of waste could not be obtained. Instead, figures gathered from the waste contractors on the average weight of a full REL bin onsite had to be used. This meant that a standard figure was used for all emptied REL bins, whether they were 100% full or not. In many cases, the bins could be as little as 50% full and still be emptied, as overflowing bins could not be risked due to the impact it would have on the production line. Therefore, waste figures alone do not illustrate the full extent of improvement in workforce behaviour.</p>
<sec id="section14-0734242X12455087">
<title>Quantities of recyclables</title>
<p>In order to gain an understanding of the levels of resource conservation amongst staff, the quantities of recyclables recovered were investigated. Overall, the quantity of recyclables recovered increased from 35.1 tonnes at the beginning of the study in January 2007 to 46.8 tonnes by the end of July 2008. Although the total amount recovered fluctuated throughout the study, the overall trend showed an upward trend. As with general waste, the recyclables recovered would have been subject to the influence from the number of units manufactured and the holiday shutdowns. Therefore, the data were normalized against unit production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0734242X12455087">Figure 4</xref>).</p>
<fig id="fig4-0734242X12455087" position="float">

</fig>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0734242X12455087">Figure 4</xref> illustrates the actual and expected recyclables recovered per unit. The expected values were derived from the data that were available prior to the beginning of the research. For cardboard and polythene only a few months of data were available, thus the figures were extrapolated to account for a full year. There was a visible difference between the actual and expected recyclables recovered. There was also a slight upward trend in the actual recyclables recovered. Waste bin inspections also supported this finding, as recyclables were found within the general waste bins less often as time passed.</p>
<p>Based on inspections of the general waste, the most significant improvement was made with reduction in cardboard and polythene in the general waste bins. Other items such as wood and metal were rarely found, as separation of those materials had been in place for many years. The only occasions on which these materials were found in the general waste was when the internal construction ‘tipper skips’ had been contaminated with other waste and it would have been too time consuming to separate the materials. Occurrences of this had largely stopped towards the end of the study due to education of the workforce and colour coding of the bins. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0734242X12455087">Figure 5</xref> depicts the impact that the education of the workforce had on wood recovery. Throughout the research more wood was recovered per unit than was expected. Within the first year of the project this level fluctuated by up to 0.2 tonnes per unit. This fluctuation was most likely from wood being disposed of in the large general waste skip. Investigations highlighted that a forklift truck driver was disposing of wood in this skip, as he had incorrectly identified the bin as a wood skip. Education of individual employees helped to reduce instances such as this from occurring.</p>

<p>Although waste bin inspections suggested that improvements had been made in polythene recovery, the recyclable data did not support this (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0734242X12455087">Figure 6</xref>). This discrepancy was most likely due to the nature of the polythene material, in that despite occupying a large volume, its weight was limited. Thus, removing the polythene from the bins did little to increase the tonnage recovered, but did make more space available within the general waste bins for other waste.</p>

<title>Energy consumption patterns</title>
<p>Between 2007 and 2008 the company experienced a reduction in gas use of 993 984 kWh, which equated to a cost-saving of £29 000 in the first year. Although gas use in 2008 was still substantially lower than the amount used in 2006, overall use was higher than in the previous year (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0734242X12455087">Figure 7</xref>). When gas use was broken down into individual areas within the organization, it became apparent that the increase occurred within only one building on the site.</p>

</fig>
<p>In November 2006, the company invested in an ‘intelligent’ gas heating system for its two manufacturing lines. This had an impact on the overall gas consumption (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0734242X12455087">Figure 8</xref>). The system worked by automatically turning off the heating system if the factory doors were open for more than 2 min. This enforced a behavioural change within the workforce, as they soon found that they were getting cold if they did not close the doors.</p>

</fig>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0734242X12455087">Figure 8</xref> shows that gas usage in the Home Maker Centre (HMC) increased at the end of 2007, and this increase continued into 2008. The cause of this increase was never officially identified; however, it was believed that the new heating/cooling system installed towards the end of 2007 might have been faulty, as no gas leak was identified.</p>
<p>Throughout 2007 the electricity used per unit manufactured varied considerably. There was minimal evidence to suggest why these fluctuations were occurring, other than some late night audits had highlighted that equipment such as air compressors and dust extraction units were being left on. It was felt that this could not be the only explanation. Further investigation into electricity invoices showed regular occurrences of queried invoices and rebates received throughout 2007. This may account for the peaks and troughs seen in electricity consumption.</p>
<p>By 2008 invoicing issues appeared to have been resolved. A positive aspect shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0734242X12455087">Figure 9</xref> was that electricity consumption per unit manufactured had steadily decreased. As no energy-efficient equipment was installed, this reduction can only be attributed to the behavioural change amongst staff.</p>

<title>Impact of the environmental officers</title>
<p>The environmental officers had only a limited impact on the environmental practices and beliefs of staff. Indeed, during the first few months of the project, there was wide spread disregard of their work. For example officer 1 reported that:
<disp-quote>
<p>Across the board the people just saw it (the environmental officer position) as a bit of a joke.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This feeling was also shared by officer 3 who was of the view that:
<disp-quote>
<p>They see environmental officers as the people that should be rifling through all the rubbish and sorting everything out.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Officer 2 was of the opinion that the attitudes of the workforce were one of the biggest challenges to overcome:
<disp-quote>
<p>Getting people to take you seriously when you are telling them about throwing like a little piece of rubbish on the floor like or in the wrong bin, they are looking at you like ‘what? It is a handful of something that has gone in a bin, why is it such an issue?’ and to be taken seriously about that was probably the biggest challenge.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In addition, all of the officers except one also mentioned that their departmental colleagues were also not in support of what they did. For example, officer 4 stated that:
<disp-quote>
<p>(There is) lots of name calling, lots of bullying, you know, I feel like I am a prefect at school, you know, you are just a target.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>However, as time progressed, there was some change in staff perceptions. For example, officer 3 thought that the shift in attitudes was due to the fact that:
<disp-quote>
<p>They (the workforce) learnt what we were actually doing and the fact that it wasn’t really big changes.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>By contrast, Officer 1 felt that the shift in behaviour for some of the staff could be attributed to the fact that his position as a senior supervisor gave the role more credibility:
<disp-quote>
<p>It certainly has got them to be a bit more vigilant.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Interestingly, despite the disregard for the officers, almost all of the employees stated that they would turn to them if they had queries. Indeed, more employees felt they could turn to the Environmental Officers (61%), than to their supervisors (58%).</p>
<p>In addition, whereas most staff (68%) were aware of who the environmental officers were; slightly less than half (48%), felt that the officers had helped to improve their knowledge of environmental issues.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-0734242X12455087">
<title>Knowledge and awareness building</title>
<p>In survey 1 when employees were asked whether they believed resource conservation and recycling benefits the environment only 47% agreed, compared to 95% in survey 2. There was also an increase from 83 to 87% of staff stating that they participated in resource efficiency at work, and from 64 to 66% when they were asked whether they felt resource efficiency benefited them.</p>
<p>Almost half (49%) of the employees felt their knowledge of what to do to minimize quantities of waste was an issue, despite companywide training sessions and incorporation of environmental inductions for all new starters. It is important to note though that this opinion was down from the results of survey 1, in which 64% felt they were lacking the necessary knowledge.</p>
<p>Most of the staff received general work information through notices and emails (86%). However, the posters (76%) and the training sessions (68%) had the highest impact on levels of knowledge and awareness of environmental issues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0734242X12455087">Figure 10</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>Posters were reported to have positively changed attitudes in 75% of employees, whereas the training had an almost equal impact on changing attitudes (69%) and knowledge (70%). The presence of environmental officers led to there being less attitudinal changes (43%); however, whereas the posters were more effective at changing attitudes than they were at improving knowledge, the officers were similarly effective at both. As illustrated by <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0734242X12455087">Figure 11</xref>, employees felt that the environmental manager was the main point of contact if they had a query on an environmental issue (79%). Alternatively, staff also felt strongly that they could refer to the notice boards as well (75%), which supports the earlier finding that the workforce felt the notices improved their knowledge.</p>

<sec id="section19-0734242X12455087">
<title>The impact of the training sessions</title>
<p>Some 68% of the employees noted that the training sessions increased their awareness of environmental issues. Although every effort was made to ensure that all attended the induction or bespoke (i.e. manufacturing- or office-focused) training sessions, only 77% of respondents reported having attended any training. This may explain why 49% of staff still felt that they were lacking in environmental knowledge.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0734242X12455087">Table 2</xref> indicates that over the 2 years of the project, the company invested a total of £82 884 on an environmental improvement programme. The two biggest investments were in the recruitment of a full-time environmental manager, and the installation of the efficient heating system. However, the total savings were in excess of £132 500. Although a large proportion of this (£52 000) was attributed to savings from the efficient heating system, the savings from waste and the rebates for recyclables can be directly attributed to the positive environmental behaviour of staff. Therefore, the total savings that can be attributed to changes in workforce behaviour were just over £80 000, with a saving of £49 711.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<sec id="section22-0734242X12455087">
<title>Effectiveness of the interventionist techniques</title>
<p>Posters were found to be the most effective means of providing knowledge to the workforce. However, they were less effective at changing behaviour, which is the opposite of what was found by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0734242X12455087">Bankole et al. (2004)</xref>. The positioning of the posters was found to be an important factor, as posters placed on notice boards, such as those of the environmental team, were seen by fewer employees, which does support the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0734242X12455087">Bankole et al. (2004)</xref>. By contrast, posters placed within the toilets reached a far greater proportion of the workforce. Training on the other hand was the most effective tool at changing attitudes. Indeed, some employees stated that whereas the training had not provided them with increased knowledge it had changed their attitude towards the importance of resource efficiency. This is similar to findings by Perron et al. (2005) who also found that training did not improve knowledge significantly. Finally, the key benefits of the environmental team were in the engagement and support of the workforce. Although the team was not identified as being the first point of contact for environmental queries, it is believed that a lack of knowledge of who the environmental officers were was the limiting factor in this. If the team was to remain in place for a further 12 months, and was promoted throughout the company through various media, it is believed that their impact would have increased. In addition, it was also evident that the higher the status of the officer, the more likely they were to be listened to and respected.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section23-0734242X12455087">
<title>Individual versus combined interventions</title>
<p>The findings suggest that on their own the interventions employed had mixed results at changing attitudes, beliefs and behaviours, and enhancing knowledge and awareness. For example, the posters and training sessions did help to improve knowledge and awareness. However, the environmental officers were for the most part viewed with suspicion, their instructions were ignored, and they were given very limited support by their colleagues and managers. It is important therefore for the success of the interventions employed to be set within the context of key influencing factors such as the support of senior managers and the time that staff had for example, to attend training. Thus, it can be argued that if for example, there had been more support provided by senior managers for more sustainable practices by the company, the interventions might have been more successful.</p>
<p>However, targeted use of a combination of interventionist approaches did result in reductions in the quantity of waste being generated and energy being consumed. Indeed, similarly to previous studies, the findings suggest that the three main techniques used, namely training, awareness building and the environmental team all realized benefits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0734242X12455087">Grodzinska-Jurczak et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0734242X12455087">Johansson and Magnusson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0734242X12455087">Remmen and Lorentzen, 2000</xref>). This integrated system resulted in benefits greater than would have been experienced had one technique been implemented in isolation. In addition, similar to previous studies, the findings suggest the importance of senior managers in order to improve environmental performance within the company (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0734242X12455087">Norcia, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0734242X12455087">Roberts, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0734242X12455087">Sanchez, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition, the attitudes of the staff towards environmental management also significantly increased. For example, beliefs in the benefits of resource efficiency for preserving the environment improved from 47 to 95%.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section24-0734242X12455087">
<title>Cost-effectiveness of the interventionist techniques</title>
<p>Over the course of the project, the case study company realized savings in excess of £132 000. This meant that over the course of the research they had increased their profits by £49 711 through environmental initiatives. The cost savings and environmental benefits realized during the research supports the theory that using a combination of interventionist techniques can achieve improved efficiencies in companies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0734242X12455087">Defra, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0734242X12455087">EEF, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0734242X12455087">Envirowise, 2009a</xref>;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0734242X12455087">b</xref>). Thus, the findings suggest that improved resource efficiency can deliver both financial and environmental benefits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0734242X12455087">Roberts, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0734242X12455087">Welford, 1998</xref>). The systems that were put in place (e.g. increased number of bins) were all relatively ‘simple’ and inexpensive. Thus, this demonstrates that such measures can lead to improvements. Whether more expensive and fundamental technological change would have led to increased savings would require further study. However, such changes would evidently require the support of senior managers if they were to be implemented successfully.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The UK construction and demolition sector accounts for approximately 32% of all waste generated. Studies suggest that companies can spend around 5% of their turnover on wastage. Thus, an understanding of how to minimize waste and how to maximize recovery of value is crucial. The findings from this study suggest that through the use of a combination of targeted interventionist approaches, greater resource efficiency is possible and significant financial and environmental savings can be realized within companies in the construction sector. However, it is important to note that this was a case study of a small company and thus it is difficult to extrapolate the findings across the entire sector. Therefore further research on the long-term sustainability of the interventions would be needed, as it is possible that gains realized in this study may be in the short or medium term only, with any long-term benefits possibly requiring significant and continual input of resources. It is important to also mention that similarly to the assertions of Tang <italic>et al.</italic> (2010), the interventions were ‘successful’ due to the wider contextual UK framework of environmental policies and legislation that encouraged change. Thus, the success of corporate interventions for improved environmental sustainability evidently requires a holistic and strategic approach, within the organization and within a supportive wider policy and legislative context. It is only in this way that there can be greater conservation of resources, costs savings and wider efficiencies realized.</p>
