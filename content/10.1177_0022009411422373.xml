<p>(N.S. Krushchev, on 3 September 1959, at the American National Exhibition in Moscow’s Sokolniki Park.)</p></disp-quote>
<p>The single most important source of self legitimacy (and of the legitimacy of the ambitious projects of social transformation towards ‘Socialism’ and, then, ‘Communism’) in the ruling Communist elites of Cold War era Russia and East Central Europe was a thoroughly modernist master narrative: the Marxian theory of social formations. As is well known (and can be read in the <italic>Communist Manifesto</italic>, or in the <italic>German Ideology</italic>, as well as in thousands of Marxist–Leninist textbooks of historical materialism, political economy, or scientific socialism), this narrative tried to bring meaning and order into the history of mankind through its focus upon the production and reproduction of material life and upon what was deemed to have been the most crucial of all social relations: the ownership of the means of production. On these grounds it developed an understanding of history as a linear progress consisting of major consecutive stages of development, where each stage (social formation) distinguished itself as a ‘mode of production’ defined first of all by its ownership relations. ‘Primitive communism’ was followed by slavery which gave way to feudalism. The latter came to be undermined, crushed and replaced by capitalism, which was said to have been the most dynamic one of all modes of production based on private ownership. Within the capitalist social formation, productive forces develop not only rapidly but also to levels where production is turned into a highly complex set of mutually dependent social activities, the management and coordination of which call more and more for social (collective) coordination. The tension thus generated – or, putting it in the doctrine’s own vocabulary, the ‘antagonistic contradiction between the social nature of production on the one hand, and private appropriation, on the other’, was what socialism was to come to solve, by the expropriation of the expropriators, that is, by introducing collective socialist ownership of the means of production. Socialism was still not the end of the story (and certainly not the ‘End of History’); rather, the suggestion was that socialism constituted a transitory phase between capitalism and communism. The necessity of such a transitory phase or formation was explained by reference to the fact that the forces of production had still remained to be developed to a level where they could secure the assertion of the Communist principle of distribution (‘to each according to his/her needs’) – the dreamworld, where no one would become a captive of the social division of labour and everyone could freely develop her/his human capabilities and creativity. Providing the elites with a sense of meaning and direction, the significance of this discourse on social formations and, most importantly, socialism’s place in it, should not be underestimated.</p>
<p>In February 1958, the Political Bureau of the Hungarian Socialist Workers’ Party was discussing the plans for Hungary’s pavilion at the Brussels world’s fair, Expo ’58, that was to open in just two months’ time.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0022009411422373">2</xref></sup> Central Committee Secretary Gyula Kállai was furious about the conspicuous absence of ‘socialism’ from Hungary’s exhibits. Not only the art to be displayed but also the various goods produced by various Hungarian industries had failed to carry unmistakable markers of their origin – they were not recognizable as products of socialism. Kállai’s comrades, however, saw no reason to worry. They did not believe there was such a thing as a ‘socialist sweater’ and emphasized that if Hungarian textile industries wished to export their sweaters they should better consider the taste of the Western consumer. The discussion reveals some of the defining historical tensions of the Communist project of socialism: the urge to assert, in discursive as well as in other fields of social practices, the autonomous, exceptional and superior nature of socialist society in comparison to and distinction from capitalism (whence the demand to display ‘socialist sweaters’ came) and, at the same time, to bring about a development in the countries of state socialism that promised not only to close the sizeable developmental gap between East and West but also to enable socialism to beat capitalism in terms of technological, economic and welfare dynamics. Paradoxically, all this emphasized not merely the relative backwardness of the socialist countries but, more importantly, the deep embeddedness of the socialist project in (capitalist) modernity and the profound unity of the <italic>modern</italic> world, systemic and national-cultural divisions notwithstanding.</p>
<p>This thematic issue is the work of a group of scholars who decided to utilize the complex and rich experience of international fairs and exhibitions in order to improve our understanding of cultural, social and political interaction across the systemic divide between the social orders construed as ‘capitalism’ and ‘socialism’ in the cold war era. Looking through the windows of international fairs, we were confident that we would be able to contribute to a truly trans-national and trans-systemic cultural history of the state-socialist project from its early and ambitious beginnings, through its crisis in the 1970s, to its demise in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Engaging issues pertinent to projects, ambitions and designs, as well as perceptions and reception among elites and lower classes, <italic>Sites of Convergence</italic> was launched to yield new insights into (and solidly founded assessments of) the cultural interaction between the two ‘world systems’ confronting one another in the cold war.</p>
<p>The results we are reporting now constitute a promising beginning in the pursuance of these high ambitions. For even if much of the agenda remains to be effected, we now are able to show that international fairs were indeed major sites of interaction between different nations and systemic ‘camps’: an interaction out of which no side could come entirely unaffected. They were ‘sites of convergence’ in the admittedly (and deliberately) ambiguous, contradictory sense that they promoted the mutual assimilation of norms, values and standards, at the same time as they prompted with renewed force the efforts among the elites of state socialism to articulate and assert the distinct and independent nature of socialist modernity. In our discussions,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0022009411422373">3</xref></sup> the idea occurred that it should be more fruitful to approach Cold War era international fairs as sites of cultural hybridization or transfer between the various participants, for the metaphor of ‘convergence’ might be suggestive of a linear, mechanical movement in a predefined direction (even though much of the more sophisticated ‘convergence-theory’ literature of the 1960s and 1970s did in fact perceive convergence as a process propelled partly by a give-and-take exchange). The problem with the hybridization metaphor, however, is that it takes it for granted that the Soviet-type socialist experiment had indeed managed to create a social-cultural order which constituted a genuine <italic>Sonderweg,</italic> an autonomous challenge to capitalist modernity – after all, you cannot ‘hybridize’ without having two autochtonous entities at hand. Thus, talking of hybridization precludes one of the most important questions with regard to state socialism: did the socialist experiment really manage to assert an alternative modernity, a genuine variant of modernity obeying its own distinctive norms, values and economic and sociological regularities? I feel that there is no good reason for us to consider this issue closed and that we need a conceptual apparatus that opens up the issue for discussion and empirical scrutiny rather than closes it down and considers it done with.</p>
<p>The study of world’s fairs and international exhibitions has a long tradition.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0022009411422373">4</xref></sup> Even Cold War era fairs have received increasing attention since 1989. The work of R.H. Haddow on the projection through major exhibitions, of American ideas of well-being and good society, is a relatively recent example,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0022009411422373">5</xref></sup> as is the January 2007 symposium on Cold War expositions at the Royal College of Art, London.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0022009411422373">6</xref></sup> W.L. Hixson’s <italic>Parting the Curtain</italic> includes an illuminating discussion on the Soviet–US exchange of exhibitions in 1958-9, and Susan E. Reid’s essays on the US exhibition (and, most importantly, its official as well as popular reception) in Moscow in 1959 are also important.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0022009411422373">7</xref></sup> There is another work to be mentioned from Susan E. Reid’s pen: her piece on the <italic>Art of Socialist Countries</italic> exhibition in Moscow 1958-9, which assesses, on the basis of the visitors’ books, how Central and East European art on display contributed to the expansion of the horizons of legitimate socialist art in the USSR and promoted ‘the arguments of Soviet reformists that socialist modernity required an artistic rapprochement with figurative modernism in the form of a “contemporary style”’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0022009411422373">8</xref></sup> Katherine Pence’s work on the Leipzig Trade Fairs of the 1950s shows both the high official aspirations of GDR power elites and the unintended popular appropriations of these fairs as sites and occasions to critique the regime and even as arenas of illicit behaviour (among others, prostitution).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0022009411422373">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>However valuable these beginnings are, the study of Cold War era Communist fairs and exhibitions is still in its infancy.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0022009411422373">10</xref></sup> The specific platform and focus of <italic>Sites of Convergence</italic> was meant to improve this situation not only as an extension of experience considered (by studying fairs hitherto unexplored), but also by enabling us to take a fresh look at relatively well-known fairs from new angles: for example, there had been Western accounts of the Soviet pavilion at the Brussels Expo ’58, but we knew precious little about Soviet plans and design for this expo, not to mention the Soviets’ actual experience in Brussels; the same applies to the Czechoslovak or Hungarian pavilion and presence at Brussels and at other world’s fairs of the Cold War era (New York 1964–5, Montreal 1967, Osaka 1970, or Vancouver 1986).</p>
<p>Cold War era international fairs constitute a fascinating and intellectually attractive phenomenon, as all modern and late modern era fairs do, and partly for the same reason: their impressive complexity. They too can be seen, read and experienced as a set of major national statements presented at the same site and carried by a combination of aesthetic form-languages, technologies, architectural and other artefacts, audio-visual and/or printed communicative acts, theatres, carnivals and other more or less deliberately planned and meticulously scheduled and choreographed events. While often careful to bring onto display some cherished idiosyncrasies (whether it is the ‘Hungarian Kitchen’ [cuisine], the Viennese operetta, Bulgarian rose oil, or the culture of the American ‘Wild West’), these national statements tend to engage and speak to a number of common issues put on the agenda by the <italic>Zeitgeist</italic>: issues of modernity, development, traditions and authenticity. They also share the urge to project fantasies of future, including the fantasy and hope for the national capability of mastering the future.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0022009411422373">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>On the other hand, what sets the Cold War era <italic>state-socialist</italic> fairs and exhibitions/pavilions apart is an additional layer of complications: <italic>the systemic dimension</italic>. The fairs and exhibits covered by <italic>Sites of Convergence</italic> witnessed the encounters and interaction between national cultures as much as between system-related representations, projections, perceptions, understandings and meanings. They were sites of ‘peaceful co-existence’ and rivalries between countries as well as between <italic>capitalism</italic> and <italic>socialism</italic>, which was particularly conspicuous in the case of the two Germanies, as is shown by Katherine Pence’s and Greg Castillo’s essays in this issue. Indeed, national virtues and achievements tended to be seen as means promoting objectives of systemic self-assertion and ego-tripping, and vice versa – typically systemic features (market economy, high values attached to individual consumer’s choice, or extensive public ownership, generous social institutions, full employment, etc.) were oftentimes appropriated and deployed as elements of national narratives of success and progress. Moreover, as Greg Castillo argues, for the designer of West Germany’s pavilion in Brussels, distinguishing the German West from the East was as important as distancing West Germany’s present from Germany’s Nazi past. In many cases we find the urgent need to rid a country from stereotypes sticking to it even though, it was deemed, they had been obsolete for long – as a published account for the successes of the Hungarian pavilion of Expo ’58 revealed: ‘We had to prove to the world that we were no longer a country of wranglers and <italic>gulyás</italic> [the Hungarian goulash soup]. Even though it is true that we still have our excellent cuisine, our wonderful gypsy music, and our world famous wines, in the meantime we have become a developed industrial country’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0022009411422373">12</xref></sup> To mark a departure from an embarrassing and/or compromising past, whether this past was an inhuman political regime (like Hitler’s in Germany or Mátyás Rákosi’s in Hungary, as is shown in contributions on the German and the Hungarian pavilions at Expo ’58 to this issue), socio-economic backwardness, or ‘capitalism’, was often a prime objective of national participants in various international fairs.</p>
<p>In the studies planned within the frameworks of this project, we intended to include cases of socialist participation in some of the most important world fairs of the period, such as the Brussels Expo ’58, New York 1964–5 and Montreal 1967, as well as cases where socialist countries hosted such fairs, such as, for example, the regular trade fairs of Brno, Budapest, Leipzig, Plovdiv or Poznan, or the World Exhibition of Hunting, Budapest, 1971. In the event, it proved possible to cover much of the experience of Expo ’58 and only a few other cases.</p>
<p>Because of the complexity of the phenomenon itself and because of the multidisciplinary composition of our team, we deliberately abstained from the imposition of a unitary conceptual and methodological design. We share many of the questions and the general problematic, but we attacked these common issues from a number of distinctly disciplinary platforms that have been established for the study of cultural life within the fields of modern history, history of architecture, and history of art and design. In spite of the great extent of conceptual and methodological discretion, contributors to <italic>Sites of Convergence</italic> have been fully aware of the four main conceptual avenues along which we approached and analysed international fairs of the Cold War era.</p>
<p>Our fairs can be envisaged and understood as <italic>sites of encounters</italic>, where different cultures (and different cultural- and social-political projects) meet one another, and where <italic>rivalry, confrontation and contestation</italic> take place. In the case so perceptively analysed by Danilo Udovicki-Selb in this issue, the 1937 Paris world’s fair became the site of the confrontation of two inhuman modernities – Hitler’s and Stalin’s. Another example could be the Brussels Expo ’58, which, contemporary observers believed, was turned ‘into an architectural rutting ground between the superpowers’ by the Soviet and American pavilions. The former featured not only the recent climax of Soviet technological and scientific progress, the Sputnik, which is the subject discussed in detail by Lewis Siegelbaum in his contribution to this issue, but also an architectural design which abandoned the form language of ‘classical’, Stalinist socialist realism. The American pavilion, on the other hand, placed ‘a premium on light, strength, and freedom’, with its circular, transparent (open) design.</p>
<p>Systemic rivalries often targeted third parties rather than the public of one-Self or of the systemic Other. Self-representations of the West and/or of the Soviet Bloc intended to speak to the <italic>developing world</italic> at least as much as to the populations and elites of one another. Katherine Pence’s essay in this issue shows quite clearly that the staging of and participation in international fairs was a continuation of diplomacy by other means. In bringing a trade fair to Cairo, East German aspirations to break the isolation of the GDR were as or even more important than the desire to enter the markets of the developing world – and the West German efforts to counteract the GDR in Egypt were exerted on behalf of the whole Western World, to save what still could be saved politically in the aftermath of the Suez War and Nasser’s revolution. The triangular relationship between ‘East’, ‘West’ and the ‘Third World’ is, even in cultural studies, a relatively new, upcoming topic of research, and international exhibitions are certainly a rewarding empirical platform from where to approach it. Organizers of the 1971 World Exhibition of Hunting in Budapest went out of their way to secure, through various subventions, a large scale presence of the developing countries of Africa, Asia and Latin America, in order, among other things, to leave visiting and exhibiting professionals from these countries with the impression that ‘a truly rational and highly developed wild life management and environmental protection, in accordance with the interests of the whole society, can only be possible under socialist conditions’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0022009411422373">13</xref></sup> Here we should mention the special case of Tito’s Yugoslavia, emerging as an animating force of the Non-Aligned Movement, not much later to become so important in the decolonizing ‘Third World’: a Communist country, yet excluded from the Soviet Bloc, the Yugoslavs’ Brussels pavilion, as is ably discussed in this issue by Vladimir Kulić, clearly reflected the in-between position in a number of dimensions of Titoist socialism at the time. They found themselves between the ideological blocs of the Cold War, between the political and economic systems of capitalism and Soviet-type state socialism, and between modernity and tradition.</p>
<p>Another important aspect is the contestation over the <italic>genre</italic> of the international fair itself. To refer to the opening quotation, the words of N. S. Khrushchev, one of the questions lurking all the time in the minds of those arranging international fairs and exhibitions was to what extent the state-socialist regimes managed to stage exhibitions that ‘their people (and peoples under capitalism) were really interested in’? Due to the paramount position of systemic relativism in the discourses of state-socialist regimes,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0022009411422373">14</xref></sup> we could safely expect to find claims on behalf of Communist elites (and, sometimes, even among the commoners) according to which their ‘socialist fairs’ were superior to the ‘capitalist fairs’,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0022009411422373">15</xref></sup> with arguments about who served ‘the working people’ and who manipulated them in order to make higher profits, etc. It may even be the case, as Mary Neuburger asserts in her contribution to this issue, that a number of socialist fairs (like the Plovdiv fairs in the 1960s and 1970s) could credibly present a spectacle that spoke directly to the people, offered them an enjoyable entertainment and included them in ‘a realistic and restrained system of consumption, to which most could aspire’, instead of teasing their desires with unattainable goods such as Harley Davidson motorbikes or eighty mile an hour powerboats. <italic>Kebabche</italic> may have held some magic power over Bulgarians who managed to resist the temptation to go over to hotdog. Hungarians, however, traded their <italic>fasírozott</italic> (the Hungarian meatball) for hotdog and, even more, for hamburger with little hesitation during the 1970s and 1980s.</p>
<p>Fairs with socialist pavilions and/or with socialist hosts constitute a prime subject for cultural analysis because they were also major <italic>sites of identity formation</italic>. Self-representations and projections (constructions of the Self) can and should be analysed in tandem with perceptions and understandings of the (systemic and/or other kinds of) Other. We are not talking of a confrontation of entirely distinct and contrasting images, even less about the confrontation between images that had been set once and for ever at a certain point of time (e.g., when Churchill made his ‘Sinews of Peace’ speech or when the Cominform was established and it declared the ‘two-camps division’ of the world). We are talking about the interactive process of yielding and shaping, producing and reproducing these images within the frameworks of the fairs, not only by way of the ‘messages’ issued through the aesthetic choices made, architectural design selected, artefacts displayed, arrangements/programs of information and amusement offered, etc., but also by way of the <italic>reception</italic> of these messages and the appropriation of the opportunities offered (deliberately or not) by the fairs. In his analysis of the Soviet deployment of the Sputnik in Brussels in 1958, included in this issue, Lewis Siegelbaum rightly points out the importance of distinguishing between these different phases of a performance at a fair. While a fair as a whole or one or another of its exhibits/pavilions and their contents, displays, programmes, etc., can be meticulously planned and designed in accordance with a pre-defined political and/or artistic project, the way in which different audiences/visitors will ‘read’ and interpret these messages can never fully be planned, even less foreseen. This was a well-known problem with the Budapest or the Leipzig International Fairs, for example. Socialist Hungary’s satirical magazine, <italic>Ludas Matyi</italic>, regularly lampooned the Fairs for showing the latest consumer goods of ‘international class’ from socialist industries, to evoke only frustration among the fairs’ domestic visitors, to whom those goods would hardly ever become accessible in the shops.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0022009411422373">16</xref></sup> Thus, the consequence of the show was not only unintended but also the very opposite of what was deemed politically desirable. The Budapest International Fair went down in the urban folklore of Budapest as a site where lies about a ‘socialist consumers’ paradise’ were made tangible. This is, of course, not at all to suggest that major international fairs and exhibitions were the scenes where socialist countries only embarrassed themselves. As in several of the cases we discuss, such events boosted considerably the image of a country and its political regime both in the eyes of their domestic and foreign publics. Even if the 1937 Soviet pavilion was indeed meant to replace reality with illusion, and everyday life with myth, as Udovicki-Selb argues in this issue, it also got an enthusiastic reception by the Parisian public, due not least to Vera Muhina’s statue, the couple (a peasant woman and a factory worker man), topping the pavilion, and to the messianic mood generated by the increasing threats of war and the prolonged economic recession in the background. Udovicki-Selb quotes the critic of the conservative art magazine Beaux-Arts claiming that there was in Muhina’s couple ‘an answer to the many painful questions that assail, at this hour, all those who live and suffer’. The 1971 Budapest World Exhibition of Hunting, to give another example, was a major national success for the host, socialist Hungary – several hundreds of pages of guest books tell about an upsurge of national pride over ‘little Hungary’s’ great performance as a ‘leading nation’ in terms of wild life management and environmental conservation. The exhibition, from the first days of initiating and planning the project, created ample opportunities for socialist Hungary’s professions related to forestry and wild-life management to reach out to their international (Western) peers, get accepted and included by the international (Western) professional communities. Even the country’s political elites got an opportunity to harvest some of the fruits of the relaxations introduced by their reform-Communism and rub shoulders with the political and social elites (including representatives of the aristocracy) of Western Europe, on the basis of their shared and profound interest in hunting. The Czechoslovak pavilion at the Expo ’58 in Brussels, discussed in great detail by Cathleen Giustino in this issue, was the single most successful pavilion reaping an impressive harvest of medals and prizes. As Paulina Bren shows in her contribution, the reception of the Czechoslovak and Cuban pavilions in the Montreal Expo ’67 was that these pavilions offered a ‘view of Communism as culturally specific, not monolithic’. While the Cuban show depicted the Communist revolution ‘as fun and psychedelic instead of serious and drab’, the Czechoslovak one emphasized, instead of conducting the usual Eastern European propaganda, that the country’s culture had been part of the Western European heritage. It seems, then, that in most of the cases when socialist performance at international fairs impressed, this was due to domestic and/or ‘bloc-wide’ political-social developments that brought liberal and more professionally oriented groups of the elites to the fore in these countries – groups who were less eager to maintain socialist exceptionalism and confrontation with capitalism than to sustain universal modern values and to keep their country within the ecumene of modernity.</p>
<p>Socialist fairs, just as other fairs, were <italic>sites of negotiation, diffusion and transfers</italic>. They also performed the basic role out of which modern era fairs emerged: they were <italic>market places</italic> where goods, technological know-how, licences, services, etc. were sold and bought. Thus, they greatly contributed to the diffusion and transfer of new products, new technologies, new knowledge, new patterns of organization and creativity. Moreover, hand in hand with the exchanges of information and commodities went the negotiated diffusion across national and systemic boundaries of norms, values and standards of industrial, economic, professional and artistic activities exercising, again, a significant impact upon processes of identity formation in all participating countries. A perusal of Leipzig’s <italic>Messemagazin international (Das Magazin für den Ost-West Handel)</italic> reveals plenty of considerable adjustments in terms of choices of topics, photos, style and design made by the editors in accordance with their understanding of what their (Western) clients might expect – adjustments that were not entirely in keeping with the officially sanctioned ‘public taste’ in the GDR.</p>
<p>Last but not least, fairs hosted by socialist countries and/or fairs with socialist exhibits can also be seen and conceived as <italic>sites of convergence</italic>. For one thing, they provided platforms where representatives of the two Cold-War regimes came physically close to (converged on) one another and interacted. Even more importantly, this interaction and the mutual impact of West and East upon one another promoted tendencies of systemic convergence. Increasingly with time, these fairs tended to reveal that the attempt by the state-socialist project to create a <italic>civilization</italic> alternative to capitalism had been a pathetic failure. Cultural, political and ideological variations notwithstanding, at a higher level of abstraction, the message of these fairs could be nothing but the assertion of the global (supra-systemic) nature of the standards and norms that apply not only to technological, scientific, industrial and general economic progress and success, but also to what one can conceive of as decent living standards and, in general, a decent good life in the modern world.</p>
<p>It will require another project to explore the ways and means Communist elites resorted to in their efforts to absorb and cope with all the uncertainty and angst that this tendency of convergence must have given rise to.</p>
