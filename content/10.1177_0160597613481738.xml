<p>Michelle Alexander’s book, <italic>The New Jim Crow</italic>, offers a hard-hitting, unabashed look at the U.S. criminal justice system and the harsh realities of contemporary racism that folks of color face in America, particularly African American men. As a legal scholar, Alexander is well equipped with the expertise to closely and critically examine what may be the biggest hidden injury to our society since the Civil Rights Movement in the mid-twentieth century. And indeed, she does not disappoint with this book.</p>
<p>Alexander’s thesis is straightforward and to the point. Previous forms of racial control that were prevalent during U.S. apartheid are alive and well in America today. Whereas in the past racial control included de jure segregation, legally sanctioned or overlooked lynching, and other forms of physical and mental violence, Alexander argues that racial control today is perpetuated largely through the U.S. criminal justice system. It is done so in two ways. First, African American men are frequently targeted as criminals. As a result, not only does the United States currently possess the highest rate of incarceration in the Western world—750 people are in prison for every 100,000 adults and children—but a significant proportion of that population is African American and male. Among the most outstanding and utterly shivering statistics that Alexander mentions in her book is the fact that the U.S. “imprisons a larger percentage of its black population than South Africa did at the height of apartheid” (p. 7). In some places, the figures are truly staggering. In Washington, DC, for example, it is estimated that three of the four African American males will be incarcerated at some point in their lives.</p>
<p>The second way in which the U.S. criminal justice system functions as a contemporary system of racial control is through the denial of basic human rights for individuals who end up stigmatized as felons. Thus, as Alexander notes, old forms of discrimination in education, employment, and housing are now “legal” against those who have been incarcerated. The U.S. legal system, criminal justice system, and prison industrial complex are what Alexander label the “New Jim Crow” that help maintain a racial caste and serves to control, segregate, and discriminate against minorities in America. To be painfully clear, such a system systematically and permanently marginalizes African Americans men.</p>
<p>The book is well documented and well written. Having pleasantly read through the book several times, I cannot but help to note the readability of the book—certainly it was written for a wider audience than academics. There is hardly any jargon and what little there is well defined and explained. Like a well-armed surgeon, Alexander swiftly dissects and examines how racialized social control currently operates in the United States and compares and contrasts it with the system that was in place during U.S. apartheid. The result is six well-crafted chapters that detail everything from racialized legislation such as the War on Drugs to debunking the myth that rates of African American imprisonment can be explained by crime rates. Chapter 6 is arguably the most important chapter in the book and its ultimate tour de force. It is in this chapter that Alexander reflects on what the New Jim Crow means for the future of racism and human rights issues in the United States. For those of us searching for the key to solving colorblind racism, it does not lie solely in educating folks, nor does it do us any good to organize against racial practices of the past (e.g., overt manifestations of racism). Indeed, Alexander argues that a new civil rights movement needs to be organized in a way that is specific to the current and prevailing racial practices that exist in our society. Such a movement, she notes, needs to be well versed in both the colorblind rhetoric and practices of our society and our collective denial on the racial practices of yesterday and today. It also needs to be based in honest conversations about race. Ultimately, the most important point that Alexander makes about ending the injustices of the current system of mass incarceration is to embrace a much larger (human rights) movement that decries white privilege (or what Alexander refers to as “racial bribes”) and advocates for the collective interests of all.</p>
<p>As a human rights and antiracism advocate, I find this book a useful tool in debunking current myths about race and incarceration. As a sociologist, however, I note that social science race scholars have long examined issues of racism and mass incarceration in the United States. Indeed, academics such as Bruce Western and Mary Patillo have argued for decades about both the pervasive myths surrounding contemporary ideas of race and crime and the racial disparities of our prison system. In terms of race theories, scholars such as Eduardo Bonilla-Silva (New Racism, Colorblind Racism), Lawrence Bobo (Laissez Faire Racism), Joe R. Feagin (Systemic Racism, White Racial Frame), and Michael Omi and Howard Winant (Racial Formation Theory) have spent their academic careers exploring how current racial practices in the United States are nothing more than old perfume in a new bottle. Indeed, even the call for a major social movement as a way to dismantle the current American racial structure is not a new clarion call—Bonilla-Silva first stressed the need for a new Civil Rights movement in his <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0160597613481738">2006</xref> book, <italic>Racism without Racists.</italic> Such a movement, Bonilla-Silva argued, needed to recognize colorblind racial practices for what it is and have a goal oriented to dismantling not individual prejudice, but systemic racism.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, Alexander’s book is notable because of its straightforwardness and its readability. More than ever, we need scholars who are able to reach outside the realm of academia and touch folks who are able to affect policy: the social commentators, the politicians, and those who are able to directly impact policy changes. Further, Alexander brings to the table more than just theories about how race and racism operate in the post–Civil Rights era. Indeed, <italic>The New Jim Crow</italic> highlights specifically how mass incarceration serves as the central form of racial control in the twenty-first century.</p>
<p>In summary, Alexander has written a book worthy of all of our attention, especially those of us who are advocates of human rights issues and racism in the United States. It is worthy of our attention because for the first time, here is a book that speaks not to theoretical arm-chair and ivory tower bound academics, but rather to those of us who engage in social change—the activists, the policy makers, and the public. For those of us who are teacher-scholars, this book is a must read for students interested in whiteness studies, economics, international law, human rights, political sociology, Critical Race Theory, and race and ethnic relations in the twenty-first century.</p>
