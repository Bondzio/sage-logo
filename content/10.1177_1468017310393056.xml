<p>• <italic>Summary</italic>: Multicultural modern society shows the necessity for a systematic assessment of needs and the formulation of policies which are based on rigorous and systematic research. Specifically, in Spain juvenile penal justice represents one of the major contexts where the presence of cultural diversity has made itself forcefully felt. This situation has led to an ongoing reappraisal of the way in which the forms of conflict management which currently form part of the Spanish Juvenile Penal Code are applied. This article represents an attempt to take a closer look at the way mediation is used as a policy alternative in the penal context, and in particular how it is used in situations when one part of the process involves a young immigrant. We focus on the meaning attributed to penal mediation from the perspective of the victim or the offender and on the difficulties in applying mediation programs among young immigrants.</p>
<p>• <italic>Findings</italic>: This analysis shows the presence of several asymmetries in intercultural mediation and suggests the importance of intercultural communication in mediation.</p>
<p>• <italic>Application</italic>: We aim to develop a more comprehensive framework in order to improve the way such processes are implemented in practice, paying special attention to the possible application of mediation in other contexts.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1468017310393056" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>The list of policy alternatives has expanded considerably in recent decades. Many of the new alternatives which are now available have their origin in new definitions of ‘deviance’ and changes in the meaning and interpretation attached to situations where some form or other of social conflict is involved. In particular, the concept of conflict has itself been redefined in a variety of ways and from a number of different perspectives. The term structural violence has been developed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1468017310393056">Galtung, 1985</xref>) at the same time as we have seen paradigmatic changes in the way in which the processes of conflict resolution are handled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1468017310393056">Entelman, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1468017310393056">Fried, 2000</xref>). Further examples would be the meaning currently associated with the concept of security, which is now intrinsically linked to a perspective of human development or the new discourses which have arisen around the idea of the ‘risk society’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1468017310393056">Beck, 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1468017310393056">2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1468017310393056">Giddens, 2000</xref>). Such changes have meant that there has been a constant revision and updating of the points of reference used in the construction of meaning and in understanding and interpreting situations of conflict.</p>
<p>The origin of such changes is not exclusively to be found on the conceptual level. The processes of demographic change have inherently involved a substantial increase in cultural diversity in many societies and these changes in and of themselves have inevitably produced an increased level of complexity in social interaction. Under these circumstances the increasing potential for situations of conflict to arise on the basis of the differences in meaning the various social actors attribute to the situation, or the differences in values, attitudes and behaviour which are associated with a wide variety of social and cultural practices create both a challenge and an opportunity for advancement and social development. The wide variety of individual differences that are to be found in modern society produce a continuing need for a more explicit elaboration of criteria, norms, rules, laws, etc. The process of social interaction itself brings with it the constant possibility of conflict and society of necessity needs to furnish itself with mechanisms which facilitate the speedy and effective resolution of such conflicts.</p>
<p>Both in the context of formal education itself and in the more general arena of social action the educational intervention has had to integrate with and reflect over possible responses to this increasing social complexity. In this sense the social response to the situation of young offenders has been constantly changing as new principles of equity have been incorporated, and as the need has grown to offer real opportunities to make integration processes a genuine reality for those whose marginalization and poverty configure their daily lives. The study here summarized was an attempt to analyze the use of mediation as a strategy for conflict management in the juvenile penal environment. In addition, allowance has been made for the changing typology of juvenile offenders, given the presence of differing cultural perspectives, through the analysis of the influence that such changes are having on the strategies applied.</p>
<p>In the present article the theoretical context which informs the policy framework is initially addressed, as well as the way in which this is applied in the juvenile justice context. Following this, the design of the research itself is explained together with the results obtained.</p>
<p>The objective of this article is to reflect, in a way which is backed by solid research, on the need to develop less punitive and more educative alternatives in the context of social conflict resolution, as well as the opportunities which such alternatives offer in our current complex and diverse reality.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-1468017310393056"><title>Current perspectives on positive conflict management</title>
<p>Given the fact that conflicts form a constant and intrinsic part of inter-personal relations, it is important to be aware that cultural norms are not universal givens across human societies. Both the perception which may be held of conflictive situations and the strategies which may be adopted to resolve them differ according to the perspective the individual has on any given reality.</p>
<p>The modern judicial system, for example, is one of the most representative forms of social conflict management. At the same time it is an institution which has been in a process of continuous evolution throughout its entire history, and the most recent challenges presented by increased diversity are no exception here. In particular we have steadily moved towards a system which incorporates a conception of positive conflict management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1468017310393056">Entelman, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1468017310393056">Fried, 2000</xref>), one that attempts to overcome the idea that punishment is the only possible route to the maintenance of social cohesion. New conceptions of conflict management have had an impact on both the characterization and the understanding of conflict, and consequently on the strategies deployed for resolving them.</p>
<p>Conflict, in fact, may be seen as forming a <italic>natural</italic> part of human relations. Its perception is in large measure conditioned by the cultural and social heritage of the individual. Conflict situations may develop following either a positive or a negative dynamic, and their resolution may become either a process of enrichment or an experience characterized by erosion and disequilibrium. Mediation may be conceived of as one possible strategy among others, as a strategy which may be considered to offer considerable opportunities in the potential it embodies for ensuring that the outcome of the conflict management process is a positive one, in particular in multicultural contexts.</p>
<p>The mediation process, however, does present the inherent difficulty that it is susceptible to application biases in the penal context. The very existence of both an aggressor and a victim creates an asymmetry between the two parties which does not self-evidently favour the search for solutions based on dialogue. Despite this, mediation does offer some very clear advantages when compared with other methods available within the present penal justice process. In the first place, the individuals involved assume the leading role in the process. In many cases a strict application of the penal code not only fails to truly resolve the conflict; it also re-victimizes both the aggressor and the victim. In the second place the existence of a dialogue between the parties tends to lower tension in conflicts which embody a clear emotional component thus allowing for the possibility that the need to defuse subsequent confrontations may be addressed comprehensively.</p>
<p>In addition, the voluntary nature of the mediation process solicits in and of itself a personal commitment to the search for solutions and to the acceptance of corrective or reparative measures as a way of compensating for possible harm caused. Thus, despite the existence of a number of evident inherent limitations, mediation should clearly be considered to be an interesting and potentially useful alternative, in whole or in part, to the other forms of retributive action on which the penal system is currently based. In this sense it is hardly surprising that the General Assembly of the United Nations recommends mediation as a strategy in conflict resolution:<disp-quote>
<p>Informal processes for conflict resolution, including mediation, arbitration and justice or native practices should be used as and when necessary in order to facilitate conciliation and reparation for harm suffered by victims. (Paragraph 7, Resolution 40/34 of 29 November, United Nations, 1985)</p></disp-quote></p>
<sec id="sec3-1468017310393056"><title>Intercultural mediation</title>
<p>Mediation is a positive conflict management strategy that is based on communication and dialogue, and is normally achieved via the intervention and participation of a third party in a way which allows the two parties in a conflict to be brought together. In particular, mediation can be defined as negotiation carried out with the aid of a third party (the mediator) who does not act as either referee or judge, given that the mediator does not have the power to impose a result on the parties to the conflict (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1468017310393056">Rozenblum, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>There are two broad traditions for conceptualizing mediation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1468017310393056">Vinyamata, 2001</xref>). On the one hand, there is the Anglo-Saxon tradition, which views mediation as a specific strategy inherently embedded in a more complex framework constituted by the entire process of <italic>conflict resolution</italic>. On the other hand, there is the Latin tradition, from within which the mediation is conceptualized in a more all-encompassing sense, and within which a variety of strategies are to be found.</p>
<p>These different ways of conceptualizing mediation are at the same time associated with a variety of models, and among these the most important are the Harvard model, the narrative model and the transforming model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1468017310393056">Del Campo, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1468017310393056">Díez &amp; Tapia, 1999</xref>). The three models differ in terms of the type of communication which they imply as well as in the importance attributed to the objectives which may be achieved in the mediation process. Both the final result and the meaning assigned to the process itself by the participants may be significantly influenced by the model chosen.</p>
<p>In particular, many young offenders find themselves subjected to varying degrees of what may be considered to be structural violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1468017310393056">Galtung, 1985</xref>), as well as to various forms of cultural violence. This feature is especially pronounced among young immigrants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1468017310393056">Galtung, 1990</xref>). In many situations there is a manifest lack of sufficient and adequate resources with which to guarantee the minimum conditions necessary for the development of an adequate strategy for conflict resolution.</p>
<p>The transformative and narrative models of mediation constitute an attempt to incorporate such circumstances in the mediation process by attempting to identify alternatives which are both effective and which really offer the possibility of solving the conflict. One alternative is what has become known as the <italic>generative approach</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1468017310393056">Fried &amp; Schnitman, 2000</xref>) which contemplates the creation of future scenarios through which the real causes of the conflict may be addressed.</p>
<p>Intercultural mediation is also characterized by multiple conceptualizations, which range from translation and interpretation tasks to the control of school absence, or to the assessment of specific cultural aspects. Given the large variety of possible roles which an intercultural mediator may play, it is evident that certain key competences are essential, such as, for example, a higher level of awareness of cultural diversity, a more general perspective, and an ability to offer increased sensitivity towards the diversity of perceptions and approaches which may be present in one and the same conflict. In this sense some of the models offered – such as, for example, the one proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1468017310393056">Hofstede (1989)</xref> – facilitate the identification of the general dimensions involved in the interpretation of cultural diversity.</p>
<p>In order to be able to offer a model of intercultural mediation that is able to produce symmetry and mutual recognition, while at the same time maintaining the real causes of the conflict as a starting point, it is important that the dialogue process between participants be based on meaningful intercultural communication. Intercultural communication in this context may be considered as communication between people who come from different reference cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1468017310393056">Chen &amp; Starosta, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>As a useful alternative to conflict resolution we can consider some basic processes. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1468017310393056">Bermúdez et al. (2002)</xref> propose avoiding centralization as a key element in conflict resolution; as the authors said: ‘[a key task] is to take distance from oneself in order to identify your own frames of reference and [make] your own representations of the other different’ (p. 82). Another process is to be able to empathize and make observations from their point of view. And the last aspect would focus on intercultural negotiation, in order to secure the necessary exchanges between diverse viewpoints to facilitate management solutions satisfactory to both participants.</p>
<p>In this sense, we must take into account how they represent the interactions with others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1468017310393056">Téllez, 2005</xref>). The perception of ‘others’ influenced by such things as: our goals, our expectations, how we value the relationship with others, the emotional significance of that value and the experience we had in previous situations. These perceptions condition the typology of the relationship. There is a particular tendency to perceive what may be regarded as negative, focusing on aspects that make us alert to danger.</p>
<p>Language and communication play a very important role in the processes of intercultural mediation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1468017310393056">Drake &amp; Donohue, 2000</xref>). The very existence of a multicultural communicative context in and of itself produces a number of barriers to communication which tend to make the communication process between the various parties more difficult than would otherwise be the case. Some of these communication barriers are located at the interpersonal level. Examples of this would be the presence of ethnocentric attitudes, the widespread use of stereotypes and/or prejudices, ignorance about how cultural diversity affects communication, or a lack of motivation and/or the absence of skills to overcome such barriers. In addition, the mediation process itself does not lack structural impediments: the existence of an asymmetric relationship between the parties, substantial differences between the cultures of the participants, or cultural shocks produced by recent migratory processes, would all be examples.</p>
<p>Faced with these potential barriers to communication between participants in a mediation process involving different reference cultures, the level of intercultural communication competence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1468017310393056">Vilà, 2008</xref>) of the mediation professional may prove to be a decisive factor in ensuring that the mediation process has the required level of fluidity.</p>

<sec id="sec4-1468017310393056"><title>Mediation in the juvenile penal justice context</title>
<p>Penal mediation has the objective of achieving the non-violent resolution of conflicts between citizens. Given the known difficulties that a judicial tradition based on the application of sanctions presents, mediation constitutes one of the most important opportunities and challenges that is currently to be found in the penal context, and especially in relation to juvenile justice. The ability to have recourse to alternatives to traditional punitive remedies has added implications in that society itself also assumes some part of the responsibility for the situation. It is evident, for example, that inequality, conditions of structural violence and marginalization are all examples of situations which form part of the interpretive context of an offence and are all of these are not the sole and exclusive responsibility of the offender.</p>
<p>Examined from this perspective, if our intention is to contribute to the construction of a society which is more just, and is respectful of the liberty of all, then only those proposals may be considered to be genuinely mediatory in the penal context which consider the risks associated with asymmetric distribution of power and communicative competence in the attempt to effectively address, and in a non-violent way, the resolution of conflicts.</p>
<p>In the context of penal mediation there are three models in general use today. The <italic>informal model</italic> may be used by the agents of the penal system to introduce processes of dialogue or agreement between the parties in conflict. The <italic>assembly model</italic> is linked to earlier traditions and is based on the search for a shared set of norms, beliefs and customs whereby a variety of social groups and agents are able to meet together in an autonomous fashion in order to seek out common solutions. Finally, there is the <italic>victim-offender model</italic> of mediation, which has been increasingly favoured in recent decades. This model is based on the exclusive participation of the parties in conflict, in the presence of the mediator. In this model the practices of mediation may be very diverse: the mediator may be a volunteer or a professional, who may operate within or outside of the formal judicial system, and who may or may not form part of a specialized mediation service. At the same time, the practices of penal mediation can be introduced at differing stages of the judicial process and as a consequence they may be used to facilitate the achievement of a variety of different objectives. When used in the initial stages of a process the objective is normally to put it out of the judicial process. Mediation may also be introduced at a later stage in the judicial process, in order to determine the sentence for example, and finally, it may take place during the execution of the sentence in an attempt to achieve a broader interpretation of the sanction imposed.</p>
<p>Specifically penal mediation may be defined (in terms of <italic>the victim-offender model</italic>) as that process which enables victim and offender to actively participate, always assuming they do so on a voluntary basis, in the resolution of the problems which arise from the original offence, with the active participation of an impartial third party (as recommended in R (99)19 of the committee of the Council of Europe). Viewed in this light mediation involves a dialectical process which can facilitate the mutual recognition of those in conflict; the role of the mediator is basically that of facilitator, enabling the outcome of the dialogue which is produced within the communicational space established to move towards resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1468017310393056">Ceretti &amp; Mannozzi, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>From this point of view, contributing to the construction of a fairer society, one which is respectful of the rights and responsibilities of each and every one of its citizens, inevitably implies the development of proposals for penal mediation which take into account the risks associated with the presence of power asymmetries, and which explicitly incorporate as one of its objectives the idea that the final result be achieved via a non violent form of conflict resolution. Mediation understood from a perspective of dialogue in the face of conflict can contribute to the development of responsible attitudes among individuals, and to the reconstitution of damaged or broken social and individual interaction between the parties to a conflict.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1468017310393056">Guillamat (2004)</xref> performed a short analysis of the historical development of mediation in criminal matters, highlighting the programs initiated in the US and Canada in the 1960s. These were motivated by the following facts: the questioning of the legitimacy of criminal law from an abolitionism tendency, the growing importance of the victim and the redressing of the effects of crime, and also the need of avoiding the stigmatization of the aggressor through alternatives to jail. Consequently, in 1977 <italic>neighbourhood justice programs</italic> appeared which saw the beginnings of the application of mediation. In the 1980s this practice became widespread in many European countries: Netherlands, Germany and Austria; also Belgium, France and Spain introduced this practice from the 1990s.</p>
<p>Thus penal mediation pursues a non-violent resolution of conflicts between citizens, although given the presence of a long and extensive legal tradition based on recourse to the use of sanctions, mediation also constitutes one of the most important contemporary challenges in the penal context, and especially in the context of juvenile justice. The Department of Justice of the Generalitat of Catalonia embarked on the long road of facing up to this challenge in 1990, when it introduced the <italic>Mediation and Reparation Program</italic> in the context of juvenile offenders. This program was developed during a period of rapid transition, one which has involved an ongoing review of practices and a steady stream of changes with juvenile justice in Catalonia and in Spain as a whole. This transition reached its culmination in the move towards penal models based on responsibility and educative sanctions as outlined in the most recent version of the juvenile law (Ley Orgánica de Responsabilidad del Menor (LORPM) 5/2000, del 12 de enero).</p>
<p>This new judicial approach means there is now a dual route available for addressing problems of conflict resolution, a penal one and an extra-judicial one oriented towards conciliation and reparation between young offenders and their victims. Along the second of these pathways the role of the mediator is envisioned as an integral part of a strategy for facilitating reconciliation.</p>
<p>The LORPM offers two possible time scales for introducing mediation: during the phase of initial instruction, at which point the state attorney can halt the normal judicial procedure and solicit the mediating one; or during the execution of the sentence, at which point a conciliation process between the minor and the victim can have the effect of freezing the original judicial decision. Once conciliation and reparation have been authorized by the government attorney, a team of professionals offers the possibility of initiating a mediation process or a series of educational activities directed towards the young person, whilst at the same time carrying out an evaluation of their viability.</p>
<p>In this way, in the Catalan context, the mediation program has the basic objective of resolving the conflict between the parties in an extra-judicial manner, via the intervention of a mediator who orients the process, as laid down in the penal code. Despite the fact that the mediation process takes place in an extra-judicial context, it may have consequences for the judicial framework, even if such repercussions and benefits can only be understood in the context of the formal penal procedure.</p>
<p>The mediation and reparation program in the juvenile justice system of the Department of Justice of the Generalitat of Catalonia, forms part of a model of juvenile justice in which the young person is treated as an individual having the capacity to take responsibility for his or her actions. Here the possibility of diversifying the judicial response is conceived as one way of achieving a more appropriate application of the process to the real needs of the young person involved. The process has the general objective of achieving the minimal judicial intervention which is harmonious with a complete respect for the rights of the victims, while at the same time achieving the maximum restoration of the moral and material harm produced.</p>
<p>On the other hand, access to the Mediation Program requires that a certain number of basic criteria be followed:
<list id="list1-1468017310393056" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>An assumption of responsibility for the harm and damaged caused by the young offender.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The young offender should clearly demonstrate his or her desire for reconciliation with the victim.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The young offender should have the capacity to achieve reconciliation with the victim or to make reparation.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The two parties have the right to resolve the conflict and therefore accept the level of commitment necessary to participate actively in the entire process. The process should produce an evaluation of whether the damage caused has any possible form of reparation.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>In this way the mediation process has the double objective of facilitating the reconciliation of the young offender with the victim (or the achievement of reparation for the harm caused) and obtaining compensation for the victim. In this way priority is given to the participation of the victim, to reconciliation, to direct reparation, and to the solution of the conflict by means of dialogue, communication, consensus (always taking into account the interests of both parties), and agreement.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1468017310393056"><title>Objectives of the study</title>
<p>The new conceptions of conflict resolution regard themselves as an opportunity for transformation. If put into practice in an appropriate manner such conceptions can offer experiences which assist the processes of development and personal growth. Within such a dynamic, mediation offers a very interesting instrumental route. At the same time many of the conflicts which the new approaches attempt to resolve contain a notable cultural component, based on the life experiences of those who participate in the process, whether these be professionals or the parties to the conflict.</p>
<p>The objective of this research is to deepen our understanding of the most significant aspects of the conflict situation which characterize the process of interaction between the juvenile justice system in Catalonia and the young offenders themselves, in particular when one of the parties to the conflict is an immigrant. This is a topic which, despite its evident relevance, has not been sufficiently studied to date in our context.</p>
<p>The analysis presented here is based on the findings of a preliminary study into the role and value of mediation in the context of juvenile justice, and specifically in those cases where one of the parties involved is an immigrant. The sample is intentional and although, in Catalonian context, there are few cases of immigrant young people involved in the mediation process in juvenile justice, it is important to deepen our awareness of the underlying theoretical model which contextualizes mediation as a strategy for conflict transformation with an application in the judicial context. The question is how to interpret the components of this model from a cultural perspective, identifying possible sources of bias and their impact on the mediation process, and increasing our understanding of the phenomenon.</p>
<p>What is involved is a deepening of the investigation into the types of interaction produced in mediation, and an analysis of the communicative processes involved. Particular attention is paid to the way in which meaning is generated within such processes, focusing on the nature of the communication and the intercultural elements which are present, identifying those elements which facilitate communication and understanding and the specific intercultural communicative resources used.</p>
<p>At the same time the contextual frameworks which give meaning to the communication need to be identified. Knowledge of the predominant frameworks used by members of the majority community is essential, as is an ability to identify the differences which these present when compared with other cultural frameworks. In this sense it is a question of deepening our understanding of the discursive postures which are adopted on the basis of any given meaning.</p>
<p>Finally, one last objective of this research is to provide interpretative bases which may serve to improve the intervention processes among young immigrants who have a significantly different cultural baggage. Our objective is to try to establish some foundations to improve the quality of intercultural communication during the mediation sessions, and thus create a proposal for improving the intervention processes by making available tools and strategies for professionals to put to use in their day-to-day activity.</p>
<p>In order to obtain the previously described objectives the methodology employed in the study is in large part determined the above-mentioned aspects. In the first place, the lack of prior reference points with which to orient the investigation led us to structure and elaborate prior knowledge by starting from a descriptive analysis of the reality which forms the object of the study. In the second place, our concern for deepening the process of attribution of meanings to those involved implies the relevance of a constructivist methodology together with the need for collecting qualitative information.</p>
<p>Specifically, the information has been obtained via the use of discussion groups and interviews in order to gain access to primary sources, while at the same time we have proceeded to the observation of a process of mediation in which young immigrants participated.</p>
<p>The use of <italic>discussion groups</italic> allows for information to be obtained (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1468017310393056">Krueger, 1991</xref>) to the extent that the influence of the interviewer is reduced and the interaction between the participants and the defence of the respective points of view comes to dominate. In this research two discussion groups were organized with professionals from different areas of the Juvenile Justice system participating in each group (teachers from juvenile centres, mediators, cultural mediators, delegates of open justice centres, professionals from technical teams, judges and attorneys).</p>
<p>In these groups the question of mediation as a conflict resolution strategy was examined, as well as its possible use when faced with the participation of people who come from a wide variety of cultural contexts. Consequently, the mediation process was considered both as an alternative measure within the penal justice system as well as a form of conflict management in a variety of different circumstances (in juvenile centres, during probation, etc). Such sessions have allowed us to make an initial diagnosis from the perspective and viewpoint of the professionals involved.</p>
<p>We have at the same time deepened our investigation into the vision of those who directly participate in this process, that is, the young immigrants who have participated in the above cited mediation processes. To this end, <italic>semi-structured interviews</italic> were carried out with the young people involved. Such interviews imply a strategy of information gathering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1468017310393056">Wittrock, 1989</xref>) which, starting from a general guide, structures the different components which appear in the theoretical framework. In this way the technique has allowed us to express the particular point of view each person holds, and thus carry out the cultural framing and attribution of meaning concerning their individual experience. At the same time the interviews were carried out subsequent to the discussion groups, using part of the information obtained in these groups to prepare the scripts for the semi-structured interviews with the young people. In particular a total of six young people were interviewed (two girls and four boys), and the origin countries involved were Morocco, Cuba, Algeria and the UK.</p>
<p>Finally a number of mediation processes were <italic>observed</italic> in their entirety, always involving some participation of persons born outside Spain as one of the parties. These sessions were recorded and subsequently transcribed to facilitate their analysis.</p>
<p>The transcriptions of the discussion groups, the interviews and the mediation observation were then studied using a content analysis technique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1468017310393056">Krippendorff, 1990</xref>) based on Nvivo v. 4 and Atlas.ti software. The use of this software was very important in the information-coding processes since we were dealing with information coming from a variety of sources, and the numbering of the text lines enabled reference to the different information paragraphs to be systematic. This software was also essential to enable the recovery of the coded fragments using complex search procedures and different criteria combinations.</p>
<p>Once the analysis of the information obtained from each of the previously cited sources had been analysed we proceeded to carry out data triangulation, establishing contrasts between the different perceptions and, at the same time, comparing them with the prevailing theoretical models in order to try and elaborate a comprehensive perspective on the phenomenon studied.</p>
<p>Throughout the whole process the research team felt it necessary to meet on a regular and systematic basis. Such meetings permitted the team not only to coordinate the organizational details of the study, but also to reflect over the experience and the data as it was being analysed. The research process itself was composed of three phases: <italic>initial preparation</italic> together with the establishment of the necessary contacts to enable the smooth development of the post data-collection<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1468017310393056">1</xref></sup> stages of the research; <italic>data collection</italic>, integrating the findings of the focus groups, the interviews and the observation of the mediation; and <italic>data analysis</italic>, drawing conclusions, and writing the research report.</p>
<p>During all these phases a consistent attempt was made to maintain the necessary scientific rigour appropriate to this type of qualitative study. Specifically, to respond to scientific rigor it was considered important to respond to the needs of the <italic>credibility criterion</italic> by means of a triangulation procedure implemented across the various sources of information. Using detailed descriptions obtained from the sample and from other participants the criterion of transferability or applicability was addressed. The <italic>criterion of dependence</italic> or consistency is obtained using revision trails which leave a clear record of how data was collected and analysed.</p>
<p>In the following section we will outline some of the more significant conclusions which we reached in this study, and in this way we will attempt to address the objectives initially presented. As such this constitutes the third phase of the investigation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-1468017310393056"><title>Results and conclusions</title>
<p>The results obtained have a diagnostic character and constitute an initial approach to the impact of mediation in the context of juvenile justice in cases where one of the parties involved is an immigrant. These results improve the understanding of these aspects, within the limitations of qualitative research methodology and the limited sample of the study. One of the principle limitations of this research is also that is not possible to generalize to further situations. However, our conclusions can be conveniently brought together under five fundamental headings.</p>
<sec id="sec7-1468017310393056"><title>Meaning attributed to penal mediation from the perspective of the victim or the offender</title>
<p>One of the most notable aspects which emerged from our analysis and the triangulation of the data obtained, is the difference in interpretation which can be made of the mediation process in terms of the role assigned to the penal environment. Our analysis of the narrative obtained and the observations made indicate substantial differences in the way the process is experienced by the various participants. The victim experiences a well known feeling of satisfaction, while normally the aggressor experiences the process in a rather shameful way, normally hoping that it will end as soon as possible.</p>
<p>The degree of voluntary action in participation and mediation constitutes a very significant element here. The victim is an entirely voluntary participant while the offender is constrained by the constant possibility of more punitive outcomes. In this sense it may be said that the participant’s role is more important than their cultural origin, given that this situation was perceived in a similar way regardless of whether the victim belongs to the majority culture or comes from a minority one. Clearly the same may also be said of the offender.</p>
<p>The fact that the mediation space has a fundamental role in the dialogue tends to create situations in which the aggressor may well feel at a disadvantage with respect to the victim. In the majority of penal mediation cases the aggressors have had a life trajectory which is characterized by acting aggressively in interpersonal relations and where dialogue assumes a subordinate role. One of the young people interviewed drew attention to this ‘I think you should organize a course where young people learn to talk rather than to fight.’ In fact some of those interviewed admitted not having the necessary skills to participate in such a process, as one respondent commented:<disp-quote>
<p>Marcos, the tutor, told me that I need to learn to resolve problems in another way, talking and without fighting. I don’t know if I would know how to do that. I never learnt how to. I only know how to fight … sometimes I ask myself why I do these things, I realize that I shouldn’t do them and think about saying that I am sorry: But I don’t know if I would be able to. (Respondent, 8)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>The mediation process implies a clear orientation towards reparation, that is to say, towards the compensation that the victim should receive from the aggressor. In this sense it is possible to say that mediation in the context of the penal system has greater limitations as an educational tool than in other potential contexts. For example, one mediation process studied involved the case of aggression against a Moroccan girl in a secondary school carried out by a student from the same school. In addition to the use of expressions which were clearly offensive, such as references to the girl’s North African origins, the attack had an evident racist component. It was therefore surprising to discover that, according to the girl attacked, during the mediation process, at no time was this aspect of the situation addressed in an attempt to modify the behaviour and cultural attitudes of the aggressor.</p>
<p>Possibly the cultural component is an aspect which is still not sufficiently appreciated in mediation processes. It is clear that a great deal has been written about mediation processes: phases, consensus strategies and communication, but aspects like cultural influences and how communicative processes are determined in such contexts, still require a process of examination and development which will make it possible to include aspects as relevant as cultural influences in a process where the importance of these should be obvious.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-1468017310393056"><title>Difficulties in applying mediation programs among young immigrants</title>
<p>Even if under the Juvenile Penal Law mediation is contemplated as an alternative which is accessible to all young people, the reality is all too often that the young immigrant has greater difficulty in attaining access to such alternatives. One of the basic principles of access to mediation is the capacity and the compromise that the young aggressor should accept in making retribution for the harm caused to the victim. Both ignorance of the judicial system, and a lack of stability and bonding which allows for the control of the fulfilment of the retribution, represent obstacles which have no easy remedy and this tends to orient the judge towards measures which involve a greater level of control, such as internment in a centre. Many young immigrants exhibit confusion when faced with a judicial system which may appear to be very different to the one to be found in their country of origin:<disp-quote>
<p>I feel much disoriented by all the customs I find here … if you steal something you get locked up just the same, but here it seems all very strange. (Respondent, 3)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Another aspect to which considerable importance is often attached in the mediation process is the need for reflection on the act committed. As one young offender comments:<disp-quote>
<p>a trial only serves to give you a punishment. Mediation makes you reflect, and realize what you have done, and you don’t do it again. You don’t make the same mistake twice. (Respondent 2)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>This kind of reflection facilitates the development of a feeling of responsibility and an understanding of the perspective the victim has in such situations.</p>
<p>One of the young people interviewed accepted this process of becoming aware of the victims point of view in a very clear way:<disp-quote>
<p>when I speak to the mediator, then I get involved, it was like someone opened my eyes and made me think about all the harm I had caused to that woman. Up to then I had only thought about myself and the money I needed to enjoy myself. I thought she had more money than me, and that she wouldn’t miss the money. (Respondent 1)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Language, however, is the basic tool used by both those who develop the mediating action and the principal communicative resource existing between victim and aggressor. Many of the young immigrants involved in the mediation process have only a very basic and rudimentary knowledge of the languages currently in use in Spain, and this makes it harder to achieve the level of abstraction and reflection required in such cases, for example, the perceptions which each side has of the same situation. All too often the poor quality of communication, normally the result of language difficulties, is a problem which, even if it allows for the expression of the basic facts of a case, produces an excess of ambiguity.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the mediator normally is unfamiliar with the cultural and social context from which the young person comes, and as a result the relational asymmetry which exists often passes unnoticed, with the mediator simply being left with a frustrating feeling of being unable to establish a relationship based on trust, a circumstance which only serves to reinforce the initial subjective impression that the young offender is unable to enter the process in a meaningful way and is simply attempting to avoid punishment. In the case of young people whose family live in Spain, the family often experiences their encounter with the Spanish judicial system with a real feeling of panic (in many cases due to the influence of their perspective on the penal system in their country of origin) and their personal circumstances which are often not much better than those of their children. As a consequence the family cannot offer the young people involved the emotional and material aid they really need. Normally, the mediator is seen as an agent of the judicial system itself, and their function is conceptualized as one of repression and control. The result is a tendency to adopt a defensive attitude, and often to create obstacles in an attempt to avoid the entry of the child in the mediation process.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec9-1468017310393056"><title>Asymmetries in intercultural mediation in the context of juvenile justice</title>
<p>We have already noted the influence that communication asymmetries may exert on the context of mediation process. Such asymmetries have been present in all levels of this research, from the initial data gathering stage, through the focus groups and during the transcriptions of the interviews. In general, the mediation process is seen as being oriented towards the satisfaction of the needs of the victim. As one of the young offenders said:<disp-quote>
<p>It is a program of reparation for the victim. I have harmed someone, and somehow or other I have to put things right. (Respondent 7)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>In fact the victims’ consideration of their level of satisfaction, once the process is completed, is superior to that of the offender. At the same time, and in many of the cases, the age difference between victim and offender is a further factor complicating the mediation process. This age difference often leads to a significantly reduced participation in the process on the part of the offender, and as a result the victim may often adopt the leading role in the process and set the communicative framework – or framing – which means that the bias towards the agenda set by the victim is further increased, as can be seen in the following comment:<disp-quote>
<p>the truth is that it seemed to me too that I needed to do something more. I wanted to do something more, but I didn’t know what. Finally, the woman said that it was hard for her to carry things. That if we agreed to buy some bottles of water and some milk cartons and took them to her house, this would save her money and effort. (Respondent 5)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Despite the initial situation which gives rise to the mediation it is important to bear in mind that subsequent contact with the victim can be very enriching and very instructive for the offender, as is revealed in the following paragraph which comes from an interview with a young female offender who had participated in a mediation process with an adult victim:<disp-quote>
<p>I was shocked by her attitude. How could she have confidence in me? In us? Giving us money to buy her things, letting us into her home, introducing us to her husband, to her children and grandchildren. She gave us food, and while we were eating we broke into tears, and I didn’t know where to look. How can people be so kind to you after you have treated them so badly, … I don’t think that I would have been capable of this. (Respondent 15)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Obviously it is not a frequent occurrence that victims are so understanding and open to actions which can help their attackers in the way found in this case.</p>
<p>Another aspect which favours the asymmetry in power relations in the context of mediation is the cultural difference that exists between the two parties. This situation can be considered to be a representation of the inequality existing in society and to be a typical example of the differences found in linguistic competences between the two parties. In this sense the participation of young immigrants in the mediation process is often limited and insubstantial, consisting of monosyllabic responses to very direct questions. The young offenders themselves make use of a discourse which is limited and restrictive in terms of possibilities for personal development:<disp-quote>
<p>the only thing which matters to me is to come out of this without incarceration and be able to work … it seemed to me to be the easiest way. (Respondent 11)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Such attitudes reveal how the process which people only see him- or herself as a simple part of the workforce is not the best starting point for a high level of personal involvement in the mediation process. These asymmetric conditions also exist in the young offender’s relationship with the mediator. Normally, the mediator belongs to the same culture as the other party in the mediation, which adds to the perception and feeling of lack of confidence towards the institutional structure. Again, in the words of one of the young offenders:<disp-quote>
<p>In the beginning she [the mediator] was bit of a bore – don’t tell her I said this, will you – It’s just I didn’t see the point in what she was saying. (Respondent 3)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Overcoming these asymmetry relations – which obviously exist in areas other than mediation – is one of the most important challenges which face mediation processes in the context of juvenile justice.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec10-1468017310393056"><title>The importance of intercultural communication in mediation</title>
<p>In mediation processes that involve people from differing reference cultures intercultural communication has a special character. The principal preoccupation that arises among professionals is normally the problem of linguistic comprehension, but in fact the cultural backgrounds of those involved have a much more significant and general impact than the linguistic one alone. The construction of perceptions and the process of conflict resolution itself have elements which show clear signs of the presence of cultural factors, indeed the interviews with young offenders who have participated in mediation processes, as corroborated by interviews with young people in detention centres, show clearly the presence of ‘barriers’ which have their origin in the stereotypes and prejudices – including even clear cases of discrimination – that these young people have perceived in their relations in the institutional context of juvenile justice. The following is a good example:<disp-quote>
<p>Here there are young people, but they don’t understand you. They cheat you because you are a foreigner. You can’t trust anyone. My lawyer told me that they couldn’t hit me, but the police did just that, though they didn’t do it to the Spanish kids. (Respondent 13)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>These barriers clearly prejudice communication between the parties and this is even more the case when the mediator also represents a clear association with the majority culture. These barriers can be reduced and to some extent overcome through intercultural communication processes which require a certain level of competence, both cognitive and affective, on the part of the professionals.</p>
<p>In fact in the follow-up carried out on the mediation sessions, the effort applied by the mediator to adapt to the communication conditions – an effort which is normally more intuitive than intentional – is often clearly in evidence. It is possible, for example, to note changes in the language used, the use of Spanish rather than the locally habitual Catalan, once the mediator becomes aware that the young immigrant feels more comfortable in Spanish; there is also a change in vocabulary, with the use of more structurally simplified phrases and recourse to expressions which have an active rather than a passive form.</p>
<p>There is also a constant and evident use of clarification statements both in the language used by the young person and in connection with some of the more abstract concepts deployed by the mediator. In fact, some interviews reveal the presence of some of these competences among mediation professionals:<disp-quote>
<p>you can reflect and speak; you feel yourself to be a person, because the mediator respects you and doesn’t treat you like an inferior. (Respondent 18)</p></disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec11-1468017310393056"><title>Application of mediation in other contexts</title>
<p>In analysis of situations arising in the context of juvenile justice requiring the use of mediation processes it has been observed that, in a certain number of cases, the application of standard penal justice would appear to be somewhat excessive. In many of these cases an application of a mediation process would allows the conflict involved to be addressed in a more ‘natural’, and less dramatic and less punitive, fashion:<disp-quote>
<p>what they do is take away the feeling of being on trial. They help you see and understand what happens when you do something wrong and that you need to think about things before doing them. (Respondent 2)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>It is undeniable that the formal intervention of penal justice, even if it is of the juvenile kind, provokes certain classes of stigmatization and these may be found in other contexts where conflicts arise and need resolution. In the school and the wider community, contexts are easily to be found where mediation could certainly represent a viable option.</p>
<p>In this sense mediation at school has been steadily developing within the education system however, even today, there is still a long road to travel before it can come to have the profile it merits as a formula for conflict resolution. The school cannot simply ignore the situations which arise in its midst. Similarly the broader community (in this case, professionals active in the education and social system, or participants in the networks of community and family associations which surround the school) need to remain on the margin of certain types of situation, promoting alternatives which favour the mutual understanding of the social agents involved and cohesion at the community level.</p>
<p>Mediation does not constitute a policy alternative with the capacity to resolve each and every problem which arises, since in many cases the root of the problem lies in the very presence of inequality itself, the lack of social justice, or in circumstances which are much more extensive than those which can be approached with limited initiatives. Despite this, the use of mediation always promotes a certain degree of reflection with the objective of achieving new forms of social action which, on the one hand, produce a broader feeling of social co-responsibility going well beyond the immediate conflict circumstances, while on the other an attempt is made to truly resolve the conflict, taking dialogue and mutual recognition as the basis for harmonious community life, as one participant put it:<disp-quote>
<p>I didn’t know mediation existed, but now I do, and I don’t think I will ever forget it. (Respondent 14)</p></disp-quote></p>
