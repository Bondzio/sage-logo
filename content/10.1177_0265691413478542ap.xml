<p>In this excellent book, David Stevenson offers a highly original and exciting account of the final, decisive year of the First World War. At the beginning of 1918, the conflict’s outcome still hung in the balance. While the Allies were economically stronger, the Russian Revolution had allowed the Central Powers a temporary military advantage and a last window of opportunity in which to win in the west. Two closely related questions are at the centre of Stevenson’s account of this dramatic year. First, he asks why the Allies ultimately triumphed; how were they able to survive the powerful offensives launched against them in the spring and summer and then counterattack to achieve victory? Second, he seeks to explain that victory’s timing, determining why it was in the autumn of 1918 that the Central Powers capitulated and why their opponents proved ready at that juncture to accept their surrender.</p>
<p>His answers to these questions range exceptionally widely. The pivotal war zone in 1918 was the Western Front, and Stevenson draws on a wealth of recent excellent military history, as well as commanders’ writings and armies’ official histories, to explain the inherent flaws in the German plan of attack and the success of the Allied response. Following David T. Zabecki, he highlights Ludendorff’s vacillation and operational blindness, especially his inability to identify the railway centre of Amiens as a crucial target, as reasons for the offensives’ failure. In accounting for the Allies’ subsequent advance, Stevenson addresses not only their leadership and operational skill but also engages with recent debates on the state of German morale in 1918. He argues (in this reviewer’s opinion, correctly) that this plummeted once it became clear that the spring offensive had not achieved its goals, and that among frontline troops surrenders rather than desertion were the key consequence before the German government appealed for a ceasefire on 4 October 1918.</p>
<p>The major contribution of this book, however, is its incorporation of other less well understood, yet critically important, factors that shaped the war’s outcome. Above all, Stevenson’s study of supply and logistics, in part based on detailed archival work, is groundbreaking. Allied victory depended on the transportation of fuel, food, materials and men, often thousands of miles across the Atlantic. He explains not only how this was achieved but also the Allies’ interdependence and the tensions that supply caused both domestically and within their coalition. The Europeans were beholden to the United States for finance, food and raw materials, yet the US army relied on its allies to arm it, and, as its needs and numbers overseas rose, it was even projected that by 1919 American expenditure in France would outstrip French spending in the US. There were supply difficulties: although far better provided for than their enemies, Britain, France and Italy struggled with food and coal shortages, and in America, Stevenson reveals, a railway crisis threatened economic paralysis in the winter of 1917–18. There was also distrust: the British, for example, worried about the loss of their external markets and their dependence on the United States for oil. All this, as well as concerns about money, manpower, lives lost and their relative influence at the negotiating table, gave the Allies good reason to agree to peace in 1918.</p>
<p>The book is also remarkable for its geographical breadth. It covers not only Germany and the western Allies but also the Habsburg and Ottoman Empires. Neglected theatres such as the Mediterranean, Mesopotamia, Palestine and the crucial Macedonian front, where a Franco-Serb breakthrough at the end of September helped force the German decision to sue for an armistice, all receive detailed consideration. Moreover, Stevenson shows how the different war zones were interconnected. The collapse of Bulgaria, for example, partly conditioned by the withdrawal of German and Habsburg troops and material aid, exposed the Ottoman Empire to attack, offered the opportunity of opening a new front against Austria-Hungary and threatened the Germans’ hold over crucial Romanian oil.</p>
<p>It is difficult to fault scholarship of this scope. Perhaps one reservation that can be made is that amongst the mass of figures on shipping tonnage, coal shortfalls, troops transported and shells produced, the human aspect of war is sometimes submerged. The book discusses morale at length and even quotes some combatants, but the emotional engagement of the populations, and in particular what individuals saw as being at stake for themselves and their countries in victory, defeat or revolution, is never really explained. That engagement was important in a ‘total war’, and it goes far in accounting for the continuation of violence across much of Europe after 1918, an issue also not discussed. Nonetheless, this does not stop the book from being a monumental achievement. Extraordinarily rich, original and readable, David Stevenson’s book is likely to become the authoritative account of 1918.</p>
