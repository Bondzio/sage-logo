<abstract>
<p>The essays in <italic>Rethinking the Ethics of John</italic>, edited by Jan G. van der Watt and Ruben Zimmermann, make a signiﬁcant contribution to the study of Johannine ethics. They show that the Gospel’s narrative form with its character portrayal, speciﬁc directives, and images, provides critical reflection on human action. The command to ‘love one another’ need not be understood in a narrow sense, for it forms community and engages the world. Themes of ‘life’ and ‘truth’ work together with ‘love’ to create a multifaceted ethical perspective. The Gospel afﬁrms values included in Jewish law, while centering ethical reflection on the action of God in Jesus, which evokes a human response. The critical stance toward opponents in the Johannine epistles stands in tension with the love command, but references to God’s action on behalf of the world opens up possibilities for positive reading.</p>

<p>The essays in <italic>Rethinking the Ethics of John</italic>, edited by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0142064X13495133">Jan G. van der Watt and Ruben Zimmermann (2012)</xref>, reflect promising new directions in the study of the ethical dimensions of the Johannine writings. The contributors challenge the common tendency to relegate John’s Gospel and the Johannine Epistles to the periphery when exploring New Testament ethics. In the past, interpreters have often noted that the Fourth Gospel includes little explicit ethical teaching. There are no lists of virtues and vices, and no deliberations about practical issues like marriage and divorce, sexual misconduct, social conflict, or relationship to the government. To be sure, the Fourth Gospel includes the command to ‘love one another’, but it offers little elaboration about how that is to take shape in action. For many interpreters, the Fourth Gospel’s ethical dimension has appeared to be ‘ambiguous, incoherent and incomplete’ (Lund, p. 265;<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0142064X13495133">1</xref></sup> cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0142064X13495133">Houlden 2004</xref>: 36; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0142064X13495133">Matera 1996</xref>: 92-118; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0142064X13495133">Schrage 1989</xref>: 301-24).</p>
<p>The problem of discerning an ethical dimension in John was forcefully stated some years ago by Wayne Meeks, whose negative judgment of John’s value for moral formation is often noted in this volume. Meeks said that ﬁrst, John offers no explicit moral instruction and limits the love command to showing love for others in the Johannine circle. Second, the Gospel includes no plausible and universalizable model for human behavior. John’s Jesus can scarcely be considered a human ﬁgure, and the others in the story represent the situation of a small embattled Christian community, whose behaviors cannot easily be generalized. Third, ethical discourse must appeal to reason, whereas John’s worldview is not only irrational but antirational. The enigmatic sayings of the Johannine Jesus overthrow ordinary rationality and therefore cannot be taken as the foundation for ethics. Fourth, everything in John’s narrative world seems predetermined, so that there is no truly free decision making. Only those who have been chosen out of the world can make the right moral choice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0142064X13495133">Meeks 1996</xref>: 318-19). According to Meeks, that worldview may have appeal for the aesthete, ‘but hardly for the ethical person’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0142064X13495133">Meeks 1996</xref>: 320). He concluded that the only way John managed to ﬁnd a cherished place in the moral sensibilities of western readers was ‘through an endless series of more or less strong misreadings’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0142064X13495133">Meeks 1996</xref>: 317).</p>
<p>Some recent contributions to the discussion, however, have included more positive proposals concerning the ethical dimensions of John. Some have focused on the implications of the love command for speciﬁc moral action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0142064X13495133">Popkes 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0142064X13495133">Schnelle 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0142064X13495133">2009</xref>), others explore the way that the Gospel’s narrative form communicates values with signiﬁcant ethical implications. Of special interest are the values and behaviors presented through the interaction of characters in the story and the Gospel’s rich collection of images (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0142064X13495133">Nissen 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0142064X13495133">van der Watt 2006a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0142064X13495133">2006b</xref>). Continuing this encouraging trend, the essays in the present volume offer a welcome series of studies on ethics in John’s Gospel and 1 John using a variety of approaches. Given the range of the material, let me reflect on these contributions in the light of the volume’s leading questions.</p>
<sec id="section1-0142064X13495133">
<title>Ethics and Narrative</title>
<p>One of the basic issues in exploring Johannine ethics concerns the nature of ethics itself. In its simplest form, ethical inquiry means asking ‘What should I do?’ and ‘Why?’ But as Michael Labahn notes, the formal study of ethics usually means critical reflection on behavior based on a theoretical and methodological framework. The problem is that neither the Johannine writings nor any other NT texts undertake such a systematic approach to ethics, and all of them generally fail to provide critical argumentation in support of their moral teachings (p. 6). Accordingly, Labahn proposes that an ‘ethical text’ is one that ‘(a) provides a reflective orientation toward the reader’s actual “way of life” (b) by deﬁning how to behave and act (c) according to a value system that is developed and supported by the text, its characters, and/or its setting, (d) in relation to a speciﬁc social group and/or to the surrounding society at large’. The corollary to this deﬁnition is that ethical texts ‘attempt to persuade the reader to embrace the norms that they promote as normative’ (p. 7).</p>
<p>The deﬁnition rightly acknowledges that critical reflection on behavior is integral to the study of ethics. That aspect distinguishes ethics from the investigation of ‘ethos’, which involves describing the habitual and often unreflective behavior of a group. To consider the Johannine ethos one would ask what values and patterns of conduct seem to be typical of Johannine Christians and are presupposed in the Gospel. But ethics goes a step further by asking ‘why’ someone should embrace such values and adopt a particular course of action (Labahn, pp. 7-8; Zimmermann, pp. 58-59). A central argument of this volume is that the Gospel’s narrative form does provide critical reflection on behavior. These studies consider how the Gospel’s narrative reveals an underlying value system that includes critical reflection and can therefore be considered ‘ethics’ or ‘implicit ethics’ (van der Watt and Zimmermann, p. x).</p>
<p>The value of narrative for the study of ethics was noted by Alasdair MacIntyre, who said, ‘I can only answer the question “What am I to do?” if I can answer the prior question “Of what story or stories do I ﬁnd myself to be a part?”’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0142064X13495133">1984</xref>: 201). Narratives reflect the desire for coherence. As people seek to live with integrity, they try to set their actions within the larger framework of a life story, and they struggle to make their actions congruent with the values that the story represents. The Fourth Gospel shapes behavior by telling the story of God in Jesus Christ (Zimmermann, p. 66). That story does not outline ethical theory, but it does provide critical reflection on what people do and why. Through the portrayals of characters, along with words of instruction and a variety of images, the Gospel draws readers to certain forms of belief and action that are deemed positive, while alienating them from the forms that are negative. Through the story, readers gain a sense not only of what one should do, but why one should live and act in a certain way.</p>
<p>The levels of action in the Fourth Gospel include the works of God, Jesus and human beings. Each level is related to the others (Weyer-Menkhoff, pp. 159-74; Löhr, pp. 229-49). It has often been noted that Jesus plays a central role as a model for behavior. When washing the disciples’ feet he says, ‘I have set you an example, that you should also do as I have done to you’ (Jn 13.15). Since Jesus takes on the role of a servant or slave, the disciples are to do the same. If Jesus dies like a seed in order to bear much fruit, his followers are to die to themselves through their service (12.24-25). As God sent Jesus into the world, Jesus now sends his disciples (17.18; 20.21). If Jesus is the good shepherd, he also entrusts responsibility for shepherding to others (21.15-19).</p>
<p>Yet Ruben Zimmermann’s essay rightly points out that the Gospel does not simply identify proper behavior as the imitation of Jesus (p. 73). Jesus has a unique role that cannot be assumed by others. His death is redemptive in a way that his followers’ death to self is not. He is the light of the world and his followers are to walk in his light (8.12). Others may act as shepherds, but the flock continues to belong to Jesus the good shepherd (21.15-19). I would add that this nuance also applies to the relationship of human action to the action of God. The miraculous signs may show that Jesus can do whatever he sees his Father doing (5.19-23), but the same cannot be said of other human beings. Their capacities are limited. Accordingly, a number of essays point out the ‘responsive’ nature of Johannine ethics. People give what they have ﬁrst received. They love others because they have been loved by God in Jesus. Their actions are not autonomous but proceed from the relationship that God has established (Zimmermann, p. 80; Rabens, pp. 120-22; Weyer-Menkhoff, pp. 160-63, 174; Stare, p. 228). We might bring this perspective more directly into dialogue with the ethical question ‘What should I do?’ by saying that for John the response is: ‘Do what is congruent with what God has done in Jesus’. That in turn invites consideration of what such actions might look like.</p>

<sec id="section2-0142064X13495133">
<title>The Command to Love One Another</title>
<p>Jesus’ command to ‘love one another as I have loved you’ is a major focus for the discussion of Johannine ethics (15.12; cf. 13.34; 1 Jn 3.11; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0142064X13495133">Hays 1997</xref>: 158-57; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0142064X13495133">Houlden 2004</xref>: 36; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0142064X13495133">Schnackenburg 1988</xref>: 148-80). Interpretations of the command have varied signiﬁcantly. First, some construe the love command as a broad ethical mandate. Accordingly, when asking ‘What should I do?’, the Johannine response would be ‘Do the loving thing’. A classic representative of that view is the eighteenth-century writer Gotthold Lessing, who took it as an ethical criterion for all humanity. Second, others read it in the opposite way as a boundary-creating command. Jesus’ followers are to love one another, rather than the world, so that they create an in-group that sets itself apart from the world. From this perspective the Johannine writings run counter to Jesus’ emphasis on loving neighbor and even one’s enemies by limiting the scope of love and turning it into a purely sectarian bond. Third, still others agree that the love command focuses on the community, while emphasizing that such love is also outward looking, since it is integral to the Christian witness to the world (Jn 13.34-35). Putting love into action provides practical evidence as to why outsiders should become members of the community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0142064X13495133">Augenstein 1993</xref>: 11-21; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0142064X13495133">Thyen 2007</xref>: 623-30).</p>
<p>Contributors to this volume generally develop the third perspective on the love command in helpful ways. While recognizing the Johannine distinction between the believing community and the world, they ﬁnd the Johannine perspective to be ultimately world engaging rather than world negating. The most basic point is that for John the world has become alienated from God and yet it remains the object of divine love. God’s sending of Jesus expresses his love for such a world, and it is done so that the world’s relationship with its Creator might be restored (3.16). If the followers of Jesus are to act in ways congruent with what God has done, then their witness to the world must attest to God’s love for the world. A purely sectarian form of love would not do so (Labahn, pp. 3-5, 20-28; Zimmerman, pp. 47-51; Lund, pp. 266-69).</p>
<p>Next, Jesus conveys love through actions that are paradigmatic for his followers. One of these is the footwashing, which translates love into an act of devoted service to others. Although the footwashing was done within the circle of disciples, we might develop the lines taken in this volume even further by deepening the engagement with the narrative context. The Gospel makes clear that during the footwashing, Satan was present and active in Judas, who was about to betray Jesus. Yet Jesus washed the feet of all the disciples, including Judas his adversary (13.1-11). If the disciples are to do what Jesus did, then tangible acts of love are to be extended even to one’s enemies (13.12-17). We might also note that the narrative context of the love command breaks down the simple lines between those in the community and those in the world. Immediately prior to the command, Jesus addresses his disciples in the same way that he addressed his opponents: ‘as I said to the Jews’—who had failed to understand him and belonged to the world (7.32-34; 8.21-23)—‘so now I say to you’ disciples, ‘Where I am going you cannot come’. Immediately after giving the new commandment in 13.34-35, Jesus tells of Peter’s upcoming denial in 13.36-38. That literary framing of the love command shows that those to whom it is given are limited and flawed human beings, who share the traits of the world itself.</p>
<p>Similar dynamics emerge from the connection between the love commandment and the notion of friendship. After the love command is given a second time in 15.12, Jesus adds, ‘No one has greater love than this, to lay down one’s life for one’s friends’ (15.13). The value of the concept of friendship for ethics is suggested by the next statement, which says that the disciples are Jesus’ friends if they ‘do’ what he has commanded them by putting love into action (15.14). In antiquity, friendship was a topic in philosophical treatises on ethics, and John develops common aspects of this theme. If the highest form of friendship involves equality, Jesus moves in this direction by saying that his disciples are not his slaves but his friends. If friends are to speak the truth freely and openly with each other (παρρησία), then this is the way Jesus addresses his followers (Rabens, pp. 128-30).</p>
<p>It is clear that relating love to the ideal of friendship can influence actions within the believing community, but the question is whether it has any signiﬁcance for behavior outside that community. One aspect is suggested by the importance of truthful and open speech in all of one’s relationships. Jesus said that he spoke the truth openly (παρρησία) ‘to the world’, when he taught in synagogues and in the temple where all Jews came together (18.20; cf. 7.26). By analogy, his followers should openly speak the truth to the world as well (Zimmermann, pp. 74-79). Another aspect is that the philosophical ideal is to ‘lay down one’s life for one’s friends’, which Jesus does through his cruciﬁxion (15.13). Yet the cruciﬁxion goes beyond friendship in a way that transforms conventional thinking about it as an ethical ideal. According to John, Jesus gave himself not only for his friends, but as ‘the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world’ (1.29). He did not only give his life for those with whom he was already in relationship, but gave his life to create new relationships with a world estranged from God (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0142064X13495133">Koester 2008</xref>: 108-23). That in turn presses his followers to see self-sacriﬁce as a way of serving a community of friends as well as looking beyond it to engage the wider world.</p>

<title>The Interplay of Love, Life and Truth</title>
<p>Reading these essays together shows that love is only one factor in shaping human actions according to the Fourth Gospel, and we do well to ask how love relates to other narrative themes. ‘Life’ (ζωή) plays a central role. Theologically, God the Father has life in himself and is the source of life for others (5.26). As the Word and Son of God, Jesus also has inherent life, which characterizes his identity (1.1-4; 5.26). Jesus is the bread of life (6.35) and the bringer of the light of life (8.12). He is the resurrection and the life (11.25), and the way, the truth and the life (14.6). He came that people might have life in abundance (10.10). As the one who embodies and gives life, Jesus conveys life through his own actions of healing, feeding and giving life to the dead, as well as through the words that evoke the faith that the Gospel considers to be integral to authentic life (Zimmermann, pp. 54-55). So if people ask, ‘What should I do?’, one might respond, ‘Do what gives life’.</p>
<p>God’s giving of life in Jesus is directed toward the world as a whole. Mira Stare notes that Jesus comes to bring life ‘to the world’, which encompasses all of humanity (6.33, 51; cf. 1.4). In John, ‘life’ is a relational concept that includes a life-giving relationship with God as well as with other people. People enter true life through faith and live out that life through love, as they are sent into the world (13.34-35; 17.1-3, 21-23; Stare, pp. 213-28). These observations can be related to those of Christos Karakolis, who explores the way in which the love and life-giving care of Jesus are expressed in his own actions as well as those of his followers. He suggests that Jesus’ singular ‘work’ (ἔργον) encompasses his whole soteriological mission, while his ‘works’ in the plural are the concrete deeds through which he carries it out in the world. The related term ‘signs’ (σημεῖα) pertains to works with a miraculous quality (Karakoulis, p. 203; cf. Löhr, pp. 229-49).</p>
<p>Karakoulis’s comments show the interrelationship of love and life in Jesus’ signs and works. Jesus gives life to a dying child and to the dead Lazarus. He heals the lame and blind, and provides people with wine and bread. Such works show compassion and reveal God’s love for the world and his desire that it have life. By extension, Jesus’ followers will also seek to bring life and love to the world through concrete actions (Karakoulis, pp. 204-205). We might make these observations more pointed by adding that Jesus extends his gift of life even to the unbelieving. He healed a man at Bethzatha, even though the man expressed no faith and ended up reporting Jesus to the hostile authorities (5.1-18). Then Jesus gave food to a crowd that misunderstood him and later turned away in unbelief (6.1-71). In terms of ethics, those dynamics underscore that the extension of the gift of life takes the form of tangible actions, such as healing and feeding, and it is not limited to situations where the gift will be reciprocated.</p>
<p>Love and life function together with a third narrative element, which is truth. John’s Gospel says that God is true (3.33) and that the incarnate Word was full of grace and truth (1.14), so that Jesus himself can be called the truth (14.6). That aspect of Jesus’ identity is expressed in his actions, for he came into the world to bear witness to the truth (18.36-37). The importance of truth is evident in Jesus’ encounters with people throughout the narrative. Jesus speaks the truth about people, even when circumstances would otherwise conceal it. He exposes the ignorance of Nicodemus (3.1-10), tells the Samaritan woman about her life (4.16-18), and identiﬁes the inconsistencies and murderous intentions of his adversaries (7.14-31; 8.31-59; 9.40-41). Paul Anderson proposes linking disputes about truth to different phases in the development of Johannine Christianity, suggesting that discerning the truth was integral to the patterns of leadership in the community that produced John’s Gospel and the Johannine Epistles (pp. 290-318).</p>
<p>Given the prominence of this theme, one might respond to the ethical question ‘What should I do?’ by saying, ‘Do what is true’. The Gospel uses such language when speaking about human behavior. It distinguishes those who do what is evil from those who ‘do what is true’ (ὁ δε ποιῶν τὴν ἀλήθειαν), whose ‘deeds have been done in God’ (3.21). We might bring the theme of truth more directly into discussion of this volume’s central thesis by noting that the narrative does provide critical reflection on the ethical implications of doing what is true. It shows that those who wrongly judge by appearances rather than right judgment (7.24) translate falsehood into action by condemning Jesus for healing and claiming to be from God, and by expelling the man born blind from the community after he spoke the truth about his healer (8.46-47, 59; 9.24-34). Those who falsely see Jesus as a political threat plan to kill the risen Lazarus for contributing to Jesus’ popularity (12.9-11). For a time Pilate seems ready to act on the basis of truth by releasing Jesus, whom he rightly judges to be guiltless, but falsehood prevails when Pilate condemns the innocent Jesus to death (18.38-40; 19.16). By way of contrast, Jesus speaks the truth that God is the source of life, and his acts of healing and feeding are congruent with that central truth (1.4, 14; 5.21; 10.32, 37-38).</p>
<p>Drawing together the themes of the essays noted above suggests that in the Fourth Gospel ethical action is discerned through the interplay of at least three elements.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0142064X13495133">2</xref></sup> No one of these elements is adequate when taken alone. When asking, ‘What should I do?’, love is a factor, yet authentic love expresses the truth about God and the world, and the actions that love produces ultimately foster life. For example, Jesus loves the disciples, and that means telling them the truth about themselves rather than allowing love to mask the truth (13.1, 38). Again, Jesus’ adversaries may attempt to foster life for the people by suppressing the truth and killing Jesus, but the Gospel shows that this way of trying to foster life is unethical (11.45-53).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0142064X13495133">
<title>Ethics in Relation to Jesus and Jewish Law</title>
<p>The complexity of ethical discernment in the Fourth Gospel is evident in that both Jesus and his adversaries ground their conduct theologically. Both connect right actions to an understanding of who God is. For the Jewish authorities in the narrative, God’s will is communicated through the law of Moses. When asking, ‘What should I do?’, their response would be ‘Follow the law’ because that is where the wisdom of God is found. Yet the Fourth Gospel ascribes many of the traits of God’s wisdom to Jesus, who was with God in the beginning, descended from God to instruct the world, was rejected by many, and re-ascended to a place with God (Glicksman, pp. 83-101). Jesus claims to communicate what he received directly from God. He does so in a manner that is not derived from the law and yet is congruent with the law (5.39-47; 7.14-18). So when asking, ‘What should I do?’, the Fourth Evangelist’s response would be ‘Follow Jesus’.</p>
<p>The difference between these perspectives is evident in the narratives of disputes over the Sabbath. Jesus argues that it is right to heal on the Sabbath, even in cases like the invalid at Bethzatha and man born blind, whose lives are not in danger. The reason is that God gives life each day of the week, including the Sabbath, and Jesus also gives life (5.1-47; 9.1-41). In contrast, Jesus’ opponents argue that such healings are wrong because they violate the command to refrain from work on the Sabbath. Although some interpreters argue that Jesus simply interprets the law in a new and more expansive way, William Loader maintains that Jesus replaces the law. The contrast between the law and Christ ‘is not bad and good, but good and better’ (p. 150). The Gospel presupposes some of the values attested in the law, but it insists that those who follow the witness of the law ultimately move beyond it, so that they must center their perspective on ethics in Jesus (cf. Lund, pp. 269-73).</p>
<p>The Johannine Jesus and his opponents sometimes agree on certain ethical principles, which are attested in the law, though they work out the implications differently. For example, the narrative shows that both agree that blasphemy is wrong, as the law said. The disputed issue is whether Jesus’ claim to be one with God does or does not constitute blasphemy (10.30-33; Labahn, p. 29). Jan van der Watt proposes that the disputes in the Gospel are not about the value of the law itself, but over conflicting perspectives on the law. Jesus’ opponents interpret the Sabbath law through history and tradition, basing their condemnation of Jesus’ healings on a narrow view of his violation of Sabbath regulations. In contrast, the Gospel advocates a broader view, which reflects ‘theological common sense’ by recognizing that healing shows divine action and approval, which means that healing on the Sabbath is not against God’s law. To support this contention, the Gospel effectively shows that the opponents are the ones who violate the principles in the Decalogue because they seek their own honor and refuse to honor God, and they bear false witness against Jesus, which leads to his unlawful death, which violates the command against killing. In the end, van der Watt’s perspective is not so different from Loader’s emphasis on the centrality of Christ, since he ﬁnds that what gives a person the perspective needed to understand the law and to perform the appropriate ethical action is coming to faith in Jesus, who reveals the will of God (van der Watt, pp. 175-91).</p>
<p>Karl Weyer-Menkhoff expands the discussion by exploring the connection between faith in Jesus and the narrative portions of the law. He emphasizes that faith is not a self-generated or autonomous action, but a relationship that is generated in response to Jesus. As people are brought to faith, they are moved to act according to the pattern set by Jesus, whose own actions are congruent with what he sees his Father doing (5.19). Weyer-Menkhoff sees an interplay between the works of God depicted in Jewish Scripture and the works of Jesus portrayed in John. For example, the betrothal stories in Genesis and Exodus show God guiding Isaac’s servant, Jacob, and Moses toward new relationships that emerge beside a well. In a similar way, Jesus’ journey to the well in Samaria shows him carrying out the work of God through his encounter with the Samaritan woman by the well in Jn 4 (pp. 159-74).</p>
<p>The problem with this approach is that it shows readers only <italic>that</italic> they have to respond to the work of God, but it says little about <italic>what</italic> they should do or how they might draw more broadly on biblical narrative for ethical deliberation (p. 174). The challenge of deriving a speciﬁc course of action from the Fourth Gospel raises again the question of how much responsibility people actually have for ethical discernment, according to John.</p>

<title>Empowerment and Freedom for Ethical Action</title>
<p>Earlier we noted Wayne Meeks’s critique of Johannine ethics, which argued that the Gospel not only lacks ethical guidance, but denies that people had the freedom to make ethical decisions. From this perspective, the Gospel has a deterministic worldview in which there are two groups of people, those who are from below and those who are born from above; and it is only those who are chosen out of the world who can live in an ethical manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0142064X13495133">Meeks 1996</xref>: 319). Some of the essays in the present volume, however, generally reframe the issue in a more positive way, opening up directions for further research.</p>
<p>One aspect concerns the issue of being empowered for ethical action. The worldview of John’s Gospel is that the world is not a neutral sphere in which people simply determine a course of action by rational choice. People are subject to influence by the forces of truth and falsehood, life and death, love and hate. Such a worldview does not reduce human life to a predetermined course of action, but it recognizes that ethical decisions are made in the context of competing forms of influence, which is why the Gospel must call people to faith and obedience (10.38; 12.36; cf. Eynikel, pp. 102-13).</p>
<p>John was not alone in assuming that an ethical life involves formative influences. Volker Rabens notes that the Stoics could speak of a person’s nature changing for the better as it was infused with the material πνεῦμα, thus enabling them to live in accordance with nature, while Philo understood the πνεῦμα as that which binds people to God and empowers ethical action. The Fourth Gospel also recognizes the need for ethical empowerment, since one can only obey the command to give love if one has ﬁrst experienced love through life in community and the Spirit-Paraclete that is active there (Rabens, pp. 114-39). Love—a factor that is integral to John’s ethical vision—cannot be self-generated. It is the fruit of a relationship with Jesus, which is experienced in community. Believers are like the branches of a vine, which receive the love they in turn give to others (Caragounis, pp. 250-63).</p>
<p>To further this discussion, one might note that the Gospel can make sharp distinctions between the community and the world, and depict actions falling into the categories of light and darkness, but the Gospel also subverts those distinctions through its narrative. A good example is the Samaritan woman, whose responses to Jesus are remarkably ambiguous. She recognizes that he is a Jewish man and a prophet, but stops short of actually identifying him as Messiah and never makes an open profession of faith. Yet she is the one who <italic>acts</italic> as a disciple by inviting others to ‘Come and see’, whereas the disciples who openly profess faith fail to act in this way (4.28-33; cf. 1.39, 46). Later the man born blind repeatedly speaks the truth even before he says, ‘I believe’ (9.11, 17, 24-38). John also recognizes that those who do profess faith in Jesus are capable of enormous moral failings, such as Peter following Jesus and yet lying about his identity as a disciple (18.15-27). The Gospel pictures a situation that is dynamic rather than static, where the insiders may act faithlessly and others may do what is true, at least to some extent.</p>
<p>A second aspect concerns John’s use of a few key principles, which are stated briefly and presented in characters and images, instead of giving detailed directives about behavior. Glen Lund observes that in practice the Johannine community would have understood ethical behavior in the light of communal values that were shaped by Jewish tradition and memories of Jesus but were not codiﬁed in written form. When dealing with questions of behavior, they would have to work with the values presupposed by the group. There is a positive aspect to this approach, for John’s Gospel ‘replaces detailed, rigid regulation with a more dynamic and open-ended standard for determining morality’ (p. 282). An approach that is ‘based on broad principles, fleshed out through participation in mystic union with God, is much freer, simpler and more responsive than a system based on ﬁxed rules or traditions’ (p. 284). That gave the community the flexibility to develop patterns that ﬁt their situation, which evolved over time (cf. Labahn, p. 42).</p>
<p>Along these lines, one might compare the Johannine approach to using a compass rather than a map to determine a course of action. The basic commitments to love, truth and life are the primary points of reference, which enable people to keep their bearings as they traverse the distinctive challenges of their social landscape. In practice there might be several viable routes through a complex topography, all of which make use of the key reference points in various ways. At the same time, a particular path might depart too far from one of them and require community discernment to call for a different direction. The use of a few key ideas, which can easily be remembered—instead of longer and more complex instructions—provides a community with common points to which people might appeal when seeking consensus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0142064X13495133">Koester 2003</xref>: 264-70).</p>
<p>The danger in providing this degree of freedom and responsibility for ethical discernment is that the quest for consensus may fail, and some within a community may determine that the interpretations advocated by others have negated the basic values of the group. The Johannine Epistles attest to just such a situation (Lund, pp. 280-81).</p>

<title>Ethics in 1 John</title>
<p>The struggle reflected in 1 John centers on a division within the community over matters of belief and behavior. One aspect involved a dispute over the question of Jesus’ humanity, which was a matter of faith, yet the dispute culminated in some members leaving the community, which was an action that violated the command to ‘love one another’ (1 Jn 2.7-11, 29; 3.11). Jeffrey Brickle observes that the author’s response to the ethical problem of breaking fellowship (κοινωνία) had multiple dimensions. The basis for ethical behavior is following the love command and example of Jesus, so that one will ‘walk’ as Christ walked (2.6; 3.11). That way of life means maintaining fellowship with the author’s group rather than those who have left, since they ally themselves with the world and its hatred and lust (2.9-17). For Brickle, the author of 1 John does not so much argue his case as repeat his perspective multiple times in order to reinforce the importance of remaining connected to Jesus, the tradition and the community (Brickle, pp. 340-49).</p>
<p>A more critical perspective is offered by Tom Thatcher, who emphasizes the ethical paradox created by 1 John. While stressing the command to ‘love one another’, the writer shows a hateful attitude toward opponents, who are viliﬁed as antichrists, and he warns readers not to love the world (2.15-19). Thatcher proposes that 1 John used the memory of Cain and Abel as a template (3.8-15). According to Gen. 4.4-5, God found Abel’s actions acceptable and those of Cain unacceptable, and the writer of 1 John inferred that each of them acted out of his own underlying character, which God judged accordingly. The author does the same in his own situation, associating his own group with Abel and his opponents with Cain. The problem is that if his situation simply manifests an age-old tension between two kinds of people, then there are no resources for conflict resolution. The author could simply write off the opponents because they were acting according to their spiritual descent and nothing could be done about it (Thatcher, pp. 350-73). One problem is whether the brief mention of Cain in 1 Jn 3.12 allows the story to function so broadly as a template.</p>
<p>The essay by Udo Schnelle suggests a more positive reading of 1 John by returning to love as that which deﬁnes God’s own character. Schnelle points out that the passage that says ‘God is love’ (4.8, 16) also speaks of divine love coming to expression through God’s sending of the Son into the world, which is the realm of sin and alienation. For love to reach its goal it must overcome sin through the atoning action of Christ, who does not accept the world as it is but is the Savior of the world. Through this action, a community of love is created (4.9-16; pp. 332-35). Although Schnelle emphasizes the community as the place where God’s love is made visible (p. 331), he can also say that ‘God’s love aims for the inclusion of all creation into the unity with the Father and the Son which gives true life’ (p. 330).</p>
<p>Schnelle does not take up Thatcher’s question about how such an emphasis on love can be reconciled with the harsh language used for those who have separated from the community, but the interplay of love, truth and life that emerged in other parts of this volume suggest lines for further exploration, since those themes appear in 1 John as well as the Gospel. An intriguing dimension is that 1 John recognizes that the forces operative among the opponents might also be present in his own group. If he warns about the antichrists who work through deception (2.18, 26; 4.1-6), he also tells his own group that they deceive themselves if they say they are without sin (1.8-10). The result is that 1 John gives self-criticism an integral place in its ethical vision (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0142064X13495133">McGinn 2000</xref>: xv-xvi, 77, 82, 278-80).</p>
<p>A second aspect concerns the nature of human action in relation to the world. When the writer of 1 John warns readers not to love the world, he explains that it means not turning love toward the desires of the flesh, greed and pride, which characterize ‘the world’ where the evil one operates (2.15-16; 5.19). But the writer insists that God’s action was to send the Son in order to save the world from sin (2.2; 4.14). The response of the faithful is to ‘overcome’ the world’s deception by attesting to the truth of God that gives life (4.4; 5.4-5, 11).</p>
<p>The points of agreement and difference between the contributions in this volume will stimulate further work on the question of Johannine ethics. The attention to narrative as a form of critical reflection on human actions, and the recognition that multiple literary and theological themes are at work in these texts, opens up fresh avenues for consideration of this important topic. The essays invite a broader reassessment of the way the ethical dimensions of New Testament texts might best be understood, and renewed attention to the way in which the Johannine writings might suggest a centered approach that remains dynamic in its view of the Christian community and the world.</p>

<p>Glen Lund also notes the interplay of multiple elements. He relates the love command to the command to keep or abide in Jesus’ word (14.23-24; 15.7), as Urban von Wahlde suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0142064X13495133">1990</xref>), but he adds a third element, which is the command that the disciples be sent into the world (17.18; 20.21; Lund, pp. 276-77).</p>
