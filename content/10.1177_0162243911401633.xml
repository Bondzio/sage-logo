<abstract>
<p>The interventionist turn in science and technology studies (STS) increasingly involves researchers with practices of technology development and thus entails the need for appropriate methodologies. Based in software engineering, this article introduces the deconstructive technique of “mind scripting” as a method for analyzing processes of the co-materialization of gender and technology and as a tool to support cooperative, reflective work practices. Anchored in critical design approaches, “mind scripting” is a means for development teams to disclose discourses implicitly guiding work practices in order to make negotiable the underlying value systems. After discussing its foundation in deconstructivist feminist theory, the author illustrates how the method is applied by drawing on selected empirical results. Generating insights into the reproduction of hegemonic social discourses in development processes, “mind scripting” enables the rethinking of established ways of doing.</p>

<body>
<p>As highlighted by the rich body of literature on the social shaping of technology, on the co-construction of society and technology and on the gender implications of these processes, software development is a sociotechnological process of negotiating and constructing meaning (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0162243911401633">Floyd 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0162243911401633">Cockburn and Omrod 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0162243911401633">Nørbjerg and Kraft 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0162243911401633">Zorn et al. 2007</xref>). In everyday development practice, common knowledge and social discourses become operative as hidden assumptions and belief systems. Feminist science and technology studies (STS) have argued with the genderedness of software artifacts of key computing concepts and of development processes and methods (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0162243911401633">Adam 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0162243911401633">Oudshoorn, Rommes, and Stienstra 2004</xref>). Moreover, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0162243911401633">Donna Haraway (1985)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0162243911401633">Karen Barad (1998)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0162243911401633">Suchman, Trigg, and Blomberg (2002)</xref> have theorized sociotechnological design as situated, embodied practice configuring new alignments between the social and the material. Conceptualizing gender as a social practice and a performative act (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0162243911401633">Butler 1997</xref>) coupled with an understanding of technological artifacts as material-discursive constructions highlights the co-materialization of gender and technology.</p>
<p>Due to the impact that information technology has gained on our quality of life, critical design approaches suggest that designers reflect their meaning-constructing work practices and integrate value-based perspectives. By focusing on gender, such cultural critique seeks to learn how social discourses and gendered knowledge unconsciously inform software development. This means asking which function this implicit knowledge fulfils in development processes and how methods and concepts of computing can be analyzed in terms of their gendered character. In development practice, labels such as “gender and diversity” often remain obscured or activate ideas about gender-specific (also, e.g., culture-specific) requirements, attributing special needs to female consumers (or other user groups). Thus, a key question is how software developers can make transparent these assumptions and belief systems and, thus, overcome pitfalls of stereotyping and allow for conscious decision making. How can they make implicit knowledge on gender discourses operative in a productive way? These questions entail two important issues: the need for a methodology for identifying gender-relevant aspects in practices and their implicit theories <italic>and</italic> the need to provide a method-supported process to feed new insights back into development projects.</p>
<p>To provide an approach to these issues, I draw on deconstructivist theory. Deconstructivist feminist theory proceeds from a postmodern conception of gender that disavows “femininity” and “masculinity” as ontological coherent identities while referring to non-unitary subjectivities that contextually oscillate between different gendered subject positions. These subject positions intersect with enactments of class, “race,” ethnicity, and sexuality. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0162243911401633">Suchman (2008</xref>, 140) has summarized,<disp-quote>
<p>[f]eminist research shares with poststructuralist approaches [...] the premise that the durable and compulsory character of categorisations and associated politics of difference are reproduced through ongoing reiterations, generated from within everyday social action and interaction. Correspondingly, the consequences of those re-enactments are intelligible only as the lived experiences of specifically situated, embodied persons.</p>
</disp-quote>Regarding sociotechnological processes, I therefore suggest analyzing and reflecting cooperative work practices in which social meaning is reconstructed and ideologies of gender difference are inscribed to artifacts and use practices. Reflective research and intervention also methodologically need to be supported by a deconstructivist procedure. For this purpose, I elaborate the method of “mind scripting” that allows a collective to deconstruct unconscious sense making and enables negotiations on the adequateness of implicit assumptions guiding decision making. Raising transparency in this respect pursues various objectives: Ideally, the gained insights result in software that embodies cultural critique in that it is designed by deconstructing its inscribing normativity. More importantly, reflecting established ways of doing initiates a learning process within development teams that enhances their knowledge on the entanglement of societal hegemonies and sociotechnological processes.</p>
<p>The article is organized as follows: The next section outlines the research tradition that has influenced this work and the reason for choosing a deconstructive approach. Then, I discuss the theoretical and methodological underpinning of “mind scripting” and explain how it is applied. By presenting selected examples of two case studies, I demonstrate how the method can be used to deconstruct development practices and concepts of computing in terms of their gendered character. The final section discusses the method’s applicability in practice.</p>
<sec id="section1-0162243911401633">
<title>Methods in Design Research</title>
<p>Even though empirical design research is a growing field, only few approaches combine qualitative research with the improvement of development methods and processes. Giving a comprehensive overview of these is beyond the scope of this article (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0162243911401633">Dittrich et al. 2007</xref>); however, I briefly outline the methods used to grasp social dimensions in design practice.</p>
<p>The STS research in engineering has strongly focused on ethnography, using participant observation for understanding epistemic cultures from an insider’s perspective and ethnomethodology to address the methods that developers use to cooperate. In ethnographically inspired fieldwork, researchers learn from experiencing unexpected events or clashes with the culture studied (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0162243911401633">Robinson, Segal, and Sharp 2007</xref>). “Mind scripting,” in contrast, is a collective method in which results are gained through negotiating meaning constructions between participants. Deconstruction excites astonishment of all participants and aims to temporarily disclose an outsider’s point of view to developers. Critical design approaches, such as participatory design (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0162243911401633">Bødker and Pekkola 2010</xref>), value-sensitive and reflective approaches support intervention by a variety of analytical and interactionist methods. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0162243911401633">Wright and McCarthy (2005)</xref> have introduced a remarkable approach that frames participatory design as creative dialogue. Users and designers not only draw on different bodies of knowledge they also represent different centers of values, attitudes, and motivations. Thus, the authors suggest opening a dialogical space in which creative response can be forged. However, in regard to the performativity of gender discourses and their identity-informing reiterations, I suggest that deconstruction best triggers the creative response because users may rely on gendered constructions similar to designers. Value-sensitive and reflective approaches conceptualize critical reflection itself as a core technology in design. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0162243911401633">Mathiassen’s (2002)</xref> “Reflective Systems Development” strives to shape understandings of systems development for software process improvement. His comprehensive framework represents work practices using maps of development practices, diaries, and formalizations of methods and processes. To bring about innovation in case of technical impasses, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0162243911401633">Agre’s (1997)</xref> “Critical Technical Practice” suggests identifying core metaphors framing the development of technologies. When working with these metaphors, the analysis of what has been marginalized allows the integration of previously disregarded issues. While Mathiassen mainly integrates interpretive methods, Agre’s deconstructivist move opens abandoned perspectives by integrating what has been constitutively outside. “Value-sensitive Design” introduced by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0162243911401633">Friedman, Kahn, and Borning (2006)</xref> suggests putting values in the center of system design. To answer questions such as “How do stakeholders prioritize competing values in design trade offs?” they use the entire range of socioscientific methods, such as observations, interviews, or measurement of user behavior. Evolving from the field of human–computer interaction, “Reflective Design” refers to bringing awareness to unconscious aspects of user experience. In this spirit, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0162243911401633">Sengers and colleagues (2005)</xref> frame their approach as “designing for appropriation,” which inspires designers to open spaces for users to reflect on how technology influences their engagement in activities. A most innovative aspect is the transgression of boundaries between designing and using by “actively building for co-construction of meaning between users, systems, and designers” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0162243911401633">Sengers et al. 2005</xref>, 56). Methodically, they draw on the aforementioned approaches but emphasize that users shall be encouraged to reflect.</p>
<p>Against this background, I suggest that “mind scripting” can add a valuable dimension to these rich approaches. Introducing deconstruction provides a path for making tangible, in a non-essentialising way, the dynamics in which gender, societal hegemonies, and software are coproduced. Being based on an elaborate deconstructivist methodology, “mind scripting” provides a framework that captures the sociocultural complexity of software development as a material-discursive construction process. Compared to the values and goals of the previously mentioned approaches, it clearly pursues the deconstruction of ideologies of difference. Beside gender, “mind scripting” also inspires one to learn how to approach enactments of other differences (e.g., based on class, ethnicity, or heteronormativity) and to question how the consequences of these re-enactments co-materialize with technological phenomena such as methods, processes, and artifacts.</p>

<title>Mind Scripting as Deconstructive Design Approach</title>
<p>The method of “mind scripting” is based on memory work, a socioscientific method developed by sociologist Frigga Haug and colleagues (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0162243911401633">Haug 1999</xref>; Haug et al. 1999). Theoretically grounded in critical psychology, Marxist theory, and theories of culture and ideology, memory work is a collective method for investigating the processes by which individuals construct themselves into existing social relations. It asks how subjects have appropriated structures and discourses and how individuals and collectives reproduce these through everyday theories and sense making. With the objective of questioning social conditions and ideologies that colonize a field, it argues for active intervention and change.</p>
<p>Making use of memory work in software development processes, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0162243911401633">Allhutter and Hanappi-Egger (2005)</xref> adapted the method to be applied for tracing the interconnectedness of societal discourses and development practices and called this adaptation “mind scripting.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0162243911401633">1</xref>
</sup> This article elaborates on how its objective and methodology are adjusted to deconstructivist feminist theory. Deconstruction questions the normativity of discourses and practices by revealing the constructedness of seemingly “natural” sense making. Gender is understood as a knowledge category informing and being informed by sociotechnological practices. Since “mind scripting” is a research method <italic>and</italic> a tool for developers to reflect their work practices, it challenges the reproduction of gendered power relations and discursive hegemonies that are coproduced through the developers practices and objectifications. Akin to memory work, “mind scripting” is a discourse analytical and linguistic method of deconstruction, working with written memories, which are understood as narratives that people resort to when making sense out of social experiences. The method deals with how developers construct themselves into educational and professional structures and cultures and how these subjectivation processes translate into inherent professional self-conceptions and into work practices. Deconstructing concepts crucial to specification and implementation practices and investigating how gender discourses implicitly inform seemingly technology-centered design decisions discloses the unconscious guiding assumptions that shape processes and artifacts.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0162243911401633">
<title>Theoretical and Methodological Implications</title>
<p>The collectivity of the procedure makes Haug’s methodology especially beneficial to researching and supporting cooperative work practices. All members of the development team collectively deconstruct written memories in order to investigate shared meaning constructions and to compare diverging perceptions. Deconstruction investigates the formation of constructs and not their final effects; therefore, the memory texts not only serve as an analytical source but also the process of negotiating constructions.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0162243911401633">2</xref>
</sup> Indeed, “mind scripting” conceives of human beings in collective and cooperative terms.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0162243911401633">3</xref>
</sup> While, for example, ethnographic research uses the experience of developers as the starting point but relies on the outsiders' perspectives of researchers, “mind scripting” presupposes that developers act as research subjects and objects at the same time. Disregarding organizational hierarchies (or scientific-expert status), all participants engage equally in the analysis that integrates research with a reflective learning process. In collective work, individuals can complement each other in terms of their knowledge and perceptions. The benefit of the method lies in comparing different perspectives by pitting one experience against another. According to Haug, experiences may be seen as lived practice in the memory of a self-constructed identity. Memories structure the process whereby subjects perceive any given situation. They are fragmented and contradictory; their meaning is continually reconstructed and, in this sense, memories are essential for individual and collective sense making in the present. Subjects integrate contradicting experiences and therefore interpret, transform, and reconstruct their memories. Consequently, Haug argues that deconstructing and comparing written memories can be used as a source for disclosing collective meaning constructions. It enables the analysis of constructions that system designers have appropriated in their professional field, through public discourses and everyday experiences.<disp-quote>
<p>[T]he absence of contradictions in our self-interpretations will to a large extent be constructed by us; contradictions are forgotten and omitted, left unperceived. While to a degree, it is our use of such constructions that enables us to get by in the world, they ultimately prevent us from gaining a proper grip on reality. (Haug et al. 1999, 40)</p>
</disp-quote>For the written narratives, this means that the individual puts much effort into telling coherent stories of himself/herself, but, in the deconstruction, opposing experiences become visible as breaks in logic, blind spots and naturalized causal relations.</p>
<p>While memory work was primarily developed to research processes of subjectivation, “mind scripting” aims to analyze processes of meaning construction that inform sociotechnological practices. In a long-term perspective, “mind scripting” pursues the ideology-critical and change-oriented goals set forth by Haug. By strengthening cooperative work practices, the method enables shop-floor developers to co-shape the content of their work and to negotiate value systems. Furthermore, learning processes of this kind shall deepen the team’s understanding of its accountability when shaping technologies that strongly have an impact on peoples' work life and everyday life.</p>
<p>From a deconstructivist perspective, a point of criticism is how memory work has been used to research processes of “female” subjectivation. While the center of the method involves pitting different perceptions against each other in order to question hegemonic ideologies, conclusions on the different ways that women and men work themselves into society tend to follow an essentializing notion of gender-different socializtion. Memory work’s question of how women’s experiences are constructed in memory texts has generated enlightening revelations of society’s confining contradictions that lie obscured by gendered constructions and their embodied social practices. Haug and colleagues, however, tend to reproduce gender dichotomies using “female” and “male” experiences as analytical categories of difference. Comparing women’s texts against men’s texts reveal “female” as well as “male” subject positions in both sorts of texts; however, the dichotomy itself is not deconstructed.</p>
<p>In contrast, for theoretical and practical reasons, “mind scripting” restrains from putting the gender of participants on the map. First, the hegemonic construction of the technological sphere as a male domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0162243911401633">Faulkner 2007</xref>) and a respective gendered division of labor in technical fields still prevail. When dominant perceptions associate “gender” with women and not with men, this could lead to unfavorable group dynamics. However, second and foremost, the objective of “mind scripting” is not to conceive gender as a dichotomous category of difference but to trace the performativity of gender discourses in sociotechnological practices and theories. Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0162243911401633">Haraway’s (1988)</xref> disavowal of the “female” subject of experience, the method nonetheless accounts for the situated and embodied knowledge of developers by envisaging their collective and diverging self-conceptions as professionals (which are, of course, inherently gendered).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0162243911401633">
<title>Applying Mind Scripting for Feminist Analysis and Intervention</title>
<p>To illustrate how to apply the method, I refer to two case studies<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0162243911401633">4</xref>
</sup> conducted with commercial development teams, one in game design and a second in search engine development. While reflecting their own work practices, the participating teams gained insights into their team culture, on gender aspects of their ongoing development projects and on the sociotechnological concepts from which they draw. In this way, “mind scripting” is a means to inform practice-based development from a gender-critical perspective <italic>and</italic>, at the same time, to rethink theories, concepts, and methods of computing (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0162243911401633">Allhutter and Hanappi-Egger 2006</xref>). In order to gain a deeper understanding of the performativity that “gender” unfolds in design practices, we traced the discursive practices that silently become operative when making design decisions. As the concept of “genderscripts” has shown, artifacts are co-shaped by implicit beliefs such as gendered assumptions on future use contexts (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0162243911401633">Oudshoorn and Pinch 2008</xref>). “Mind scripting” draws from this concept but focuses on the design process in that it seeks to deconstruct the implicitly gendered character of conceptions (e.g., quality requirements) that inform work practices. In this spirit, it is designed to be implemented as reflexive process improvement that supports practice-based learning (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0162243911401633">Allhutter and Hofmann 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The “mind scripting” process consists of the following steps: Participants agree on an issue central to the actual design process; it may refer to a particular design phase or specification and implementation practices. They write a short text recording actual memories of a situation referring to the agreed-upon topic. About half a page in length, the texts are free in style except for one aspect: to enable participants to treat them with distance, they are written in the third-person and do not use the author’s name. Then, the actual “mind scripting” process—the deconstruction and comparison of texts—begins. By collectively deconstructing every text, participants search for representations of subjects, activities, emotions, and motivations. Each deconstruction takes about 45 minutes; therefore, four texts can be analyzed in a half-day workshop. Groups with more than twelve participants can be divided into subgroups, which report their results to each other. The deconstruction sessions are recorded in writing (or on tape) and finally analyzed comparatively according to the reading negotiated between participants. While reaching consensus is not an objective, diverging views and perceptions are to be recorded.</p>
<p>To specify appropriate topics for the case studies, we first conducted interviews with the teams that consisted of managers, system designers, programmers, and graphic and sound designers. This gave us an idea of the respective fields and organizational contexts. When we began cooperating with the game design company, they were in the initial phase of designing an adventure game. With this project, the team sought to significantly improve game quality in comparison to their former productions. By asking for the team members' conceptions of quality in game development, we learnt about their shared vision that better quality should primarily be achieved by improving graphical realism. In addition to quality standards such as functionality and usability, the team implicitly indicated the importance of dimensions such as atmosphere or emotions experienced by users. In contrast to objective quality criteria that are technologically feasible, these aspects were said to be subject to artistic talent but cannot be operationalized. When asked about the game’s target group, developers stated that possible group characteristics generally do not affect the game design. While the team had not defined target groups because it was producing for an unspecified mass market, interviewees implicitly incorporated generalizing assumptions on users when arguing for particular system specifications. Considering this impact of user representations, the topic chosen for “mind scripting” was intended to inspire reflections on quality standards from a user perspective: team members were asked to write about “The last time she or he tried out a computer game.”</p>
<p>Generally speaking, the team agrees upon a subject to which every participant can recall actual memories; the title should be worded in everyday language in order to ease the process of remembering. For the case study in search engine technologies, we agreed on the subject of “When they took a design-decision that was important to her or him.” The team was working on a new version of their core product. In interviews, the team members described their field as highly complex and abstract. A discrepancy was revealed between the strongly innovation-oriented and scientific approach to conceptual design and the rather pragmatic specification and implementation practices. Some of the interviewees deliberated on the fact that classifications of search engines are not neutral and thus do not generate objective search results (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0162243911401633">Bowker and Star 1999</xref>). Although subjectivity is unavoidable, the unfeasibility of objective methods was again seen as contravening operationalization in terms of envisaging a structured way of translating multifaceted relations to information systems. The narrower subject of our study was the prototypical development of a travel information system; this internal project sought to integrate a front-end and back-end component of the search engine, which until then had been separate subprojects. The “mind scripting” was conducted when the project failed to be complemented within the planned time scope due to severe coordination problems. The chosen title intended to reflect the team’s work practices and problem-solving strategies.</p>
<p>Although, in these cases, the researchers<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0162243911401633">5</xref>
</sup> identified a topic and chaired the “mind scripting” procedure, a team that has gone through such a process will easily be capable of accomplishing both on its own. After collecting the texts, an introductory workshop was held with both teams. We found it useful to provide some background on why memories are a valuable source of information, because we considered that it increases the readiness to engage with this experimental process. “Mind scripting” does not seek to reconstruct a situation but to ask how teams organize their experiences and give meaning to their actions. The texts do not speak of the author subject but are understood as contextual, selective, and temporal representations of the writer. When deconstructing, participants shall not analyze its author but learn about the process of meaning construction in this particular text. Deconstructing a text means taking it apart, separating content and formal aspects under the focus of how work practices are given meaning and how concepts relating to the respective development context are constructed. Therefore, participants need to agree on the following communication rules: Most importantly, they do not talk about how the author <italic>is</italic>, nor are they to assess the author's actions or views; they ask how she or he <italic>constructs</italic> himself or herself in the text. Generally, it does not pose a problem if the participants identify particular writers. During the deconstruction, however, authors should not reveal themselves nor should others be asked about the meaning of their text. Deconstructing a text means discussing and questioning perceptions, not interpreting its meaning.</p>
<p>A chairperson begins with a set of general questions and some questions specifically designed for the respective subject. This function may rotate but the person should have basic knowledge on social implications of software development. She or he can participate equally in the discussion but gives structure to the process and takes care that participants do not interpret but deconstruct. When starting the session, participants choose the text that first attracts their attention. In a first round, they agree on its main <italic>message</italic>. Reaching consensus quickly often hints to common priorities and beliefs. For example, memories on “The last time she or he tried out a computer game” were generally organized around the themes of anticipation and disappointment linked to quality claims of games. Texts on “When they took a design decision that was important to her or him” dealt with how to generate a common understanding of abstract conceptions.</p>
<sec id="section5-0162243911401633">
<title>Individual and Collective Self-Conceptions</title>
<p>Next, participants discuss the context of the described situation and how the writer presents himself or herself and other persons in terms of <italic>actions, interests</italic>, and <italic>emotions</italic>. The text is taken apart to see how its central meaning has been discursively constructed and staged linguistically. In order to deconstruct self-constructions and perceptions of others, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0162243911401633">Haug (1999</xref>, 212) suggests focusing on verbs read as notions of activity; on how writers motivate their activities and those of others; and on emotions that, in contrast to thoughts, express spontaneous reactions. As deconstructing the game developers' texts showed, the (implicit) task of telling the story from a user’s point of view induced writers to permanently switch between a professional perspective and a user perspective. Generally speaking, sections written from a professional viewpoint described material aspects of the game such as the interface and how it was technically done, for example, in terms of parameters. Like in the following passage, writers often emphasized characteristics particularly important to them due to their managerial, technical, or artistic functions:<disp-quote>
<p>[T]he graphic effects are absolutely state-of-the-art, the gameplay is fantastic, and the rest works very well. This impression materialises only after playing one to two hours, as the first levels of the game are not particularly demanding and the AI [artificial intelligence] of the opponents is by no means exploited.</p>
</disp-quote>What the participants have read as <italic>professional self-construction</italic> was characterized by a distant writing style, mostly using passive wording and thereby taking the author from the spotlight, while focusing on objectified descriptions of assessing a game. In contrast, in the sections which participants identified as written from a <italic>user perspective</italic>, writers appear as active subjects and enthusiastically described the particular emotions aroused when interacting with the game:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>The game offers him not only variety and excitement, but also funny moments and those ‘aha’ experiences that let the pleasant warmth of satisfaction emerge. Again, something accomplished. Again, something discovered. In these moments, the game rewards him with little titbits—either short video-sequences, or a new section of the game world opens itself.</p>
</disp-quote>Self-constructions of this kind were about diving into the game world as opposed to describing material aspects. Discursively, assessing the game from a professional perspective was linked to aspects such as production value and the comparative technological state of the art. The user perspective was thematically connected to the consumer price and the anticipation that a new game stands out against previously played games. The self-reflective element of “mind scripting” is not primarily to be located in the meaning construction within the texts but in the process of negotiating these meanings while deconstructing them. As noted previously, the outcome of “mind scripting” results from a collective process.</p>
<p>In this spirit, when finding this switching between perspectives in several texts, participants discussed how quality criteria have been staged in different texts. While dissecting the structure of a text, one of the participants found that there are “purely technical [criteria], such as loading times, which equipment you need, whether it is well aligned, graphics, sound. Then the non-technical, the purely emotional, how the atmosphere is staged, how the game absorbs'. Another participant carried on that ‘in the beginning it is quite professional, because [the writer] sifts through the features of the game. In between, it gets emotional’. Discussing the perspectives occurring in the text, a third contributor concluded that it is written ‘from both [perspectives]; professionally the graphics have to be ok. However, the writer doesn't describe in detail what is good about the graphics, just that it has an effect. This is not so professional; it sounds as if described by a player.” Carrying on it became explicit, that obviously checking standard quality criteria and objectifying them by discursive and linguistic means was collectively perceived as an expression of professionalism.</p>
<p>In regard to the user perspective, a second dichotomy could be identified revealing contradicting assumptions on users. Despite both the “professional” perspective as well as the perspective of “designers as users” articulated a preference for games with demanding aesthetics and content, several texts implied that ‘average’ users only buy games with mainstream characteristics:<disp-quote>
<p>[U]sually, he doesn't get beyond the intro [...] the reason is that most games often look good, but in essence, compared to the graphics, the games' depth is mostly underexposed [...] the packaging and presentation address certain target groups [...] that like cars with engine interior lights, and dull cool wannabe actors and actresses.</p>
</disp-quote>The developers' self-constructions as users, however, articulated rather self-confident perceptions of their own entertainment standards. As I will discuss later, the identified dichotomies, “objective/subjective” and “designers/average users,” had wider-reaching implications informing the teams' established practices.</p>
<p>Collectively shared discourses as well as diverging viewpoints are revealed by deconstructing professional self-conceptions of the team and of subgroups such as system designers or programmers. Moreover, negotiating team-cultural aspects makes visible how informal hierarchies and hegemonic viewpoints unfold in work practices. Examples of this aspect were found in the second case study in which the writers' self-constructions provided a reason to discuss task sharing and the distribution of competences and responsibilities. The integration of the previously mentioned subprojects involved a high level of complexity that made it difficult for the team to achieve a common understanding. The problems partly resulted from diverging perspectives that team members had developed due to their function in the project. This became clear when analyzing textual constructions like the following: “When everyone was finished [...] all were greatly surprised during the presentation of the result to the whole team […] when it became clear that the interface between the front-end and the back-end—hence the interface of these two teams—did not work.” As one of the participants analyzed, the writer equated the interface between the components with the interface between the two subgroups; other texts illustrated that they even used different group-internal names for the system to be developed. When proceeding to deconstruct the passage, a participant stated that “there apparently is a clear division of labor, namely, that everybody works on his own, and occasionally there are brief decision-meetings.” Another participant agreed: “That's right, it is the same in other texts, there are clear responsibilities for the parts but not for the interfaces.” In fact, nobody seemed to have been explicitly in charge of the interoperable interface of the overall system architecture. Different views on the question of which division of labor they had implicitly agreed on disclosed opposing expectations and accusations, as this section highlights:<disp-quote>
<p>He had repeatedly pointed out that an integration of the GUI [graphical user interface] and the backend is not yet sufficiently specified; on the fly, and without any further discussion, another person specified an integration from a backend perspective, he [the writer] had to implement this specification.</p>
</disp-quote>This and similar accounts led the designers to frame the analysis in terms of who was in charge of specific tasks and who took responsibility. The participants pointed out how unclear responsibilities unfold at the individual level: “The self-conception [of the writer] and his role do not coincide,” one of the designers remarked and analyzed that the writer “definitely presents himself as someone who […] knows that the specification does not yet fit, who points out and warns, who contributes or wants to contribute. But his role is to only implement things. The ‘plain-implementing’ and the ‘wanting-to-have-a-say’ in the specification is not quite favourable.”</p>
<p>Dittrich and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0162243911401633">2008</xref>, 237) stress that “[d]oing research in cooperation with software developing companies puts researchers in a situation influenced by contradicting interests, hierarchies and personal antagonism.” Being sensitive to issues of workplace politics is a crucial aspect. In this respect, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0162243911401633">Haug and colleagues (1999</xref>, 70) provide a helpful explanation of the meaning of textual self-representations and representations of others: the constructions of others in terms of their motivations and character traits have an important meaning for the coherence of our stories; the apparent incomprehensibility of their actions is a way of disguising our own and structural antagonisms. The following passage from yet another text helps to elaborate on this aspect. After narrating in detail the effects the coordination problems had on his workload, one participant noted that<disp-quote>
<p>[i]n a brief questioning […] he responded that he had understood the subject only partially and for three weeks had not exactly known for what the pieces were that had been implemented in this or that plug-in. [...] neither was there a comprehensive specification nor continuous minutes of the workshops or information on the changes made in the implementation of the backend.</p>
</disp-quote>The writer’s self-conception in the text was seen as describing someone who emphasizes that he is not involved in decision making and not heard. The dissociated writing style and the apparent linguistic elimination of other involved persons still imply that other people who have more autonomy or agency have failed. Similar to discussions on texts of other team members, this implicit representation of others, at first, provoked mutual accusations. Only when comparing deconstructions which incited similar reactions, the structural dimension of these uncertainties and accusations became apparent to the participants. Overall, the team members' professional self-conceptions were strongly centered on autonomy and heteronomy and hence the preconditions for assuming responsibility. The text-based method made it possible to abstract from particular persons and treat the described problems as structurally induced difficulties resulting from the unproductive separation of implementation from conceptual design. As I will show later, a second aspect contributing to the preliminary failure of the project was that again anticipated use contexts were obscured. As has been discussed above, assuming a general or average user frequently performs as a gendered practice.</p>

<title>Causalities and Contradictions</title>
<p>Haug suggests yet a number of other questions for going deeper into the construction mechanisms of the texts: Which assumptions of causalities can be found? Are there contradictions, interruptions and breaks in logic? As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0162243911401633">Haug and colleagues (1999</xref>, 52) explain, “we tend to conceptualise what we already know as the result of causal relations,” which seem self-evident but are by no means “natural.” In the case studies, analyzing causalities provided evidence of how design decisions were implicitly based on gender discourses. The use of clichés and popular metaphors is a very common form of verbalizing memories. Building on silent consensus, these forms act as obstacles to understanding. Thus, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0162243911401633">Haug and colleagues (1999</xref>, 62) define them “as the linguistic means by which we are socialised into heteronomy.” Questioning what they help to silence is a way of opening scopes of action. Such absences also become apparent through breaks in writing style or in logic, which, for example, argue opposing motives or attitudes. Hiding contradictions by linguistic ambiguities often obscures the real antagonisms in our lives. “The price we pay for the elimination of contradictions is acquiescence in a kind of narrow-mindedness that conflicts at every turn with the level of knowledge we have actually attained” (Haug et al. 1999, 69). In this respect, the collectivity of the process is fundamental as the group acts as a corrective to any harmonization of contradictions.</p>
<p>To reflect implicit work practices and concepts of computing, we still added some elements specific to the respective contexts. To intensify discussions on the issue of quality, we asked how “quality” and specific quality criteria are described. How is interacting with a game described, which actions and emotions are mentioned? After analyzing all memories, textual constructions, and negotiated meanings are compared. Only when merging the results of the deconstructions, collective processes of meaning construction, shared understandings, and diverging perspectives become transparent.</p>
<p>As described above, game developers differentiated “objectified” quality criteria from what really makes a game worth playing, namely, a captivating atmosphere and the chance to immerse themselves in a parallel world. Analyzing this construction revealed a contradiction appearing in most texts: the assessment of graphical realism occurred as obligatory and was thereby emphasized as an important indicator; whereas in the deconstruction, it was seen as a criterion that they condone in favor of more important factors. When aiming to identify blind spots in one of the texts it was noted that, contrary to most other texts, graphics was not mentioned as a quality criterion. In this text, quality was “more like ‘does it touch me?’ […] And you can not fix this by the graphics […]. So I find it relatively useless to dissect the quality of a game because it is about feeling ‘I like it’.” Similar points were made in other deconstruction sessions and one of the designers eventually disclosed the seemingly causal relation between graphics and quality. The focus on graphics—which guided their work practices in that they believed that improving graphical realism would lead to an advance in quality—was deconstructed as distracting from what they implicitly defined as more vital. Only by appealing to atmospheric and emotional sensations, a game develops an addiction factor. When discussing the subjective/objective dichotomy, the participants indicated that these subjective dimensions should be taken as criteria objectively contributing to quality: “In other texts, aspects like graphics […] are discussed […] in an objective tone ‘this is good, that not'; obviously there are established criteria […]. In contrast, this text is written in a very subjective way, like […] ‘it gives me a comforting feeling’. With regard to the game atmosphere, there apparently are no objective quality criteria.” Another participant replied: “[T]here are probably also no absolute quality standards in the other areas, but in the text it is formulated as if there were; I think that the author simply formulated it in a subjective way.” With this statement the participant indicated that it may make sense to approach subjectified criteria in a structured way too. When deconstructing further sections of the same text, one of the participants drew attention to the fact that when switching from subjectified to objectified game characteristics, user groups also appear. Throughout the texts and deconstruction session, the designers described their professional assessment, that is, checking objectified criteria, as being less important if the game succeeded on an affective user level.</p>
<p>The method’s benefit clearly lies in enabling a team to <italic>experience</italic> and question its collective sense making and in its potential to initiate and support a learning process. To elaborate on this argument, I want to return to some of the results we gained in the previously mentioned interviews. They pointed at how the team implemented the seemingly neutral requirement of graphical realism. While male game characters were modeled anatomically correct using photo references of real people, the only female character was modeled after an existing computer-generated character and lacked anatomical realism. It may not seem surprising that the requirement of graphical realism obviously did not contradict a fraudulent staging of female characters in the developers' eyes. A closer look at the gendered knowledge instructing this implementation practice, however, shows that the underlying convention of realism itself is not neutral. It was given meaning as a gendered practice that aims at constructing intelligible male and female characters and thereby renaturalizes culturally instituated fantasies of difference. Investigating the conceptions of “quality” with “mind scripting” revealed that construction mechanisms of objectified <italic>standards</italic> versus subjectified <italic>preferences</italic> had implications for specifying requirements of both sorts. By disregarding implicit standards like “atmosphere” and “user experiences” because of their subjectified character, the team obscured how their hidden assumptions on the “average” user had unconsciously informed their design decisions. The comparative deconstruction revealed that developers self-constrained their creativity due to the implicit construction of the “average” user as male and mainstream in every respect. This first experience with “mind scripting” enabled the team to begin to perceive how deeply this unconscious belief informs their work practices. The re-established dichotomy “professional/objective” versus “user-centered/subjective” prevented a negotiation of subjectified criteria. The construction of the stereotyped “average” user hindered the search for structured ways of operationalizing these implicit quality standards, while at the same time it obscured the sociocultural dimension of objectified standards. With the emerging question of whose subjective preferences need to be considered the focus shifted to future users. This opened an interest in gender as a relevant category for thinking about “atmosphere” or “user experience”—which would be an ideal next subject for “mind scripting.” When discussing the results of the case study, several participants suggested to consciously reflect the effects of stereotyping and became convinced that it is less about trying to include women as target groups but about not relying on conventional assumptions on gender differences. I argue that, while it would not do to merely report to the designers on how gender structures their conception of graphical realism, “mind scripting” provides a tool that step-by-step enables them to sharpen their analytical view on gendered sense-making processes.</p>
<p>In the study with the search engine team, we included questions, such as which obstacles to problem solving occur in the texts. How is the problem of integrating the front-end and the back-end described from the author’s perspective? How are the future use contexts for the travel information system referred to? As mentioned, the subdivision of the overall project combined with the separation of conception and implementation generated very particular and diverging perspectives on the integration project. Moreover, most texts did not include any reference to the anticipated use context of the system. In this context, one of the texts happened to mention an interesting problem-solving strategy that intended to fill this gap: “As a consequence of this surprise [about the complexity of the product], the CEO appointed him to assist as an ordinary mortal user in the re-defined conceptualisation phase.” Contrasting the developers' self-construction as experts, in the deconstruction session the “ordinary mortal user” was presented as technologically illiterate and neutral; thus a colleague in operative management was chosen for this role, which was defined to urge the team to break down the high level of abstraction to an understandable and feasible stage. The underlying assumption being that if they can make clear their complex tasks to such a person, the members would be capable of realizing their abstract concepts themselves. Moreover, an outsider’s perspective would bring in a neutral viewpoint from which it is possible to integrate the diverging perspectives. While deconstructing the practice of introducing the user-as-informant, participants became aware that their ignorance of use contexts and their failure to develop a user-centered specification entailed difficulties in translating abstract concepts to tangible design decisions. By assigning a user role to a team member, they tried to substitute for a proper specification of use contexts.</p>
<p>The gender dimension of their work came into focus by examining this practice of disregarding users when developing generic solutions and the problem of subjectivity in deciding on search classifications. As reported in the interviews, the team usually tried to develop for a generalized user; however, in projects implying specific use contexts, they had different solutions available to handle the problem of subjectivity. Occasionally, they consulted experts of a particular knowledge area; while, in other cases, they counted on their everyday knowledge. An example for the latter was a search application for course information that, beside the “general” user, should also address particular groups such as migrants and women. When considering women as users, a first idea was to include childcare as search category. The ad hoc association of women with child care was to be materialized in the application by defining this field as a subcategory of “location.” Thereby, child care was reproduced as a female task, which at the same time was assigned a hierarchically low position within search categories.</p>
<p>Due to the failure of the search engine project gender was not directly addressed in this “mind scripting.” Nevertheless, deconstructing problem-solving strategies led to a discussion on the consequences of ignoring user-centered approaches and disclosed the established practice of implicitly assuming (gendered) user characteristics to be able to translate abstract concepts to specific design decisions.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The case studies demonstrate how “mind scripting” can be applied to trace how designers interconnect their professional know-how with practical ways of problem solving that are co-shaped by societal discourses. In practice, the construction of social meaning implicitly serves to make feasible technology-centered, objectified concepts (e.g., graphical realism) and processes (e.g., specifying an abstract conception). “Mind scripting” enables designers to grasp analytically how subjectivity and societal implications unfold in design processes and offers a means to approach, in a structured way, the frequently referred to “social dimensions of software development.” It makes the performativity of gender discourses in design practices tangible in a context-specific way that attains explanatory power.</p>
<p>Applying “mind scripting” in practice raises questions of usability and learnability. The procedure’s fit within practice clearly reveals that it presupposes an orientation toward learning. The method can prove useful in different phases of the design process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0162243911401633">Hanappi-Egger 2006</xref>): Applying it to accompany the shaping of an artifact, it should be conducted in the course of system specification and can also assist in implementation. In different cycles of negotiating and adapting systems requirements, it might also be useful to integrate users. Considering mid-term or long-term learning effects, it could also be a part of the evaluation phase. Regarding learnability, as with any other method, “mind scripting” requires some training. A crucial question is who can guide the deconstruction in terms of gender knowledge. In this respect, it clearly takes someone to impart a mind-set for avoiding essentialist interpretations. Fortunately, the deconstructive approach promotes this way of thinking in a very down-to-earth manner and acts on the assumption that there is a diversity of opposing views available within a group. In any case, in order to initiate and to pursue this learning process—as any other sort of gender political intervention or diversity management—it requires a person in charge of this function.</p>
<p>Analyzing how gender discourses unfold in development processes is supposed to have a threefold impact: In the short run, it is an analytical tool to disclose and consciously decide on gendered assumptions that are otherwise unknowingly inscribed to artifacts. In the medium term, gaining knowledge about the constructedness of gender and experiencing how this knowledge changes social practice such as collective work practices widens capacities for action. Moreover, in the long run, commonly held beliefs and the values systems that they are based on may be challenged and reoccupied. In this respect, unlearning (e.g., of the belief systems perpetually reiterating gender difference) and relearning are inherent to “mind scripting.” The objective of the case studies was to elaborate the method for a beginning, while it was not within their scope to aim to improve the developed artifacts. As regards the evaluation of the method’s impacts on learning as well as on development processes and artifacts, further empirical research needs to be done. Aspects that need to be take into account in an evaluation are the team’s consistent appropriation of gender competences (e.g., the ability to recognize stereotypes and processes of normalization; the decomposition of dichotomous thinking and the appreciation of heterogeneity), the acquisition of method skills and reflexive process skills (i.e., the ability to apply the deconstructive practice without guidance and to feed back changes in perspective to different stages of the development process) and the acquisition of implementation abilities (i.e., the ability to resort to the gained knowledge when taking specification and implementation decisions).</p>
