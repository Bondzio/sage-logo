<abstract>
<p>The consequences of misadaptation when suddenly exposed to bright light can by minimised by gradually darkening (photochromic) glasses and this permits better vision. However, the reaction time of such glasses is of the order of a few seconds which is slow enough to cause visual discomfort when the lighting changes rapidly. The current invention presents an eye device with a fast response time, designed to proportionately filter electromagnetic radiation. This system, consisting of a photo-sensitive sensor, an electronic circuit and two liquid crystal lenses, inserted into an eyeglass frame, gives reaction times in the range 50–100 ms. Such liquid crystal electro-optic filters enhance global visual comfort and can also improve the security of users, e.g. by avoiding the glare to a driver at the exit of a tunnel, as well as being useful during outdoor activities and maybe in some medical conditions.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1477153511431128" sec-type="intro"><title>1. Introduction</title>
<p>The human eye can see in different luminous environments, thanks to a physiological mechanism called visual adaptation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1477153511431128">1</xref></sup> The exact light-adaptive mechanisms are unclear, but they are known to include physical, biochemical and neural elements. Retinal adaptation can be affected by physical changes in the size of the pupil to adjust the quantity of light coming into the eye.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1477153511431128">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1477153511431128">3</xref></sup> Photochemical adaptation due to the bleaching and regeneration of the visual pigments can take several minutes, whereas neural adaptation, generated by retinal neurons at successive stages of the visual chain in the retina, occurs in seconds. These different reaction times of the eye to a sudden change in brightness can reduce visual capabilities and create discomfort. Sudden changes in lighting can occur in real life and cause dangerous situations during the time of visual adaptation. Wearing appropriate eye protection, such as sunglasses, reduces glare and its consequences (discomfort, insecurity, etc.) in everyday life and outdoor activities.</p>
<p>Different types of sunglasses, from regular to progressive lenses, can be found. Whereas standard tinted sunglasses have a similar transmittance in different luminous environments, progressive tinted glasses (photochromic or ‘transition’ lenses) offer better visual comfort with flexibility in transmittance. The first photochromic glasses were commercialised in the 1960s.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1477153511431128">4</xref></sup> Now, photochromic glasses get dark from low to high light transmission within a few seconds. However, such solar lenses are mostly intended for people wearing corrective eyeglasses and still present some drawbacks. Photochromic lenses use a chemical reaction to ultra-violet (UV) radiation. Daylight is composed of 5% UV and 39% visible light (380–780 nm) and glare is caused by wavelengths in the visible spectrum, so such lenses do not directly react to the wavelength causing the discomfort. Moreover, as UV is filtered by the windscreen, they are not completely efficient when driving. Other disadvantages of photochromic sunglasses can be: Slower brightening (inside) than darkening (outside) and the appearance of a residual tint (shade) over time due to the chemical process.</p>
<p>A process other than chemical reaction to UV may offer different eye protection. In industry, liquid crystal glass has been used for welding helmets.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1477153511431128">5</xref></sup> The auto-darkening of such eye area protection has greatly improved the welding process. These faceshields can be either transparent or very darkly shaded, according to a control voltage. They use a battery or a solar cell to detect the bright light from the electric arc and almost instantaneously make the liquid crystal glass dark. Such technology could be used for sunglasses.</p>
<p>Our goal was to improve the visual comfort offered by eye protection by designing a regulated progressive tinted system with a ‘perceptually instantaneous’ reaction time.</p>
<p>First, visual comfort is increased by using progressive degrees of darkening to allow adaptation to different levels of brightness. As mentioned earlier, this has been done with photochromic glasses. Neutral sunglasses, however, do not usually have variable tint.</p>
<p>Second, shortening the reaction time of the lenses, down to ‘perceptually instantaneously’, would reduce the adaptation time of the eye and enhance visual comfort. Despite important improvements over the past 10 years, photochromic glasses still have a reaction time of several seconds<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1477153511431128">6</xref></sup> and cannot offer such visual comfort.</p>
<p>This paper describes the design of a new sunglass device using liquid crystal electro-optic filters which reduce the reaction time of the lenses to under a second.</p>

<sec id="sec4-1477153511431128"><title>2.1.1. General description</title>
<p>The proposed liquid crystal electro-optic device enables the light to be filtered proportionally to its brightness with a linear feedback control, without using any other artificial power supply. The filter is made of a sensitive photodiode solar sensor used as a power supply and of a nematic liquid crystal regulated by an electronic circuit. The system consists of several parts: Two scratch-resistant polarisers, two glass plates, a film of liquid crystal panels, a power supply sensor and an electronic oscillating circuit regulated by a microcontroller.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1477153511431128"><title>2.1.2. Liquid crystals</title>
<p>The nematic liquid crystal panels used present a natural helicoidal twist, which acts as a wave-guide for the polarised light (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1477153511431128">Figure 1</xref>). They are dependent on the angle of vision. When the crystals are at rest, their phase is contorted while sticking to the glass surface. The wave-guide is still working, which allows the light in. When an electric field is applied between the two plates, the nematic phase starts to swing, the polarised light rotates less and finds itself caught by the exit analyser. As a result, the intermediate liquid crystal molecules spirally twist to polarise incident light in a rotatory movement of 90°. On the one hand, the two substrates will transmit the incident light when they are equipped with polarising plates on the outside with axes of polarisation running parallel to the positioning of the substrates in touch with the polarising plates. On the other hand, if the liquid crystal molecules are supplied with voltage, they are oriented parallel to the direction of the voltage, the spiral state is broken to allow the transmission of the incident light into the liquid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1477153511431128">Figure 1</xref>). We note that the difference in potentials and the frequency in oscillations thus induced have a direct effect on the filtering. A change in the optical transmission and its oscillating frequency can be seen according to the voltage amplitude. The alternative voltage supply provided by the electronic sensor depends on the brightness.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1477153511431128">7</xref></sup> The use of liquid crystal lenses to filter rays of light allows us to obtain a reaction time of 50 to 100 ms (at 25°C).

<sec id="sec6-1477153511431128"><title>2.1.3. Electronic light sensor and regulator</title>
<p>The sensors used are photodiode solar cells, which have a similar spectral response to that of the eye: From about 350 to 750 nm with a peak at 550 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1477153511431128">Figure 2</xref>). Moreover, solar cells are sensitive to light reflection, on water or snow for example, and thus react in such conditions as direct light exposure. They supply 0.1 to 0.5 V from some hundred lux to some thousand lux with 7 mm<sup>2</sup> of surface area. These sensors, connected in series, will enable us to start the filter with a voltage of about 1.5 V. An ASIC micro-controller circuit can be used to register and maintain the right proportion between the filtering and the light intensity. In order to regulate the optical filter, we can act on the frequency of oscillation or on the voltage amplitude. The filter automatically adapts itself to its new environment according to different levels of filtering.
<fig id="fig2-1477153511431128" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Spectral responses of the human eye and the Silicium solar cells, as a function of the wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum. Both are sensitive to light from about 350 nm to 750 nm with a peak at 550 nm</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1477153511431128-fig2.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p>The main advantage of this type of filter is its adaptability to the environment without using any artificial power supply. As the system is self-reliant thanks to its sensor, the required energy consumption is produced for the crystal liquid panels and the electronic circuit. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1477153511431128">Figure 3</xref> shows the electronic regulation system controlling the liquid crystal glasses.
<fig id="fig3-1477153511431128" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>Diagram of the operating principle. The sensors, sensitive to light from the environment, create an electrical signal, which is processed by the microprocessor to control the liquid crystal lenses. The darkness of the lenses proportionately increases with the external brightness. The device works in complete autonomy and does not need any battery; the solar cells supply the electronic circuit</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1477153511431128-fig3.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p>Solar sensors are used to inform and supply the microprocessor. According to the light intensity and temperature, the microprocessor regulates the liquid crystal glasses by supplying an alternating electric voltage with adjustable amplitude and frequency.</p>
<p>A temperature sensor can be added to this system to give supplementary information to the microprocessor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1477153511431128">Figure 3</xref>). In a situation of extreme temperature, the contrast can be controlled by the modification of the frequency for example. Regular commercial twist nematic (TN) liquid crystals are effective between −20°C and +60°C. If necessary, extended TN liquid crystals can be used to cover a temperature range from −40°C up to +80°C.</p>
<p>This liquid crystal electro-optic system was designed to be built into the eyeglass frames (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1477153511431128">Figure 4</xref>). The miniaturisation of the system is therefore a prerequisite to the installation of the electronic components in the frames. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1477153511431128">Figure 4</xref> displays a design of sunglass frames which take into account the place of the solar sensors. The electronic circuit was placed behind the solar sensors. The system, inserted inside the sunglass frames, is thermo-linked to the liquid crystal lenses. Furthermore, to filter-out particular wavelength bands of light, the lenses can be made red-, green-, yellow- or grey-tinted. There are several potential applications such as maintaining dark adaptation with red-only light, removing short wavelength (blue) for less glare and less chromatic aberration, removing short wavelengths to prevent melatonin suppression etc.
<fig id="fig4-1477153511431128" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>Example of a design of the eyeglass frames showing the location of the solar cells and the miniaturised electronic system in the middle part connecting the two lenses</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1477153511431128-fig4.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p>Four solar sensors were used to supply the system. Each of these photodiodes can deliver a voltage ranging from 0 to 0.8 V. The final voltage delivered by the four photodiodes covers the filter categories 2, 3 and 4 since the voltage delivered varies between 0 and 3 V (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1477153511431128">Figure 5</xref>). Moreover, the microprocessor can be blocked in category 3, <italic>via</italic> an electronic selection, to allow driving (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1477153511431128">Figure 3</xref>).

The corresponding filter categories, i.e. the different levels of solar protection, are indicated.

<sec id="sec7-1477153511431128"><title>2.1.4 Compliance test results</title>
<p>Some laboratory tests have been performed on the gray electro-optic lenses described above, according to standards for photochromic lenses.</p>
<p>The behaviour of the transmission factor as a function of the voltage has been analysed at a frequency of 300 Hz. Voltage was varied from 0 to 3 V and the values of the corresponding transmission factor were measured to determine the different categories of eye protection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1477153511431128">Figure 5</xref>). Category 4, which is forbidden for driving, corresponded to a voltage of 2.5 V and above (that is a transmission factor of 7.71%). Depending on the transmission factor, the liquid crystal electro-optic lenses correspond to filters of category 2 in the normal clear state, and to filters of category 3 (2.2–2.4 V) or 4 (2.5–3 V) at darker shades. Further tests determined that these lenses passed the general essential requirements, as well as the tests for special requirements for transmission and resistance to UV radiation.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1477153511431128">Figure 5</xref> displays the transmission factor for each voltage applied from 0 to 3 V (at a frequency of 300 Hz), as a function of the wavelength. This shows that the lenses protect against UV rays and gradually filter the light in the visible spectrum (400–750 nm) depending on the voltage, therefore on the transmission factor. Maximal transmission is about 40% for this example with black experimental polarisers. It is not a limitation of the device but it depends on the polariser filter. It could be superior with other polariser filters (grey, yellow, red, blue, green), however, it will never be 100%. In addition, an increase of the frequency, beyond 300 Hz, can provide other contrast characteristics, in particular lower. Conversely, a lower frequency produces a higher contrast.</p>

<sec id="sec8-1477153511431128" sec-type="conclusions"><title>3. Conclusions</title>
<p>As mentioned above, the disadvantage of commercialised photochromic glasses is that they need several seconds to react,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1477153511431128">6</xref></sup> which is enough to blind someone temporarily when going from dark to bright light. Moreover, photochromic lenses do not completely darken inside a car as the windscreen reduces UV transmission. Thus, drivers may not be protected from intense dazzle.</p>
<p>Liquid crystal lenses can be used to filter rays of light with a reaction time of about only 50 to 100 ms. A regulation system able to control liquid crystal lenses has been developed. This device is aimed to be integrated into eyeglass frames so special interest has been given to miniaturisation. Moreover, solar cells were used to supply a microprocessor and as a control sensor for the liquid crystal lenses.</p>
<p>The ‘perceptually instantaneous’ reaction time (∼1/10 second) of these liquid crystal electro-optic sunglasses tremendously improves visual comfort in different situations. The solar protection up to category 4 makes these glasses multipurpose. They can be used for extreme outdoor activities (such as climbing, mountain biking, skiing, ice-field hiking, aero-modelling and kite activities) with the darkest shade or electronically locked at a maximum of category 3 to allow secure driving. This technical flexibility allows the personalisation of the device. Different products can easily be developed according to the expected performance. Therefore, such visual comfort would be available for everybody: This device was designed for neutral sunglasses, not only corrective lenses. Equivalent visual comfort has not been reached with other systems, like photochromic glasses, which have a longer reaction time. Moreover, the liquid crystal glasses presented here could be an alternative for people who do not adapt to other products.</p>
<p>Many parameters of this device can be individualised. In addition to the protection category (i.e. the degree of darkness), the reaction time of the liquid crystal glasses can be electronically modulated to obtain an individual optimal comfort. The darkening can thus be more progressive. The colour of the lenses themselves can also be customised (tinted in brown/black, red, green or yellow). This will give a large choice of individually adapted visual comfort. Such flexible design of the device, and the broad range of possible applications, means that each individual is able to get the best use out of the product.</p>
<p>Psychophysical studies in sunglass users and in different categories of consumers (e.g. for driving, for outside activities, for extreme sports, etc.) are further needed to optimise the different parameters and to specify a set of customised designs according to individual profiles of users.</p>
<p>These sunglasses, with a ‘perceptually instantaneous’ reaction time, may also be useful in some medical conditions, related directly to the eye or to the nervous system. In photophobia,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1477153511431128">8</xref></sup> people suffer from an excessive sensitivity to light. Such hypersensitivity and aversion to sunlight leads to an experience of discomfort or pain in the eyes, due to light exposure. Damage to the cornea, the retina or the oculomotor nerve can induce the entrance of too much light in the eye. In tunnel vision, the visual field of the patients is narrow, restricted to the central part of their environment, and most of the time, this trouble goes together with a bad vision at night and a hyper-sensitivity to glare. Moreover, the intolerance of the eyes to light is reported in up to 90% of migraine attacks.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1477153511431128">9</xref></sup> Besides, the risk for cataract and other age-related eye problems is associated with a person’s lifetime exposure to the sun’s UV radiation. An appropriate solar protection is thus essential in everyday life. The device presented in this paper, offering better visual comfort and individualised protection, may increase the use of sunglasses. Its clinical use needs, however, to be further addressed.</p>
