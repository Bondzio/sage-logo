<title>Health Literacy</title>
<p>Welcome to a New Year and a new look <italic>Perspectives.</italic> We would like to thank Patrick Keady for his enthusiasm and professionalism during the last year as deputy editor and we are delighted that Dr Rosalind Stanwell-Smith has agreed to take up the position from him. In the spirit of refreshing content we are introducing a new column entitled, Peep into Parliament and Beyond, sharing with readers the latest debates and government views that impact policy. Another exciting development is that three times a year we intend to write an Economic Social Research Council (ESRC) report, which will make the link between research and practice. With the public health lens on outcomes and evidence base, we hope that readers will be stimulated by the cutting edge of new research and the potential translation of this into frontline engagement.</p>
<p>We would also like to welcome Dr Michael Popejoy from America who will be joining the International Advisory Board. Michael’s interests lie primarily in global public administration and public health policy initiatives in areas such as disaster preparedness and response as well as pandemic disease surveillance and interdiction. Lastly, I would like to take the opportunity to thank all our reviewers for their sterling effort last year in making the journal such a credible and robust publication, your commitment is much appreciated.</p>
<p>Policy documents ask us to become ‘informed patients’, ‘engaged and active citizens’ and ‘empowered communities’. But most of us do not have the necessary skills to drive decisions for our health.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1757913911430901">1</xref></sup> Health literacy is therefore topical and important. With the increasing use of technology and the wealth of information available at the press of a button, the ability to decipher messages and make sense of them becomes ever more urgent. The ‘heal thyself’ mentality is rife particularly amongst men who tend to be reluctant to visit their GPs. Global access to knowledge is quick, easy and stress free. It is no wonder therefore that much health information is received this way. Health literacy as defined by Marshall <italic>et al.</italic> “<italic>is the degree to which individuals have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions”</italic> and debate within this issue of <italic>Perspectives</italic> centres on this inherent ability.</p>
<p>However, information is only as good as the author. The credibility of some health advice and websites could be severely criticised as could some columns in newspapers. Access to good, reliable information is the cornerstone for informed decision making. The Ottawa Charter for health promotion states that: “<italic>health is created in the context of everyday life, where people live, love, work and play”.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1757913911430901">2</xref></sup> It follows therefore that we need health literacy skills, that also include the ability to judge the value of knowledge, in our capacity as citizens, consumers, and patients. Authors in this issue discuss the position of health literacy within the curriculum and the role of education in developing informed individuals. We surely also need to build professional health literacy, especially as in the new public health climate, confidence in the competency of frontline workers to provide accurate and consistent information is paramount. Health literacy has become a vibrant area of research and within the UK there is an active group, whose mission is to raise the profile of this topic especially as low health literacy may be a strong contributor to health inequalities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1757913911430901">3</xref></sup> <italic>Perspectives</italic> provides a platform for comment and research and we thank Dr Selwyn Hodge for his thought provoking guest editorial.</p>

<title>Nutrition labels need to be central</title>
<graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="10.1177_1757913911430901-fig1.tif"/>
<p>A US study has found that labels containing nutritional information should be placed in the centre of food packaging to ensure shoppers read the information.</p>
<p>The study had 203 participants and used an eye-tracking device to find that the average consumer only reads the top part of a food content label. When the nutritional label was placed in the centre 61% read it, compared to 37% and 34% when the labels were on the left and right hand side. Knowledge of a food’s nutrients can influence consumers to make healthier purchases, and so the positioning of labels can have a substantial impact on public health.</p>
