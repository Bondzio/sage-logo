<abstract>
<p>After the London bombings on 7 July 2005, trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy (TF-CBT) was provided for survivors with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). A “screen and treat” approach was used. The transcripts of 18 audiotaped CBT treatment sessions with these patients were analyzed using the qualitative method of thematic analysis. Interviews comprised participants’ direct experiences of the terrorist attack and its impact on their lives. Themes identified were shock and disorientation, horror, getting out, reorientation and reconnecting with the outside world (on the day of the bombings); and posttraumatic stress and depression, feeling different, and recovery and resilience (following the day of the bombings). Services may be part of wider political responses to terrorism but this did not preoccupy participants. In CBT, during elaboration of traumatic memories, attention might usefully be paid to clients’ experiences of collective action taken during a terrorist attack.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The London bombings on 7 July 2005 (referred to commonly and throughout this article as “7/7”) were the United Kingdom’s first alleged terrorist attack from Al Qaeda. Three bombs were detonated on underground trains, and a fourth exploded on a bus. The attacks killed 52 commuters and the four suicide bombers, injuring more than 700 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1534765611426793">Great Britain: Home Office, 2006</xref>). The Irish Republican Army (IRA) targeted the London Underground in the 1970s, but this was unprecedented in being the first attack in London by terrorists at multiple locations and involving suicide bombers. Two weeks later repeat terrorist attacks by Al Qaeda were intercepted, and London remained in a state of heightened alert.</p>
<p>Quantitative surveys have reported the impact of terrorism on civilian populations in the weeks following terrorist attacks in London (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1534765611426793">Rubin, Brewin, Greenberg, Simpson, &amp; Wessely, 2005</xref>), in New York (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1534765611426793">Schuster et al., 2001</xref>), and in Madrid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1534765611426793">Vazquez, Perez, &amp; Matt, 2006</xref>). New York City residents and US citizens surveyed post-9/11 showed marked psychological impact for those nearby, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1534765611426793">Boscarino, Galea, Ahern, Resnick, &amp; Vlahov, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1534765611426793">Galea et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1534765611426793">Huddy, Feldman, Capelos, &amp; Provost, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1534765611426793">Schlenger et al., 2002</xref>) and modest impact for those geographically distant. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1534765611426793">Schlenger et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1534765611426793">Schuster et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1534765611426793">Silver, Holman, McIntosh, Poulin, &amp; Gil-Rivas, 2002</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1534765611426793">Galea et al. (2003)</xref> reported that initial levels of probable posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms subsided after several months. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1534765611426793">Luce, Firth-Cozens, Midgely, and Burges (2002)</xref> reported the 1998 Omagh bombing and its impact on emergency staff. None of these studies, however, directly explored the personal perspectives of survivors, which is ubiquitous in trauma-focused cognitive behavior therapy (TF-CBT). Two qualitative studies captured the immediate effects of 9/11 on the U.S. general population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1534765611426793">Cohn, Mehl, &amp; Pennebaker 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1534765611426793">Small, Lerner, &amp; Fischoff, 2006</xref>), but the experience of survivors was not the focus of either work.</p>
<p>The aim of this study was to understand how survivors with PTSD experienced the London bombings. Quantitative studies demonstrating the efficacy of TF-CBT for patients treated following the London bombings, has already been published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1534765611426793">Brewin et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1534765611426793">Brewin, Gregory, Lipton, &amp; Burgess, 2010</xref>). This study is a qualitative investigation of material from TF-CBT sessions with 18 of the 82 patients evaluated in the primary quantitative paper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1534765611426793">Brewin et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Whereas the quantitative study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1534765611426793">Brewin et al., 2008</xref>) looked at recovery from PTSD following TF-CBT, we wanted to explore the unique accounts of this group of survivors. Our aim was to describe a rich picture of the experience of the bombings, to orientate clinicians offering TF-CBT to clients who have experienced a terrorist attack to the possibly unique themes within their narratives. Thematic analysis was the research method used, as it was deemed to be a good epistemological “fit” with these aims.</p>

<title>Context</title>
<p>After the 7/7 bombings, London implemented its emergency response. A centralized “screen and treat” program offered survivors with PTSD treatment in one of five central London trauma services of their choice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1534765611426793">Brewin et al., 2008</xref>). This article’s authors are all clinicians at the Institute of Psychotrauma, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1534765611426793">d’Ardenne, Capuzzo, Ruaro, &amp; Priebe, 2005</xref>) one of the London services that provided TF-CBT to survivors. Ethical approval for the study was granted in June 2006 by the East London and City Local Research Ethics Committee.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1534765611426793">
<title>Material</title>
<p>All 7/7 London bombings patients, treated at the above institute, between October 2005 and July 2007, were approached with information about the study. Thirty people out of 49 who had received individual TF-CBT as a result of PTSD following the 7/7 bombings agreed to participate. Of these, 8 current and 10 discharged patients had audiotaped sessions, from varying stages of treatment, suitable for analysis (see consort diagram, indicating how transcripts were selected for inclusion in the qualitative analysis). The clinicians carrying out treatment comprised five clinical psychologists and psychiatrists. All were trained in CBT and had specific training and experience in working with individuals to treat the psychological consequences of trauma, including PTSD. In this way data collection was opportunistic, reflecting the reality of a psychological service, rapidly responding to an unparalleled London-wide emergency. The only exclusion criterion was poor audio quality.</p>

<title>Qualitative Analysis</title>
<p>All 18 session recordings were transcribed verbatim by one of the authors, Carleen Scott, and anonymized. Analysis of the patients’ speech was carried out by three clinical psychologists and one research psychologist at the institute. All those involved had expertize in the treatment of the psychological consequences of trauma. One of the researchers, Patricia d’Ardenne, was therapist for 8 of the 18 treatment sessions analyzed. Transcripts were distributed randomly and equally among the four authors for initial analysis.</p>
<p>The 18 transcripts were analyzed using thematic analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1534765611426793">Braun &amp; Clarke, 2006</xref>), and the sample was sufficient for saturation to be reached. The transcripts were divided among the researchers who read them twice to familiarize themselves with the material. They made notes about the material’s form and content according to the following criteria: settings/context, definition of the situation, perspective, ways of thinking about people and objects, process, activities, events, strategies, relationships, and social structure and methods (Bogdan &amp; Biklen’s criteria, 1992, cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1534765611426793">Miles &amp; Huberman, 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>Codes were initially generated by each researcher and shared. Codes were accepted, altered, or abandoned through discussion within the research team (the four authors). A single, initial combined coding scheme was then used to code the transcripts line by line, and additional codes generated where none fitted. This process was repeated until the coding scheme captured all aspects of participants’ experiences comprehensively. On the fourth coding round, two distinct time frames emerged: the day of the bombing (7/7) and time after (post-7/7), for each participant. Any material relating to time prior to the day of the bombing was discarded, firstly, because it was only indirectly relevant to the bombings, and secondly, it comprised a negligible proportion of the transcripts; on average, 5%. The research team then collapsed the coded data into broader themes for 7/7 and post-7/7 for each participant. Superordinate themes were developed through a cumulative and cyclical process of linking themes from the individual transcripts. Evolving superordinate themes were: (a) strengthened by subsequent transcripts, (b) eliminated, or (c) incorporated into other superordinate themes. Emerging themes were regularly debated with a wider research team within the service as a validity check. Following analysis, two independent psychology researchers reviewed the transcripts as a reliability check.</p>

<title>Themes Reported by Participants</title>
<p>From analysis of the transcripts, seven overarching themes emerged, but which were subsumed under two time frames: 7/7 and post-7/7.</p>
<p>Four superordinate themes reflected the day of the bombings (7/7): shock and disorientation, horror, getting out, and reorientation and reconnection with the outside world. Three superordinate themes described the time after the day of the bombings (post-7/7): posttraumatic stress and depression, feeling different, and recovery and resilience (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1534765611426793">Table 2</xref>).

<sec id="section11-1534765611426793">
<title>Horror</title>
<p>Participants’ horror at what they were witnessing was prominent in their accounts. They were confronted with the mutilation and deaths of other passengers and described this in graphic detail.</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>We were in a medieval torture chamber. The walls, the tunnel, the train walls, the darkness, the blood, the screaming, the . . . I thought ‘I’m in a nightmare now . . .’ (P9, female, 57 years).</p>
<p>People with maybe half a leg or leg held on by a piece of muscle and skin or like a trail of blood across the platform . . . There were so many things that were equally horrific . . . One man had a shard of glass that had gone through his sandal and through his foot, he also suffered a heart attack. And another lady, I think it was, who had a . . . fairly horrific injury around her right eye socket . . . I think the eye had gone. (P3, male, 59 years)</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>These scenes meant people had to repeatedly digest new images and information that was terrifying. Participants gave accounts of becoming fixated by their imminent death. Underground, the fear was of asphyxiation, being burned alive, crushed, or electrocuted by live rails. Further explosions were also feared, including by survivors of the bus bombing. Overall, immediately after the bombs the sense of further threat remained.</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>. . . every step I was taking I thought the ground would explode (P14, female, 39 years).</p></disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1534765611426793">
<title>Getting out</title>
<p>Participants gave lengthy and detailed narratives of what they and others did in response to the carnage around them. Survivors rapidly, spontaneously, and intimately comforted each other.</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>One gentleman just walked up to me, never said anything, just gave me a hug . . . And then, erm, the lady that gave me the water she sort of stayed . . . with me . . . (P10, female, 28 years)</p>
<p>I turned round and there was a young girl on her own sobbing and she was just so scared, so I just went up to her and I gave her a hug and I said, “don’t look” and she was just still looking. I had to physically grab her and turn her round “don’t look there it’s not nice.” (P13, female, 29 years)</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>What was clear from accounts was that escape was to be a collective action. Participants described trying to give or follow others’ directions. However, the process of reaching safety continued to feature significant confusion.</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>I’m telling people to hold their positions, I’m saying to people to stay on the doors and the gates (P16, male, 51 years).</p>
<p>Shouldn’t we just stay where we are? Erm . . . but I followed everybody (P10, female, 28 years)</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Survivors of the underground bombings were also instructed by London Underground staff and emergency services to evacuate the trains. They described clambering over and around other seriously wounded passengers or not being able to reach others who were in extreme distress. This was highly disturbing and participants felt guilty at not helping other injured passengers.</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>They couldn’t get down onto the lines because the power was still on but this fella was screaming for help like and you know, you couldn’t get down onto the lines (P12, male, 28 years).</p></disp-quote>
</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1534765611426793">
<title>Reorientation and reconnecting with the outside world</title>
<p>The capacity to continually make shifts to reorientate themselves to their newly changed environment, and make decisions about how to respond, was the means by which survivors navigated their “escape.” This rapid switching between surreal and dangerous horror and potential safety gave accounts tension. Survivors had repeated experiences of trying to make sense of how the world had changed so instantaneously and dramatically at a physical, cognitive, and emotional level. Being able to respond to the carnage around them represented salient turning points in the day and were a source of hope for survival; some described feeling sudden defiance in the face of possible death, moments when rescuers arrived, or instances when they felt closer to safety.</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>. . . another part of me was raging, just raging . . . I do not wanna die like this, I’m not gonna die here. This is not how I am gonna die (P9, female, 57 years).</p>
<p>It might have been a mobile or whatever; we started to see light in the carriage (P11, female, 45 years).</p>
<p>I could see Paddington Station . . . this small golden lit vision of normality (P9, female, 57 years).</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>In contrast to these moments, disorientation reverberated throughout the rest of the day. Some narratives described people automatically trying to resume travel to work or to continue with their original plans for the day, without success. Some survivors did not realize that they had been involved in a terrorist attack until hours later in the day. This again represented a turning point in their stories, but instead was from times of presumed safety to moments when the trauma was re-realized as life threatening.</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>I said “I don’t need to get on a bus to go to hospital. I’m not injured. I’m not hurt. I don’t need to go to hospital.” And [my daughter] didn’t want to either and so we . . . walked back to the office . . . I didn’t realise that of course we were covered in black and I said “don’t worry we’ll get back to the office and we’ll just clean ourselves up and we’ll just go to work,” . . . we had no idea what had happened . . . [ ]. And then as we went into reception, there’s a big reception area with a telly, . . . and [my daughter] just completely fell apart at that point and lost it, and I never forget trying to get her to sit down and she was screaming, to “just turn it off, turn it off, turn it off.” (P8, female, 50 years)</p>
<p>And I was like “hang on a minute” . . . and I said to the girl—“have I just been in a bomb explosion?” and she went “I think so” and I went “what? There was a bomb on my train?” and she went “I think so” and then . . . I was like, “but how comes I’m here then—like the bomb exploding and I’m still here” and then I just started to cry . . . (P13, female, 29 years)</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The experience of emerging from the underground and facing the media was, again, bewildering, as at this point participants perceived themselves to be witnesses rather than victims of a terrible event.</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>I thought “why are they taking photographs, why are there cameras, why are they pointing them at us?” I thought “they only do that” . . . I thought to myself “they need to be holding them at, you know, people who were victims” and then I realised with a horrible shock that’s the category I came in to. (P9, female, 57 years)</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>In summary, this process of shock, terror, reorientation, and hope was one that individuals circled round repeatedly on the day of the bombings.</p>

<title>Feeling different</title>
<p>Participants here referred to personal and interpersonal changes which they felt made them different from those who had not been in the London bombings, and in ways that they felt could not be understood by others. This left them feeling silenced, disappointed, and alone.</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>. . . one guy was saying he had a friend who wouldn’t call him and he tried calling him himself and after a while he got through to him and he goes “what’s happened? Why didn’t you call?” and he goes “I didn’t know what to say” . . . (P17, male, 27 years)</p>
<p>. . . I couldn’t tell my family and friends. (P16, male, 51 years)</p></disp-quote>

<p>In response to this sensitivity, some wanted to make life changes and appeared to seek conciliation through such changes.</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>I mean yeah, I remember you saying you wanted to, I was going through some weird phenomenon of having a mid life crisis at the age of 22 (P 17, male, 27 years).</p>
<p>I’ve grown up more, which I think has really helped and it made me see things differently and understand things more and it’s been a real learning curve.

</p>
<p>There was relatively little discussion around attribution. Where this did occur there was a range of perspectives. Some denied anger toward the perpetrators or political leaders (who, in contrast, were subject to wide public scrutiny post-7/7), some felt the attacks were meaningless, and others failed to understand why terrorists would commit such acts. Some were angry at the perpetrators, the wider Muslim community, and UK and US politicians, who were perceived to have placed the UK at increased threat of terrorism.</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>I just find it really difficult to, you know, have some form of really . . . compassion or think that this person has also died, you know, in the explosion. It just made me angry that this person had done this, you know to me. How dare you? Kind of thing . . . erm . . . and that’s why I stopped watching the TV because that was just making me more angry, more upset. And I guess a year later I probably don’t, I probably still feel angry but I kind of also thought pity as well for this person.

<p>You know, if Tony Blair had not gone to war, then it might not have happened. (P3, male, 59 years)</p></disp-quote>

<p>In summary, felt difference was not an experience of becoming politically mobilized but one of increased personal attunement to suffering, both their own and of others.</p>

<title>Recovery and resilience</title>
<p>Participants articulated ways in which their lives were moving forward. For example, they said their symptoms of PTSD were diminishing through perseverance with exposure, and that they were viewing the events of 7/7 differently now.</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>I don’t get as scared or flustered or, you know, nervous as before. Um . . . I do get trepidation from time to time but er . . . not as bad as before.

<p>I think my gut feeling is “I think I’ll be OK”, you know. At times it’s hard to cope with certain things; I do get help for certain things which is helpful. And just . . . carry on the way I have been really. I’m not sure really . . . I think I’ll be all right. (P15, female, 27 years)</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Participants displayed resilience through their determination to rebuild their lives at an intimate level. For some, their different feelings meant after the traumatic experiences, that they valued their relationships more highly and that their existential views had changed.</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>I mean we spend time together like, just . . . feel like I appreciate it more than perhaps when you just take for granted that “yeah we can go . . . we can go to the theatre,” you know, lots of things that you take for granted.

<p>Overall, those who had survived the experience of the terrorist attacks were primarily concerned with the immediate impact on their lives, rather than the political meaning of the terrorist attacks.</p>

<title>Key Findings</title>
<p>Survivors of the London bombings on 7 July 2005 who presented with PTSD described two time periods in their accounts of these terrorist attacks during TF-CBT. These were “7/7,” which encapsulated the day of the London bombings and “post-7/7,” the period of time after this day.</p>
<p>The themes of 7/7 tracked participants’ reverberating shock and disorientation immediately after the explosions, horror and their process of escape. This was followed by reorientation and being reunited with a more familiar world once they were physically safe. The themes of post-7/7 were PTSD, (a cognitive, emotional, and somatic reliving of the trauma) distress as a result of symptoms and concomitant depression, felt difference from others and from their previous selves, and then adjustment and hope. Participants’ process of psychological survival post-7/7, at best, resulted in an enhanced sense of connectedness to others. One of the unifying features across both time frames was the repeated changes of thinking that survivors made to make meaning of a situation that was unprecedented for them.</p>
<p>What was distinct within these accounts was that despite being in mortal danger during 7/7, survivors recounted in detail their experience of where they were in relation to the other passengers around them, moments of togetherness, and joint escape. This was in contrast to feeling different and disconnected from others, both in intimate and other relationships post-7/7. Whereas the disorientation of 7/7 was a physical and psychological dislocation from the world they had expected during their journeys, the dislocation subsequently felt was as an internal difference from others who had not been involved in the London bombings. Their view of the world had changed, and others’ responses to survivors since the bombings were at times incongruent with what they now needed.</p>

<sec id="section20-1534765611426793">
<title>Limitations and Strengths of Study</title>
<p>The generalizability of the results reported in this study are limited, as inclusion of transcripts was through self-selection, and the sample size was small. However, despite the heterogeneity of the participants’ and their differing points in treatment, their accounts showed remarkable consistency and similarity. Arguably saturation of findings was reached even in this small sample.</p>
<p>Inevitably TF-CBT would elicit detailed narratives of the trauma, and the themes of PTSD arguably were consonant with this agenda. However, this study was unique in revealing new insights into the impact of terrorism on individual survivors, which, without exploration, would have remained privy only to clients and therapists.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section21-1534765611426793">
<title>Therapeutic Implications</title>
<p>Descriptors of PTSD in these accounts support established models of traumatic memory and PTSD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1534765611426793">Brewin, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1534765611426793">Brewin et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1534765611426793">Ehlers &amp; Clark, 2000</xref>). What this study has shown that is new, however, is that during TF-CBT, the therapist may need to attend more to their clients’ experience of collective action taken by themselves and others during terrorist attacks to help elaborate their traumatic accounts. For example, the CBT therapist might usefully focus on multiple shifts in meaning on the day as a consequence of interactions with others, for example, other survivors, the media, emergency services, bystanders, and families, to facilitate a fuller trauma narrative that incorporates the process of survival, as well as, moments of threat. Therapeutic interventions that help clients recall acts of kindness or heroism could redress guilt or sadness about perceived individual acts of omission, such as not helping the severely injured.</p>
<p>Our analysis revealed that participants felt isolated from those unaffected by the bombings after 7/7 which they believed slowed their recovery from PTSD. Despite the extensive media exposure of survivors’ experiences, our results indicate that survivors’ sense of difference warrants exploration by CBT therapists. This felt collective experience on the day of the attacks, followed by felt distance from others also merits studies of group CBT interventions for these clients.</p>
<p>Survivors were more likely to blame themselves, if anyone, for their ongoing difficulties. They expressed surprisingly little anger toward the perpetrators, nor strong desire for retribution. This is in marked contrast to the political response and media reportage of the bombings. The disparity between survivors’ priorities, evident in these personal accounts, and political priorities should be considered during emergency response planning for terrorist attacks.</p>
