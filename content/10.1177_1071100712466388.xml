<title>Background:</title>
<p>The purpose of our study was to investigate tarsal tunnel syndrome (TTS) arising in patients who have undergone maintenance dialysis at our facility and to evaluate the frequency, pathological characteristics, and diagnosis of TTS.</p>

<title>Methods:</title>
<p>We evaluated 1011 patients (mean age 65.1 years) undergoing maintenance dialysis from 2000 to 2006 at our hospital.

<p>Various orthopedic complications associated with long-term dialysis, such as osteoarthropathy and peripheral neuropathy, have become issues. In terms of peripheral neuropathy, since Warren and Otieno<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1071100712466388">27</xref></sup> reported in 1975 that many dialysis patients developed carpal tunnel syndrome, many reports regarding carpal tunnel syndrome have been published.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1071100712466388">7</xref></sup> As its causes, a degenerated, thickened transverse carpal ligament and swollen flexor tendon due to the deposition of amyloid and compression by the hyperplastic peritendinous synovium have been considered to be disorders of the median nerve.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1071100712466388">7</xref></sup> However, reports regarding tarsal tunnel syndrome in long-term dialysis patients are very rare and only case reports exist; thus, the epidemiological and pathological characteristics of tarsal tunnel syndrome in long-term dialysis patients still are not fully understood.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1071100712466388">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1071100712466388">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1071100712466388">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1071100712466388">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>The purpose of our study was to investigate tarsal tunnel syndrome arising in patients who have undergone maintenance dialysis at our facility and to evaluate the frequency of tarsal tunnel syndrome and the problems with its pathological features and diagnosis.</p>
<sec id="section6-1071100712466388" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>One thousand and eleven patients (mean age 65.1 years; range, 19-98; 598 males, 413 females) undergoing maintenance dialysis (mean dialysis duration, 10.0 years; range, 1-38) at our hospital from 2000 to 2006 were evaluated. When patients had any complaints that suggested the presence of orthopedic diseases, such as numbness or pain, they were examined by an orthopedic surgeon specializing in orthopedic disorders associated with dialysis.</p>
<p>Tarsal tunnel syndrome was diagnosed in patients in whom tarsal tunnel pain or foot pain and plantar sensory abnormalities in the tibial innervation region were present and who were positive for Tinel’s sign over the tarsal tunnel.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1071100712466388">17</xref></sup> A nerve conduction study of the medial plantar nerve was conducted as an auxiliary diagnosis for patients in whom clinical symptoms were present.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1071100712466388">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1071100712466388">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1071100712466388">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1071100712466388">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1071100712466388">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1071100712466388">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1071100712466388">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1071100712466388">21</xref></sup> In addition, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1071100712466388">5</xref></sup> or ultrasound of the foot was used to evaluate the tarsal tunnel. An ankle brachial pressure index (ABI) was taken for differentiation purposes with regard to arteriosclerosis obliterans, and MRI scans of lumbar spine were taken for differentiation purposes with regard to lumbar diseases such as lumbar spinal stenosis.</p>
<p>The presence of night pain, dialysis pain, and sensory abnormalities as clinical symptoms was elicited. A nerve conduction study was performed to evaluate whether a delay of 5.4 milliseconds or more was present. The presence of enlargement of the soft tissue silhouette, bone cyst, bony erosion or destruction, joint space narrowing, or juxta-articular bone atrophy was evaluated by plain radiograph, and the presence of enlargement of the soft tissue silhouette, soft tissue mass, bony erosion, or destruction was examined by CT scan and MRI.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1071100712466388">5</xref></sup> The presence of nerve stenosis, enlargement of the soft tissue, deposits suggestive of amyloid, and soft tissue mass was evaluated by ultrasound examination.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1071100712466388">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>Surgery was performed for patients who failed conservative treatment. Tissues strangulating the nerves were excised and pathologically and immunohistologically evaluated. Postoperative care included 3 weeks of immobilization with full weight-bearing using an immobilizing device. Follow-up study was conducted for at least 1 year.</p>

<title>Patient Characteristics</title>
<p>Among the 1011 patients undergoing maintenance dialysis at our hospital, 595 patients with hemodialysis (mean age, 65.3 years; range, 32-95; 212 males, 211 females) who had complaints that suggested the presence of orthopedic disease were examined.</p>
<p>There were 270 patients who had complaints regarding the finger, 219 the spine, 179 the foot and ankle, 136 the knee, 117 the shoulder, and 94 the hip.</p>
<p>One hundred patients were diagnosed with carpal tunnel syndrome, 97 with trigger finger, 67 with dialysis amyloidosis of the shoulder, 63 with destructive spondyloarthropathy, and 56 with dialysis amyloidosis of the hip.</p>
<p>Five patients (7 ankles) (mean age, 57.8 years; range, 47-69) were diagnosed with tarsal tunnel syndrome, with a mean dialysis duration of 23.4 (range, 7-30) years (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1071100712466388">Table 1</xref>). The affected ankles were 3 left ankles and 4 right ankles. The average duration from the onset of tarsal tunnel syndrome to confirmation of the diagnosis was 2.2 weeks (range, 1-4 weeks). Related conditions included 5 cases of carpal tunnel syndrome and dialysis-related amyloidosis, 4 cases of destructive spondyloarthropathy, 1 case of diabetic peripheral neuropathy, 1 case of lumbar disc herniation, and 1 case of arteriosclerosis obliterans. Spinal stenosis was recognized in 4 patients who underwent lumbar spine MRI. Night pain, dialysis pain, and sensory abnormalities on both plantar medial/lateral sides were found in 7 ankles.</p>

<p>In terms of nerve conduction velocity, 4 patients (4 ankles) showed a delay of 5.4 milliseconds or more, and 3 patients (3 ankles) could not be measured because of disease severity.</p>
<p>Enlargement of the soft tissue silhouette was recognized in 7 ankles on plain radiograph. Bone cysts and bone erosion or destruction were recognized in 6 ankles. There were no cases of joint space narrowing or juxta-articular bone atrophy. Enlargement of the soft tissue silhouette and talocalcaneal joint destruction in 7 ankles and cystic mass in 3 ankles were discovered with CT and MRI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1071100712466388">Figure 1</xref>). Among the 4 ankles on which an ultrasound study was conducted, nerve stenosis and cystic mass were discovered in 4 cases and an enlargement of the soft tissue as well as amyloid deposition was discovered in 3 cases.</p>

<title>Treatment</title>
<p>With conservative treatment consisting of rest, medication (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and vitamin B<sub>12</sub>), and a steroid injection in all patients, 4 patients (4 ankles) showed an improvement. Night pain and dialysis pain were reduced within 4 months. However, the symptoms of numbness did not disappear in any of these patients.</p>
<p>Surgery was performed in 3 patients (3 ankles). The duration from confirmation of the diagnosis to surgery was 1, 2, and 24 months, respectively. In 1 patient, the duration from confirmation of the diagnosis to surgery was 24 months because he rejected an operation at 1 month after confirming tarsal tunnel syndrome. The flexor retinaculum was thin in all the cases, with no thickening observed. Amyloidoma, fragile deposits like nodular tumor in the soft tissue or thecal surface, proliferation of the synovial tendon sheath, and thickened joint capsules were recognized in 3 ankles, and a concomitant ganglion was recognized in 1 ankle. Histologically, the deposition of hyaline materials was recognized in all tissues, including the walls of the ganglion or joint capsule, by staining to a pale red color using Congo red stain. An immunohistochemical study indicated positive staining by β-2 microglobulin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1071100712466388">Figure 2</xref>). Pain disappeared in 3 patients within 1 week.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Tarsal tunnel syndrome is an entrapment disorder of the tibial nerve in the tarsal tunnel.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1071100712466388">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1071100712466388">14</xref></sup> Pain or sensory abnormalities in each innervation region arise when the medial plantar nerve branching from the tibial nerve or lateral plantar nerve is compressed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1071100712466388">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1071100712466388">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1071100712466388">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1071100712466388">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1071100712466388">15</xref></sup> Although no frequency of occurrence has been reported, Cimino<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1071100712466388">2</xref></sup> reported in 1990 that there were 186 cases in 24 reports in the literature. The critical cause was reported to be apparent in 60% to 80% of cases, such as space-occupying lesions,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1071100712466388">9</xref></sup> and Cimino reported that 25 of 122 cases, of which the causes were listed, were idiopathic, 21 were traumatic, and 3 were due to ganglions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1071100712466388">2</xref></sup> In contrast, Tobimatsu et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1071100712466388">26</xref></sup> reported that among 24 cases of tarsal tunnel syndrome, 9 were traumatic and 6 involved ganglions.</p>
<p>However, reports regarding tarsal tunnel syndrome among dialysis patients are very rare and mostly consist of case reports.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1071100712466388">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1071100712466388">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1071100712466388">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1071100712466388">25</xref></sup> Therefore, studies on the occurrence and pathological process of tarsal tunnel syndrome in dialysis patients have been difficult.</p>
<p>In this study, tarsal tunnel syndrome developed in 5 of 1011 dialysis patients. All of these patients had undergone dialysis for 5 years or longer. Three patients among the 4 reported in the past<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1071100712466388">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1071100712466388">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1071100712466388">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1071100712466388">25</xref></sup> had a history of dialysis of 5 years or longer. Therefore, the occurrence of tarsal tunnel syndrome in dialysis patients was 0.5%, with the tendency more prevalent among patients undergoing 5 or more years of dialysis. Considering that few reports on tarsal tunnel syndrome in dialysis patients have been published,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1071100712466388">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1071100712466388">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1071100712466388">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1071100712466388">25</xref></sup> we suspected that cases of tarsal tunnel syndrome might thus have been overlooked. We believe that the possibility of tarsal tunnel syndrome should be investigated in patients with a history of dialysis of 5 years or longer along with numbness or pain in their feet.</p>
<p>Numbness or pain in the foot occurs in spinal diseases such as lumbar spinal stenosis or lumbar intervertebral disc herniation, neuropathy associated with diabetes or uremia, hematogenous disorders associated with arteriosclerosis obliterans or diabetes, and local neurological disorders of the foot. Although the diagnoses have become definitive by recognizing the Tinel-like sign in all patients in this case, lumbar spinal stenosis was recognized in 4 patients. When tarsal tunnel syndrome is still in the early stages or the degree of the disorder is not severe, Tinel’s sign sometimes does not appear positive. In addition, even in the nerve conduction study, there are cases that were not able to be measured, making up approximately 4% of people 60 years or older, and it has been reported that cases that were not able to be measured exist among long-term dialysis patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1071100712466388">16</xref></sup> Above all, in cases for which definitive diagnosis is difficult, we believe that differential diagnosis might need to be conducted, keeping double crush syndrome in mind. We also believe that we should pay closer attention to the existence of tarsal tunnel syndrome when examining patients with spine abnormality or diabetic peripheral neuropathy.</p>
<p>To confirm the diagnosis of tarsal tunnel syndrome, we used CT, MRI, or ultrasound. Frey and Kerr<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1071100712466388">5</xref></sup> reported the efficacy of MRI in patients with tarsal tunnel syndrome. We also recommend MRI because it can demonstrate an inflammatory or mass lesion in the tarsal tunnel. However, in cases for which MRI is not possible because of a pacemaker or other problem, CT and ultrasound are effective for confirming the diagnosis.</p>
<p>Sammarco et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1071100712466388">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1071100712466388">23</xref></sup> reported that operative findings included arterial vascular leashes indenting the nerve, scarring in or around the nerve, venous varicosities, fascial constructions, and space-occupying lesions including accessory flexor digitorum longus muscle, ganglion cyst, bone spur, and neuroma. In our patients, amyloidoma, fragile deposits like nodular tumor in the soft tissue or thecal surface, and proliferation of the synovial tendon sheath were recognized, and thickened joint capsules were recognized in 3 ankles among the patients with tarsal tunnel syndrome on whom surgery was performed, with concomitant ganglions recognized in the ankle. No vascular problems, anomalies, intrinsic peripheral neural disease, or associated comorbidities were found. In the 4 ankles on which conservative treatment was performed, findings suggesting amyloidoma were recognized on MRI and/or ultrasound studies. In past reports, amyloid tumors were discovered in 2 patients on whom surgery was performed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1071100712466388">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1071100712466388">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1071100712466388">25</xref></sup>; amyloidoma is the main abnormality of tarsal tunnel syndrome in dialysis patients. Furthermore, multiple complexities including enlargement of the tendon or tenosynovitis caused by amyloid deposition in the surrounding tissues, enlargement of the joint capsule, and joint destruction were believed to arise. However, whether these amyloidoma are specific changes in dialysis amyloidosis, which is the slowly grown deposition of amyloid, remains unknown. The flexor retinaculum was thin in all cases, with retinaculum-like thickness not found in carpal tunnel syndrome. Therefore, we believe that its pathological process may be different from that of carpal tunnel syndrome.</p>
<p>In this study, we evaluated 1011 patients as subjects. This number of subjects is equivalent to 1 of 300 of patients undergoing maintenance dialysis in Japan, and we believe that this number is sufficient to evaluate the epidemiological and pathological characteristics. Five patients (7 ankles) were diagnosed with tarsal tunnel syndrome, and surgery was performed in 3 patients (3 ankles).</p>
<p>In summary, we believe that amyloidoma is the main abnormality of tarsal tunnel syndrome in dialysis patients. Tarsal tunnel syndrome was very rare in patients undergoing hemodialysis.</p>
