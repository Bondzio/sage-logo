<p>Recently, many state and local governments have implemented furloughs as a major strategy to deal with budget crises. Furloughs are often used as a temporary tool by which organizations try to save costs and at the same time, minimize layoffs. It is little known whether furloughs have the same impact on management as other cutback measures. This study examines furlough issues in public organizations with a more holistic view, from formulation of policy, to implementation, to outcome evaluation. We employed a survey of 273 employees in six state agencies. We found that furloughs have a significant individual impact on job satisfaction, financial burden, workload, and career stability while individual work performance, basically, did not change. However, the impact on an organizational level seemed limited—employees were more likely to view furloughs as “reasonable.”</p>

<body>
<p>The recent economic crisis has promulgated the return of cutback management, a popular approach to public management during the early 1980s, one of the most critical recessions in recent history. In dealing with financial crises and the trend toward privatization, governments have been more strategic, particularly when handling personnel. Rather than committing mass layoffs, governments are relying on temporary measures when trying to mitigate harmful impacts on local economies, focusing on saving jobs as much as possible. Options eschewing lay-offs such as furloughs, hiring freezes, wage cuts, and pay schedule delays, have been adopted. Among them, furloughs are a very popular alternative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0734371X13477426">Vu, 2009</xref>). By instituting furloughs, governments save jobs and reduce costs by cutting wages. Additionally, they can still provide services without serious interruptions by maintaining human capital and retaining employee capacities. Even labor unions support this alternative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0734371X13477426">Cockerham, 2009a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0734371X13477426">2009b</xref>).</p>
<p>As with other cutback management tools, however, furloughs may have some negative impact, particularly on employee job satisfaction and performance. Leaves without pay can bring some emotional and financial burdens. Negotiating and planning furloughs may also damage the relationship between managers and staff. Accordingly, it becomes important for public organizations to minimize negative impacts and to adjust to the new financial environment.</p>
<p>Despite such importance, there have been few empirical studies regarding furloughs. Our study examines the effects of furloughs on personnel management and work performance holistically, from formulation of policy, to implementation, to effects on the organization, to outcome evaluation. Human resource literature states that as government agencies employ cutbacks, retrenchment, or downsizing, employees’ morale and job satisfaction invariably decreases as does performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0734371X13477426">Feldheim, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0734371X13477426">Moore, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0734371X13477426">U.S. Merit System Protection Board, 1981</xref>). Is there no real difference between furlough policy and other cutback measures?</p>
<p>The literature has always addressed the emotional effect on employees during cutbacks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0734371X13477426">Robinson &amp; Rousseau, 1994</xref>) with the most serious problem being the dramatic decrease in morale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0734371X13477426">Kiviat, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0734371X13477426">Moore, 1985</xref>). Cutback policies rescind any hopes of employee advancement while challenging perceptions of positive self-worth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0734371X13477426">Behn, 1980</xref>). When employees realize that the organization is moving from growth to decline, their confidence in their ability to control events seriously drops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0734371X13477426">Behn, 1980</xref>). Additionally, they lose their focus and interest on work and service delivery. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0734371X13477426">Cameron (1994)</xref> surveyed senior managers in downsized companies and found that 74% of respondents observed a reduction of morale, trust and productivity. Similarly, the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0734371X13477426">Merit Systems Protection Board (1981)</xref> found that 100% of the employees in the organization were impacted negatively. Noticeably, they suffered depression, decreased self-esteem, insecurity, conflict, bitterness, loss of trust, less respect for management, guilt, and a decline in morale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0734371X13477426">Feldheim, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0734371X13477426">Kennedy, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0734371X13477426">Lewis, Shannon, &amp; Feree, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0734371X13477426">Tselikis, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>From rumor to actual workforce reduction, turmoil and uncertainty are often the major impact on an organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0734371X13477426">Holzer, 1986</xref>). In the short time between rumors and actual implementation, employees suffer a variety of stresses such as job insecurity, the fear of dead-end career paths and salary reductions. Employees enter a “mourning period,” feeling that the organization has broken a tacit social contract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0734371X13477426">De Vries, Manfred, &amp; Balazs, 1997</xref>). As morale declines, so does job satisfaction and motivation. During this turbulent time, employees, particularly the best and most talented, those needed most by the organization, become discouraged and seek greener pastures. The organization loses its best employees and the resources invested in recruiting and training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0734371X13477426">Moore, 1985</xref>).</p>
<p>Emotional effects on employees are generally viewed as significant negative variables in relation to performance and productivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0734371X13477426">Jacobs, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0734371X13477426">Lewis et al., 1983</xref>). More filing of grievances takes place (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0734371X13477426">Chadwick, Hunter, &amp; Stephen, 2004</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0734371X13477426">Rich (1983)</xref> observes that it is has always been difficult to gauge the effect of such cutback strategies on productivity in municipal departments. Understaffed departments have an unsettling effect on employees. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0734371X13477426">Levine (1979)</xref> adds that hiring freezes, a convenient short-term strategy, leaves the organization critically short of technical expertise. Long term planning becomes difficult while the staff becomes more difficult to stimulate, and retain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0734371X13477426">Jacobs, 2009</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0734371X13477426">Rich (1983)</xref> describes ensuing delays in management upgrading and cancellation of training and development programs, causing more of a debilitating effect on morale. He also found that organizations did not deem downsizing to be efficient. Only 46% reduced expenses and only 32% of private companies increased profits. Stressful decisions must be made about terminations and downsizing departments.</p>
<p>We examined whether furloughs were just like any other cutback measure. In terms of the intensity of employee losses, furloughs appear to be a more minimal policy when compared to other extreme measures. There may be several reasons why furloughs are not similar to other cutbacks. First, furloughs are often viewed as a “job-saving action,” which is why labor unions and employees do not vehemently object to furloughs in comparison to other cutback options (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0734371X13477426">Green, 2010</xref>). For example, a 2009 survey of 245 U.S. companies revealed that 17% of organizational managers ordered mandatory furloughs, while 19% offered voluntary ones. Companies, experimenting with furloughs, hoped that by sharing the pain of the downturn, they would retain talent, win loyalty and position for a recovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0734371X13477426">Tuna, 2009</xref>). It also appears that public employees’ motivation to perform civic service, commitment to public policy and self-sacrifice also diminish negative effects on morale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0734371X13477426">Feldheim, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0734371X13477426">Frank &amp; Lewis, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0734371X13477426">Houston, 2000</xref>). When furloughs are implemented in an undifferentiated manner, employees view the process as egalitarian and appropriate, feeling fortunate to preserve their positions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0734371X13477426">Cunningham, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0734371X13477426">Smith, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Our study proposes that furloughs create less negative worker perceptions and milder effects on personnel than other cutback policies. Rather than testing a specific model of furloughs’ effects, we intend to describe the impacts of furloughs, facilitating theoretical implications for further empirical study. We use the case of Georgia that has not been spared a severe economic recession and has implemented several budget cuts the last few years. Former Governor Sonny Perdue urged agencies to cut as much as possible. Most agencies implemented their own budget-cutting plan, mostly by adopting and expanding furloughs. Accordingly, the case of Georgia will be useful in understanding furloughs’ impacts on working environments, job performance, workloads, work relationships, organizational performance, morale, and job satisfaction. Hence, we surveyed public employees in several state agencies, seeking lessons for improvement in furlough implementation.</p>

<title>Georgia’s Furlough Policy</title>
<p>In 2010 Georgia experienced a severe budget deficit. During Fiscal Year (FY) 2009 tax revenues declined 10.5 % from the previous year. This resulted in a budget shortfall of approximately US$650 million. Lawmakers closed the shortfall by using approximately US$365 million of the remaining state Revenue Shortfall Reserve funds, approximately US$190 million in federal “stimulus” funds, and other end-of-year savings. The revenue decline facilitated an FY 2010 budget shortfall of US$900 million. With only US$200 million in reserve funds available, the Governor needed to lower the FY 2010 revenue estimate by between US$1 billion and US$1.5 billion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0734371X13477426">GA Budget and Policy Institute, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0734371X13477426">GA Office of Planning and Budget, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Dealing with such budget constraints, at the beginning of FY 2010, the Governor ordered all agencies to prepare three additional cost cutting plans resulting in decreases of 6%, 8% and 10%. He also called for all state employees to be furloughed at least three days, but no more than 12, before the end of the fiscal year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0734371X13477426">GA Office of Planning and Budget, 2009</xref>). Agencies furloughed their employees to meet their own budgets. For example, the Department of Human Services furloughed 9,000 employees for 12 days during FY 2010 to save US$23 million. The 500 employees of the state’s Prosecutor’s Offices have furloughed employees once a month since September 2009 and twice a month since March 2010, saving those offices about US$2.8 million. The state Supreme Court furloughed Justices and all court staff for three days before the end of 2009. The Board of Regents furloughed its 40,000 employees six to 12 days saving US$42 million. In total, about 115,000 state government employees in Georgia were furloughed during FY 2010 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0734371X13477426">Vestal, 2009</xref>). Perdue also called for the state’s 128,000 teachers to be furloughed to save US$33 million a day. That decision was left up to individual school districts, but most adopted furloughs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0734371X13477426">Diamond, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Most agencies furloughed on Fridays, to minimize the loss of productivity and to maximize workers’ flexibility in using time off. The state exempted employees in departments that require 24-hour services, such as prisons and hospitals, and those employees who make less than US$23,660 a year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0734371X13477426">Vestal, 2009</xref>).</p>

<title>Method and Data</title>
<p>We constructed a survey questionnaire that includes diverse issues regarding furlough policy and implementation. The survey defined furloughs as “a mandatory temporary leave without pay usually resulting from a budget crisis in an agency.” First, we addressed impacts on the individual work environment; job performance; productivity; job stability; employee financial burden; employees’ emotional issues; morale; workload; working relationships, and employee turnover. Second, we studied impacts on the organizational level by including concerns such as organizational performance and productivity; overall morale; working conditions, and managerial changes. Third, we included several qualitative opinion questions, including the appropriateness of furlough policy, its implementation process, alternatives to furloughs, the use of furlough days, and the optimal organizational policy to deal with budget constraints. This survey intended to capture a complete view of furloughs in public organizations.</p>
<p>During September, 2010, we conducted the survey with state agency employees. There are about 108,000 full time employees in various agencies in Georgia. However, there is no complete directory that includes all employees’ contact information. Therefore, we randomly chose five major agencies from a list of state agencies, all diverse regarding employee composition and organizational mission. These agencies represent different types of employment arenas, yet they all implemented furloughs without any exceptions. Although these five agencies might not necessarily be sufficient to represent all Georgia agencies, considering the complexity of their diverse services, we feel that these selected organizations sufficiently represent the average variety of agencies that implemented furloughs as a critical financial strategy. We then obtained agency employee directories. Only one posts its complete directory on its website, while all the others provided printed copies. By using a systematic sampling, we selected 700 employees from the directories and then confirmed that their contact information, including email, was current. We emailed a preliminary message to the sample regarding our survey. Subsequently, 57 bounced back as undeliverable because they were nonexisting addresses. We replaced those 57 employees with those who had current information. We used a web-based survey since the employees in the agencies regularly access the internet in their work activities.</p>
<p>We received 298 responses; 25 were returned incomplete. Thus, we had 273 complete replies, a response rate of 39%. Since we did not include any personal identification questions (e.g., name or office), we cannot evaluate whether there was any systematic error in the survey’s participation. However, we think that the 25 incomplete surveys were provided by employees who had no furlough days as a result of the minimum salary stipulation or by those who were not interested in completing the questionnaire.</p>
<p>Demographically, 57% of participants were women, 43%, men. Regarding age, 44% were 50 years of age or over, 26% between 40 and 49 years old; 25% between 30 and 39; and only 5% under 30. Concerning service years in the current organization, 30% had worked more than 10 years; 29% between five and 10 years; and 41% had worked less than five years. Additionally, 84% responded that they had previous work experience in the private sector. The diverse composition of social and demographic factors represented in the sample seems to be typical of Georgia agencies. Of the 269 people who responded to the question regarding amount of furlough days received, almost 51% of respondents stated that they had six furlough days; 14% had 10; and 13% had three. Only 8% in the sample had more than 11 furlough days.</p>

<title>Findings</title>
<sec id="section4-0734371X13477426">
<title>Impacts on the Individual Level</title>
<p>As a result of furloughs, 38% responded that their wages were reduced by between 1% and 2.99% of their regular salary; 40% reported a reduction between 3% and 5%; 8% reported less than 1%, and 15% stated that more than 5% had been reduced. On average, about a 3% wage reduction arose for each individual staff member. Regarding wage reduction, 60% perceived it to be a significant, but bearable burden; 18% stated it had a small impact on their personal financial situation; 20% said it was unbearable; and 2% stated it had no impact.</p>
<p>The correlation between furlough days taken and severity of financial burden is significantly positive (correlation coefficient = .168, <italic>p</italic>-value =.006). Based on the linear relationship, it is estimated that seven furlough days created “a significant, but bearable burden,” while 32 furlough days (in fact, no one in the sample had 32 furlough days but if it is estimated) made workers experience an “unbearable burden.” The prediction might be useful information for managers planning furloughs. It appeared that most employees accepted the furlough policy, with some hardships.</p>
<p>Regarding the impact of furloughs on job satisfaction, emotional issues and morale, as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0734371X13477426">Table 1</xref>, a majority (about 58%) agreed either strongly (19%) or somewhat strongly (39%) that job satisfaction had decreased. Interestingly, men were more likely to feel a decline in career satisfaction. Sixty one percent of men indicated a decrease in job satisfaction due to furloughs, compared to 56% of women. Additionally, men were almost 9% more likely to proclaim emotional problems. Also, those who have worked longer periods in their current agencies were more likely to report a decline in job fulfillment. Fifty six percent agreed that their morale deteriorated. About 70% reported that they did not see an improvement in working conditions. However, almost 85% of respondents disagreed with the notion that they suffered emotional troubles as a result of furloughs. A question, “I would not recommend a job in the government sector for others,” had a divisive response: 43% agreed while 57% disagreed. In particular, 48% strongly disagreed that they were less inclined to take the initiative in work projects. The data appears to show a decrease in satisfaction and morale somewhat, but employees were still committed to their work.</p>

<p>In terms of perception of individual work performance, 70% responded that their work functioning neither improved nor deteriorated; 20% responded that it deteriorated somewhat, again, almost no change in job performance. Males were about 15% more likely to report that furloughs caused individual work performances to deteriorate. Accordingly, furloughs seem to have brought additional workloads; 66% agreed that their workload increased, while 34% reported no change.</p>
<p>Furloughs usually created extra leisure time for employees. When inquiring what workers did during furlough days, 46% said that they stayed home and relaxed; 35% still worked on their job assignments indicating a strong work commitment, thus, sustaining performance and productivity. Nineteen percent went on a trip; 16% took care of children; 13% searched for other employment; 6% worked at another job; 7% studied for job-related skills, and 3% attended school for an advanced degree. Other specified responses included “served on reserve military duty,” “ran errands,” “worked on home projects,” and “volunteered.” Regarding an employee’s individual plan for dealing with extended furlough periods in the future, respondents generally agreed that they would stay with their current job. Seventy three percent stated that they would not retire from their current position. Opinions were divided over whether they would search for another fulltime time job or for a secondary job. Forty five percent planned to “definitely” search for another fulltime job; 50% stated that they were interested in seeking a new job; and 52% stated that they would not find secondary employment to supplement decreased incomes. Men were about 14% more willing to find a secondary job.</p>
<p>Due to adversity and financial burden, about 45% considered seeking other employment. Of those, 77% considered finding another position in private companies. Forty eight percent mainly considered a federal agency; 28% considered starting their own business; 22% considered a nonprofit organization; 29% contemplated working in another Georgia agency; 17% considered a non-Georgia agency, and 22% considered local government.</p>

<sec id="section5-0734371X13477426">
<title>Impacts on the Organizational Level</title>
<p>Regarding responses related to the impacts on organizations, a majority of employees responded that they observed some (37%) or substantial (32%) deterioration of staff morale. As displayed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0734371X13477426">Table 2</xref>, only 35% observed that staff and client relationships deteriorated either somewhat (26%) or substantially (9%). Eighty six percent responded that there was no or little decrease in agency clients seeking services, indicating no particular change in the agency–client relationship. In terms of staff productivity, 59% responded that there was little or no decrease. About 30% reported some decrease. As for job satisfaction, males perceived a more significant deterioration in productivity: 45% of males indicated some or substantial deterioration of productivity, compared to 37% of females. To compensate for the potential loss of productivity and performance, organizations must plan alternative, more strategic programs Seventy percent responded that their organization did little or nothing to plan for alternatives; 44% stated that no innovations in services and administration were enacted; and 33% observed a few advances.</p>

<title>Appropriateness of the Furlough Policy</title>
<p>In regard to employees’ evaluation of the appropriateness of furloughs and their preferences concerning this policy, 39% responded that their organization’s policy was somewhat reasonable, 24% stated that it was very reasonable, 22% said that it was somewhat unreasonable, and 15% reported that it was very unreasonable. Employees generally agreed that furloughs were an unavoidable choice. What factors might affect the workers’ perception of furlough policy appropriateness? We developed a regression model including financial burden; job satisfaction; productivity; agency innovation; individual and organizational performance; workload; preparatory policies; and job security concerns. These variables could be used as valuable indicators to evaluate the policy’s overall appropriateness. Private sector experience and gender were used as control variables.</p>
<p>Policy appropriateness, the dependent variable, was measured by respondents’ perceptions of furloughs (1 = very reasonable, 2 = somewhat reasonable, 3 = somewhat unreasonable, and 4 = very unreasonable). As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0734371X13477426">Table 4</xref>, we found that financial burden is significantly associated with employees’ perception of policy appropriateness (<italic>p</italic> = &lt;.001), while controlling for other factors (e.g., workers who reported that furloughs resulted in an unbearable financial burden). Also it is the strongest predictor of the perception of policy appropriateness in the model. Organizational measures to try to soften any consequences of furloughs also had a significantly positive relationship to employees’ perception of policy appropriateness (<italic>p</italic> = &lt;.001). A decline of job satisfaction and deterioration of productivity were significantly associated with furlough policy appropriateness. When decreases in job satisfaction and productivity occurred, negative perceptions of the policies increased. Similarly, agency innovation in dealing with furloughs was an important predictor of employees’ perceptions of the appropriateness of the policy (<italic>p</italic> = .01). Likewise, in the qualitative responses, many comments addressed the need for further agency measures to deal with furloughs, before and during the programs.</p>

<p>However, work performance (productivity, initiative, and work interest) and workload were not significantly associated with appropriateness of the policy. We assume that the insignificant relationship may have been due to employee assertions that their performance and workload had not changed. Concern with job security (“not searching for a new job due to furloughs in the next fiscal year”), or the intent to search for another job, was not a significant predictor of policy appropriateness as well. Additionally, the variables, age, service experience, and gender were not significantly correlated to the perception of policy appropriateness.</p>
<p>In respect to the statement, “Furloughs are the best policy to save jobs during the budget crisis in organizations,” about 55% of respondents agreed. Female employees were significantly more likely to concur with this statement by a large margin, 10% (female 59%, male 49%). About 45% of employees disagreed with the idea, forwarding many alternatives. In response to the question, “What other option would be better than furloughs? They suggested the following: “permanent reductions,” “increasing organizational efficiencies,” “scaled-back policies,” “increases in teleworking,” “removing unnecessary projects,” “layoffs,” “salary cuts for higher income earners,” “ hiring freezes,” and “early retirement.”</p>
<p>The survey also asked the respondents to recommend better furlough implementation policies and 172 qualitative responses ensued. Among the responses, frequent themes were “allowing employees to schedule their own furloughs,” “enacting furlough days just before or after holidays,” “decreasing furloughs, but cutting costly projects,” “each office deciding its own furlough schedule,” “increasing the income level for furlough exemptions,” and “longer notifications of furloughs.”</p>

<title>Discussion and Conclusion</title>
<p>This study was designed to examine various effects of furloughs on management and employee performance in public organizations. Overall, individual employees perceived that furloughs had a significant impact on their financial burden, job satisfaction, morale, and work conditions. However, they generally reported that there was no visible change in work performance and productivity. On the organizational level, similar responses occurred. Organizational performance and productivity did not change noticeably. Such a relatively neutral or positive view seems to indicate that more employees accepted furloughs as a reasonable policy considering current economic conditions. Employee views were realistic as they asked, “what other option would be better?” There appears to be no superior alternative during cutbacks. The policy’s major positive effects include saving significant amounts of organizational costs while maintaining the current workforce, translating into no layoffs.</p>
<p>So, where did the worker determination come from? The fortitude possibly resulted from furloughs not facilitating any change in organizational structure. Centralization, or strong concentrated managerial control from an office usually detached from a particular agency, typically ameliorates workers’ trust of management during cutbacks, which accordingly, affects job performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0734371X13477426">Curtis, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0734371X13477426">Hall, 1982</xref>). Hence, we did not observe a perception of a threatening environment in the agencies. Employee resilience may have been better explained by their desire to perform service for the “public good.” When employees understand the overall condition of the economy, they may be inclined to be compliant with the agency’s reduction intentions.</p>
<p>Although workers appeared to be more tolerant of furloughs, they recommended many things to consider before and during implementation. They stated that furloughs should be planned early. Respondents reported that they needed longer prior notification to prepare personal financial strategies. They commonly mentioned that more consensus-building processes were needed. Furloughs were adopted under a traditional top-down chain of command structure, often leaving employees with little flexibility in adapting. A substantial increase in communication between managers and staff members seems necessary. Additionally, more flexibility in deciding furlough schedules should be given to each unit within organizations. Fridays appear to be good furlough days for many employees. However, depending on the unit or office, other days could be considered. Therefore, rather than having agency-wide furlough days, individual employees should have more flexibility in deciding their own furlough days.</p>
<p>This study provides implications for personnel managers. As assumed, as organizations attempt to soften the impact of furloughs, employees will be more supportive of the policy, as a result, performance and productivity should not change. Subsequently, furloughs may be considered a necessary evil as its impact on job turnover appears to be minimal.</p>
<p>Although this study intended to examine furlough issues with a holistic view, it may need innovations for further research. Primarily, among genders, we found significantly different responses to furloughs in regard to several work related issues. Thus, it may be important to further investigate furloughs’ impact on male and female employees by including greater and more diverse (race, age) samples and expanding the study to several other furlough-adopting state and local agencies severely affected by the recession.</p>
