<abstract>
<p>The management of diabetic ankle fractures is difficult given the associated wound and bone healing complications. Even with meticulous soft tissue handling and a stable construct, the fixation sometimes fails because of the poor biological environment. This study reports on 2 cases of Weber type B ankle fractures in patients with diabetes mellitus where the authors elected to treat with arthroscopy-assisted fracture reduction and percutaneous fibula nailing to reduce the risk of wound complications.</p>

<title>Case 1</title>
<p>A 52-year-old woman presented to the emergency department following a low-energy twisting injury to her left ankle. She had been diagnosed with type II diabetes mellitus 7 years ago and had been on oral metformin therapy for the past 4 years. She reported a moderate level of functional activity with no symptoms of end-stage organ damage secondary to her diabetes. She had no other significant medical problems.</p>
<p>Examination at the acute presentation revealed a moderately swollen left ankle with an anterior ankle fracture blister. Pedal pulses were present and sensory examination was normal. Preliminary anterior Mortise and direct lateral radiographs showed an unstable Weber B2 distal fibula fracture with an associated medial malleolar fracture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1938640011434511">Figure 1</xref>). The ankle was immobilized in a below-knee split cast prior to transfer to the orthopaedic ward. Laboratory evaluation revealed a hemoglobin A1c of 7.6 and otherwise normal clotting and electrolyte profile.</p>

<title>Case 2</title>
<p>A 56-year-old woman presented to the emergency department with a history of having fallen off a pavement almost 24 hours prior. She had been diagnosed with type I diabetes mellitus 15 years ago and also has a known history of hypertension, mild asthma, and moderate renal impairment.</p>
<p>Examination showed a significantly swollen ankle with extensive anterior bruising and moderate tenting of the skin. Pedal pulses were normal and sensation was grossly intact. Preliminary Mortise and direct lateral radiographs showed a Weber type B trimalleolar ankle fracture that was displaced in both views (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1938640011434511">Figure 3</xref>). The ankle was immobilized in a below-knee split cast and the patient transferred to the orthopaedic ward. Laboratory evaluation revealed a hemoglobin A1c of 8.3 and mild normochromic normocytic anemia.</p>

<sec id="section4-1938640011434511">
<title>Operative Technique</title>
<p>Both operations were performed in a similar fashion. The patient was positioned supine with a thigh tourniquet in place.</p>
<p>First, an ankle arthroscopy was performed using traction. Minimal traction was applied using a tensor bandage only when the posterior aspect of the talus needed to be visualized to diagnose associated chondral injury. The standard arthroscopic anteromedial and anterolateral portals were used. Clot was washed out of the joint and the fracture pattern inspected. In particular, the rotation and length of the distal fibula was observed. In case 2, the posterior malleolar fracture fragment was reduced first (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1938640011434511">Figure 1</xref>). A large fracture reduction forceps was used to maintain reduction from the posterior malleolus to the tibia. Reduction was maintained with percutaneous lag screws and washers placed from posterior to anterior. Once this has been achieved, fibula reduction was attempted with traction applied to the tip of the fibula using percutaneous reduction forceps. Reduction was assessed using the C-arm and via the arthroscope.</p>
<p>Once the reduction was adequate, a small 1.5-cm incision was made over the tip of the fibula. A 1.6-mm K-wire was introduced from the tip of the fibula into the fibula canal. The entry point was kept perpendicular to the long axis of the fibula on all planes to ensure correct reduction of the fracture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1938640011434511">Figure 4</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>The distal 4 cm of the fibula was reamed with a 6.1-mm cannulated reamer to open the tip of the fibula to facilitate entry of the nail. The fibula nail was assembled on the back table. The rod was mounted on a targeting guide, which was then used to enter the fibula canal. Image control was used to ensure the rod was correctly seated in both the anteroposterior and lateral views. Two distal locking screws were inserted into the fibula in the anteroposterior direction.</p>
<p>A combined maneuver of traction and internal rotation was applied onto the rod to reduce the distal fibula. The final reduction was assessed both on image intensifier and via the arthroscope confirming that the fibula was out to length, internally rotated, and correctly aligned both in the sagittal and coronal planes, respectively. When this had been achieved, 2 syndesmosis screws were placed. In case 1, with an unstable syndesmosis, a reduction forceps was used at the same time to achieve syndesmosis compression.</p>
<p>Final fracture reduction was reassessed via arthroscopy and the image intensifier. For case 2, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1938640011434511">Figure 3</xref>) with the associated medial malleolar fracture, the final fracture reduction was confirmed arthroscopically following insertion of percutaneous compression screws.</p>

<p>Since the publication of Kristiansen’s<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1938640011434511">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1938640011434511">12</xref></sup> two series of ankle fractures in diabetic patients in 1980 and 1983, most experts concur that diabetes mellitus does pose an increased risk of complications following ankle fractures. These have included postoperative wound infections, Charcot neuropathy and delayed bone healing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1938640011434511">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1938640011434511">14</xref></sup> Although the role of good glycemic control and end-stage organ damage have gained increasing significance as prognostic markers in an evolving body of level III and level IV evidence, the relative merits of operative versus nonoperative treatment in this high-risk population continue to be debated.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1938640011434511">15</xref></sup> Nevertheless, most experts still continue to treat the unstable ankle fracture in the high-risk diabetic in the customary operative fashion using open reduction and internal rigid fixation.</p>
<p>In our experience of managing these high-risk patients with the percutaneous fibula nailing aided by arthroscopic fracture reduction, the authors have had promising early results. The first patient (case 1), is now 3 months postsurgery and has had no wound complications with excellent fracture reduction and early signs of radiological healing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1938640011434511">Figure 5</xref>). The second woman (case 2), is now 8 weeks postsurgery and has completely healed surgical stab incisions with a healthy soft tissue envelope over her anterior ankle joint (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1938640011434511">Figure 6</xref>).</p>

<p>The role of the fibula nail in the management of displaced Weber type B ankle fractures in the elderly patient and in those patients with poor soft tissue envelopes has long been recognized.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1938640011434511">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1938640011434511">17</xref></sup> Restoration of the lateral cortical buttress using a fibula nail with interlocking screws followed by intraoperative screening to ensure reduction of the talar shift and assessment of the medial column have been the surgical principles of those who advocate this technique.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1938640011434511">18</xref></sup> More recently, however, there has been an increasing body of evidence to suggest that the long-term outcome of ankle fractures is more related to the injury to the joint surface rather than the bony injury itself.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1938640011434511">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1938640011434511">20</xref></sup> Articular lesions are postulated to occur in 50% to 80% of ankle fractures. As such, arthroscopic assessment of the joint at the time fracture fixation may result in better outcomes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1938640011434511">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>Apart from patients with diabetes, an ankle fracture presenting after a high-energy transfer injury may warrant a computed tomographic scan of the ankle to help exclude a significant ankle chondral injury. If this is present, a diagnostic ankle arthroscopy can be performed prior to fracture reduction and stabilization to assess the extent of the chondral impaction injury or cartilage defects, other associated fractures of the talus or distal tibia, syndesmosis instability, or loose bodies. Arthroscopy will then enable debridement of these cartilage defects, removal of loose bodies, and finally assessment of fracture reduction of the joint surface after provisional fixation.</p>
<p>On behalf of our experience with 2 patients, we feel arthroscopy-aided fibula nailing of unstable ankle fractures in the high-risk diabetic patient offers a novel combination of 2 promising techniques. In the setting of our 2 patients, the fibula nail fixation system enabled minimal soft tissue dissection and a stable construct with good rotational stability. It was also easy to perform technically. In our experience, given the narrow dimensions of the fibula, an accurate trajectory of the guide wire is essential to ensure fracture reduction is maintained and the final position of the nail is in neutral. In the difficult fibula fracture reduction case, we anticipate performing a percutaneous reduction using the pointed fracture-reducing forceps under fluoroscopy to achieve neutral rotation and length. In both our cases, the role of arthroscopy was pivotal to reaffirm that the fibula is out to length and in neutral rotation and to confirm the accurate intra-articular reduction of the medial and posterior malleolar fracture fragments postnailing. Furthermore, in this younger age group, arthroscopy provides valuable prognostic information on the degree of chondral injury. The first woman (case 1) also sustained an anterolateral tibial impaction injury that was debrided arthroscopically. In both cases, arthroscopy time was kept to the bare minimum and no debridement of the soft tissue was performed so as to limit the extravasation of arthroscopy fluid which would compromise the soft tissue envelope further. Accelerated wound healing enabled both our patients to begin ankle range of motion exercises at 3 weeks postsurgery and partial weight-bearing out of the walker boot at 6 weeks postsurgery.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Poor wound healing and bone healing are inherently more common after ankle fractures in patients with diabetes mellitus. The novel combination of arthroscopy-aided fracture reduction and minimally invasive fibula nailing of unstable Weber type B ankle fractures is an attractive alternative to conventional plate fixation in patients with poor skin conditions or poor healing capacity such as those with open fractures or rheumatoid arthritis.</p>
