<abstract>
<p>Juvenile delinquency is an ongoing social problem particularly among low-income urban youth who are regularly exposed to numerous risk factors. Although much research has been conducted in this area, the most at-risk youth have been largely neglected. This study examines the role of peer deviance in mediating the influence of adult monitoring on male and female adolescents’ delinquent behavior, using multisource, multimethod data with an emphasis on differing impacts across the two genders. Results suggest that the level of peer deviance partially mediates the impact of monitoring on delinquent behavior, even after controlling for previous levels of delinquency. However, girls’ delinquency appear to be more influenced by peers than their perceptions of monitoring. Conversely, boys’ delinquent behavior is associated with daily immediate monitoring, not peer behaviors. These results are discussed in the context of particular issues facing low-income urban African American families.</p>

<p>Juvenile delinquency continues to be a serious concern for both its immediate and long-term effects, including decreased educational commitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0272431610397661">Vazsonyi &amp; Flannery, 1997</xref>), peer rejection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0272431610397661">Cairns, Cairns, Neckerman, Gest, &amp; Gariepy, 1988</xref>), substance use, and adult criminality. Furthermore, young offenders create a costly burden on society because of the numerous interventions, services, and agencies with which they will have contact throughout their lifetime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0272431610397661">Loeber &amp; Farrington, 2000</xref>). Understanding the complex etiology of juvenile delinquency has, therefore, become a research priority in recent years. Unfortunately, the nonrepresentative samples of past research (e.g., middle to upper class, European American men) provide limited understanding of how various predictors influence delinquency among youth living in communities where poverty and exposure to violence are part of their daily experiences. Moreover, the effects of various predictors on delinquency across gender are not well understood. This study examined the effects of adult monitoring and affiliation with deviant peers on the delinquent behaviors of low-income urban African American male and female adolescents.</p>
<p>Researchers suggest that delinquent behavior may be normative among low-income urban youth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0272431610397661">Henry, Tolan, &amp; Gorman-Smith, 2001</xref>), and documented rates of aggressive behavior in this population are well above national standards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0272431610397661">Guerra, Huesmann, Tolan, Van Acker, &amp; Eron, 1995</xref>). For urban boys living in the most disadvantaged neighborhoods, even a significant number of promotive factors (e.g., high accountability, good relationship with parents) does not entirely protect against delinquency. Surprisingly, initiation of delinquent behavior occurs as early as elementary school among youth in the most at-risk communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0272431610397661">Stouthamer-Loeber, Loeber, Wei, Farrington, &amp; Wikstrom, 2002</xref>). Concerning African American youth in particular, various sociodemographic factors appear to increase the risk of juvenile crime including single-parent homes and neighborhood characteristics (e.g., high crime, unemployment, vandalism); however, certain other factors (e.g., religiosity, strong family ties) serve a unique protective function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0272431610397661">Entner Wright &amp; Younts, 2009</xref>). Given these considerations, it is quite possible that the mechanisms or pathways that result in delinquent behavior among low-income urban African American youth are different than those in other populations.</p>
<p>Adult monitoring of youth’s whereabouts, companionship and activities is one of the most consistently cited correlate of problem behaviors. Across ethnically and socioeconomically diverse samples, a lack of monitoring is consistently associated with alcohol and drug use, aggression, and school misconduct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0272431610397661">Barnes &amp; Farrell, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0272431610397661">Brown, Mounts, Lamborn, &amp; Steinberg, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0272431610397661">Kim, Hetherington, &amp; Reiss, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0272431610397661">Vazsonyi &amp; Flannery, 1997</xref>). Poorly monitored youth appear more vulnerable to peer pressure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0272431610397661">Flannery, Williams, &amp; Vazsonyi, 1999</xref>), and monitoring is an effective predictor of both the severity and frequency of delinquent behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0272431610397661">Patterson &amp; Stouthamer-Loeber, 1984</xref>). These associations appear to hold across different environments as well. For instance, in a longitudinal investigation of urban, minority adolescent males, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0272431610397661">Gorman-Smith, Tolan, Zelli, and Huesmann (1996)</xref> found that those juveniles categorized as serious chronic offenders were likely to come from homes with such an extreme lack of parental involvement that many would have met the legal requirements for neglect.</p>
<p>What constitutes adequate monitoring is likely to change over different stages of development. As children enter adolescence, they typically become more emotionally and behaviorally autonomous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0272431610397661">Holmbeck, 1994</xref>), experience less direct supervision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0272431610397661">Pagani, Tremblay, Vitaro, Kerr, &amp; McDuff, 1998</xref>), and attend more unstructured and unsupervised activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0272431610397661">Stoolmiller, 1994</xref>). Time that was previously spent with families may be spent alone or among friends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0272431610397661">Larson &amp; Richards, 1991</xref>). As a result, this developmental stage becomes a particularly risky period for the development of delinquent behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0272431610397661">Flannery et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0272431610397661">Jessor, Van Den Bos, Vanderryn, Costa, &amp; Turbin, 1995</xref>). Parents and caregivers must learn to balance the competing needs of adolescent autonomy and effective oversight of youth’s activities. Remote supervision, whereby parents keep track of their children through phone calls and other indirect means, becomes increasingly necessary during adolescence. Research has shown that these strategies are effective in reducing delinquency and even so-called latchkey kids are no more likely than youth who come home to a parent to engage in problem behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0272431610397661">Flannery et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0272431610397661">Steinberg, 1986</xref>). When youth voluntarily disclose information about their activities, associates, and whereabouts, parental knowledge increases and the risk of delinquent behavior decreases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0272431610397661">Smetana, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Family, social, and cultural factors also affect the strategies and needs for monitoring adolescents over time. For middle-class families, both mothers and fathers spend more time with same-sex than opposite-sex adolescents; however, mothers have more knowledge of their adolescents’ peer relationships in general (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0272431610397661">Updegraff, McHale, Crouter, &amp; Kupanoff, 2001</xref>) and tend to gain information through active supervision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0272431610397661">Waizenhofer, Buchanan, &amp; Jackson-Newson, 2004</xref>). In dual-earner families, active supervision appears to be more successful than among single-earner families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0272431610397661">Waizenhofer et al., 2004</xref>). In urban areas, youth are more likely to encounter negative influences when they are unsupervised, including violence and other criminal activity as well as beliefs that promote aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0272431610397661">Guerra et al., 1995</xref>). Many urban neighborhoods are densely populated, allowing youth easier access to peers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0272431610397661">Boykin-McElhaney &amp; Allen, 2001</xref>), and particularly disadvantaged areas lack informal social control processes, whereby community members collectively regulate the behavior of youth (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0272431610397661">Sampson, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>One of the primary justifications for ensuring adequate monitoring is limiting the influence of deviant peer groups. Parental inconsistency and low levels of monitoring are linked to increased contact with delinquent peer groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0272431610397661">Brody et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0272431610397661">Pettit, Bates, Dodge, &amp; Meece, 1999</xref>) among both male and female youth. Boys generally experience less parental monitoring than girls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0272431610397661">Flannery et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0272431610397661">Kim et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0272431610397661">Richards, Miller, O’Donnell, Wasserman, &amp; Colder, 2004</xref>), and they typically report spending more unsupervised time with their friends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0272431610397661">Mears, Ploeger, &amp; Warr, 1998</xref>). The literature on adolescent delinquency has examined the association with deviant peer groups as a risk factor for delinquency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0272431610397661">Brendgen, Vitaro, &amp; Bukowski, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0272431610397661">Henry et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0272431610397661">Magnusson et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0272431610397661">Matsueda &amp; Anderson, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0272431610397661">Snyder, Dishion, &amp; Patterson, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0272431610397661">Weaver &amp; Prelow, 2005</xref>) and substance use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0272431610397661">Aseltine, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0272431610397661">Hawkins, Catalano, &amp; Miller, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0272431610397661">Newcomb &amp; Bentler, 1986</xref>). Research suggests that the link between poor monitoring and affiliation with deviant peers exists regardless of adolescents’ previous behavioral inclinations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0272431610397661">Dishion, Capaldi, Spracklen, &amp; Li, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0272431610397661">Dishion, Patterson, Stoolmiller, &amp; Skinner, 1991</xref>). Thus, even youth who would appear to be at low risk for problem behaviors may develop them in the context of poor supervision and peer pressures. Nevertheless, lax monitoring is particularly risky for youth predisposed to delinquency.</p>
<p>Most adolescents who engage in delinquent activities do so in the context of their peer groups. Keenan and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0272431610397661">Keenan, Loeber, Zhang, Stouthamer-Loeber, &amp; Van Nammen, 1995</xref>) reported that male youth involved with delinquent peers show a two- to four-fold increase in delinquent behavior over time. Aggressive or antisocial boys often band together to form like-minded peer groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0272431610397661">Stoolmiller, 1994</xref>) in which law-violating behaviors may actually become a means of group identification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0272431610397661">Heaven &amp; Virgen, 2001</xref>). Furthermore, the majority of juvenile crimes occur within a group context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0272431610397661">Aultman, 1980</xref>). Delinquent acts, such as substance abuse, theft, and vandalism, are more likely to be committed by an adolescent when he or she is with one or more peers than when he or she is alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0272431610397661">Emler, Reicher, &amp; Ross, 1987</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition to examining the role of peer groups in association with delinquent behavior, recent studies have also explored the role that gender plays in the manifestation of delinquent behavior. Recent statistics note that though rates of juvenile arrests have declined among boys, female arrests for certain categories of offenses (e.g., aggravated or simple assault) have either declined at a slower rate or increased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0272431610397661">Snyder, 2008</xref>). Other authors have suggested that the gender gap in delinquency has shrunk in high-risk urban contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0272431610397661">Farrel et al., 2000</xref>). In particular, gender plays a significant role in the development of delinquent behavior, with empirical evidence suggesting that delinquent peer groups exert less of an influence on girls than boys (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0272431610397661">Crosnoe, Erikson, &amp; Dornbusch, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0272431610397661">Mears et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0272431610397661">Piquero, Gover, MacDonald, &amp; Piquero, 2005</xref>). Several other factors have been raised to explain this gender difference. For example, girls’ socialization process is more likely to lead them toward moral judgments against delinquency and violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0272431610397661">Mears et al., 1998</xref>). However, with less serious offenses (e.g., theft, vandalism), delinquent peers may actually overcome girls’ moral constraints against acting out (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0272431610397661">Piquero et al., 2005</xref>). Early pubertal timing has also been shown to increase girls’ involvement in some risky behaviors (e.g., sexual risk taking; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0272431610397661">Belsky, Steinberg, Houts, &amp; Halpern-Felsher, 2010</xref>), though its association with delinquent behavior and drug use influence girls. The factors associated with girls’ involvement in delinquent activities will likely vary with their age and the age and gender composition of their peer groups.</p>
<p>Several models of family and peer effects on delinquent behavior have been empirically investigated (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0272431610397661">Henry et al., 2001</xref>). Most relevant to the current investigation are those models in which the influence of parental practices on delinquent behavior is mediated by peer effects. Dishion and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0272431610397661">Dishion, Patterson, &amp; Griesler, 1994</xref>) suggest that family practices, including monitoring, have a direct effect on problem behaviors of children and are also related to early peer group selection. Affiliation with deviant peer groups, in turn, contributes to escalating delinquency among youth. Therefore, the primary influence of low parental monitoring on delinquent behavior may be through its contribution to increased exposure to deviant peer groups. Other research has documented the direct and indirect effects of specific parenting practices. For instance, the relationship between parental involvement and problem behaviors has been shown to be partially mediated by school success and time spent with friends, with much similarity across gender and ethnicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0272431610397661">Pilgrim, Schulenberg, O’Malley, Bachman, &amp; Johnston, 2006</xref>). In contrast to mediation, moderation was examined and the interactive effects of poor parental monitoring and exposure to deviant peer groups appear to predict drug use among adolescent females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0272431610397661">Svensson, 2003</xref>). Lowered adult monitoring undoubtedly has some direct influence on delinquent behavior by providing children with an opportunity to engage in otherwise prohibited activities; however, it also acts indirectly by increasing the likelihood that adolescents will be exposed to other risk factors for delinquency, particularly deviant peers.</p>
<sec id="section1-0272431610397661">
<title>The Current Study</title>
<p>As noted earlier, adult monitoring of adolescent behaviors can take different forms depending on individual (e.g., gender of the adolescent) and contextual (e.g., neighborhood, culture) factors. Most of the existing literature on monitoring quantifies this construct using self-report measures, which may not always provide an accurate depiction of adolescents’ daily experience of supervision. The current study examines the relationship among adult monitoring, peer deviance, and adolescent delinquency in a sample of low-income urban African American youth. Several types of data were gathered to obtain a broader picture of youth’s daily experience of monitoring, including retrospective self-reports and experience sampling method (ESM; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0272431610397661">Larson, 1989</xref>) reports. Participants in this study were paged at random points throughout the day and asked to record their activities at that time. These data were intended to capture a more accurate index of supervision throughout the course of a day and allow for a comparison of how different reports of monitoring relate to exposure to peer deviance and involvement in delinquent behavior. We hypothesized a partially mediated model, such that adult monitoring would directly affect adolescents’ delinquent behavior but also have indirect influences through peer deviance.</p>
<p>The current study also provided an opportunity to explore different models of monitoring, peer deviance, and delinquent behavior across gender. Although there is considerable literature on the development of male delinquency, less is known about delinquent behaviors among girls. Understanding the contexts in which adolescent girls engage in delinquent behavior is increasingly important, given the documented rise in female youthful offending. Thus, a more thorough investigation into how these variables differentially affect boys and girls is necessary, particularly among low-income urban adolescents. The current study examines the unique contributions of monitoring and peer deviance to both female and male delinquency.</p>
<p>Consistent with previous research, we hypothesized that monitoring, peer deviance, and delinquent behavior will show cross-sectional associations at Times 1 (sixth grade) and 2 (seventh grade; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0272431610397661">Ge, Brody, Conger, Simons, &amp; Murry, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0272431610397661">Mears et al., 1998</xref>). Second, cross-sectional mediation is hypothesized such that the effect of monitoring on delinquent behavior will be significantly reduced, but not eliminated, with the inclusion of peer deviance. This repeated cross-sectional model is expected to hold at Time 2, after controlling for Time-1 levels of delinquent behavior. Regarding gender differences, boys are expected to consistently report higher levels of peer deviance and delinquent behavior as well as lower levels of monitoring compared to girls. It is expected that relative to girls, monitoring and peer deviance will show a stronger relationship with delinquency among boys.</p>

<title>Sample</title>
<p>A sample of 204 African American youth (40% boys, 60% girls) and their families were recruited in the sixth grade from six urban public schools in Chicago. This number represents 58% of total students approached, which falls in line with prior research concerning participation among low-income urban youth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0272431610397661">Allison et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0272431610397661">Cooley-Quille &amp; Lorion, 1999</xref>). Participants were recruited as part of a larger study examining the effects of exposure to violence among low-income urban youth. Schools were chosen because of the high rates of reported crime in the surrounding neighborhoods. Participation was voluntary, and all students were eligible to participate. Eighteen percent of the students who participated were omitted from the analysis because they did not respond to an agreed upon minimum of responses (see ESM procedure below). At each wave of assessment, researchers obtained both parental consent and child assent from study participants. Participants were given gift certificates, sports equipment, and games as incentives following data collection.</p>
<p>The participants were from relatively low-income households. At the first wave of data collection, the median annual family incomes ranged from US$10,000 to US$20,000 and 31% of parents were unemployed. A large majority of the parents (83%) had completed a high school degree, and only 10% of the parents reported college, graduate, or professional degrees. About half of the sample (48%) reported that they were living in single-parent households. The median number of family members per household was 5.</p>

<p>Data were collected over a period of 1 week, on 2 separate occasions that were 1 year apart. Seasonality did not differ across the two time points. During the weeklong assessment period, participants completed a battery of measures and participated in individual interviews. Trained research personnel administered these measures at each elementary school that participated.</p>
<p>Additional data were collected using the ESM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0272431610397661">Larson, 1989</xref>). For 1 week, participants wore wristwatches programmed to beep at randomly chosen times, once every hour and a half outside school and twice during school. Participants received a 40-min training session, prior to beginning the week of paging. They were signaled a total of 51 times throughout the week. Participants were signaled before and after school and on weekdays, weeknights, and weekends. To minimize disruption, they were signaled only twice during school. All students at an individual school had the same beep schedule. At the time of each signal, participants were instructed to stop what they were doing and complete a brief self-report form in an ESM booklet. Completion of the form required approximately 2 min. Questions gathered information regarding their companionship, activity, and internal state at the time of the signal.</p>
<p>Trained research assistants carefully instructed the participants on proper completion of the self-report questionnaires. The research staff also had daily visits with the participants to answer any questions about the ESM as well as to ensure compliant data collection. Participants were signaled a total of 51 times over a span of 1 week. As mentioned earlier, participants who responded to less than 15 signals were not included in ESM data analyses. The median number of responses to signals was 42, an 82% compliance rate, falling in line with accepted standards of ESM data collection compliance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0272431610397661">Larson, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0272431610397661">Larson, Richards, Sims, &amp; Dworkin, 2001</xref>).</p>

<title>Measures</title>
<sec id="section6-0272431610397661">
<title>Monitoring</title>
<p>Youth completed a self-report measure assessing parent’s knowledge of their activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0272431610397661">Lamborn, Mounts, Steinberg, &amp; Dornbusch, 1991</xref>). Participants were asked to rate on a 3-point scale (1 = <italic>don’t know</italic>, 2 = <italic>know a little</italic>, 3 = <italic>know a lot</italic>) how much their parents know who their friends are, how they spend their money, where they are after school, where they go at night, what they do with their free time, and where they are during the day. The sum of these responses was used as a composite score for child report of monitoring. The reliability coefficients for this measure were .74 at Time 1 and .80 at Time 2. Responses are coded such that a higher score is associated with higher levels of monitoring.</p>
<p>The ESM data were also used to create an index of daily experience of adult supervision. With each signal, participants were asked a question regarding indirect supervision: “At this time, is any adult keeping track of you?” (see <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0272431610397661">Appendix</xref>). The instances in which participants reported adult monitoring at the time of the signal were summed and then divided by the total number of signals to create a percent score for ESM report of monitoring. This provided an immediate measure of monitoring that was not subject to the same recall biases of questionnaire reports of monitoring.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0272431610397661">
<title>Peer deviance</title>
<p>Deviance of peers was assessed through adolescent self-report as well. An individual questionnaire asked participants to rate the number of their friends and/or associates (0 = <italic>none</italic>, 1 = <italic>very little</italic>, 2 = <italic>some</italic>, 3 = <italic>a lot</italic>) who engaged in a variety of delinquent behaviors including, but not limited to substance use, truancy, and physical violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0272431610397661">Clasen &amp; Brown, 1985</xref>). The sum of ratings on these 10 items created a composite score for child report of peer deviance. The reliability coefficients for this measure were .81 at Time 1 and .86 at Time 2. This measure provided a general index of the delinquent behavior of each participant’s peer group.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0272431610397661">
<title>Delinquent behavior</title>
<p>Adolescents completed the Juvenile Delinquency Scale—Self-Report (JDS-SR; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0272431610397661">Tolan, 1988</xref>). This 23-item measure addressed a variety of delinquent behaviors that ranged from minor (e.g., truancy, tobacco use) to illegal (e.g., stealing, substance use, property damage, physical aggression). Using a scale anchored at <italic>never</italic> (0) and <italic>five times or more</italic> (5), participants reported the number of times they engaged in each act. The sum of these items was used as an index of child report of delinquent behavior, Time 1 (α = .89) and Time 2 (α = .88).</p>

<title>Attrition Analyses</title>
<p>Participants with only Time 1 data available were excluded from further analyses. Independent samples <italic>t</italic> tests compared the retention sample of participants (i.e., those with both Time 1 and Time 2 data available; <italic>n</italic> = 147) with the attrition sample (i.e., those with only Time 1 data available; <italic>n</italic> = 57) using the four following Time 1 measures: (1) adolescent report of monitoring, (2) ESM report of monitoring, (3) adolescent report of peer deviance, and (4) adolescent report of delinquent behavior. The attrition sample did not differ significantly from the retention sample on Time 1 levels of monitoring. However, significant differences existed between the two groups’ ESM reports of monitoring, with the attrition sample showing higher levels at Time 1. Furthermore, adolescents in the attrition sample reported significantly higher levels of peer deviance and delinquent behavior.</p>

<sec id="section11-0272431610397661">
<title>Analytical Strategy</title>
<p>We used structural equation modeling to conduct path analyses evaluating different competing models of the direct and indirect pathways through which the key study variables influenced one another. Path models were estimated using LISREL 8.3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0272431610397661">Joreskog &amp; Sorebom, 1997</xref>), which provides maximum-likelihood estimates of standardized and unstandardized regression coefficients, standard errors, associated <italic>p</italic> values, estimates of squared multiple correlations for endogenous variables, chi-square statistics, and measures of goodness-of-fit for each path model. Path analysis lets researchers test alternative models specifying the pathways through which an effect is transmitted from an initial exogenous variable through mediating endogenous variables to a final outcome variable, via a system of interrelated multiple regression equations. Although path analysis is traditionally conducted by running a series of separate multiple regression analyses for each endogenous variable, using structural equation modeling, instead of conventional multiple regression, offers four main advantages: (1) It solves all constituent regression models simultaneously rather than piecemeal; (b) it estimates and tests the statistical significance of total, direct, and indirect (mediated) effects in the same analysis; (c) it provides an assessment of the model’s overall goodness-of-fit to the data; and (d) it makes it easy to test modified versions of the baseline path model that add or delete pathways in the model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0272431610397661">Joreskog &amp; Sorebom, 1997</xref>; Kline, 2005).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0272431610397661">
<title>Preliminary Correlational Analyses</title>
<p>Path analyses were used to test each mediational model; however, this required significant associations among at least one monitoring measure (i.e., adolescent or ESM report), peer deviance (i.e., adolescent-reported peer deviance, or ESM time with same sex, opposite sex, older peers, or associates) and the adolescent report of the dependent variable: delinquent behavior. The correlations among all measures are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0272431610397661">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<p>For Time 1 variables, low but significant associations were observed between the self and ESM-reported monitoring and adolescent-reported delinquent behavior (<italic>r</italic> = –.14, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05; <italic>r</italic> = –.17, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01, respectively) and between adolescent-reported peer deviance and delinquent behavior (<italic>r</italic> = .28, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). However, the lack of significant associations between any monitoring and peer variables rendered Time 1 mediational path analysis not possible.</p>
<p>Several significant associations emerged at Time 2, making a mediational path analysis possible. ESM-reported monitoring was significantly associated with both peer deviance (<italic>r</italic> = –.21, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) and adolescent reports of delinquent behavior (<italic>r</italic> = –.16, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). Also, adolescent-reported peer deviance was significantly associated with adolescent-reported delinquent behavior (<italic>r</italic> = .39, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). Time1 adolescent self-reported delinquency was also related to both measures of monitoring (i.e., adolescent and ESM): –.14 &gt; <italic>r</italic> &gt; –.20, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05; adolescent-reported peer deviance, <italic>r</italic> = .20, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01; and Time 2 adolescent reports of delinquency, <italic>r</italic> = .33, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01.</p>

<title>Pooled Sample Mediational Path Analysis</title>
<p>The hypothesized mediated model was first tested on the pooled male and female participants, Time 2 (seventh grade) sample, using structural equation modeling as outlined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0272431610397661">Baron and Kenny (1986)</xref>. Lisrel 8.52 was used to conduct the following analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0272431610397661">Joreskog &amp; Sorebom, 1997</xref>). Listwise deletion excluded any participants with missing data on the variables employed in the path model, from either Time 1 or Time 2. This left a sample of 147 participants, which based on standard conventions (requiring 5-10 observations per parameter) was adequate for path analyses.</p>
<p>Model 1 indicated that ESM report of monitoring is significantly related to both adolescent report of peer deviance (standardized γ = –.22, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) and adolescent report of delinquent behavior (standardized γ = –.24, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .005). Adolescents’ daily experience of monitoring at Time 2 accounted for approximately 5% of the variance in adolescent-reported peer deviance and 6% in adolescent-reported delinquent behavior. The resulting chi-square statistic for this first model was significant (χ<sup>2</sup>= 24.63, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01), suggesting a poor fit to the data.</p>
<p>Model 2, the cross-sectional test of basic mediation at Time 2 (i.e., seventh-grade students) included the path between adolescent report of peer deviance and adolescent report of delinquent behavior. This path was statistically significant (standardized β = .39, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .0001; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0272431610397661">Figure 1</xref>). The relationship between ESM report of monitoring and adolescent report of peer deviance remained significant (standardized γ = –.22, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01), and the relationship between ESM report of monitoring and adolescent report of delinquent behavior was reduced, but remained statistically significant (standardized γ = –.16, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .03). The standardized indirect effect of ESM report of monitoring on adolescent report of delinquent behavior (γ = –.09, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) was also significant. Together, these findings support the existence of a partially mediated effect of monitoring on delinquent behavior through peer deviance. The model accounted for approximately 20% of the variance in delinquent behavior among the pooled male and female participants. Due to model saturation, the results indicated a perfect fit to the data.</p>

<p>Having established a cross-sectional model using Time 2 data, Models 3 and 4 tested mediation after controlling for Time 1 adolescent-reported delinquent behavior. In Model 3 the paths between ESM report of monitoring and adolescent-reported peer deviance and delinquent behavior were both significant (γ = –.22, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .004; γ = –.18, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .007, respectively). The path between Time 1 and Time 2 adolescent-reported delinquent behavior was also significant (γ = .42, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .0001). However, the significant chi-square statistic (χ<sup>2</sup>= 24.74, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) suggests that this model is not a good fit to the data. Model 4 included the path between Time 2 adolescent-reported peer deviance and delinquent behavior. In this model, all paths between variables (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0272431610397661">Figure 2</xref>) were significant; however, the relationship between ESM report of monitoring and Time 2 adolescent report of delinquent behavior barely reached significance. The indirect effect of ESM report of monitoring on adolescent report of delinquent behavior (χ<sup>2</sup> = –.08, <italic>p</italic> &lt; . 01) was statistically significant with the mediator included, suggesting that partial mediation was supported in the pooled longitudinal model. Nearly one third of the variance in Time 2 delinquent behavior was accounted for by this model (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = .31), which showed an adequate fit to the data (χ<sup>2</sup>= 3.10, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .05).</p>

<title>Male participants</title>
<p>Listwise deletion yielded a sample size of 54 male participants, which remains within the suggested guidelines of number of observations required per parameter. Time 2 cross-sectional mediation was not supported for boys. ESM report of monitoring showed significant direct effects on adolescent report of peer deviance and delinquent behavior, and peer deviance showed a significant direct effect on delinquent behavior. However, with the latter path included, the direct effect of monitoring on delinquent behavior remained highly significant. Furthermore, the indirect effect of monitoring on concurrent delinquent behavior was nonsignificant (c2 = –.08, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .06), suggesting no support for the mediated model among boys.</p>
<p>In the following models, the path between Time 1 and Time 2 adolescent-reported delinquent behavior was included. Time1 delinquent behavior had a highly significant direct effect on Time 2 delinquent behavior, and ESM monitoring retained direct effects on adolescent reports of peer deviance and delinquent behavior. The direct effect of peer deviance on change in delinquent behavior, however, was not significant. Together, the model accounted for nearly half the variance in delinquent behavior among boys in this sample (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup>= .476). The chi-square statistic indicated an adequate model-data fit (χ<sup>2</sup>= 4.726, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .09). This suggests that among male adolescents in this sample, monitoring and past delinquent behavior had the strongest impact on changes in delinquency.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-0272431610397661">
<title>Female participants</title>
<p>Among female participants (listwise, <italic>n</italic> = 93), ESM reports of monitoring were not significantly related to peer deviance or delinquent behavior. Therefore, adolescent self-reports of monitoring were used in the path analyses as this variable was related to both the peer deviance and delinquency variables. Self-reported monitoring showed significant correlations with the hypothesized mediator and outcome for girls, whereas it did not for boys. The path between adolescent-reported peer deviance and delinquent behavior was also significant. With this path included, the direct effect of adolescent reports of monitoring on peer deviance remained significant, and the path between adolescent reports of monitoring and delinquent behavior was reduced, but remained significant (standardized γ = –.16, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). The standardized indirect effect was also significant (γ = –.08, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .04). Among girls, partial mediation was supported; however, peer deviance appeared to exert considerably more influence, as a mediator of monitoring, on concurrent levels of delinquent behavior.</p>
<p>The final two models tested mediation after controlling for female participants’ Time 1 levels of self-reported delinquent behavior. Direct effects of Time 2 adolescent-reported monitoring on both concurrent peer deviance and delinquent behavior were both significant after controlling for Time 1 delinquency. The path between Time 1 and Time 2 delinquent behavior was also significant among girls. However, fit statistics suggested that this model was a poor fit to the data (χ<sup>2</sup>= 19.86, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). In the final model, which included the paths between Time 2 monitoring, peer deviance, and delinquent behavior, as well as the path between Time 1 and Time 2 delinquent behavior, the path between monitoring and concurrent delinquent behavior was reduced to nonsignificance (standardized γ = –.14, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .06). The path between Time 1 delinquent behavior and Time 2 delinquent behavior was significant (standardized γ = .17, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .03), and the indirect effect of monitoring on delinquent behavior was also significant (γ = –.08, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). Together, the model accounted for approximately 26% of the variance in girls’ delinquent behavior. Thus, the path analysis supported the hypothesis that the effect of monitoring on change in girls’ delinquency was mediated by peer deviance.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The influences of different informant/method measures of adult monitoring and peer effects on adolescents’ delinquent behavior were examined among a high-risk sample of low-income urban African American youth. Results support previous findings, which have consistently documented associations between low levels of adult monitoring and delinquent behavior among children and adolescents. These findings underscore the importance of monitoring in minimizing both adolescents’ companionship with deviant peers and their own delinquent behaviors. However, results also point to the differential impact of monitoring and peers on delinquency among boys and girls. Aside from past delinquency, only ESM reports of monitoring showed a direct effect on current levels of delinquent behavior among boys. Peer deviance did not retain a significant direct effect on boys’ delinquent behavior. Among girls, peer deviance showed the strongest effect on change in delinquency. Furthermore, only retrospective self-reports of monitoring were related to change in female delinquent behavior, showing a largely indirect effect through peer deviance. Although these comparisons should be considered tentative, given the small sample of boys, they suggest that boys’ delinquency in this sample may be best managed by their immediate perception that an adult is monitoring them, whereas preventing girls’ delinquency may be best accomplished by consideration of their peer groups.</p>
<p>Although gender differences exist in the nature of the effect of monitoring on delinquency, the importance of this aspect of parental control is clear; compared to well-monitored youth, poorly monitored youth have more opportunity to affiliate with delinquent peers and engage in delinquent activities. Research has consistently shown that high levels of monitoring seem to play a protective role against the development of externalizing problems (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0272431610397661">Klein &amp; Forehand, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0272431610397661">Rai et al., 2003</xref>) and association with deviant peer groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0272431610397661">Pettit, Laird, Dodge, Bates, &amp; Criss, 2001</xref>). Effective monitoring would seem to be a particularly important parenting skill among the sample studied in the current investigation. The urban neighborhoods in this study share certain characteristics with other disadvantaged communities, which necessitate increased monitoring of children’s daily activities. These include high population density, high crime, and generally low levels of adult monitoring or collective regulation of children’s behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0272431610397661">Sampson, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>Community characteristics also place inherent limitations on the parents’ monitoring capabilities. Sources of instrumental or emotional support are often lacking in disadvantaged areas, and economic, psychological, and social stressors can influence parental monitoring of children (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0272431610397661">Ceballo &amp; McLoyd, 2002</xref>). Furthermore, high-risk neighborhoods are often characterized by social isolation and residential instability, which work against the utilization of available resources and the formation of networks of adults who collectively monitor area youth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0272431610397661">Sampson, 1997</xref>). Given these added challenges, low-income urban parents often struggle to ensure that their children are appropriately supervised.</p>
<p>Research on parenting practices within low-income urban African American families have demonstrated that parents who successfully manage their children’s behavior seek out and utilize quality community resources; enlist the assistance of older siblings, extended family and kin; and work to end antisocial peer associations while enhancing prosocial friendships (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0272431610397661">Jarrett, 1999</xref>). If direct supervision by a trusted adult is not possible, parents may exercise remote supervision by scheduling regular telephone calls or other means of checking in that ensure knowledge of children’s whereabouts, and activities. Involving children in available after-school programs, where they are both under the supervision of adults and exposed to peer groups in an environment that encourages prosocial behavior, has been advocated as a means of curbing delinquent behavior among adolescents. It is important to acknowledge that parents are able to overcome the unique challenges of raising children in an urban community, but doing so requires extraordinary efforts—becoming “super-parents” in Jarrett’s words (1999)—and often the cooperation of other adults.</p>
<p>The weak associations among the two monitoring variables (adolescent self-reports and adolescent ESM report) are worth noting. Many would argue that for monitoring, it is children’s perception of how well they are being supervised that is most critical to delinquent behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0272431610397661">Smetana, Crean, &amp; Daddis, 2002</xref>). In the current study, the ESM monitoring variable, which required immediate reports of whether the participant was under adult supervision at the time of each signal, showed the strongest direct effect on delinquency among boys. The exploratory results suggest that ongoing salient reminders of monitoring are more effective with boys, who appear to require more immediate adult supervision to stay out of trouble. Regular inquiries as to adolescents’ daily whereabouts, activities, and friends may be sufficient for girls. Regardless of the evidence provided here, prescriptions for effective monitoring should not be viewed simplistically across gender lines. Similar to recent findings, monitoring and peer deviance only accounted for a small proportion of the variance in delinquent behavior, and past history of delinquency was often the most important predictor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0272431610397661">Landsheer &amp; Van Dijkum, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0272431610397661">Overbeek, Vollebergh, Meeus, Engels, &amp; Luijpers, 2001</xref>). Therefore, monitoring practices must consider individual characteristics of youth and their specific environments and should be adjusted over time to meet their developmental needs.</p>
<p>In opposition to the finding that female delinquency is not as influenced by peers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0272431610397661">Mears et al., 1998</xref>), the delinquent behavior of adolescent girls within this sample seems quite influenced by peers. Others have found that group involvement in delinquent activity is more marked among girls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0272431610397661">Emler et al., 1987</xref>) and that the friendships of delinquent girls are characterized by higher levels of peer pressure than the friendships of nondelinquent girls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0272431610397661">Pleydon &amp; Schner, 2001</xref>). Support for these findings can be found in literature pertaining to social development. Indeed, a robust conclusion in the literature is that girls are more peer focused. Unlike adolescent males who largely base their self-esteem on achievement, adolescent females’ self-esteem is linked to interpersonal relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0272431610397661">Eder, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0272431610397661">Rosenberg &amp; Simmons, 1975</xref>). This finding suggests that they are more susceptible to the influence of peers. Nonetheless, though our findings support these conclusions and explanations, the finding that male delinquent behavior is not as influenced by peers is not supported by prior research. As mentioned earlier, boys are significantly more likely than girls to have friends who condone and engage in delinquent behavior (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0272431610397661">Crosnoe et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0272431610397661">Mears et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0272431610397661">Piquero et al., 2005</xref>). Therefore, it is clear that research regarding peer influences on delinquency is not conclusive. Future research should attempt to reconcile these findings by examining large and diverse samples of adolescents or by conducting meta-analyses of previous studies.</p>
<p>Limitations of the current study should be noted. First, the sample of low-income urban African American youth is not representative of all African American youth geographically and socioeconomically; thus, generalizability must be taken into account. Second, the significant differences between the attrition sample (i.e., those participants with data available at Time 1 only) and the remaining sample on peer deviance, self-reported delinquency, and ESM-reported monitoring warrant caution in interpreting the results. As noted before, this group of participants curiously reported higher levels of daily supervision while also reporting higher levels of peer and individual delinquency. The attrition sample could represent a group of low-income urban children who engage in particularly problematic behaviors despite attempts at monitoring and may be especially difficult to address in longitudinal research. Third, the rather small sample of boys employed in the path model may have reduced the power to detect all possible effects and may provide yet another explanation for the nonsignificant association between peer and individual delinquency among boys. Fourth, though parent data were originally included, the current study ultimately relied on self-reports of delinquent behavior as the primary outcome measure. Adolescent reports may have been biased by response styles that could yield either an under- or over-reporting of delinquency. It would have been helpful to further substantiate adolescent self-reports and even parent reports with more objective measures of delinquency, such as police or court records. However, such objective measures may not have captured hidden or minor acts of delinquency. Sixth, the lack of relations among our variables from the sixth-grade data may be explained by developmental shifts that include increased autonomy, which may lead to peer deviance and more delinquent behavior in seventh grade. Finally, the models used in the current study did not include several additional variables (e.g., family composition, parental pathology, pubertal timing) that are receiving increased attention in the field of delinquency research. Whereas the primary importance of monitoring and deviant peer associations in predicting delinquency led to their focus in this study, the delinquent behavior of youth in the current sample was obviously influenced by other, unmeasured variables.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the current study offers additional insight into the effects of monitoring and affiliation with deviant peers on delinquent behavior among low-income urban African American male and female youth. The different paths toward male and female delinquency among the participants in this study suggest the need for future research that further addresses what constitutes effective monitoring in low-income urban communities, the nature of delinquent peer relationships, and the composition (i.e., sex and age of group members) and stability of peer groups over time. Impulsivity and parental conflict are other unmeasured variables that may predict participation in delinquent behaviors. Understanding the general contexts and specific circumstances in which delinquent behavior occurs could be achieved by further use of innovative techniques like ESM. It is important for more studies to undertake complex investigations, such as time-use methods, of specific populations that are identified as at risk and integrate these findings with those of studies of similar groups. Population-specific theories of delinquency may provide added clarity and better inform prevention and intervention efforts in specific communities.</p>
