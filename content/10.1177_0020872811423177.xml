<p>This book presents a good argument for the applied science approach in social work. The author himself calls it a ‘practice book’, based upon examples of his own social practice embedded in a theoretical framework of reference. This framework seems to be able to explain the empirical data as well as supporting reflection on the practical aspect. The book offers a broad selection of different materials which refer to critical life events, when men lose their social and mental resources and go through a deep decline in their capability to cope. Men, such as perpetrators of violence, workers at risk and displaced workers, substance abusers, alcohol abusers, older men at risk and finally mentally ill, are likely to become clients of social workers. The second part of the book and its chapters are structured along these groups of at-risk males and their help seeking behavior, while the first part of the book deals with conceptions of masculinity and the theoretical and practice guidelines of the author’s approach.</p>
<p>The framework of reference is basically inspired by a key theory, which contains the ambivalence of male problems and difficulties in life: ‘Paradoxically, while men may be a privileged group in many sectors in society, as social work clients they are not’ (p. 6). It is the vulnerable man, who stands in the centre of this approach; not with his failings, but with his hidden strengths and needs. In this sense the book offers integrated theories for access to men at risk: the strength perspective, an approach which helps men to see themselves as producers of their own biography with its turning points and changing possibilities; the understanding of existential needs, which can focus help on the core human state behind deviant behavior, and finally cognitive behavior therapy (CBT), which focus on helping men by developing new skills of behavior in a self confronting and activating way. The CBT is chosen as ‘one way for social workers to align their practice with the needs of men (and) to adopt theories that are congruent with men’s values and ways of viewing the world’ (p. 11).</p>
<p>Strength based narrative and existential approaches are based on concepts widely accepted in contemporary social work in Europe. On the contrary for concepts like CBT there is a significant dissent in parts of the scientific community. Those evidence-based and therefore linear concepts are criticized as they can be seen as close to the medical model and because they narrowly focus on the individual and neglect the conditions of social structure and the possibilities of varying the social environment in terms of functional equivalence. This would entail working for creating alternative settings in which the clients can feel and recognize that they can have self-esteem and social attention without violence and deviance.</p>
<p>A further critical point concerns the interpretations of theories of masculinity. The author stresses for example, the concept of hegemonic masculinity (Connell) which emphasizes more the dominance and less the dependence in the life of men. Nonetheless, a book about men at risk needs a stronger theoretical framework which can explain the conditions of these dependencies, which are empirically well described in the chapters of part two. Maleness in industrial societies is characterized by a structural <italic>dialectic of male hegemony and availability of men</italic>. To find a theory for this phenomenon is one of the main tasks of research over masculinity in the social science. Another task should be to analyze the psychodynamic processes that affect men in view of economical availability and their ways of expressing themselves, which are often hidden and ambivalent. The concept of narrative therapy offers a pragmatic approach but not a theory of coping, which should be necessary for the author’s focus on intervention.</p>
<p>However, the book contains an impressive range of indicative information and modes of application, with its various case examples, exercises and study questions. It is well manageable for students. The author’s own recommendation to the reader that: ‘ultimately is up to you to integrate these ideas with your current conceptions of practice’ (and theoretical concepts as well!) makes it undoubtedly worthy for gender discourse in European social work.</p>
