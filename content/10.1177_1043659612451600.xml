<abstract>
<p>This article examines the available evidence about intramuscular injection techniques to generate simple evidence-based or best practice guidelines for implementation in the developing world. Giving intramuscular injections is considered a core nursing skill, and millions are performed around the world every day. Intramuscular injections are more commonly used in resource-poor environments, but there is limited education of nurses on its proper administration. The findings in the literature conclude that the vastus lateralis muscle is the preferred site for intramuscular injections, particularly in resource-poor settings.</p>

<body>
<p>In industrialised countries, there is a growing trend towards intravenous (IV) administration of medications that cannot be given orally. Intramuscular (IM) injections are generally avoided in paediatric settings, because of the fear, pain, and anxiety they induce, which can now be avoided (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1043659612451600">Hemsworth, 2000</xref>). In African hospitals and other developing world settings where huge demands are placed on very few nursing staff, IM injections are common because of the difficulty in obtaining an IV access and in sustaining the IV line in children. In addition, adherence to standard regimen is problematic for nurses. On the other hand, IM administration may be safer and equally efficacious, when adequate monitoring and equipment for safe IV infusion is not be available to maintain safe and consistent infusion.</p>
<p>In developing countries, there is high paediatric morbidity and mortality from infectious diseases, particularly malaria. In contrast to the practice in industrialised countries, antibiotics, antimalarials, and immunisations are commonly administered intramuscularly to children in the dorsogluteal region. Contributing factors to this ritualised practice of IM injections in the dorsogluteal region include the increased workload and lack of educational preparation and continuing education among nurses. Consequently, many nurses are unaware of best practices and lack the skill to administer IM injections safely. Limited resources and difficult working conditions contribute to the preference by nurses to continue to give IM injections the same way as they were previously taught and avoid IV infusion because of the time and resources needed.</p>
<p>The aim of this article is to examine and present the available evidence regarding IM injections and develop recommendations applicable to developing world settings.</p>
<sec id="section1-1043659612451600" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>A search of the literature was conducted in MEDLINE (1966-January 2009) and CINAHL (1982-January 2009) using the terms “exp intramuscular injections” OR “exp medication administration, intramuscular” OR “medication administration.” The results were limited to humans, English language, and paediatrics. All titles and abstracts were read, and relevant articles were identified and full texts obtained. A hand search of references was also conducted.</p>
<sec id="section2-1043659612451600">
<title>Best Practices</title>
<p>IM injections are common in the developing world, particularly in paediatrics. In parts of Africa, a large proportion of paediatric admissions require Quinine treatment. Whereas Quinine is often administered intravenously in developed countries, this is not common practice in developing countries because of staff workload, lack of IV equipment such as infusion pumps for accurate infusion rates, and lack of qualified staff. Quinine is often given intramuscularly to treat malaria. Other antimalarial drugs used in the developing world, such as Artesunate, are also given by IM injection.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1043659612451600">Schapira et al. (1993)</xref> found that IM injection of Quinine is as effective as IV administration and that local side effects are prevented by using diluted solutions. Quinine is not usually given rectally because of limited availability and because many children have accompanying vomiting and diarrhoea, which can affect the absorption of the drug.</p>

<title>Preferred Site</title>
<p>Although considered a basic nursing technique, the risks of IM injections to patients can be extremely damaging, with lifelong effects. Poor technique has been implicated with complications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1043659612451600">Malkin, 2008</xref>). One of the most serious is injury to the sciatic nerve, which can cause significant disability to those affected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1043659612451600">Small, 2004</xref>). The sciatic nerve passes through the inferior aspect of the buttocks or gluteal muscles and descends into the thighs, supplying the skin and muscles in the legs and feet. As such, it is vulnerable to damage via IM injection because of its large size and because the buttock area is the common injection site.</p>
<p>Nerve damage can produce a range of effects from minor motor and sensory abnormalities to complete paralysis or causalgia (excruciating and incapacitating pain that is resistant to analgesia; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1043659612451600">Horowitz, 1984</xref>). Typical manifestations are foot drop, loss of flexion and extension, persistent leg and foot pain, and loss of protective foot sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1043659612451600">Pickett, 1985</xref>). Surgery is needed to treat paralytic foot drop and gluteal fibrosis, along with use of a brace when walking and splints at night. As many as three out of eight children have recurrence and require further surgical intervention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1043659612451600">Napiontek &amp; Kuszkowski, 1993</xref>).</p>
<p>It is important to select the largest muscle at any age for IM injection in order to avoid the disparity between the muscle mass and the volume of injected fluid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1043659612451600">Sarkar, Pan, Biswas, &amp; Mukherjee, 1989</xref>). Muscle mass changes from infancy throughout childhood as the thin muscle mass of early life adapts to meet the biophysical needs and activities of later childhood. Drug effectiveness of IM injections may be hindered when they are unintentionally delivered into subcutaneous tissue where the drug cannot be fully absorbed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1043659612451600">Scott &amp; Marfell-Jones, 2004</xref>). The technique is crucial as survival of children in resource-poor countries hinges on effective drug absorption.</p>
<p>IM injections deliver the medication into the denser part of the muscle below subcutaneous tissues. Compared with adipose tissues, skeletal muscles have fewer pain receptors and absorb larger volumes of fluid because of the rapid uptake of the drug into the blood stream via the muscle fibres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1043659612451600">Hunter, 2008</xref>). Thus, IM injections are less painful when administered correctly and can be used to inject concentrated and irritant drugs that could damage the subcutaneous tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1043659612451600">Greenway, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1043659612451600">Rodger &amp; King, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Inappropriate selection of the injection site and poor technique can increase the risk of injuries, pain, nerve injury, bleeding, and accidental IV administration; sterile abscesses can result from repeated injections in one site with poor blood flow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1043659612451600">Rodger &amp; King, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>The vastus lateralis (VL) muscle in the thigh area is recommended as the site of choice for IM injection in children. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1043659612451600">Sarkar et al. (1989)</xref> conducted a series of technical research that revealed that the muscle size of the VL is the most suitable for use in 0- to 6-month–old infants and for repeated IM injections in children.</p>
<p>Recent randomised trials of IM injection techniques in Australia found essentially no difference with regard to efficacy, acceptability, or side effects between different anterolateral and dorsogluteal sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1043659612451600">Cook &amp; Murtagh, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1043659612451600">2005</xref>). It should be noted that these studies were conducted in well-resourced settings with routine vaccinations, which may not be applicable to developing world settings. The VL muscle is the site of choice as it is a thick and well-developed muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1043659612451600">Harkreader, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1043659612451600">Hemsworth, 2000</xref>). It is the preferred site for infants younger than 1 year as it provides a larger muscle mass, allowing greater volume to be injected—up to 5 ml compared with 2.5 ml for the ventrogluteal site and 4 ml for the dorsogluteal site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1043659612451600">Craven &amp; Hirnle, 1996</xref>). The large area of the VL muscle is suitable for multiple injections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1043659612451600">Du Gas &amp; Knor, 1995</xref>) and is easily located and accessible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1043659612451600">Rodger &amp; King, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Compared with the gluteal muscles, the VL has a higher rate of absorption and is innervated by and receives blood from branches rather than the main femoral nerves and blood vessels, thus reducing the risk of major injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1043659612451600">Harkreader, 2000</xref>). The VL is less likely to be complicated by neurovascular injuries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1043659612451600">Losek &amp; Gyuro, 1992</xref>) and is the recommended site for injection of penicillin in infants and young children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1043659612451600">Nicoll &amp; Hesby, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>However, there are complications reported from using the VL muscle. The most frequently reported is fibrosis and contracture of the quadriceps muscles from multiple or single injection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1043659612451600">Bergeson, Singer, &amp; Kaplan, 1982</xref>). Nevertheless, the injuries are less debilitating than injuries to the sciatic nerve, which occurs even in properly executed dorsogluteal injections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1043659612451600">Bergeson et al., 1982</xref>). The main disadvantage of using the ventrogluteal site is the difficulty in locating the site accurately through palpation of the greater trochanter and anterior superior iliac spine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1043659612451600">Nicoll &amp; Hesby, 2002</xref>). The ventrogluteal site is less commonly used because nurses lack confidence in using the site; one study found that only 12% of nurses at a large U.S. teaching hospital used this location (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1043659612451600">Rodger &amp; King, 2000</xref>). The fact that the ventrogluteal site is infrequently used may explain the lack of reported injuries from this site. It is prudent not to recommend use of the ventrogluteal site in developing countries because of the technical difficulty in locating the site accurately in the midst of workload demands on the nursing staff.</p>

<sec id="section4-1043659612451600">
<title>Needle Size</title>
<p>The research findings regarding the appropriate needle size is varied and inconsistent. The Royal College of Nursing’s (2002) guidelines recommend a 1-inch (23-gauge) needle, which produces less redness and swelling and enters the muscle adequately. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1043659612451600">Diggle and Deeks (2001)</xref> found increased frequency of side effects with needles shorter than 1 inch. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1043659612451600">Losek and Gyuro (1992)</xref> recommend the 1-inch needle for children between 0 and 24 months. However, for underweight infants weighing between the 10th and 50th percentiles, these guidelines may be inappropriate. In resource-poor countries, the preferred needle size may not be available consistently. Hence, nurses need to make judgement regarding the needle size based on the individual child’s muscle mass. It is important that the needle is long enough to reach the muscle tissue without penetrating underlying structures. Studies of adults in developed countries have highlighted the impact of obesity on needle size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1043659612451600">Nisbet, 2006</xref>), but obesity has less relevance in resource-poor countries where malnutrition and undernourishment are common.</p>

<sec id="section5-1043659612451600">
<title>Skin Cleaning</title>
<p>Abscess formation secondary to IM injections remains a problem in the developing world, yet there is paucity of evidence on this issue. The World Health Organization and other organisations have abandoned meticulous skin preparation in favour of making sure the skin is “grossly clean” prior to injecting. According to the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1043659612451600">Royal College of Nursing (2002)</xref>, there has been no sudden upsurge in abscess formation after implementing this protocol. However, evidence-based practices emphasizing use of disposable needles, universal precautions, and ensuring that the skin is “grossly clean” may not be realistic in resource-poor countries. During times of water crises, availability of water for skin cleansing is compromised.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1043659612451600">
<title>Aspiration</title>
<p>Aspirating into the syringe prior to giving the medication verifies if the needle has penetrated a blood vessel. If blood is seen in the syringe, it is consistently recommended that the needle is promptly removed and the IM injection repeated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1043659612451600">Beyea &amp; Nicholl, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1043659612451600">Cocoman &amp; Murray, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1043659612451600">Small, 2004</xref>). In the case of some drugs such as penicillin, the solution for injection may be opaque and viscous and the aspirated blood may thus not be visible; this was found to occur in one out of five injections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1043659612451600">Weir, 1988</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1043659612451600">
<title>Rotation of the Injection Site</title>
<p>The injection site needs to be rotated in order to avoid irritation, pain, and sterile abscesses with repeated injections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1043659612451600">Hunter, 2008</xref>) as well as to reduce discomfort from overuse of one area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1043659612451600">Workman, 1999</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1043659612451600">John and Stevenson (1995)</xref> suggest that only small volumes should be administered by IM injections and the dose may be split to avoid pain and allow absorption; as such, no one injection should exceed 5 ml, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1043659612451600">Rosdahl, 1995</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1043659612451600">
<title>Minimising Pain</title>
<p>Measures to decrease pain and discomfort included positioning the child to relax the muscle prior to injection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1043659612451600">Cocoman &amp; Murray, 2006</xref>) and pressing the site for 10 seconds postinjection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1043659612451600">Rodger &amp; King, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1043659612451600">Wynaden et al., 2005</xref>). Several studies found that massaging the site post injection distributes the medication more efficiently and increases absorption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1043659612451600">Craven &amp; Hirnle; 1996</xref>). Exercising the limb post injection assists absorption of the drug by increasing the blood flow and oxygen to the area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1043659612451600">Beyea and Nicholl 1995</xref>). The recommendations adopted in Western countries, such as use of local anaesthetic creams, distraction, and play (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1043659612451600">Weise &amp; Nahata, 2005</xref>), can be adopted in developing countries with increased funding and staffing.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1043659612451600">
<title>Other Guidelines</title>
<p>There is no clear guidance in the literature regarding the use of the Z-track technique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1043659612451600">Wynaden et al., 2005</xref>). There is probably insufficient evidence of its benefit in resource-constrained settings. A simple method to check the correct location of the needle during IM injection is to try to move the needle sideways, as side-to-side mobility is absent when it is well within the muscle; this is the only technique that carries no risk of development of fat necrosis and subcutaneous abscesses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1043659612451600">Sarkar et al., 1989</xref>). The muscles need to be pinched up before IM injections for malnourished children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1043659612451600">Rodger &amp; King 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1043659612451600">Workman, 1999</xref>).</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>IM injections are commonly used in many parts of the developing world where nurse education, time and resources are low, and potentially dangerous techniques are still used. For paediatric patients in developing countries, the VL site is probably the most appropriate. Other best practices to be considered include appropriate needle size selection, pain minimisation, and ensuring that the skin is “grossly clean.” With dissemination of information on best practices and an evidence-based approach, safer practices may be adopted. Ongoing nurse education can increase confidence and knowledge of IM injection and rid nursing of ritualistic practices, which have surrounded the use of the dorsogluteal site for many years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1043659612451600">Floyd &amp; Meyer, 2007</xref>).</p>
