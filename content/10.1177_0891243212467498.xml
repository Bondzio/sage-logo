<p>I greatly appreciate these thoughtful and generous responses to my attempt to place <italic>The Feminine Mystique</italic> in historical context. Roth puts her finger on a central challenge in returning to this classic text: How can we assess its real achievements without minimizing the book’s limitations or exaggerating its role (as opposed to Friedan’s) in reviving the feminist movement? Is it possible to explain the book’s powerful, sometimes life-changing, impact on many readers while simultaneously acknowledging its lack of relevance for many other women?</p>
<p>But this challenge constituted only one tip of the iceberg I encountered in navigating these intellectual waters. Perhaps the best way to answer the questions Guenther, Roth, and Whittier raise about why I pursued some topics and not others is to explain how I was forced into a circuitous research journey that landed me in a different place than I’d originally hoped to go.</p>
<p>This book began with a publisher’s idea to do a series of biographies of books rather than individuals. When my editor suggested I write the biography of <italic>The Feminine Mystique</italic>, I was excited about revisiting a book that had influenced countless people—including myself. But I soon realized I had in fact never read it. Like many people I spoke with over the following years, I had absorbed a few of its ideas second-hand and retroactively attributed to it arguments that Friedan and other feminists raised only years later.</p>
<p>I was dismayed by the book’s hostility toward homosexuality; its seemingly elitist focus on educated, middle-class women; and its failure to credit Friedan’s feminist and leftist predecessors. And I was especially puzzled to find no call for the collective action that Friedan instigated in founding NOW, three years after the book’s publication, or in organizing the 1970 Women’s Strike for Equality.</p>
<p>The absence of such a call to action made it difficult to answer the questions Guenther and Whittier raise about how and when any insights readers gained from the book inspired them to push for structural change. Letters written to Friedan at the time, now at the Schlessinger Library, were not much help. It was impossible to track down the writers and discover which ones had become political activists and which ones had simply been moved to change their personal lives.</p>
<p>Memoirs of feminist leaders likewise provide little evidence that many had their lives changed by the book. Some, especially those in Friedan’s own age group, had already reached the same conclusions. They welcomed the book’s confirmation of their views, but did not find it a revelation, although they were delighted to harness Friedan’s fame and energy in founding NOW in 1966. Others came to feminism through the Civil Rights movement or their experience in the New Left. These women were often more influenced by the radical feminist authors of the late 1960s and early 1970s than by Friedan. And as Whittier notes, many women became feminists first, and only then began to read feminist authors.</p>
<p>So I was unable to find evidence to draw firm conclusions about the impact of the book on the feminist movement. But it was clear from letters written to Friedan at the time, from memoirs mentioning the book’s impact—or lack of it—on the authors, and from the people I was able to interview 45 years later, that the women who responded to <italic>The Feminine Mystique</italic> with special enthusiasm and gratitude had a very distinctive profile. They were white, middle-class homemakers, many of whom had received—or aspired to—more education than was then the average for their sex.</p>
<p>This was a much narrower set of women than I had hoped to write about, and I shared the disappointment my reviewers expressed in my not being able to find a framework allowing me to be more inclusive. But gradually I began to see that there was an interesting puzzle here, precisely because the demographic was so narrow. Why was it that so many middle-class women, with more education and advantages than others of their sex, seemed so in need of the semipolitical self-help message of Friedan’s book—the insistence that “women are people too,” that they have a need for meaning in their lives, and that it is not selfish for them to seek an education or train for a satisfying career? I wanted to understand why women who seemingly had the <italic>most</italic> options and privileges—women with above-average educational backgrounds, women with an interest in books and ideas, and women whose husbands’ incomes allowed them the luxury of choosing whether to work or stay home—reported feeling so trapped and inadequate. The answers I found explain why my book, as Whittier and Guenther note, does not investigate the lives of unmarried or child-free women, or of employed wives, whatever their race, class, education, or sexual orientation.</p>
<p>In pursuing these narrower questions I discovered the unexpected bonus of finding a middle ground on an issue that has polarized many historians. Was the 1950s a decade of defeats and setbacks for women, or was it a dynamic period that contained the seeds of the struggles that flowered in the 1960s?</p>
<p>In fact, it was both. As Whittier notes, observers can often identify in retrospect how the contradictory and cross-cutting trends of a transitional era produced eventual transformation. But in real time, the clash of new opportunities, new pitfalls, and old messages that become even shriller as they become less relevant can create tremendous anxiety and self-doubt among people caught in the storm.</p>
<p>In the 1940s, 1950s, and early 1960s, these contradictions and cross-currents were particularly acute for a group of women who had been exposed to the world of ideas or activism in the 1940s or early 1950s and then become full-time wives and mothers—women in their 70s, 80s, or 90s today. These women found Friedan’s book exceptionally enlightening. So did many of their daughters, particularly those who sensed that something was missing in their mothers’ lives or their parents’ marriages.</p>
<p>These homemakers were caught between two worlds. In the early part of the century, women who entered college challenged social expectations of their gender. They were often feminists. Most completed their degrees; many entered careers; a high proportion remained single. And since the 1970s, most educated women expect to be employed most of their life, even if they marry someone who can afford to support them.</p>
<p>But in the immediate postwar era, although it became respectable—even desirable—for a woman to attend college, she was not expected to use her education outside the home afterwards. Parents sent their daughters to college to get a good husband rather than a good job. Educators bombarded them with “scientific” pronouncements of Freudian psychiatrists and functionalist sociologists explaining that any woman who wanted more from life than marriage and motherhood suffered from psychological maladjustment.</p>
<p>In that era, a much higher proportion of female college students dropped out to get married than in earlier or more recent decades. And those who graduated seldom stayed in the workforce for more than a few years. Magazines targeting this growing group of white middle-class homemakers, I found, promoted Freudian ideas about “healthy” and “unhealthy” gender roles far more than did periodicals aimed at white working-class or black middle-class women.</p>
<p>So the more well-read a middle-class white woman was, the more she “knew” it was not natural to have interests apart from her own family. The result was that educated housewives who did not experience the fulfillment they thought they <italic>should</italic> be feeling were prone to a special kind of misery, self-doubt, and guilt.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0891243212467498">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>These were the women Friedan hoped to reach, and the ones, as far as I can tell, upon whom she had the greatest impact. They became my focus. I found few testimonials to Friedan’s influence among racial ethnic and working-class women, but I included African American and white working-class wives and mothers to compare their behaviors and values with those of their more privileged counterparts. I found that in spite of greater material hardship and oppression, working-class women were <italic>less</italic> likely than middle-class homemakers to internalize a sense of self-doubt and guilt about any discontents they felt. And African American women, whatever their class, saw much less contradiction than their white counterparts between being a wife and mother and being a community activist and family co-provider. Upper-middle-class black wives were <italic>especially</italic> likely to work outside the home.</p>
<p>So I suggested that the real problem with Friedan’s omission of African American women was not, as many critics have since claimed, that they would have loved the luxury of living like the white homemakers she wrote about. Rather, Friedan might have used their example to demonstrate that women could work outside the home and still be successful wives and mothers. Roth points out that in the context of 1960s racial attitudes, making such an argument would probably have cut Friedan off from the audience most in need of her critique. I completely agree. I now see that this was more a rhetorical point against other critics of Friedan than a constructive criticism of <italic>her</italic> book.</p>
<p>I also agree with Guenther that I should have been clearer about my interview methodology. I began by circulating a questionnaire designed to identify people who had read the book close to the time of publication and to elicit their reactions. I recruited informants through various list servers and websites, as well as personal recommendations. But it soon became clear I would not get a representative enough sample to reach any solid conclusions about the book’s typical impact. I eventually got 188 completed, detailed questionnaires from people who had read the book within a few years of publication or recalled the reaction of relatives who had done so. I asked follow-up questions of about half these people and then did extensive individual interviews with 43 who had reported powerful responses, either pro or con. But the survey answers and interviews never became my core data. I used them to supplement and illustrate points I felt confident in making from more general historical research.</p>
<p>Nor did I ever develop enough data to assess the question Guenther raises about how and where Friedan’s book resonated for women globally, or if it still does. It would be fascinating to know whether other societies are just now creating a similar group of women, caught between the contradictory pressures of two different worlds and therefore ripe to hear Friedan’s message, or whether, in the process of what Russian Marxist Georgi Plekhanov called “uneven and combined development,” wives and mothers in other countries have skipped over older feminine mystiques and are grappling with new ones.</p>
<p>As Guenther notes, I do not deal with lesbian/bisexual/queer women. Whittier adds that this omission is significant because of Friedan’s association of women’s oppression with marriage and motherhood, as well as because of the central role of lesbians in the feminist movement. But Friedan, unlike many later feminists, did not see marriage and motherhood as the problem. She argued that women would be <italic>better</italic> wives and mothers when they rejected the feminine mystique that they could find fulfillment only at home. And Friedan was initially hostile to the participation of lesbians in the women’s movement, though she was eventually pressured into supporting their inclusion. That is a different story, dating from a later part of the 1960s.</p>
<p>I do completely agree with Whittier that we need more research on when and how personal “clicks” lead to political and social action. I don’t have the answer, but I can’t think of a more urgent question for people concerned about today’s gender, racial, and socioeconomic inequities. When and how will Americans translate their personal angst about economic insecurity and family-sabotaging work practices into collective action? And is it possible to rebuild the 1960s confidence that personal dilemmas can have political solutions?</p>
