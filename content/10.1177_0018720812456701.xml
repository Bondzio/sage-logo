<p>The results of the Chilean experience reveal that it is important to overcome the concept of “static” ergonomics focused on workplaces that may be valid for offices and machine operation but not for a significant number of miners who will be moving around workstations located in systems of different complexity.

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In Chile, mining is the main source of income, and there are still sufficient reserves of minerals for several years to come. In fact, Chile has the world’s largest copper reserves, and the mining companies employ nearly 112,000 workers. Although mining work is a dangerous activity, official statistics of the National Mining and Geology Service (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0018720812456701">SERNAGEOMIN, 2011</xref>) show that the frequency of accidents is low. However, the number of fatalities is still very high and lower only than that registered by the transport industry. Unfortunately, not all accidents have the same happy end as occurred in 2010, when the whole world felt tremendous satisfaction when 33 Chilean miners trapped underground were rescued alive after 70 days. In contrast, very few people know that in the same year, 43 miners died in different accidents that were not highlighted in the media.</p>
<p>These critical figures stress the need to improve ergonomic and safety activities, aiming at a reduction of health and safety risks, yet with a more ambitious twin goal of raising both quality of working life and productivity. The increment of ergonomics and safety activities is a need for underground and surface mining, for state and private enterprises, and for large and small contractor companies.</p>
<p>It is important to mention that in South America, particularly in the Andean countries, mining is progressively being carried out in extreme environments in critical conditions. Mines located at approximately 5,000 m above sea level, where the thermal sensation can go down to −35°C, present a challenge for ergonomists to effectively protect miners. Adaptations to high altitude and cold exposure have been studied by physiologists. Although their findings have been very important to the understanding of adaptation to high altitude, from the ergonomics point of view, there is still a great need for research that extends knowledge about limits for work in such conditions. This greater knowledge would hopefully allow ergonomists to propose interventions to improve work organization.</p>
<p>Studies carried out in the past few years by the Unit of Ergonomics of the University of Concepción in public and private mining companies have demonstrated the existence of a number of ergonomic problems affecting the safety and health of workers, who have low productivity as a consequence. The problems detected come from deficiencies in the design of machines and tools, poor organization of processes, and lack of knowledge of the limits of physical and mental work. Furthermore, on occasion, workers use safety devices and accessories that are not always well matched to the characteristics of the Chilean miners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0018720812456701">Apud &amp; Meyer, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The same studies have shown that attempts to increase productivity are generally limited to greater mechanization of processes, which does not always lead to the adoption of appropriate technology. Deficiencies in high-cost equipment and processes occur when they do not consider the problems of adaptation for the users. Therefore, in this article, I draw from the experience acquired in Chile with the aim of analyzing present and future problems that will have to be faced in many countries where mining is similarly an important source of income and employment.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0018720812456701">
<title>The Current State of Knowledge</title>
<p>One of the most critical problem areas emerging from the lack of ergonomic criteria in the design of work is musculoskeletal disorders. In this regard, it may be noted that in some mining companies, medical reports of these types of pathologies are bordering 40% of all reported conditions and reaching significantly higher figures among workers performing mechanical maintenance of heavy components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0018720812456701">Apud &amp; Meyer, 2009</xref>). For example, in an ergonomics study requested by a mining company to assess the association between chronic diseases and the jobs of 180 miners, it was found that in 85% of the cases, there was an association between job demands and diseases suffered by the workers. In another study, the same authors evaluated 225 work situations in a mining company. Interviews with the workers revealed a clear relationship between the perception of musculoskeletal symptoms reported by the workers and the objective observations carried out in the field. The results are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0018720812456701">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<p>The figures shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0018720812456701">Table 1</xref> are high, and even when some of the deficiencies encountered were minor, they are enough to impair the comfort of most workers. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0018720812456701">Table 1</xref>, office workers, field operators, and machine operators from the mining sector all reported musculoskeletal symptoms in high percentages.</p>
<p>The evidence shows a worrying situation. Looking back in time, one can say that the contribution of ergonomics to the mining sector in Chile has been primarily focused on the diagnosis of different types of problems. Although progress has been made in quantifying deficiencies, few examples of corrective changes can be found.</p>
<p>In Latin America, clearly there are things to learn from more industrialized countries. However, it is equally urgent to stop the damage that sometimes is done in the name of ergonomics when foreign experts, for commercial purposes, introduce techniques that do not solve the real problems, simply because the imported professional lacks essential knowledge of the specific populations. In other words, for ergonomists, it is not enough to simply highlight what is wrong or to expect solutions to appear magically with the application of a checklist or equivalent. Instead, it is necessary to move beyond the diagnosis stage and guide the actions toward intervention.</p>
<p>In developing countries, it is also important to keep in mind that modern industries coexist with very traditional forms of work. Therefore, progress is often required in both manual and mechanized versions of work. The Chilean experience has also shown that future interventions aimed at the higher goals of ergonomics must balance aspirations regarding the quality of working life and productivity, with the understanding that these goals should be achieved through adaptation of work to the actual women and men who perform it.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0018720812456701">
<title>Present and Future</title>
<p>After years of work in mining, there is the conviction in Chile that participatory ergonomics is the best approach to understanding and improving working conditions. It is interesting that the concept of participatory ergonomics as something different is often used nowadays, but in my experience, the <italic>only</italic> way to practice ergonomics in industries historically has been through a participatory approach and method.</p>
<p>The four areas in which it is necessary to develop ergonomic interventions in mining, particularly in developing countries, are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0018720812456701">Figure 1</xref>.</p>

<p>As set out in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0018720812456701">Figure 1</xref>, knowledge of the capabilities, limitations, and needs of the workers (Box 1) is a basic requirement if one is to anticipate and address ergonomic problems in new investments (Box 2). Of course, whenever possible, this knowledge should also be used to correct those problems already existing in mines (Box 3).</p>
<p>It is equally important to educate laborers about self-care and what they can do to help themselves be better prepared (Box 4). However, one must be capable of differentiating aspects in which workers can really look after themselves from situations in which their doing so would be irresponsible and unfair. Workers should not be recommended to “take care” when the ergonomic problems evidently need to be designed out. The recommendation of self-care is quite common in topics related to, for example, manual handling, whereby recommendations for workers on limits and practices tend to be too rigid, on many occasions not applicable, and therefore dangerous as a consequence.</p>

<sec id="section10-0018720812456701">
<title>Knowledge of Chilean Miners</title>
<p>Because of the importance of labor-intensive methods in mining, studies have been performed to increase the understanding of the physical characteristics of the workers and their social and working environment. Others have quantified food intake and habits in relation to the physiological workload of heavy activities. These studies include anthropometric surveys and measurement of physical fitness through evaluation of workers’ response to dynamic exercise and body composition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0018720812456701">Apud &amp; Meyer, 2009</xref>). Nowadays, based on the research findings, standards have been established for the evaluation of clothing, safety implements and accessories, furniture, and office and plant design and for the evaluation of heavy machinery. At the same time, advances can be seen in the knowledge of acceptable limits for heavy manual work performed in extreme conditions, including night work and 12-hour shifts. These conditions are common and well accepted by workers living in mining camps, because they allow more days of rest at home during the subsequent down time.</p>

<title>Learning From Experience: Anticipating and Addressing Ergonomics Problems in the New Projects</title>
<p>In Chilean mines, a number of problems arising from the design of work have been detected. The solutions are usually expensive and should have been foreseen in the planning stage, before the construction of plants, with consideration of the characteristics of the miners. In ergonomics, the observation of work is particularly relevant, and very serious infrastructure problems are easily visible yet very difficult to correct without large investments. Just as an example, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0018720812456701">Figure 2</xref> shows a photograph of a worker climbing a staircase that ends in a corridor where a metallic structure is located at 70 cm height. Examples of this kind can be found everywhere in the industrial world in developing countries.</p>

</caption>
<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0018720812456701-fig2.tif"/></fig>
<p>The ergonomic studies in Chilean mines show the need to have well-defined criteria to regulate the importation of foreign technology. When, for example, machines have ergonomic problems in their design, the correction might be extremely difficult, if not impossible, to achieve after the equipment is in situ. Sometimes companies seek ways to mitigate these problems and invest resources to do so. However, they get frustrated when they do not see any positive results. For example, in recent times, there has been interest within several mining companies to improve the cabins of heavy machinery that expose workers to vibration and postural overload. Absenteeism, lost time, and decrease in production are observed in addition to health impairment. In these few cases in which some retrospective changes are possible, large investments are required and solutions are still not completely satisfactory.</p>
<p>For this reason, it is urgent that we start using the existing knowledge of the anthropometric characteristics of the Chilean population to assess the technology that is to be incorporated. As already mentioned, in many cases, sufficient knowledge has already been generated for Chilean miners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0018720812456701">Apud &amp; Meyer, 2009</xref>) that could protect the physical and mental integrity of workers.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there are no rules for the introduction of foreign technologies, but some mining companies have become aware of the problem and have been using internal standards based on the characteristics of Chilean workers, which are helpful at least when acquiring new machinery. These companies, by mean of midterm programs, have realized that technology adapted to the characteristics of workers is a good investment.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0018720812456701">
<title>Using Participatory Ergonomics to Overcome Existing Critical Issues</title>
<p>Although it is essential to include ergonomic analysis in the initial stages of any mining project, either to generate new structures or to inform the next iteration of implements, it is also true that changes must be made in systems currently in operation to address ergonomic deficiencies as they are detected. It has already been mentioned that in Chile, there have been numerous studies that demonstrate ergonomic problems and propose interventions to correct them. However, studies that are conducted without sufficient grounding within the companies tend to end with the final report, and problems will remain the same or increase to the detriment of the quality of life of the working population.</p>
<p>It has to be highlighted that the level of criticality varies, and the ergonomist cannot allow himself or herself the indulgence of tackling just the easy but low-value targets. Often the more critical and potentially beneficial issues, such as maintenance tasks, are also far more complex to approach. Therefore, it is important to go beyond the concept of ergonomics studies centered on single, static workplaces, which may be valid for offices and computer stations but not for most miners, who move through different workstations.</p>
<p>For example, the problem of workers’ carrying out maintenance of heavy components is more complex to solve because of the fact that most of their work is done while exerting forces of different magnitude, in uncomfortable positions, in places of difficult access, and often standing on unstable surfaces. Moreover, maintenance or repairs may require actions that fall outside established procedures, as they are related to the magnitude of the damage. In those cases, there is no standard to follow. Following rules works only when every possible situation has been accurately predicted by the rule maker. Rules in manuals do not always apply, and the solutions necessarily involve the development of long-term participatory programs.</p>
<p>One way to encourage participation is through innovation in the form of training. In the studies conducted in Chilean mining, priority high-risk areas for specific worker groups were identified in the field. Afterward, workshops have been carried out in which invited participants from these groups are trained in general aspects of ergonomics, with emphasis on issues that affect them and with materials specially prepared with consideration of their educational background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0018720812456701">Apud &amp; Meyer, 2012</xref>). For example, maintenance workers are taught to recognize postural overload problems, including proper work techniques and the contribution of physical fitness. In the case of foundry workers, the focus of analysis is exposure to heat. These workshops also bring in the supervisors and engineers of the areas under discussion. After the theoretical training, time is given to participants to analyze individually the way they perform their work from an ergonomic perspective. As part of the training, they are instructed in the use of subjective techniques to evaluate their workplaces, and they later get support when back in the field for the analysis and presentation of their results.</p>
<p>Subsequently, the results of the different participants are compared, and the intervention proposals and their feasibility are assessed. A final document is structured with recommendations for ergonomic interventions to be carried out in the short, medium, and long term. This method creates a bridge between those who run the businesses and workers, on a technical basis. It allows the subject experts from the floor to have a say in setting priorities so that problems can often be solved without major investments, especially when the origin is actually in the work organization. Another advantage of this approach is that it generates long-term ergonomic groups, which is important because lasting changes can be made only from inside the companies. In other words, external experts can propose change, but establishing new, innovative forms of work is something that requires the active contribution and agreement of employers and workers.</p>
<p>To show an example of the economic impact of a participatory program carried out together with trained workers, I will briefly describe the changes in manual polishing of a “swing surface” of a huge crane employed in mining. The main problem was that the height of the work area was only 80 cm, resulting in a big postural load on the stooping or crawling workers not only because of the low height but also because the perimeter was 15.3 m. With the hand grinder employed in the past, the task used to be performed practically lying down, making it difficult to reach all corners across this large area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0018720812456701">Apud &amp; Meyer, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Through participatory activities, workers and supervisors agreed to propose the installation of a semi-mechanical arm in the center of the “crown,” using a space where they could support this arm to hold the grinder. The arm was equidistant from all points that had to be polished. In addition, the arm was installed with rails and wheels for easy mobility. The evaluation of effectiveness carried out before and after the innovation by workers and supervisors is shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0018720812456701">Table 2</xref>.</p>

<p>This example highlights that participatory activities help in finding balanced and profitable solutions. In the case under discussion, the innovation demanded a low investment of just less than US$10,000, whereas the savings achieved with the change was close to US$750,000 per maintenance cycle.</p>
<p>A concern was that the reduction in the number of shifts to complete the work may have led to unemployment. This result was not the case, however, as maintenance activities are very demanding, and workers and supervisors found that having more time allowed them to do other maintenance tasks in a more efficient way and with better quality.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0018720812456701">
<title>Self-Care Issues</title>
<p>Participatory programs may also contribute to promoting self-care and better preparedness for work. However, as mentioned earlier, it is necessary to maintain some caution about the results to be obtained with self-care when ergonomic problems persist. Good results may be achievable in modifying factors workers can control, such as physical fitness and the very serious problem of obesity, in Chilean mining. However, in aspects such as the prevention of musculoskeletal injuries, when the designed-in risks remain, the promotion of best practices and self-care, which is certainly important, will be only a palliative and will not solve the problems.</p>

<sec id="section14-0018720812456701" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>In this text, a proposal is made to face ergonomic problems in the mining industry. There may be other criteria, but the Chilean mining experience indicates the need to move beyond the stage of simply diagnosing problems and instead to initiate participatory interventions to overcome the ergonomics mismatches found today.</p>
<p>Another conclusion to draw is that ergonomics should be incorporated in all new projects. It is imperative that new investments of plant and wider systems, from the smallest to the largest, include ergonomics in the early planning stages.</p>
<p>It is also essential to create hubs of ergonomic development within companies. Doing so will require increased awareness at all levels, from the people who make major decisions to workers who are directly affected by the lack of ergonomics. This sort of program should aim to generate permanent programs inside the companies. This permanence is needed if companies are to progress beyond generating a series of isolated studies. Such isolated activities in Chile have been numerous, but they tend only to quantify the existence of ergonomic problems affecting the safety, health, and quality of working life without solving them.</p>
