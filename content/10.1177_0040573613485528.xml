<p><italic>The Jewish Jesus: How Judaism and Christianity Shaped Each Other</italic></p>
<p>Peter Schäfer</p>
<p>Princeton and Oxford: Princeton University Press, 2012. 349 pp. $35.00</p>
<p>Scholars have long noted the role that “Judaism” played in the development of Christian identity in the early centuries of the church. The early Christians defined themselves and their faith against “Judaism,” which represented error and falsehood, whether a christology that was too low, or a too great reliance on the literal meaning of the Hebrew Scriptures, or an observance of too many of the rituals prescribed by the Torah, or an eschatology that seemed too focused on the earthly city of Jerusalem. Whether this “Judaism” had anything to do with real living Jews, or whether it was simply a discursive formation of the Christians themselves, eager to discover, perhaps invent, an Other against whom to define the Self, is not clear. In any case, whatever it may have meant exactly, “Judaism” appears often in the pages of early Christian writers, and helped shape, by negation and contrast, the contours of what would become “Christianity.”</p>
<p>Is the mirror image true as well? Did Christianity, whether the real thing or some hypostatized creation of the Jewish mind, play a role in the emergence and self-definition of Judaism in the centuries after the destruction of the Jerusalem temple in 70 <sc>ce</sc>? Since the only form of Judaism in the post-70 period about which we have substantial information and from which we have substantial literary remains is the rabbinic, our question is: Did Christianity play a role in the formation of rabbinic Jewish identity? Until recently scholars assumed that the answer is no. No one denies that rabbinic sages from time to time conversed with Christians, especially Jewish Christians, but until recently scholars assumed that Christian truth claims did not play a formative role in rabbinic self-definition. Recently, however, Peter Schäfer, formerly professor of Jewish Studies at Princeton, now retired, and other prominent scholars (notably Daniel Boyarin, whose name frequently appears in this book) have argued that the answer is yes. Christian truth claims played the same role vis-à-vis rabbinic Judaism as “Judaism” did vis-à-vis Christianity. Indeed, that is the main thesis of this book, as indicated by the subtitle.</p>
<p>The title of the book <italic>The Jewish Jesus</italic> is a bit misleading, since the book is not about the Jewishness of Jesus. The book is about Jewish (rabbinic) truth claims that resemble, or seem to respond to, Christian truth claims about Jesus. The book is a series of studies of various rabbinic passages that adopt or reject theological positions (usually forms of binitarianism) that seem very Christian, even though the rabbinic passages under study do not mention Jesus, Christians, or Christianity. The themes of the chapters are as follows: different names of God (chapter 1), the Young and the Old God (chapter 2), David—Messiah as divine (chapter 3), God and the chief angel Metatron (chapter 4), God’s son (chapter 5), angels (chapter 6), Adam as divine (chapter 7), the birth of the messiah (chapter 8), and the suffering messiah (chapter 9). All of the chapters are suggestive; none is probative. Those who want to see Christian truth claims in these rabbinic passages will do so; those who are skeptical will remain skeptical. And even if we accept all of Schäfer’s arguments, he will have demonstrated that these dozen or so rabbinic passages react to Christian truth claims. This is still a far cry from the claim that “Christianity” somehow shaped “Judaism,” for such a claim assumes that “Judaism” is synonymous with Jewish theology, a claim that needs to be demonstrated.</p>
<p>Schäfer repeatedly observes that most of the passages that he discusses are from the Babylonian Talmud. If any Jewish community of antiquity was engaged in disputation and dialogue with Christians, it will have been the rabbinic community of Babylonia. This observation confirms another trend in modern scholarship, the trend to see the Jews of Babylonia as Hellenized, cosmopolitan, and engaged with their social and cultural surroundings to an even greater extent than their co-religionists in Roman Palaestina.</p>
<p>In sum: even if not always convincing, nonetheless a rich book on an important theme, readily accessible to non-specialists, and well worth reading.</p>
