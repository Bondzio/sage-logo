<abstract>
<p>Health care services in India have undergone rapid transitions in the last two decades. While government health services have been shrinking and investments got squeezed, the private sector has been promoted as an efficient alternative. This has led to an increasing dependence of people on the private sector for seeking care and a regressive form of financing based on out-of-pocket spending has emerged. The 12th Plan tries to address some of these concerns through Universal Health Coverage. The author argues that while universal access to health is a noble goal, it may not be achieved if an insurance-based model of financing and a managed care approach based on private sector delivery is adopted. Such an approach may facilitate further consolidation of capital at the expense of people’s money. The author draws from international experience to argue that egalitarian and universal access to health care can be provided only if government health services are strengthened.</p>

<title>The Current Policy Context: The Consensus and a Few Contentions</title>
<p>The health financing system in India is among the most privatised in the world in the sense that the share of private spending on health is among the highest. Of the total spending on health, 71 per cent comes from people’s pocket, while the government share is less than a fifth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0049085713492281">GoI, 2009a</xref>). Such a regressive form of financing leads to indebtedness, and pushes people towards poverty, untreated ailments and preventable deaths. In recent years, global debates on health financing have centred round eradication of ‘catastrophic expenditure’ and ‘Universal Health Coverage’ (UHC). Under UHC, governments are being seen as a major purchaser of health services (and not the provider or the only provider) and different forms of purchasing mechanisms are proposed including tax financed health insurance, mandatory social insurance and managed care model. The consensus is that government spending on health has to be stepped up significantly to finance such mechanisms.</p>
<p>The idea of UHC is being bandied about in India for the last three to four years. It was first floated through the National Health Bill (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0049085713492281">GoI, 2009b</xref>) by the Central government in late 2009 which was shelved subsequently without much deliberation. <italic>The Lancet</italic> published a special volume on universal coverage of health in India in early 2011 (<italic>The Lancet</italic>, 2011) and the Planning Commission set up the High Level Expert Group (HLEG) on Health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0049085713492281">Planning Commission, 2011</xref>). All these reports have pointed out towards alarming levels of Out Of Pocket Expenditure (OOPE) and suggested that UHC should be an immediate priority. <italic>The Lancet</italic>’s ‘call for action’ lays bare all that is on the cards. The direction is towards setting up an ‘Integrated National Health System’ including public and private health providers. According to these reports, ‘…comprehensive health insurance that is financed through a combination of public, employer, and private sources’ would be rolled out (Lancet Call for Action: 763). Apart from financing and regulating, the role of the government, as envisioned in the volume, is to ensure provisioning in rural and underserved communities and preventive and promotive work.</p>
<p>The HLEG report made a departure from the global discourse in suggesting that enhanced public spending on health to 2.5 per cent of GDP should be largely devoted towards strengthening public systems. It also recommended against insurance mechanisms and called for bringing different government insurance programmes under the same umbrella. It rejected insurance sighting the evidence that bulk of OOPE was in out-patient services and on drugs and diagnostics. Instead, the HLEG suggested that a national health package would be provided as a guarantee to all citizens and services would be jointly provided by the public sector and the private sector. It suggested two models to engage private sector, one is a ‘coordinated care model’ based on public provisioning complemented by contracted-in private sector; the other is more like a ‘managed care model’ where private and public facilities would be part of a network to provide health services to empanelled citizens. The final health chapter of 12thPlan has proposed that two UHC models would be piloted in different districts and States would be provided incentive funds for the proposed National Health Mission (NHM) to take up the pilots.</p>
<p>While one may find the ideas of increasing public spending up to 2.5 per cent of the GDP an important prerequisite and eradication of OOPE extremely essential, there are certain important contradictions between the goal and the design which need to be highlighted. To start with, eradication of OOPE is a narrow goal; it should rather be one of the key strategies to achieve ‘health for all’. This distinction becomes important because the goal drives the strategy. ‘Universal health coverage’ and ‘health for all’ mean two entirely different things. While ‘health for all’ prerequisites a progressive socialisation of health care, gradual undoing of commoditisation of health care and a primary health care approach integrated under the notion of social determinants; ‘universal coverage’ merely means that a financing system is developed to cover a majority of people against OOPE but provisioning is done essentially through market (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0049085713492281">Planning Commission, 2011</xref>).</p>

<title>Twelfth Plan Chapter on Health: March Towards ‘Advanced’ Markets</title>
<p>The health chapter of the 12th Plan is clearly an attempt to create conditions for further expansion of market in health care and at the same time to project the current UPA II government as progressive and pro-people, all under the guise of ‘Universal Health Coverage’. The strategy of the 12th Plan starts with a laudable proposition in the form of a call to expand and strengthen public sector. Emphasis has been given to increase district level capacities to provide different range of services at various levels including primary, secondary and tertiary. It also calls for rapid expansion of medical and para-medical education to fill huge human resource gaps with conversion of district and sub-divisional hospitals as centres of training and education. The other important initiative, which is already being contemplated, is to provide free medicines through all public facilities. However, almost in the same breath, it wants to ‘find a workable way of encouraging cooperation between the public and private sector in achieving health goals’—essentially hinting towards public–private partnerships (PPPs) and contracting-in.</p>
<p>The 12th Plan proposes to launch NHM by introducing the Urban Health Mission (UHM) along with National Rural Health Mission (NRHM). It is quite clear from the Plan document that the UHM strategy is going to be largely based on contracting-in private providers for secondary care and preventive and public health services through public sector. Restructuring of Rashtriya Swasthya Bima Yojna (RSBY) to include out-patient services is also called for. As was the case with NRHM, under the UHM also, tertiary care services would continue to remain out of the ambit of public services. Given the emergence and consolidation of corporate sector in urban areas, this would provide further impetus to the process of market expansion.</p>
<p>The HLEG proposed that UHC be provided through a mix of public and private sector providers and essentially financed by general tax revenues.</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>…every citizen should be entitled to essential primary, secondary and tertiary health care services that will be guaranteed by the Central government. The range of essential health care services offered as a National Health Package (NHP) will cover all common conditions and high-impact health care interventions for reducing health-related mortality and disability…Health care services to all citizens covered under UHC will be made available through the public sector and contracted-in private facilities (including NGOs and non-profits). (HLEG report: 5)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In this model primary, secondary and tertiary care would be managed as a network, with payments made to the network per person registered. The PC envisions that transformation towards such managed care model would require a longer time horizon and as an interim strategy proposed greater coordination between public and private sector to provide ‘continuum of care’. The PC proposes strong regulatory mechanisms to ensure rational use of resources. States would be provided ‘incentive funds’ to embark upon UHC models as pilots in a couple of districts. Under such a mechanism providers, including government facilities, would be provided with capitation fee based on the number of citizens registered. This marks clear departure from the existing system of ‘global budget’ where government institutions are provided from general budget irrespective of the number of people treated. This clearly has the potential to draw more resources from under-funded and depleted public sector to fuel private growth.</p>
<p>We can clearly identify the multiple strategies of marketisation of health care suggested under the 12th Five-year Plan (FYP). The range includes contracting in private providers in urban areas, more organised forms of PPPs and developing managed care models by including private providers along with public facilities within the managed network. Such large scale attempts at privatisation are being justified to enhance patient choice, increase efficiency of resource use based on the assumption that private sector is more efficient; offers good quality care compared to public sector in delivery of health care services. It is being argued that the inherent problems of private provisioning would be overcome by effective regulation of both public and private sector. We will study the managed care model in greater details and also probe the effectiveness of regulatory mechanisms in ensuring cost control and good quality care. But before that, let us reemphasise the need for public investment and try to understand the issue of resource mobilisation in greater details.</p>

<title>Making Resources Available to States and Enhancing Capacity to Spend: The ‘Cloud-Rain Conundrum’</title>
<p>The routine violations of financial commitments made under various plans cast serious doubts about the credibility of such propositions. For instance, it was pledged under the 11th Plan that at least 2 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) would be spent on health services by the centre and the states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0049085713492281">Planning Commission, 2007</xref>: 104). The 12th Plan document, however, points out that from 0.95 per cent under the 10th Plan, spending increased to 1.06 per cent under the 11th Plan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0049085713492281">Planning Commission, 2012</xref>). There is no explanation offered for why the target in the 11th Plan to spend ‘at least two per cent of GDP’ on health was not met. The way public spending on health is structured day, a large part of the spending is non-plan in nature and spent by States from their own resources. The Planning Commission (PC) as such does not have, and rightly so, any control over these resources. Therefore, the act of PC setting overall targets of spending is mere polemic, without any real backing of resources. For the current plan, the target is to increase spending on health and related sectors to 2.5 per cent of GDP. It should be noted that 2.5 per cent would include other sectors like water supply, sanitation and nutrition, effectively meaning very little expansion. This completely dilutes the need for financial resources to make certain quality of health service available to people.</p>
<p>Public spending on health in India is among the lowest in the world—when compared in terms of share in GDP and per capita spending. There were only seven countries in the world (Myanmar, Guiana, Lao PDR, Pakistan, Azerbaijan, Cote d’Ivoire, Singapore) which spent a lesser proportion of GDP on health in 2007 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0049085713492281">WHO, 2010</xref>). Some developing countries like Brazil, Chile, Costa Rica, Cuba, Colombia, Thailand, Malaysia and South Africa, which have made significant efforts in recent history towards provisioning of universal access to health, spend much higher proportions of GDP on health (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0049085713492281">Table 1</xref>). Governments in neighbouring countries like Sri Lanka, China and Nepal could mobilise more resources towards health than what was done in India. Per capita public investment on health, is almost at the same level with the average of the low income countries (LICs) and much lower than the low middle income countries (LMICs). Countries like Brazil, Thailand and South Africa, which have recently attempted to universalise, have stepped up public spending on health to 3–5 per cent of GDP over the period of a decade or so.</p>

<p>Presently in India, states spend more than two-thirds of the total public spending on health. Constitutional responsibilities require that any major expansion in public spending has to happen through states. Given the unsatisfactory situation of state finances, whereby states are being asked to cut expenditure to meet fiscal deficit targets, such reallocation looks unlikely. Finance Commission transfers and further restructuring of resource sharing, with additional taxation rights devolved to states, are essential to meet the commitments of public spending. Instead, the PC proposes an ‘incentive fund’ to be provided under NHM conditional upon drawing multi-year ‘health action plans’. This is clearly an attempt to enhance central government’s control over aspects which are essentially into the domain of states. Under NRHM, states are provided funds through societies, bypassing legislative accountability. Given the overwhelming evidence of corruption and misappropriation of NRHM funds appearing in the media as well as Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) reports, such tendencies of centralisation should be thoroughly reverted rather than strengthened further (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0049085713492281">Comptroller and Auditor General, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>It is quite often argued that there is no dearth of money in public sector but the States do not have the capacity to absorb funds. It is also fairly routine to write the epitaph of the public sector to build the argument that direct provisioning is not an efficient option and insurance kind of mechanisms are more effective ways of ensuring health security and access. The question of fund absorption and quality of care are not isolated from overall spending. The relationship between spending and quality is like rain and cloud. A cloudy sky is necessary to have rain but it is not sufficient. It does not always rain if the sky is clouded and it never rains if the sky is not clouded. Though mere increase in the magnitude of spending may not be sufficient to increase the quality of spending it is important to recognise that spending is an absolute necessity to improve quality. It is true that during the initial years of the Mission, a considerable portion of funds remained under-utilised especially in the High Focus States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0049085713492281">Aggarwala &amp; Aggarwala, 2009</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0049085713492281">1</xref></sup> A further increment in public spending was warranted arguing that states are not capable of spending funds that are being provided to them and hence the increase in investment is futile. Recent trends show that fund absorptive capacity is gradually increasing in the high focus states and a higher per cent of NRHM funds are getting invested towards creating systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0049085713492281">Mukhopadhayay, 2012a</xref>).</p>

<title>Private Provisioning: Consolidation of Capital and Destruction of Petty-production</title>
<p>As discussed earlier, the PC has devised multiple strategies to engage with the private sector. The idea is to push through a thorough restructuring of health system in the country by giving private sector a permanent place in government financed provisioning. Though the PC argues that the current strategy is innovative and designed to provide people the best care as early as possible in the given context, the fact is that such a system is a continuation of neoliberal policies followed over the last two decades in India.</p>
<p>Almost 60 per cent of hospitalisation and four out of every five short-duration ailments are treated in the private sector (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0049085713492281">Table 2</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0049085713492281">GoI, 2006</xref>). Increasing domination of private sector in service delivery led to high dependence of people on their own means to manage health care expenses, leading to indebtedness and poverty; prolonged deprivation of a large section of population from any access to modern health care system and uncontrolled escalation of profits of the private sector and especially the corporate hospitals. Indian state has not only ignored the agonies of people, it has adopted a whole range of ‘health sector reforms’ like gradual withdrawal from providing health services, introducing user fees, cut-backs in public spending on health, privatisation and commercialisation of existing facilities and services, provision of subsidised land and other incentives to systematically help private sector grow. One should see the current plan as the ambitious step forward in the process of enhancing market penetration.</p>

<p>During the early 1980s, private sector in India largely comprised of individual practitioners, both qualified and unqualified, essentially providing primary level, outpatient care of extremely variable quality across urban and rural areas in the country (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0049085713492281">Baru, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0049085713492281">Jesani &amp; Anantharam, 1990</xref>). The growth of secondary and tertiary hospitals was relatively new phenomenon, limited to metro cities and few affluent rural pockets of the country. Like every other sector of the economy, growth of organised and advanced capitalist forms of production requires state support in different forms. The case of health sector is no different.</p>
<p>In the 1980s, when medical care was gradually opened up to private sector and PPPs were made part of national strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0049085713492281">GoI, 1983</xref>), the idea was to help market grow. Introduction of neoliberal reforms in the 1990s accelerated the process. Continuous cutbacks in expenditure halted the process of expansion of government health services and reduced quality of care. A large and relatively affluent section of the middle class moved out of the government health services and formed the market base for organised private sector. This was supplemented by various forms of input subsidies including land, import subsidies on machinery and equipment, tax concessions. Large government investments made in medical education allowed private sector to access subsidised, cheap but good quality doctors. Freeze in government recruitments left little choice to the medical graduates but to join private sector or fly abroad. PPPs were expanded to channelize government revenues to provide further impetus to private sector growth.</p>
<p>Then, the relevant question is—why are the same international agencies which advocated vehemently in favour of cutback in public spending and introduction of user fees today talking about increased public spending on health and abolition of user fees? In order to understand the question better we need to study the structure of private health sector today. Over the years the corporate health sector though very few in absolute numbers, has really penetrated in the big cities. These are large establishments with huge bed strengths. Apart from these, there are small establishments in the form of nursing homes providing wide range of secondary care services. But the large majority are still the individual practitioners. While there is no comprehensive data for the entire private sector, some recent data sources can provide some partial picture. A survey of unorganised enterprises conducted by the National Sample Survey Organisation (NSSO) covers enterprises operating in service sector including health sector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0049085713492281">GoI, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0049085713492281">2009c</xref>). There are two rounds of surveys which provide data for the years 2000–01 and 2006–07. The data on the corporate health sector is collected by the Centre for Monitoring of the Indian Economy (CMIE). Together the two data sources give picture of individual practitioners, small nursing homes, diagnostic facilities and the corporate sector hospitals and diagnostic chains. Two important things come up if one analyses these two data sets.</p>
<p>According to the NSSO survey, in 2001–02, all these practitioners and facilities put together were approximately 1.3 million unincorporated enterprises providing health services in the country, excluding public facilities. Four out of every five enterprises (1.1 million) were Own Account Enterprises (OAEs) and the rest were (0.23 million) establishments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0049085713492281">Figure 1</xref>). OAEs are individual- or household-run businesses providing health services without hiring a worker on a fairly regular basis. An overwhelming majority (80 per cent) of the OAEs are located in villages, whereas most of the establishments are in the urban areas. As per the 2006–07 survey, the number of un-incorporated enterprises has declined to 1.05 million. This decline is mainly on account of a decline in OAEs (0.78 million), whereas the number of establishments has increased (0.27 million). Thus, between 2000–01 and 2006–07 more than 40,000 new establishments have come up, largely in the urban areas. At the same time, OAEs have gone down by almost 0.3 million. These clearly point out that a rapid transformation towards organised forms of production is taking place in urban areas of the country. The disappearance of general practitioners from Delhi clearly points out to such tendencies. Further insights are required on the process through which these practitioners are being included in the medico industrial complex.</p>

<p>At the same time, the corporate sector has rapidly expanded over the last two decades. In 2001 there were some 35 corporations listed with CMIE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0049085713492281">Figure 2</xref>). By 2006 the number jumped to 93. In 2001 total income was only ₹8,510 million. This increased ₹35,300 million in 2007. This meant an annual average increase of 18 per cent in real terms (adjusted for inflation). This is more than double the real GDP growth rate during this period. Investments did not grow at the same rate till 2005, though we observe a sudden jump in 2006 and 2007. At the same time, news reports on mergers and amalgamations suggest that a consolidation of the corporate sector itself is going on rapidly.</p>
<p>Compensation to employees did not increase too much. Out of the total income earned only a sixth went to the employees. One of the pathways through which capitalism increases income is by squeezing wages. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0049085713492281">Figure 2</xref> clearly depicts such a tendency in the health sector. It is expected that a lot of squeeze in wages would happen on the paramedical and nursing staff, while hefty payments are made to the specialist doctors. Mass exoduses of experienced specialists from the All India Institute of Medical Sciences who are being lured by astronomical salaries clearly substantiate such developments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0049085713492281">PTI, 2012</xref>). Exploitation of semi-skilled labour on one hand and sharing part of the profit with the upper echelon of the professionals on the other help hospitals to manage hefty income. At the same time there is a gender and caste dimension to the problem. Unlike the medical professionals in the country who are mainly upper caste men, most of the paramedical and nursing staff come from diverse deprived sections of the society and are also largely women. The so-called claim to efficiency of the private sector is based on cost minimisation which often leads to deterioration of quality and at the same time exploitation of women and deprived sections of the society.</p>

<p>Capitalist development in health is far from being complete. The rate at which individual practitioners are being replaced with organised capital is quite overwhelming. Transition towards managed care models would definitely accelerate the process. Given the assurance from government about cashless services, a lot of people would tend to enrol them with the better looking secondary and tertiary care institutions wherever they are available. In order to incentivise the growth process further, the government of India has included the health sector in the Viability Gap Funding scheme under which 20 per cent of expenses would be borne by the government if hospitals and medical colleges are set up in non-metros. This, coupled with the market guarantee mechanisms provided under the ‘managed care’ model can create conditions for further expansion of the private sector.</p>

<sec id="section5-0049085713492281">
<title>Is Regulation the Panacea?</title>
<p>The consequences of a private sector led model of provisioning are well known—distortions, induced consumptions, a drive towards more technology-intensive care and, above all, high cost of care. One of the reasons why the private sector needs to indulge in such unethical practices is the failure to achieve economies of scale for the investments made on capital-intensive equipment and diagnostics. In order to create product discrimination and provide ‘state of the art’ technologies, there is always a tendency to over-supply some of the high-end services like Computer Tomography (CT) scans, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), etc. It is often the case that if one follows standard treatment protocols, given the patient load, usage would be less and hence returns would be less compared to investments made to procure such services. Economies of scale which can be achieved through proper planning on epidemiological basis are clearly beyond the scope of atomistic decision making. It requires states action to build health system which can ensure continuum of care and rational use of technology.</p>
<p>Consequences of private sector led growth on people are well-documented. Evidence of RSBY suggests that cashless insurance mechanisms fail to reduce OOPEs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0049085713492281">Sakthivel &amp; Karan, 2012</xref>). The same mechanisms would prevail under managed care model and there is no reason to believe that exploitation of the poor would stop. The experience of OECD countries shows that the cost of care is increasing faster than the growth of GDP and every day a larger share of resources are being invested to finance health care while entitlements are getting gradually curbed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0049085713492281">Figure 3</xref>).</p>

<p>There is an effort to deliberately underestimate problems of private sector and hush up the real issues under the garb of regulation. Global experience suggests that most of the developing countries do not have the capacity to regulate private health sector and especially corporate hospitals. In India, there is very limited experience in terms of regulating private sector. Until recently there were no efforts to enumerate total private health enterprises at the national level. Thus, the question of regulation has been limited to the field of manufacturing, sale, quality and prescription of drugs and pharmaceuticals (the Pharmacy Act, the Drugs and Cosmetics Act and Dangerous Drugs Act); medical and clinical practice related (COPRA, the Indian Medical Council Act, and the Human Organ Transplant Act); registration and inspection of facilities (the National Health Accounts, and the Nurses, Midwives and Health Visitors Act) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0049085713492281">Mukhopadhayay, 2012b</xref>). Apart from these, there were state level legislations in some states for registering the private sector. Though these legislations exist on paper, there is hardly any initiative from the state governments to even register private clinical establishments, forget about regulating them.</p>
<p>As a result, these institutions remain highly unregulated. Very recently the Clinical Establishment (Registration and Regulation) Bill, 2010, has been passed in the Rajya Sabha. The Bill makes it mandatory to register all health establishments, with or without beds, both public and privately owned, barring establishment under the jurisdiction of armed forces. The Bill is absolutely silent about the regulation of prices in the private sector. One of the major maladies of accessing private sector is high and differential prices charged by private facilities. It is important in this context that there are restrictions on prices that the private sector can charge. Its failure to propose any regulation on prices is a reflection of the dominance of private hospital lobby over the Government.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The noble objective of PC to curtail cost, ensure equity, continuum of care and rational use of technology would necessarily fall apart because of contradictory design—a design based on privatisation that is being pushed by the given global order and the class composition of the present national government. The prerequisite of strong public sector in ensuring greater access has been demonstrated in all kind of contexts—from the most developed countries like the UK and Sweden; middle income countries like Costa Rica and Chile or developing countries like Cuba, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Brazil, etc. Like all other plans, PC has retained the rhetoric of strengthening public sector and at the same time paved the way for further monopolisation by the private sector. These tendencies, if not halted, will overpower the entire agenda of Alma Ata towards its design.</p>
<p>This may require bringing qualified general practitioners from various systems of medicine into the public fold before they get completely integrated into the medico-industrial complex. Experience of initial decades of NHS shows that general practitioners (GPs) can provide cheaper services, can be regulated, rational treatments can be ensured through them and most importantly, can indirectly curb the growth of the tertiary hospital sector. The political context under which such radical transformations had happened in the UK was vastly different from the neoliberal regime that we are living in. The strength of progressive political and civil society movements would be tested at such a juncture. Whether it can really push the agenda towards rebuilding public provisioning based on a Primary Health Care approach or allows vested interests to make use of public money to further the interest of profit and the greater downfall of the public sector is to be seen in the days to come. A small ray of hope is seen in the provisioning of free drugs in the public sector. An entitlement which was unobtrusively dropped during the era of liberalisation may now bring patients back to public facilities and create demand for better services.</p>
<p>However, the battle to rebuild the public sector in a Primary Health Care approach cannot be fought in isolation and in the current context of neoliberalism possibilities of rejuvenating government health services are really bleak. Under the present regime, where exploitation of labour is taking place in a most advanced and pervasive form, the state still plays its role in generating demand. But only in a manner which does not interfere in the process of production or price-setting. That is why artificial means of demand generation like cash transfer, voucher schemes, insurance and other market guarantee schemes are promoted, which allow the market to operate freely and plunder peoples’ money. That is why health care, food and nutrition, and water services are packaged and the epitaph of universal and comprehensive public provisioning is written in an unprecedented hurry.</p>
