<p>With environmental issues firmly entrenched in public discourse worldwide, our attitudes toward them are now more than ever under the scholarly microscope. While the idea of environmental ethics may not be new, the notion of environmentalism as a religion – the coalescing of various branches of “eco-spirituality” into significant systems of meaning, belief and practice – is drawing increased attention. Notably, in his recent book <italic>Dark Green Religion: Nature, Spirituality, and the Planetary Future</italic>, Bron Taylor argues that a growing array of individuals and groups, imbued with a sense of nature as being sacred and worthy of reverent care, can be viewed as following a religion, which he labels “dark green.” What’s more, he argues, this “movement” is rapidly becoming a force to be reckoned with.</p>
<p>At the Canadian Society for the Study of Religion (CSSR) meetings of the 2010 Congress of the Humanities and Social Sciences at Concordia University this topic was addressed in a roundtable discussion. Using Taylor’s work as a primary springboard for discussion, the participants analysed the notion of environmentalism as religion. They focused particularly on the issue of identifying as “religious” environmentalists who would be uncomfortable with (or outright reject) such identification, and the definitional implications of this in the study of religion. The presentations, modified for print, follow here, maintaining as best as possible the spirit of invitation to dialogue. The final section, “Concluding Remarks,” has been added.</p>
<p>This topic, the presenters believe, is particularly significant – a belief based on the singular importance of environmental issues today, including the devastating impact of human activity on living systems of the Earth, and the increasingly vocal and widespread environmental movement in response and reaction to such destructiveness. This, coupled with the obvious importance of religion (and/or spirituality) as a form and expression of value- and meaning-building oriented around the non-material, necessitates a careful consideration of the nexus of the two; not simply how “world” or “traditional” religions are reacting (as important as this is), but also the reactions of those who understand their deep environmental commitments to be non-religious. Though certainly some of the conclusions of the discussion are applicable beyond the context of environmentalism, especially with regard to defining “religion” and the imposition of the term on “secular” movements, the presenters believe that, by virtue of the global urgency of environmental matters, this context is of unique importance. This makes it of particular value to better understand whether or not we are dealing with a new form of religion or, alternatively, what characterizes this new and different form of religious/spiritual/ethical expression. It is to this discussion that each presenter contributes.</p>
