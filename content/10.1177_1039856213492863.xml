<p>Western Australian Colonial treatment of the mentally ill began in 1829 with the first mentally ill patient, Dr Nicholas Were Langley. Building commenced to house the mentally ill with the use of a prison, ‘The Round House’, and later the temporary shelter ‘Scott’s Warehouse’.

<p>The above quote was one of the many misleading claims made to would-be new settlers considering the Swan River Colony as a migration destination. It speaks of the promise but not of the hardship the new settlers would face in an alien environment. This paper provides a narrative of colonial management of people with a mental illness between 1826 and 1865. The need to treat or confine people with a mental illness was a major problem from the conception of the Western Australian colony. It is ironic that Western Australia was promoted as a free colony, but the first major building to be constructed was a gaol. This gaol, known as the Round House, was to house criminals as well as people with a mental illness.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1039856213492863">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1039856213492863">3</xref></sup></p>

<title>Western Australia’s colonial period</title>
<p>An early garrison settlement had been established at modern day Albany as early as 1826. Non military free settlers established a colony three years later, 409 km north at the Swan River.</p>

<title>The Swan River Colony – Fremantle/Perth</title>
<p>In May 1829 the barques Parmelia and Sulphur, with the new Lieutenant Governor James Stirling and his party of free settlers, approached the Swan River. Clark vividly describes the scene: ‘After the landing on the 1st of June husbands and wives huddled together on the beach among pianos, chairs, beds and stores wondering where Stirling’s promised Garden of Eden could be. Labourers found that here, as in the United Kingdom, hard work would be an indispensable preliminary to meat and drink. Children asked their parents why the trees of Western Australia grew in snow. Their parents, after explaining lugubriously that it was not snow they were seeing but sand, wondered when the rains would cease and they would enjoy the promised light of the sun’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1039856213492863">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1039856213492863">5</xref></sup> Although Clark’s narrative description is rather passionate, it well evokes the picture of hardship the settlers faced in such an alien landscape. Trauma and mental illness emerged early in the colony’s history with the first recorded patient being Dr Nicholas Were Langley.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1039856213492863">
<title>Dr Nicholas Were Langley</title>
<p>Langley was born in the town of Wellington, near Taunton, Somerset, UK in 1800. He was brought up a Quaker<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1039856213492863">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1039856213492863">7</xref></sup> and indentured in medicine to his father, Dr Humphrey Langley, qualifying in medicine in May 1823. During 1829, he was appointed as surgeon on the Thomas Peel expedition ship, Rockingham, sailing with 400 free settlers bound for the new Swan River Colony.</p>
<p>Langley was already showing signs of distress upon the Rockingham whilst docking in India.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1039856213492863">7</xref></sup> On the journey from India, the ship had run aground due to storms just short of its destination of Fremantle. Repairs took time and many of the ship’s crew and passengers died from malnutrition on the lonely beach to which they had been wrecked. When the survivors did arrive at their destination, they were too late to claim a land grant and most of the crew were denied their wages and dues. It was amidst such disappointment and anguish that Langley arrived in the new colony of fewer than 6000 souls.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1039856213492863">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1039856213492863"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1039856213492863">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>Upon his eventual debarkation at Fremantle, having nowhere to place a disturbed Langley, the colonial authorities housed him on a wrecked merchant ship that had been blown onto a sandbank at Arthur’s Head, Fremantle. The Marquis of Anglesey had been utilised to house the post office, harbour master’s office, the Fremantle residence for the governor, a prison for recalcitrant servants, and was now to be used as an asylum for Langley.</p>
<p>The deputy harbour master, Captain Scott, was given the authority to supervise Langley. After much argument with the colonial authorities, Scott was provided with seven shillings per week to hire a labourer to take charge of Dr Langley and the small gaol on board the barque.</p>
<p>Langley proved a difficult patient; he was agitated and violent and soon wrecked the Marquis of Anglesey, smashing all wood and fixtures. Captain Scott advised the colonial secretary in November 1830 (p. 141): ‘He (Langley) is continually in mischief, throwing everything he can lay his hands on overboard. He has broken the cabin windows and thrown a great deal down the hold. There is no doing anything with him’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1039856213492863">11</xref></sup> This appeal resulted in Langley being removed from the Marquis of Anglesey and relocated to the Round House.</p>
<p>Langley supposedly made a full recovery with no treatment and eventually took up his place as a colonial medical practitioner. There is no actual record of the date of his release from the Round House, but in September 1831 the Superintendent of the Round House, Richard Lewis, had advised the Colonial Secretary that Langley should be reviewed. Lewis advised (p. 7): ‘Dr Langley appears to be very much improved in his mental faculties, and seems at times very sensible of his present situation. I am of the opinion that a change of scene, and medical attendance, may do much to restore him to his reasons. He has been for some time perfectly docile and free from mischief’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1039856213492863">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>There are records of Langley treating at least two severely injured men subsequent to this letter to the Colonial Secretary: a Mr Gage, who had been wounded by Aborigines and subsequently died,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1039856213492863">12</xref></sup> and a Mr Johnson, who was the victim of the colony’s first duel, also reportedly died despite Langley’s administrations of medical support.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1039856213492863">13</xref></sup> There are also records of Langley taking legal action to dispute claims for medical services.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1039856213492863">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>Whether Langley was entirely fit to carry out the duties of a medical officer or rose to this post due to the needs of a desperate outpost of British gentry is not known. Did Langley have a mental illness? Or, was he the victim of severe agitation as a consequence of the traumatic experience of sea transport to Western Australia? Langley’s sanity was questioned on two occasions,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1039856213492863">7</xref></sup> when he was deemed to be mentally unfit and in need of supervised accommodation. Interestingly, the colonial government had the opportunity to send him on passages back to Britain or on to Tasmania and did not act.</p>
<p>The last mention of Langley was in the colonial newspaper, which reported the finding of his naked body crouched in a bizarre position on the banks of the Swan River near Fremantle.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1039856213492863">7</xref></sup> Langley died in 1835 aged 34 of what was reported to be a stroke.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1039856213492863">15</xref></sup> Langley had been in the colony for only five years.</p>
<p>The story of Langley is important in the history of the treatment of those who experienced mental illness in Western Australia. One wonders, had Langley been an ordinary citizen, rather than a medical officer, whether his length of confinement would have differed. Most probably his medical background was seen as an important asset in a fledgling colony.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1039856213492863">
<title>The 1830s and the Round House</title>
<p>After the first Quarter Sessions in the colony, held in July 1830, it was reported that ‘the Marquis of Anglesey had housed 27 prisoners during the period between December 1829 and 1st July 1830’ (p. 114).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1039856213492863">11</xref></sup> The chairman of the Quarter Sessions expressed the view that the hulk was unsatisfactory as it continued to be difficult to transport prisoners to and from the hulk as boats were scarce in the fledgling colony. This early report was the initial expression of a need to erect the first purpose built prison at Fremantle, ‘The Round House’ (p. 132).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1039856213492863">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Round House was completed on 18 January 1831 at a cost of £1603 10s; it had stone walls, a weatherboard roof and 12 rooms.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1039856213492863">16</xref></sup> ‘The building, which is made of limestone that was quarried from the site, is a dodecagonal design with 12 cells placed radially around a central courtyard’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1039856213492863">2</xref></sup> There existed a unique link between the civil engineer of the Round House, Henry Reveley, and Jeremy Bentham, an English utilitarian philosopher who designed a Panopticon plan for buildings such as gaols and asylums.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1039856213492863">2</xref></sup> Reveley’s father had worked closely with Bentham and it is fair to presume that Bentham’s ideas would have made an impression during Henry Reveley’s training as a civil engineer. The Panopticon design was developed to utilise the architecture of the building to maintain optimal observation of the inmates, control behaviour and promote normalisation.</p>
<p>The Panopticon was a design model to control human or animal behaviour and such a model exists in current practice, where the ward is structured into rooms with the most vulnerable placed closest to the nurses, who can maintain control. Thus it can be seen that Bentham’s Panopticon model of housing people with a mental illness may have provided some therapeutic use, should the warden have seen his role as anything other than custodial. The architectural features of the Panopticon and its advantages for continued observation of inmates is manifest in 20th century mental hospital design in the form of glassed-in nursing stations, night stations in dormitory areas, observation rooms and video monitoring. ‘Whatever the specific motivation for these surveillance regimes – and they are clearly different for people with intellectual disabilities, the sick and criminals – the general public perception they generate in the minds of the rest of society (which is by and large not under surveillance) is that all people under surveillance are, somehow, similar’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1039856213492863">17</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="section7-1039856213492863">
<title>Transfer of the mentally ill to the Round House</title>
<p>The new Round House prison was able to accommodate both men and women and for several years was the only imposing structure and evidence of European settlement amidst a gathering of small tents and temporary dwellings clinging to the sand dunes. It must have been an imposing sight for the naval traveller approaching this British outpost, over 3500 km from Sydney.</p>
<p>By January 1831, the Marquis of Anglesey was abandoned and all inhabitants, including Langley, were moved to the Round House.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1039856213492863">7</xref></sup> In effect, the Round House was both the colony’s first gaol and mental asylum. The early construction of a gaol exemplifies the colonial obsession with the confinement and control of ‘criminal’ citizens of British colonies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1039856213492863">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Round House survives to this day and remains a prominent feature of the City of Fremantle. Its twelve-sided design makes it not only the oldest public building in Western Australia, but also one of the most distinctive. Mundy,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1039856213492863">18</xref></sup> a strong 19th century voice against institutional care, noted that asylums often provided an attractive facade, whether public or private, but hid a brutal and miserable life for inmates. Consideration of the plight of people with a mental illness and viewing the existing structure of the Round House at Arthur’s Head leads one to ponder the latent and manifest functions of asylums. The external walls of the Round House provide an attractive exterior which hid the realities of life for those who experienced mental illness and for the prisoners within its walls. As such, the general public could go about their business with little regard for those detained inside.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1039856213492863">
<title>The inmates of the Round House</title>
<p>During this period, the young colony was struggling to survive and could not prioritise human or financial resources for the construction of an asylum.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1039856213492863">19</xref></sup> Such a harsh environment would not endear to the remaining colonists those who were unable to pull their weight. The precise number of people diagnosed with mental illness cannot be determined until the commencement of accurate record keeping in 1857. However, records of men classed as ‘lunatic’, ‘sick lunatic’ and ‘insane’ have been uncovered from records of prisoners incarcerated in the Round House gaol.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1039856213492863">20</xref></sup> A number of these men were transferred from the Colonial Hospital (established in 1830) to the Round House gaol because they were deemed to be unmanageable. The original hospital was a mere canvas tent ‘attached to the Perth Garrison at Barrack Street… and designated the Colonial Hospital for the benefit of all civilian sick whatever their means. This was the forerunner for Perth Colonial Hospital, which later became today’s Royal Perth Hospital’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1039856213492863">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>A story of one of the patients of the Perth Colonial Hospital who was transferred to the Round House is that of John Kellum, a former agriculturalist from Dorset in England, who was admitted to the Colonial Hospital in ‘May 1841 and diagnosed with incurable mania and dementia’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1039856213492863">22</xref></sup> John Kellum had arrived at Fremantle on the Lotus in 1829. There is also record of a John Kellum having been incarcerated in the Round House for four days during 1838. The Colonial Secretary wrote to the Governor to have Kellum transferred back to the Round House. The letter illustrates a primitivism in attitude towards people with a mental illness. ‘In consequence of the noise made by John Kellum nightly, and the destruction caused by his filthy habits to the bed and bedding of the hospital, I am compelled to request you will be good enough to remove him, if possible; he is not a fit case for a hospital of general diseases, as the patient suffers from want of rest and no possible good can be done to himself, his case being perfectly incurable’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1039856213492863">23</xref></sup> It seems that Kellum remained at the Perth Colonial Hospital restrained to his bed under orders of Dr Scholl. It may have been better for Kellum if he had been transferred to the Round House. Kellum reportedly was found dead in his bed, strangled by the shackles that had bound him.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1039856213492863">24</xref></sup> The struggling colony could not waste time on people who did not contribute to society and the absence of treatment options or people who were skilled to provide such treatments resulted in restraint and custodial management.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1039856213492863">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>Records of those inhabiting the Round House were not complete prior to 1837, although evidence exists that people with a mental illness were inmates of the building from its inception. For example, Dr Nicholas Langley was housed in the Round House during January 1831.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1039856213492863">6</xref></sup> The terms ‘lunatic’ and ‘insane’ seem to be used interchangeably. However, the term ‘sick lunatic’ referred to a person with a mental illness who also had a physical illness. Confinement was often short, such as in the case of Peter Patrick, who was confined for four days (7 November 1853–11 November 1853) and then three days (24 November 1853–27 November 1853), possibly due to alcohol enhanced anti social behaviour. However, many men were incarcerated for long periods of time: Thomas Bishop, ‘lunatic’, 1882 days (4 March 1850–10 May 1855), John Harris, ‘insane’, for 1213 days (24 February 1852–25 June 1855) and Thomas Dent, ‘lunatic’, who was incarcerated for 690 days until he was found dead (8 May 1846–24 April 1848).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1039856213492863">
<title>Conditions in the Round House</title>
<p>The cells measured 4 × 1.9 m, with minimal living space due to the building’s angled shape, and there were no exterior windows. Severe overcrowding existed, for example, for 43 males gaoled within seven cells during a period in 1837. Each cell ran off a 12 m diameter central courtyard, which was open to the elements and utilised for ablutions and exercise. The ‘Blue Books’ (1841) describe one cell as being lined with planks for dangerous and refractory inmates and state that ‘no solitary or dark cells’ (p. 212)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1039856213492863">7</xref></sup> were used. The use of dark areas was a common occurrence in British colonial gaols. These were usually cells, dug out under the ground like small cellars, where disturbed inmates would be placed until they settled.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1039856213492863">
<title>The convict system of the 1850s</title>
<p>In 1850, the convict system was introduced to the Western Australian colony. The convict era came about as a means to an end. Largely, the colonists were opposed to the idea of such labour, but the small numbers of free settlers could not provide the infrastructure that the colony needed in order to prosper,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1039856213492863">4</xref></sup> and colonial policy encouraged the transport of those convicted from the overflowing prisons and barges to the colonies. On 1 June 1850, the Scindian arrived at Fremantle with 75 convicts. At first, a requirement of a convict’s transportation was good health and a sound mind.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1039856213492863">25</xref></sup> Within a few years, demand was so great for convict labour that many convicts were transported despite experiencing mental illness. In addition, the dreadful conditions of transport, harsh environment and treatment ensured many convicts became mentally unbalanced after arriving in the colony.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1039856213492863">26</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1039856213492863">
<title>Scott’s Warehouse</title>
<p>It was in response to reports of high numbers of ‘lunatics’ among the convict population in the early 1850s and that they were being incorrectly detained in the prison that plans were made for a purpose built building to be utilised as an asylum. The prison superintendent, Thomas Dixon, lamented that insane convicts needed to be housed away from the prison ‘in some isolated building where the approved appliances both of science and humanity in regard to mental diseases may be put into operation’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1039856213492863">27</xref></sup></p>
<p>The number of people with a mental illness grew considerably and, in response, a temporary asylum was established on 16 November 1857, when 10 insane convicts were transported from the Fremantle Prison to Scott’s Warehouse to join the convicts housed there. Scott, who had been the Fremantle harbour master and former supervisor of Langley on the Marquis of Anglesey, had leased the warehouse to the colonial government for the purpose of housing the newly arrived convicts. A section of the warehouse was dedicated for people with a mental illness. The construction of the temporary asylum and its staffing was well planned:<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1039856213492863">7</xref></sup> ‘The estimated cost of this exercise was £173 3s 9d, and included enclosing a space from the front garden to the shed to form a yard, surrounded by a wall ten feet high and one foot six inches thick, with a door and frame. Provision was made for a privy in the cell, cess-pit, door, seat and riser, and the wall at the back of the old cells was raised to six feet six inches above the roof. The ground floor of the store was made into a ward by laying it with wood and security measures including iron bars on the windows. One cell was lined with leather and padding of cour. Three warders plus a reliever were enough to staff the temporary asylum. The warders were to take watches in the same manner as on board a man of war. The orderlies work was to be done by well selected convicts and there was an assistant superintendent or overseer’ (pp. 17–18).</p>
<p>Although mental illness needed to be considered in the early days of the colony, the history of the asylum in Western Australia commenced with the transfer of the 10 convicts to Scott’s Warehouse on 16 November 1857.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1039856213492863">7</xref></sup> It was on this day that Dr George Cooke Attfield, a man recently arrived in the colony and appointed surgeon to the colony, took over responsibility for the small asylum. Posterity can thank Dr Attfield for his good record keeping.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1039856213492863">
<title>Conditions and treatment at the warehouse asylum</title>
<p>Whilst all inmates of the Round House had been housed in cramped spaces and were only allowed to work if they were deemed fit, the provision of the little warehouse asylum provided the opportunity for some forms of therapy to occur. Dr Attfield provided contemporary treatments as well as ‘all rational amusement and indulgence that is possible under the peculiar circumstances of this asylum… Books are regularly supplied, and a good proportion of the men read daily. Several games at ball, such as fives or cricket, together with draughts in the evening, constitute their chief amusement. Washing, sewing and housework constitute the chief employment for the women; these [women] being probably all incurable, three being hopelessly imbecile’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1039856213492863">28</xref></sup> Attfield possessed advanced ideas concerning the treatment of the mentally ill, as evidenced by his insistence on exercise and amusements and his reluctance to use seclusion and physical restraint. Despite Attfield’s plans for a therapeutic facility at the warehouse asylum, he did work within cramped, damp, ill-ventilated conditions that were often perfumed by the air of rotting sea weed from the local beach. Attfield was commonly in disagreement with other medical staff and he supported moral management, emphasised the human nature of care for the mentally ill and actively opposed seclusion and restraint.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1039856213492863">29</xref></sup></p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The story of the treatment of Western Australia’s mentally ill began early in the history of the colony with the recording in 1829 of the first mentally ill patient, Dr Nicholas Were Langley. Adaptation of settlers to the harsh climate and attempting to keep the status quo of British society in a land which provided few comforts and social stimulus must have been trying for the small group of isolated settlers. Sand, salt and sun were found in a land that had been advertised as being abundant and potentially fruitful.</p>
<p>Although Western Australia was to be a free settlement, the early establishment of the Round House reveals the intent of the British settlers to keep control, as with other colonial British outposts in Australia and North America. Confinement for mental illness was the norm in Britain’s colonial history.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1039856213492863">30</xref></sup> Lack of infrastructure and the unavailability of skilled and unskilled labour to provide this resulted in the necessity for cheap convict labour. The transportation of convicts brought with it an increase in the percentage of people with a mental illness in the general population as well as a need for appropriate accommodation and treatment options.</p>
