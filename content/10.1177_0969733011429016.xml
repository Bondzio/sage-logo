<abstract>
<p>Preserving dignity during the dying process requires reviewing the roles of those involved in the treatment, care methods and decision-making. This article examines the participation and responsibility assigned to nurses regarding decision-making in the final stages of life, as laid out in the <italic>Rights to and Guarantee of Dignity for the Individual During the Process of Death Act</italic>. This text has been analysed on the levels of socio-cultural practice and discourse practice, using the critical discourse analysis methodology. The results show that, although the law is another result of the social trend of patient empowerment, the responsibility of the nurses is not recognised, and they are left out of the decision-making process in the final stages of life.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Human beings aspire to lead a dignified life and aim for the legal system to ensure this wish. If death is the final act of life, a dignified life requires a <italic>dignified death</italic>; a human right that should be considered by the law. With the aim of effectively ensuring the full dignity of a person in the process of death, the Andalusian Parliament, a regional body with competences in health, has enacted the <italic>Rights to and Guarantee of Dignity for the Individual During the Process of Death Act </italic>(RGDIDPDA).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0969733011429016">1</xref>
</sup> This act sets out terminally ill patients’ rights, the guarantees from institutions and the duties of health professionals involved in caring for the individual, the refusal of treatment, the limitation of life support measures and palliative sedation. The act aims to give legal security to citizens and health professionals, regulating actions, decision-making and the role of all persons involved in the process. In Spain, the responsibility of diagnosis, prognosis and decision-making at the end of life has historically<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0969733011429016">2</xref>
</sup> fallen legally to the doctor, with nurses carrying out collaborative tasks alongside the physician but being removed from the ethical dilemmas which these actions pose.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0969733011429016">3</xref>
</sup> Given that the RGDIDPDA will regulate the duties of all those involved in end-of-life decision-making in Andalusia, and, for the first time, in Spain, it is essential to establish, clarify and discuss the new role assigned to the nurse during the dying process.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0969733011429016">
<title>Background</title>
<p>In contemporary societies, the transition from paternalistic medicine to the acknowledgement of individual freedom as the core of the clinical relationship is key to the patient’s processes of health, illness and death. Medical technology allows for the vital functions of patients with chronic or degenerative pathologies, or those who are terminally ill, to be maintained.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0969733011429016">4</xref>
</sup> However, illnesses with a prognosis of limited life expectancy or suffering on the part of the individual or his or her family pose ethical dilemmas regarding limits of treatment and the dignity of the patient at the end of his or her life,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0969733011429016">5</xref>
</sup> which need to be legislated. The RGDIDPDA is the result of dynamic interaction between three distinct legislative sources: European agreements, legislation produced by the Spanish state and legislation produced by the Autonomous Regions. International organisations such as the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization and the Council of Europe<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0969733011429016">6</xref>
</sup> publish guidelines for the final stages of life that stress the importance of the patient’s autonomy, dignity and right to receive quality palliative care. These recommendations form the base of individual laws in countries such as Spain, as set out in the <italic>Basic Regulatory Act 41/2002 for the Autonomy of the Patient and His/her Rights Regarding Information and Clinical Documentation</italic>.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0969733011429016">7</xref>
</sup> Spain is divided into Autonomous Regions that possess a considerable degree of freedom to legislate the rights of terminally ill patients and end-of-life care.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0969733011429016">8</xref>
</sup> In terms of drafting regulations that set out these rights, Andalusia is a pioneering region in Spain. Since 2003, the right to receive essential palliative care and to outline treatment preferences at the end of life has been laid out in the <italic>Law on the Advanced Declaration of Heath Care</italic>.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0969733011429016">9</xref>
</sup> With the aim of further dealing with patient autonomy, decision-making responsibilities and the legal security of citizens and health professionals, the RGDIDPDA was enacted in 2010. A committee of law experts and health professionals, led by a doctor, advised the Andalusian Government on the drafting of the RGDIDPDA. Recommendations and preliminary contributions were collected from more than 60 collectives, including professional associations, health syndicates and civil society organizations. This act holds institutions and public health centres responsible for the assistance, treatment, palliative care, grief management and family support of the terminally ill patient, with <italic>Title III</italic> specifically regulating the duties and obligations of health professionals during the dying process. The right to a <italic>good death</italic> should first and foremost take the patient into consideration,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0969733011429016">10</xref>
</sup> as dying with dignity involves both standardised and personal experiences. It requires the participation of the patient, together with his or her family, in planning for the final stages of life,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0969733011429016">11</xref>
</sup> of the doctor in the diagnosis and treatment<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0969733011429016">12</xref>
</sup> and of the nurse, witness and carer from a holistic perspective.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0969733011429016">13</xref>
</sup> This includes a collaborative role with other health professionals and an autonomous role in the fulfilment of basic needs and attention to altered human responses. If, in practice, the nurse is present throughout all stages of the dying process, his or her responsibility and participation in the taking of decisions and clinical information should be reflected accordingly in corresponding written legislation.</p>

<title>Objective</title>
<p>The objective of this article is to describe the RGDIDPDA and to be aware of the nurse’s participation and the responsibility assigned to him or her in the decision-making process.</p>

<title>Methodology</title>
<p>Discourse analysis is a qualitative methodology used to understand how social relationships, identities and knowledge are formed. It does this by focusing on the context in which nursing occurs and the context in which people experience an alteration in their health status. The critical discourse analysis (CDA) enables the examination of texts contextualised within social, cultural and historical processes, and thus better understanding their structure, meanings and regulations ‘beyond the words themselves’.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0969733011429016">14</xref>
</sup> It is of use when studying decision-making regarding treatment and care at the end of life,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0969733011429016">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0969733011429016">16</xref>
</sup> as it allows us to conduct an in-depth analysis of documents of interest to nursing.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0969733011429016">17</xref>
</sup> Instead of hypotheses or experiences, the CDA views social and historical context as central to the inquiry process, using the texts to demonstrate the ways in which people use language to accomplish their objectives,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0969733011429016">18</xref>
</sup> and how discourse confirms, reproduces, legitimises or challenges power relationships. In order to understand the role of the nurse in end-of-life decision-making, we can apply the CDA to the RGDIDPDA,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0969733011429016">19</xref>
</sup> a methodology with a background in critical linguistics and the views of the Frankfurt School in relation to the social character of the theory and the control processes.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0969733011429016">20</xref>
</sup> We have framed our investigation within the model of <italic>‘Societal discursive practices: studies of discourse and power’</italic>,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0969733011429016">21</xref>
</sup> and, more specifically, within the approach of CDA offered by Fairclough; one which can be employed in a broad range of critical social and health studies, and which fits well with an analysis of policy issues related to nursing practice).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0969733011429016">22</xref>
</sup> Texts such as the RGDIDPDA are considered ‘discursive events’ of social practice,<sup>

<title>Results</title>
<p>The RGDIDPDA is a suitable text to investigate the role that society, through legislation, assigns to the nurse in the end-of-life decision-making process.</p>
<sec id="section6-0969733011429016">
<title>The level of socio-cultural practice</title>
<p>In line with the Council of Europe’s Parliamentary Assembly Recommendation (24/2003), the National Health System Palliative Care Strategy (2007) and the Andalusian Palliative Care Plan (2008–2012), the RGDIDPDA sets out a legal social demand, legislating rights and duties in relation to an individual’s dignity during the process of death: ‘In recent years, various cases related to the refusal of treatment, the limitation of life support measures and palliative sedation have been the cause of debate in Andalusian and Spanish society’ (RGDIDPDA, Presentation of Motives, II). These new policies, developed within a social democratic government, have indicated the transition from the old, dominant, Catholic moral tradition in Spain to the present, multicultural society, in which different beliefs, values and preferences regarding the end of life co-exist, and hence the enactment of laws that reinforce accessibility and democratisation and give responsibility to the citizen through health policies.</p>
<p>National Catholicism, established in Spain after the Civil War in 1939, disguised medical deontology as moral theology. The stance of the Catholic Church determined policies relating to euthanasia and suffering relief, without considering the limitation of therapeutic effort or palliative sedation. The influence of these dominant morals on nurses translated into the prevalence of an ethics of virtue and compassion, extending to palliative care, and prioritising loyalty and obedience to the physician in the technical and ethical matters. It was not until the late decades of the 20th century that a step was taken towards an ethics of responsibility, based on the obligation of care and taking the patient’s autonomy into account. Furthermore, this era also saw nursing become recognised as a profession in its own right.</p>
<p>The RGDIDPDA implies a commitment to patient autonomy: ‘The emergence of the value of personal autonomy has greatly changed clinical relationship values, which should now be adapted for the individuality of the patient’ (RGDIDPDA, Presentation of Motives, II).</p>
<p>The act does not deal with euthanasia or assisted suicide, but it does consider the limitation of life support and palliative sedation, which, without looking for death, opt for the alleviation of pain and the humanisation of the process. This is the expression of ideological dynamics and power, which come together when the act is passed. It is marked by the search for unanimity between political forces, particularly in the group that unites Democrats, Liberals and Conservatives: ‘The present law does not consider the regulation of “euthanasia”. On the other hand, the refusal of treatment, the limitation of life support measures and palliative sedation must not be classified as actions of euthanasia’ (RGDIDPDA, Presentation of Motives, II). The consensus of health professionals, particularly that of professional medical associations and scientific societies, was also sought.</p>
<p>Giving a terminally ill person the possibility to die in peace and without suffering is an expression of respect for human dignity and contributes to the security of the professionals: ‘This Act aims to decisively contribute to giving legal security to the citizen and health professionals in relation to actions considered under it’ (RGDIDPDA, Presentation of Motives, II).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0969733011429016">
<title>The level of discourse practice</title>
<p>The RGDIDPDA blends the discourse of the individual’s dignity during the dying process with the acknowledgement of authority in end-of-life decision-making. It forms part of a series of initiatives such as the <italic>Charter of Rights and Obligations of Citizens in the Public Health Services of Andalusia </italic>(1999), which aim to foster humanisation of health care and the patient’s decision-making capacity with regard to his or her health. Similarly, the <italic>Declaration of Living Will Act </italic>5/2003, the Decree 238/2004 regulating the <italic>Advanced Directives Register in Andalusia, </italic>and the Royal Decree 439/2010 relating to <italic>Ethical Welfare and Biomedical Investigation Bodies in Andalusia </italic>can also be found.</p>
<p>In a health system where reforms have started to provide nurses with capabilities in relation to home care or medical prescriptions, this is not written in the RGDIDPDA, which regulates authority in end-of-life care. In Spain and Andalusia, the doctor has, up to now, been the core of decision-making throughout the dying process; nurses have not had their own voice, although they are present at every stage, from care to death. The RGDIDPDA has set out the aspects of social and political debate in a legal text, but not those of professional practice, where the identification of the doctor as the only expert implies a specific interpretation. Although the RGDIDPDA recognises the right to palliative care, defined as ‘the coordinated collection of health interventions aimed, from a comprehensive approach, at improving the quality of life for patients and their families’ (RGDIDPDA, Art. 5.c), the criteria of the nurse are required only when evaluating the limitations of therapeutic effort. Intervention is defined as ‘all actions carried out for preventative, diagnostic, therapeutic, rehabilitative or investigative purposes’ (RGDIDPDA, Art. 5), but it can be proposed only by the physician responsible, defined in the Act itself as: ‘the professional who is in charge of coordinating information and the medical treatment of the patient or user, acting as their main communicator in all aspects of care…’ (RGDIDPDA, Art. 5.h). This supposes a contradiction with the reality of the day-to-day care of the terminally ill patient, which mainly concerns the nurse; a framework of privileged positions that establish group interests, with profound consequences for the nursing practice. The regulation states that ‘the patient’s right to decide’ takes precedence over all other concerns; the health professional cannot impose his or her personal opinions or morals, either religious or philosophic. However, the nurse may also be able to contribute his or her appropriate and authorised knowledge, which, along with the physician and other professionals, could help to conserve the patient’s dignity at the end of his or her life. The limited representation of nurses in the RGDIDPDA demonstrates the relationship between the socio-political power of the professional bodies and its corroboration in the law. This question is more evident in a detailed textual analysis of the RGDIDPDA, which is laid out in five chapters, each divided into 33 articles (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0969733011429016">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<title>The level of textual analysis</title>
<p>Being a legal text, the language of the RGDIDPDA employs technical terms (<italic>regulations, infractions, sanctions</italic>) and standard expressions (‘<italic>Notwithstanding the stipulations of…</italic>’), all written in a formal tone in the third person. After explaining the principles and motives justifying the writing of the text, Title (I) lays out the <italic>General Regulations: </italic>Objective (Art. 1), Purposes (Art. 2), Field of Application (Art. 3), Basic Principles (Art. 4) and Definitions (Art. 5).</p>
<p>The act regulates patient rights and health institution guarantees, as well as the obligations of health professionals: ‘<italic>This act will be applicable to all staff involved in health care…</italic>’ (Art. 2). Although it defines palliative care as comprehensive health intervention, it identifies only the figure of the doctor responsible as the communicator and coordinator of information and for the medical care of the patient during the process, and does not name the nurse, who is included in ‘<italic>…other professionals who participate in health care processes</italic>’ (Art. 5.h.).</p>
<p>Title II specifies the <italic>Rights of the Individual Facing the Dying Process:</italic> to healthcare information (Art. 96); to decision-making and informed consent (Art. 7); to refusal and withdrawal of treatment (Art. 8); to carry out the Declaration of Living Will (Art. 9); to receive comprehensive palliative care at home (Art. 12); to pain relief (Art. 13); to the administration of palliative sedation (Art. 14); to intimacy and confidentiality (Art. 15); and to being accompanied (Art. 16). Furthermore, the rights are also regulated if the patient is a minor or incapacitated; those people who, because of their health status or a legal decision, cannot take their own decisions and require people to express wishes on their behalf. In the case of the incapacitated patient, the law leaves it at the discretion of the doctor responsible to make decisions regarding receiving information or giving informed consent, and the role of the nurse is not specified: ‘<italic>When the individual under medical care is incapacitated, at the discretion of the doctor responsible…</italic>’ (Art. 10.1). Furthermore, it acknowledges the right of minors, emancipated minors and those under 16 years old, to revoke informed consent and to ‘<italic>reject any treatment proposed to them by health professionals</italic>’ (Art. 11.3).</p>
<p>Title III states the <italic>Duties of Health Professionals Attending to Patients Facing the Dying Process</italic>: clinical information (Art. 17), medical decision-making (Art. 18), advanced declaration of health care (Art. 19), incapacitated patients (Art. 20) and limitation of therapeutic efforts (Art. 21).</p>
<p>Although the right to information must be protected by all health professionals (Art. 6.2), it is the doctor responsible who must ensure this, with the nurse included within the rest of the health professionals who ‘<italic>…are also obliged to make clinical information available depending on their level of responsibility and their participation in the health treatment process</italic>’ (Art. 17). With reference to medical decision-making, the law recognises only the doctor responsible as having the capacity to make a clinical judgement prior to health treatment being carried out for a person during the dying process: ‘…<italic>based on the latest science, the scientific evidence available, his/her professional knowledge, his/her experience and the clinical state, gravity and prognosis of the person affected</italic>’ (Art. 18). All health professionals are obliged to give information about the right of the <italic>Advanced Declaration of Health Care</italic> and respect any instructions given under it. However, the duty of making decisions for an incapacitated patient lies solely with the doctor responsible, and ‘<italic>the opinion of other professionals directly involved in patient care</italic>’ is optional (Art. 20). The limitation of therapeutic efforts depends on the doctor responsible, after listening to the opinion of other professionals including the nurse: ‘<italic>… having heard the professional opinion of the nurse responsible for the care [of the patient], the opinion of the doctor responsible is required to be the same as at least one other doctor involved in the [patient’s] health care</italic>’ (Art. 21). The doctor responsible and the other professionals who attend to the patient ‘<italic>… are obliged to offer those health interventions necessary to ensure adequate care and comfort</italic>’ (Art. 21).</p>
<p>Title IV makes reference to the guarantees of health institutions during the process of death with regards to patient rights (Art. 22), accompaniment of the patient (Art. 23), family and carer support (Art. 24), palliative care advice (Art. 25), an individual room for terminally ill patients during their stay (Art. 26) and an Ethical Welfare Committee (Art. 27). References to professionals are non-specific.</p>
<p>Title V of the RGDIDPDA includes the infractions (light, serious, very serious) and sanctions for non-compliance within six articles (Arts. 28–33).</p>
<p>With regards to the professionals, the RGDIDPDA does not deal with any type of conscientious objection, as the regulated questions are considered part of good clinical practice, and are an indisputable right of the patient.</p>

<p>As end-of-life decision-making is included in legislation and health directives throughout the world, in recent years the ideal of a ‘good death’ has been set out as a legal and ethical requirement.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0969733011429016">28</xref>
</sup> All those involved are in agreement to avoid pain and to maintain dignity. However, although communication and information are key to the patients, the continuing of care is a family matter and controlling the process is a professional one.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0969733011429016">29</xref>
</sup> Although doctors vary greatly in attitudes, decisions and actions at the end of life,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0969733011429016">30</xref>
</sup> the majority of nurses claim to play a part in decision-making<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0969733011429016">31</xref>
</sup> something which, as in the RGDIDPDA, is neither recognised nor reflected by the law. Previous studies have acknowledged that there is limited evidence of how nurses are actually performing end-of-life decision-making.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0969733011429016">32</xref>
</sup> It is important to value the nursing practice, which, unlike technology,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0969733011429016">33</xref>
</sup> requires ‘being with the terminally ill patient’ and contributing to decision-making, which is a personal and incomparable process.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0969733011429016">34</xref>
</sup> The RGDIDPDA lays out legal obligations for all professionals with respect to the patient’s values and preferences related to making medical decisions, but rarely recognises the intervention of the nurse in the process. Aspects such as the latest science, scientific evidence and professional knowledge or experience are attributed only to the doctor. The autonomy of the nurse comes from knowing the patient, an essential element for making clinical judgements adapted to a specific situation,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0969733011429016">35</xref>
</sup> which is not acknowledged by the RGDIDPDA. Various studies recognise the nurse’s role in satisfying individual physical needs (hygiene, wellbeing, comfort),<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0969733011429016">36</xref>
</sup> reducing symptoms (pain, dyspnea, nausea),<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0969733011429016">37</xref>
</sup> relieving suffering, improving quality of life and upholding dignity during the dying process (autonomy and final wishes). Although under regulations such as the RGDIDPDA responsibility for all of these interventions lies with the doctor, in practice it is the nurse who cares for the dying patient, who sees the world through another human being’s eyes and who is united with that person in their experience,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0969733011429016">38</xref>
</sup> which requires ‘being there’ for the patient – listening intently and communicating carefully. This experience allows the nurse to become close to the terminally ill patient, forming a special relationship that gives him or her the ability to anticipate, understand and attend to the needs of the patient and his or her family, and thus being able to contribute to decision-making in his or her own professional right.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0969733011429016">39</xref>
</sup> Nurses’ demands do not imply carrying out actions separately from the rest of the team, but providing experience and understanding, which, together with the doctor and carers,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0969733011429016">40</xref>
</sup> could be of use in end-of-life decision-making<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0969733011429016">41</xref>
</sup>; a collaboration that is not acknowledged by the RGDIDPDA, but would contribute to providing high-quality care.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0969733011429016">42</xref>
</sup> The decision-making process in the final stages of life requires an interdisciplinary vision that brings together all medical, economic, ethical and legal aspects.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0969733011429016">43</xref>
</sup> Although pain management is the concern of all persons involved, the priority for the patient is knowing the truth and making decisions; for the family, it is to be with the patient; and for the doctor, it is to maintain or stop treatment and life support measures.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0969733011429016">44</xref>
</sup> However, it is the nurse who, from the patient’s bedside, is the communicator among all those involved and acquires a comprehensive understanding of the process, fundamentally centred on emotional aspects, giving information, being present and actively listening.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0969733011429016">45</xref>
</sup> The figure of the nurse is key to understanding patients’ preferences,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0969733011429016">46</xref>
</sup> defending patients’ decisions<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0969733011429016">47</xref>
</sup> and carrying out advanced care planning and advanced care directives.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0969733011429016">48</xref>
</sup> The nurse responsible is recognised by the family and society as caring for children<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0969733011429016">49</xref>
</sup> and adults<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0969733011429016">50</xref>
</sup> at the end of life. However, in line with the literature studied,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0969733011429016">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0969733011429016">52</xref>
</sup> the RGDIDPDA does not authorise him or her to make decisions regarding interventions nor to evaluate the patient’s incapacity; it only makes it obligatory to listen to his or her professional opinion in the case of limiting therapeutic efforts.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The majority of health services in developed societies imply status differences between professionals and patients, which are reflected in written texts and documents. The CDA offers rigorous methods to show how different groups manage to maintain their social status in clinical practice. The RGDIDPDA puts forward the doctor as being the fundamental and virtually only agent in the end-of-life decision-making process. However, although it seems logical that the figure of the <italic>doctor responsible</italic> leads decisions regarding treatment, it is the nurse who has the capability of care. The figure of the <italic>nurse responsible</italic> is not recognised in its own right, but is included within ‘other health professionals’, to whom the RGDIDPDA assigns duties and obligations, but not the capacity to make decisions.</p>
<p>The dominance of medical discourse, a monopolising element when making decisions for a dignified death, represents the exertion of authority and interests of a specific group on the rest of those involved. The creation of the RGDIDPDA has direct implications for the formation, structuring, financing and research of end-of-life care; a discourse that empowers the doctor as the expert and excludes the nurse. The most problematic element of the nurse’s identity is his or her independence, and although the figure already forms an integral part of ethical welfare or biomedical research committees, it is not recognised in end-of-life decision-making.</p>

<title>Limitations</title>
<p>Qualitative research assumes that an individual’s experience can be directly represented in language; discourse analysis is similar to other qualitative methods in that it is an interpretive process and cannot be generalised to other situations/texts. The interpretations of the study’s results are centred on the researchers’ specific view of the data; nurses and nursing teachers with professional experience in end-of-life care. CDA deems that a text does not unequivocally mean one thing, but that it can be understood in a variety of ways. Future investigations would benefit from the participation of patients, families and researchers from other disciplines, as well as from triangulation with other methodologies.</p>
