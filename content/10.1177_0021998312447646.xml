<sec id="sec1-0021998312447646" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Multifunctional materials, capable of electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding and cooling that are also lightweight, chemical stable, and mechanically strong, are desired in many defense and civilian applications. If possible, spectral band selective transmission and blocking would also be desirable.</p>
<p>Our current research on carbon nanotube (CNT) composites is set up to explore the feasibility of incorporating some or all of these desired functionalities into such nanocomposites, with the emphasis on understanding the mechanisms and the parameters affecting the electrical, thermal, optical, and EMI shielding properties of CNT/polymer composite films with CNT content far above the percolation threshold.</p>
<p>In this undertaking, one approach has been to increase the electrical conductivity for both EMI shielding and heat dissipation without overly sacrificing optical transparency. A success in such an effort would extend the use of such a composite to applications requiring transparent electrodes such as solar cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021998312447646">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0021998312447646">3</xref></sup> It is tempting to entertain the notion of replacing the predominant indium–tin oxide (ITO) in thin film display technology with a cheaper but comparably transparent and conductive composite electrode, especially when indium has become increasingly expensive due to shortage of supply. However, ITO has set such a tall bar in conductivity–transparency product that the nanotube–polymer composites alternatives under development in this project have been unable to overcome.</p>
<p>One strategy for strengthening nanotube–polymer composites and for increasing electrical conductivity, differentiating from prior efforts, is the cross-linking of the nanotube matrix by electron beam (e-beam) irradiation prior to polymer infiltration. This cross-linking strategy has been shown to be effective in microscopic samples of nanotubes in an scanning electron microscope (SEM) chamber in the literature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0021998312447646">4</xref></sup> It has not been deployed in macroscopic nanotube films. To assess its prospect for deployment in large area films, we first study and optimize the e-beam cross-linking conditions, followed by developing a method for the formation of homogeneously dispersed cross-linked nanotube matrices. While the closed graphitic shell structure of nanotubes give rise to extraordinarily greater Young’s modulus compared with that of carbon fibers, it is also the reason behind the observed fact that the free nanotubes tend to bundle together. The bundles are bound by van der Waals forces and can, therefore, slide on each other much like the layers in graphite and with shear strength weaker than that of graphite.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0021998312447646">5</xref></sup> From our own earlier discovery of ‘fusion’ of nanotubes under prolonged exposure to the e-beam in an SEM imaging process (not published) and the later quantitative analysis reported by a Swiss group,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0021998312447646">4</xref></sup> it is found that stable cross-linking, resulting from e-beam irradiation, can form between nanotubes in contact with each other and give rise to a 30-fold increase in the bending modulus.</p>
<p>It is well known that a nanomesh structure of semiconducting material allows to some extent decoupling of its thermal conductivity from its electrical conductivity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0021998312447646">6</xref></sup> This decoupling could be increased in our CNT thin film system for the benefit of infrared (IR) sensing. Adding polymer to the system gives one more degree of engineering freedom for further enhancing one effect and reducing another. In the pursuit of composites with extended functionality and lighter weight, many polymers were examined. One polymer, poly(<italic>N-</italic>isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) stood out as most interesting. PNIPAM is a three-dimensional porous hydrogel. It manifests a phase transition from a swollen hydrated state at lower temperature to a shrunken dehydrated state at higher temperature at 32°C, losing about 90% of its mass.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0021998312447646">7</xref></sup> PNIPAM has several additional merits for our purpose including a porous structure, beneficial for incorporating a cooling mechanism, and reducing weight. PNIPAM is also environmentally safe and biocompatible. This polymer is incorporated into some of our experiments, one of which relates the EMI shielding efficacy to PNIPAM concentration.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec2-0021998312447646"><title>Experimental setup</title>
<p>Water-soluble single-walled CNTs can be obtained from both within our lab and commercial supplies such as Nanointegris, Inc. In cases where diameter, length, and their uniformity are not critical, we prefer to use commercially supplied CNTs. Thin films of CNTs were prepared by membrane filtration method and the nanocomposites of CNT/PNIPAM were fabricated by drop casting. A projection e-beam system was employed for cross-linking of CNT films. In some cases, nanoporous anodized aluminum oxide (AAO) membranes of 50 nm pore diameter using oxalic acid solution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0021998312447646">8</xref></sup> and metal micromesh (SPI) were used to create nano-/micro-patterns on CNT films by reactive ion etching (RIE), respectively. The membrane was subsequently removed by adhesive liftoff. A ultraviolet (UV)/vis spectrophotometer (Cary 500) was used for optical transparency, SEM (LEO 1530-VP), an atomic force microscope (Veeco), an HP8510b vector network analyzer for EMI shielding efficiency, and a four-point probe setup for electrical resistivity measurement were employed for sample characterization.</p></sec>

<sec id="sec4-0021998312447646"><title>E-beam cross-linked CNT films</title>
<p>E-beam cross-linking of CNT films was carried out with fixtures, shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0021998312447646">Figure 1</xref>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0021998312447646">Figure 2(a)</xref> shows a photograph after e-beam cross-linking at various dosages and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0021998312447646">Figure 2(b)</xref> shows the sheet resistance change as a function of electron dosage for a 20 nm-thick CNT film. The dosage of e-beam irradiation was apparently sufficient to have changed the color of the CNT film (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0021998312447646">Figure 2(a)</xref>), which suggests that the e-beam irradiation modifies CNTs themselves either chemically or physically. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0021998312447646">Figure 2(b)</xref>, at e-beam dosages below 10,000 µC/cm<sup>2</sup> the sheet resistance decreased significantly, by a factor of four, then fluctuated around ∼30,000 Ω/sq at dosages between 10,000 and 50,000 µC/cm<sup>2</sup>, and finally increasing again at higher dosages. The initial decrease in sheet resistance with e-beam irradiation can be attributed to e-beam induced cross-linking of the CNTs,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0021998312447646">4</xref></sup> while the increase in sheet resistance at higher dosages may indicate e-beam induced damage of the CNTs. We, however, checked the Raman spectra of the different regions irradiated with e-beam and found no difference in the spectra. Only a slight decrease in the G/D band intensity ratio was noticed between the untreated (G/D = 45) and the treated regions (G/D = 42). This result indicates that e-beam cross-linking method could indeed help the development of transparent and conducting CNT films.

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0021998312447646">Figure 3(a) and (b)</xref> shows SEM images of nano- and micro-patterned CNT thin films of 20 nm thickness using AAO nanopore array template and nickel micromesh as etching mask, respectively. We have characterized the optical transparency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0021998312447646">Figure 4</xref>) and sheet resistance of these films (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0021998312447646">Table 1</xref>). The optical transparency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0021998312447646">Figure 4</xref>) has significantly increased by 34% in the nanomesh patterned CNT film and 26% in the micromesh patterned film, but an unexpectedly large increase of sheet resistance was measured. This large increase can not be accounted for by the conductive areal reduction. It also counters the effect of any cross-linking induced in the RIE bombardment. This is not necessarily bad news as it reveals the complexity of the electron conduction in such a random network of resistors that operate in both the quantum regime (within the nanotube and tunneling between the tubes) and the classical regime (boundary scattering limited mean-free lengths). It also suggests that current RIE conditions may have damaged the CNTs or chemically modified CNT films, or simply accumulated charged particles resulting in volume expansion and increased gaps in the junctions between CNTs. Further study on the unintended increase of the sheet resistance is called for, but our own initial Raman measurements suggested a decrease in the G/D ratio of patterned samples, indicating the possibility of damage introduced in the RIE process.

<p>The patterning of the nanotube network happens to be in the interesting regime of the length scale that is smaller than the intrinsic electron mean-free length and the phonon mean-free length in a high quality nanotube but larger than the inter tube electron and phonon scattering lengths. What effect on phonon transport does patterning at this length scale in such a random network of phonon waveguides? This turns out to be an open question not yet being dealt with in the literature.</p>
<p>It is intriguing that a substantial thermopower is measured in both patterned and unpatterned network films. Moreover, a substantial increase in thermopower is measured in the nanopatterned sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0021998312447646">Figure 3(a)</xref>) relative to the unpatterned one, as discussed below.</p>
<p>It is important to assess both the new possibilities opened by nanopatterning on the control of the thermal properties and the limitations that could be brought with it. For the time being, we will focus on the potential benefits, in particular, the thermopower, or Seebeck coefficient, which has direct applications in thermal energy harvesting.</p>
<p>One strategy for increasing the thermopower could be by increasing boundary scatterings via nanopatterning and thereby suppressing the phonon contribution to the system’s thermal conductivity. Previous studies on nanopatterned silicon and rough silicon nanowires have indicated suppression of the phonon transport in these structures compared with their pristine counterparts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0021998312447646">6</xref></sup> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0021998312447646">Figure 5</xref> shows the thermo-voltage plotted as a function of the temperature gradient between the hot and cold sides for the nanopatterned CNT film of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0021998312447646">Figure 3(a)</xref> and a pristine CNT film for comparison. The Seebeck coefficient is given by the slope of the data and labeled next to each curve. Comparison of the two, otherwise, similar systems indicates an increase of almost 30% in the Seebeck coefficient due to nanopatterning. Similar enhancement of the thermopower has also been in similarly nanopatterned bismuth thin films. Nanopatterned bismuth films showed enhancement of the thermopower in excess of 25%. One advantage of this AAO-based nanopatterning strategy is that it is a low cost and parallel process that is scalable to arbitrary sample sizes. It has been demonstrated in full 8 in wafers and could be easily extended to accommodate even larger samples. This represents a considerable advantage over other strategies that require extensive use of optical or e-beam lithography to achieve nanostructures.

<sec id="sec6-0021998312447646"><title>EMI shielding and CNT-polymer composites</title>
<p>In samples prepared for experiments on effects other than transparent electrodes, such as EMI and cooling for example, the nanotubes are dispersed with a particular polymer – PNIPAM. The CNT/PNIPAM nanocomposites were prepared by drop casting. For effective mixing without bundling of CNTs, both CNT and PNIPAM solutions were prepared in 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate and then mixed to the given ratio of CNT and PNIPAM. An SEM image of the CNT/PNIPAM nanocomposite shows well dispersed CNTs within the nanoporous PNIPAM structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0021998312447646">Figure 6</xref>).

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0021998312447646">Figure 7</xref> shows the transparency of CNT-polymer nanocomposites in a wide range of radio and microwave frequencies limited by our equipment (HP8510b VNA). The polymer, PNIPAM, is transparent to radiation in this frequency range while the CNTs reflect and absorb this radiation very efficiently. Thus, increasing the relative fraction of polymer in the nanocomposite also leads to increased transmission. We have found that the ability of such composites to shield EMI radiation is intimately related with the electrical conductivity.

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0021998312447646">Figure 8</xref> shows a good correlation between these properties, suggesting the possibility that a theoretical model could emerge from further analysis and lead to more quantitative guidance in future designs. One result is particularly pertinent to a goal central to a functionality we set out to incorporate into the composite – EMI shielding. With this CNT/PNIPAM composite, films of only a few micrometers yield an EMI shielding efficiency of 20–30 dB (for example, the CNT only film shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0021998312447646">Figure 7</xref> achieves shielding of ∼20 dB and is only 1 µm thick), which is comparable to that obtained in current EMI shield films of thickness ∼10 times larger, and is also superior to previously reported CNT/polymer composites ∼100 times thicker.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0021998312447646">9</xref></sup>

<p>Based on the known hydrophobicity phase transition of PNIPAM and the accompanying large volume change, one can speculate that there could be an effect of cooling to be had in the CNT/PNIPAM composite. Measurements of the time evolution of temperature in samples do indicate that a cooling function could also be built into these nanocomposite thin films.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec7-0021998312447646"><title>Cooling rate of CNT-polymer composites</title>
<p>Since CNT/PNIPAM nanocomposites are nanoporous and have a high thermal conductivity, the cooling of this nanocomposite could occur even faster than that of the PNIPAM alone. At this stage, we are more interested in the relative difference the introduction of the PNIPAM could bring to the composite. For comparison, various types of samples were measured: nanoporous alumina membrane (AAO), AAO with a CNT film on top, AAO with a PNIPAM film on top, and AAO with a CNT/PNIPAM composite film on top. FLIR Silver SC5000 IR Camera was employed to see the temperature change of each film, which is floated on water wells. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0021998312447646">Figure 9</xref> shows the evolution of IR images of these films with time. AAO with CNT/PNIPAM composite indeed showed highest cooling efficiency of 40% temperature decrease in given time, compared to 34%, 36%, and 36% of AAO, AAO/CNT, and AAO/PNIPAM, respectively. These results are preliminary but already indicative of the potential of the CNT/PNIPAM for thermal signature reduction, and possibility of optimization by changing the ratio of polymer to CNT and employing alternative film preparation methods.

<sec id="sec8-0021998312447646"><title>Summary</title>
<p>We have developed a new method of e-beam cross-linking to improve electrical conductivity without deteriorating optical transparency of CNT thin films. After e-beam cross-linking the electrical resistivity decreased four times. Nano- and micro-patterning on CNT thin films are found to be effective in improving optical transparency, but comes at a cost of reducing electrical conductivity. In thermopower measurement, nanopatterned CNT film showed 30% increase of Seebeck coefficient compared to unpatterned CNT film, which proves nanopatterned CNT film is useful platform in thermal energy harvesting through increasing Seebeck coefficient and possibly ZT. A number of parameters are identified in the process that can be explored and optimized to controllably alter the composite thermal properties including thermoelectric power and thermal conductivity. As an example, multifunctional nanocomposites of CNT and PNIPAM were prepared and they showed high EMI shielding efficiencies and thermal signature reduction while remain optically transparent.</p></sec>
