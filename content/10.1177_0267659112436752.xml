<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is the most common enzymatic disorder of red blood cells in humans. It is estimated that about 400 million people are affected by this deficiency<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0267659112436752">1</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The G6PD enzyme catalyzes the first step in the pentose phosphate pathway, leading to antioxidants that protect cells against oxidative damage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0267659112436752">2</xref></sup>. A G6PD-deficient (G6PDD) patient, therefore, lacks the ability to protect red blood cells against oxidative stress from certain drugs, infections, metabolic conditions, and ingestion of fava beans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0267659112436752">3</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>There are a large number of studies demonstrating inflammatory response, oxidative stress and hemolytic derangements induced by cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). In addition to the inflammatory effects of CPB, G6PD deficient patients are at higher risk of impaired oxygenation, prolonged ventilation, increased hemolysis, and increased need for blood transfusion after open heart procedures compared with non-deficient patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0267659112436752">4</xref></sup>.So it is challenging to manage a G6PD deficient patient undergoing cardiac surgery under CPB.</p>
<p>We report – the successful CPB management of a G6PD-deficient patient undergoing cardiac repair for double outlet right ventricle (DORV) with normally related great arteries, severe pulmonary stenosis and left ventricular outflow obstruction.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0267659112436752" sec-type="cases">
<title>Case Report</title>
<p>A 2-year-old boy was diagnosed to have congenital heart disease at 8 months of age. His symptoms included mild cyanosis and dyspnoea on exertion and he was referred to our hospital for surgery. His saturation was 79% and, on echocardiography, he was found to have DORV with restrictive ventricular septal defect (VSD), accessory mitral tissue protruding through the VSD and severe pulmonary stenosis. Since the VSD was small and accessory mitral valve tissue was further restricting it, attempting to route the left ventricle (LV) to the aorta through the VSD would have resulted in severe left ventricular outflow obstruction and this option was considered unsuitable. Hence, we decided to perform a bidirectional Glenn (BDG) procedure with atrial septectomy and enlargement of the VSD.</p>
<p>In view of the family history of hemolytic anemia, the baby was evaluated by a hematologist to rule out hemolytic diseases. His blood report revealed a low G6PD enzyme level which was 1.7 U/gm of hemoglobin (Hb) whereas the normal range was 4.6 - 13.5 U/gm of Hb. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) classification, this percentage of enzyme activity was classified as moderate G6PD deficiency<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0267659112436752">5</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>G6PD deficiency increases the vulnerability of erythrocytes to oxidative stress. These patients have a high risk of hemolytic reactions to certain drugs. Therefore, we made a list of drugs commonly used during open heart surgery that are known to cause hemolytic reactions in G6PD-deficient patients and these drugs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0267659112436752">Table 1</xref>) were avoided during the procedure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0267659112436752">6</xref></sup>.</p>

<p>After taking informed consent from the parents, the patient was shifted to the operating room. Anesthesia safety measures included the use of medications that are safe and have not been shown to cause hemolytic crises, such as benzodiazepines, codeine/codeine derivatives, propofol, fentanyl, and ketamine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0267659112436752">6</xref></sup>. Infection can cause acute hemolysis in G6PDD patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0267659112436752">6</xref></sup>. Cefuroxime was used as a preoperative prophylactic antibiotic.</p>
<p>The patient weighed 11 Kgs, his body surface area (BSA) was 0.51m<sup>2</sup> and the pre-op hemoglobin (Hb) was 11.3gm/dL. We used a Medos Hilite Pediatric Oxygenator (Medos Medizintechnik AG, Stolberg, Germany). Priming volume of the circuit was 600 ml, the circulating hematocrit was 18%. We added 250 ml of packed red blood cells in the prime in order to achieve a target hematocrit of 28%. Minimal occlusion was set in the roller pump-head in order to avoid excessive damage to the blood cells.</p>
<p>The circuit was first primed with heparinised Ringer solution (25 mg of heparin in 500 ml of Ringer solution). After de-airing the circuit and arterial filter, 100 ml of 20% albumin and 250 ml of two-week-old packed red blood cells (RBCs) were added in the prime. The prime sample was sent for analysis, which showed severe acidosis, high potassium, high lactate, severe base deficit and low calcium levels. Then, the blood in the prime was washed using a Nipro Hemofilter (Nipro Corporation, Osaka, Japan) to remove excess potassium and to reduce the lactate levels. After blood washing, there was less acidosis and the electrolytes were near normal. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0267659112436752">Table 2</xref> shows a comparison of pre- and post-wash prime sample analysis. A double dose of mannitol 20% (50 ml) was added to scavenge free radicals and 30ml sodium bicarbonate was added to the prime to prevent acidosis and to maintain an alkalotic state during CPB.</p>

<p>Routine surgical techniques were followed. After sternotomy, the patient was heparinised with a 3mg/kg dose of heparin and instituted on CPB. We went on normothermic bypass with a moderately low FiO<sub>2</sub> to build up PO<sub>2</sub> gradually. The pump flow rate was maintained around 2.8 l/m<sup>2</sup>, with a mean perfusion pressure of 40–50 mmHg. Bidirectional Glenn (BDG) was performed with the heart beating. The aorta was cross-clamped and warm blood cardioplegia was given. The right atrium was opened, atrial septectomy was performed and the VSD was enlarged. The aortic cross-clamp time was short; the heart picked up spontaneously in sinus rhythm after release of the cross-clamp.</p>
<p>The first arterial blood gas (ABG) on bypass showed no acidosis and no increase in lactate levels, which shows adequate tissue perfusion. Before release of the cross-clamp, while re-warming, mannitol, sodium bicarbonate and vitamin C were given.</p>
<p>There was no evidence of hemolysis on-pump. There was no hemoglobinuria and no obvious increase in lactate levels. The patient was re-warmed up to 36.2ºC and was weaned off CPB smoothly. The chest was closed and the patient was shifted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with stable hemodynamics.</p>
<p>The patient had a stable course in ICU. The first ABG was normal and there was minimal chest tube volume loss. Ventilatory parameters were within normal limits so the patient was extubated early. He was shifted to the ward on the 2<sup>nd</sup> postoperative day. He had an uneventful recovery and was discharged on the 7<sup>th</sup> day after surgery.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Although there are many published reports regarding the effects of G6PD deficiency, only a few studies have discussed the management of CPB in these patients.</p>
<p>The main cause for hemolysis in G6PDD is oxidative stress. The most effective strategy of managing these patients on CPB is to avoid the factors which would cause oxidative stress, such as infection, inflammatory response, ischemia, low flows on CPB, hypothermia and oxygen free radicals. Certain metabolic conditions, such as diabetic ketoacidosis, also appear to trigger destruction of G6PD-deficient red cells. Both acidosis and hyperglycemia should be avoided<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0267659112436752">6</xref></sup>. Therefore, we formulated a strategy for management of this patient as our primary aim was to reduce the oxidative stress during CPB and safe use of drugs.</p>
<p>Sodium nitroprusside (SNP) is the most common vasodilator used in pediatric cardiac surgery, but even low dose SNP might cause methemoglobinemia in these patients, so SNP was used with caution. Methemoglobinemia in these patients cannot be treated by methylene blue because the reduction of methemoglobin by methylene blue is dependent upon nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH), generated by G6PD. An alternative treatment for these patients is ascorbic acid (2mg/kg).</p>
<p>Studies have shown that an under-occluded roller pump is less hemolytic than a centrifugal pump in short-term procedures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0267659112436752">13</xref></sup>. Therefore, we used a roller pump with minimal occlusion. Albumin was used in the prime, mainly to coat the CPB circuit and secondly to maintain osmotic pressure. Albumin coating prevents the initiation of the complement cascade and helps in reducing the inflammatory response which, in turn, reduces the oxidative stress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0267659112436752">9</xref></sup>. Preoperative and intraoperative steroid administration attenuates inflammatory mediator expression more effectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0267659112436752">10</xref></sup>. Methylprednisolone was used in our case.</p>
<p>Blood washing is an effective method to reduce the lactate levels and bring down the electrolytes to near normal, thereby, reducing oxidative stress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0267659112436752">7</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Hemofiltration is usually used in pediatric patients to remove excess fluid, certain inflammatory mediators and to achieve a good hematocrit. However, the benefits of hemofiltration in short-term procedures are still debatable. It effectively removes excess fluid and a few electrolytes, but not all inflammatory mediators. The hemofilter can also cause a considerable amount of hemolysis as the blood is subjected to higher pressure inside the filter, which lyses the RBCs. Therefore, we did not use a hemofilter on CPB.</p>
<p>CPB was initiated with moderately low FiO<sub>2</sub> to build up PO<sub>2</sub> gradually and to avoid abrupt oxygen free radical formation in a cyanotic patient<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0267659112436752">8</xref></sup>. The patient temperature was maintained between 34ºC–36ºC because hypothermia causes hemolysis postoperatively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0267659112436752">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0267659112436752">15</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>High pump flows and good perfusion pressure was ensured throughout the procedure to provide adequate tissue perfusion. Lactate levels were within normal limits throughout the case. It is an established fact that tissue hypoperfusion is associated with lactic acidosis secondary to anaerobic metabolism. Thus, measurement of blood lactate levels can be used as a marker to assess the adequacy of tissue perfusion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0267659112436752">11</xref></sup>. Preoperative and first postoperative day bilirubin and lactic dehydrogenase levels can be used as a marker of hemolysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0267659112436752">4</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Procainamide also causes hemolysis. St. Thomas’ solution, which is used as a cardioplegic solution, has procaine hydrochloride, so we prepared a customized cardioplegia solution (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0267659112436752">Table 3</xref>). Cardioplegia was given through a Spictra Blood Cardioplegia device (SIDD Life Sciences Private Limited, Tamil Nadu, India) in a 4:1 blood:crystalloid ratio.</p>

<p>Cross-clamping of the aorta will trigger oxygen free radical formation. The addition of oxygen free radical scavengers in the cardioplegia is useful in scavenging free radicals and reducing reperfusion injury<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0267659112436752">12</xref></sup>. We added a double dose of mannitol in the prime to attenuate these effects. However, our clamp time was short.</p>
<p>Ascorbic acid is a well known anti-oxidant which was used while rewarming the patient to reduce platelet destruction and depletion during CPB and promote the recovery of the hemostatic mechanism postoperatively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0267659112436752">14</xref></sup>.</p>

<p>Gerrah et al. compared the postoperative parameters of G6PD-deficient patients with a control group and concluded that the G6PDD group had a longer ventilatory duration, impaired oxygenation and increased need for blood transfusion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0267659112436752">4</xref></sup>. However, in our case, total ventilatory duration was only 6.30 hrs and there was minimal chest tube loss (110ml). There is a similar case report by Dogra et al. in which they have used antifibrinolytics to minimize the blood loss<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0267659112436752">15</xref></sup>. However, the other management strategies were the same. Blood transfusion requirement was minimal (one unit of packed RBC postoperatively).</p>
<p>The perioperative management of our patient was uneventful, primarily because of our judicious use of drugs and precautionary measures. However, the level of G6PD deficiency in our patient was only moderate. To the best of our knowledge, there are no studies reporting the successful CPB management of patients with severe deficiency of G6PD enzyme, undergoing cardiac surgery.</p>
<p>To conclude, G6PD-deficient patients undergoing complex cardiac surgery can be safely managed on CPB provided every effort is made to reduce the formation of free radicals and to increase their deactivation. However, more research with a high volume of patients is needed to substantiate and validate the CPB management strategies.</p>
