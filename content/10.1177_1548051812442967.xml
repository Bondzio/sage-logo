<abstract>
<p>Based on the experience of, and evidence from, a 120-day action research case, the theory of sustainable organizing emerged. Building on the idea of sustainable culture, the authors propose that each of Holmgren’s 12 permaculture principles has direct application to human systems and that, when consistently applied, these 12 principles will lead to resilient organizations that provide opportunities for emergence. The authors draw from permaculture to look at the ways people organize themselves to rebound from change with resilience and the intention of achieving organizational sustainability. The authors define sustainable organizing as the conscious design of an organization in ways that mimic the patterns and relationships found in nature, yielding an abundance of resources necessary for the sustainability of the mission of the organization without compromising the needs of future generations of stakeholders to continue that mission.</p>

<title>Multiparadigm Perspective</title>
<p>The theory of sustainable organizing is built from a multiparadigm perspective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1548051812442967">Gioia &amp; Pitre, 1990</xref>) that draws from scholarship on positive organizational development and permaculture gardening. In the <italic>Structure of Scientific Revolutions</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1548051812442967">Thomas Kuhn (1962)</xref> introduced the concept of a paradigm. From its inception, the concept has been vague and difficult to specify. For the purpose of this discussion, a paradigm is one of several frames of reference within a field of practice. It encompasses the set of assumptions and common views informing professional practice. These commonalities include theorems, proofs, axioms, principles, laws, methodology, shared agreement on the problems of a field, and scope of the field. Kuhn concluded that changing paradigms allows people to view their surroundings in new and different ways. The change in thinking proposed here is that the principles of permaculture gardening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1548051812442967">Hart, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1548051812442967">Holmgren, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1548051812442967">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1548051812442967">Jacke, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1548051812442967">Mollison, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1548051812442967">Mollison &amp; Holmgren, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1548051812442967">Mollison &amp; Slay, 1992</xref>) applied to organizations produces resilient and sustainable organizations.</p>
<p>David Holmgren and Bill Mollison introduced the term <italic>permaculture</italic>, a contraction of the words “permanent” and “agriculture,” in the mid-1970s. They described it as an “integrated, evolving system of perennial or self-perpetuating plant and animal species useful to man [sic]” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1548051812442967">Holmgren, 2007</xref>, p. 3). In subsequent writings, Holmgren refines the definition of permaculture to be “[c]onsciously designed landscapes which mimic the patterns and relations found in nature, while yielding an abundance of food, fibre, and energy for the provision of local needs.” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1548051812442967">Holmgren (2007)</xref> summarizes his approach into 12 permaculture principles and expands the application of these principles, saying,
<disp-quote>
<p>[P]eople, their buildings and the ways in which they organize themselves are central to permaculture. Thus the permaculture vision of permanent or sustainable agriculture has evolved to one of permanent or sustainable culture. (p. 3)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Building on the idea of “sustainable culture,” we propose that each of Holmgren’s 12 permaculture principles has direct application to human organizations and that, when consistently applied, these 12 principles will lead to resilient human organizations that provide opportunities for emergence.</p>
<p>Our understanding of resilience is congruent with the definition offered by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1548051812442967">Sutcliffe and Vogus (2003)</xref> as “the capacity to rebound from adversity strengthened and more resourceful.” Organizational resilience facilitates an understanding of how organizations thrive in an increasingly complex world. The ability to respond quickly and creatively to changes emerging from the environment is more deterministic of an organization’s fate than its ability to plan with positive intentionality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1548051812442967">Sutcliffe &amp; Vogus, 2003</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1548051812442967">Spreitzer and Sutcliffe (2007)</xref> have identified a predisposition to learning and an energetic quality as core attributes of thriving organizations. As we will see, these qualities are key to a number of Holmgren’s permaculture principles. In positive psychology, resilience is considered an essential virtue, an embodiment of flourishing, and as both the source and result of individual and organizational efficacy and mastery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1548051812442967">Sandage &amp; Hill, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1548051812442967">Sutcliffe &amp; Vogus, 2003</xref>). Thus, our purpose in this research is to draw from permaculture to look at the ways people organize themselves to rebound from change with resilience and the intention of achieving organizational sustainability.</p>
<p>The most widely accepted meaning of “sustainability” is based on the description of “sustainable development” articulated by the United Nations’ World Commission on Environment and Development. Their report describes sustainable development as “development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1548051812442967">United Nations General Assembly, 1987</xref>). The context for this definition is one of global economic development and global environmental capacity. In contrast, the context of the theory proposed here is working toward a common organizational goal through organizational development (analogous to “economic development”) and the capacity of the organization to continue to work toward that goal indefinitely (analogous to “environmental capacity”). In addition to a smaller context, the theory of sustainable organizing also exists in a shorter time span than the UN definition, which references “generations.” The general, global context of the UN definition alludes to a biological generation that uses parents and children as its frame of reference. In the United States, this time span is currently on the order of 25 years, the median age of first-time mothers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1548051812442967">Mathews, 2009</xref>). Organizations experience stakeholder turnover over time. At the organizational level, this is analogous to the succession of generations of people at the global level. The median number of years that employees spend with the same employer in the United States is 4.4 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1548051812442967">U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2010</xref>), which is a substantially shorter time than what is typical for the succession of parents, children, grand children, and so on. Taking employee tenure for the typical organizational tenure, the time span of an organizational stakeholder generation is on the order of 4.4 years.</p>
<p>Applying the global-level UN definition at the organizational level leads us to describe sustainability at the organizational level as organization development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations of stakeholders to continue the life and mission of the organization. Combining this with Holmgren’s definition of permaculture leads us to define sustainable organizing as
<disp-quote>
<p>the conscious design of an organization in ways that mimic the patterns and relationships found in nature, yielding an abundance of resources necessary for the sustainability of the mission of the organization without compromising the needs of future generations of stakeholders to continue that mission.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The theory emerged from the experience of a 120-day action research case. The objective of the case was to develop a scalable and replicable model for an intergenerational forest garden. The objective included experiencing the garden through assisting in its creation, capturing and documenting the initial development, and gathering personal reflections on the experience; investigating through action research and literature review the intersections of education, intergenerational interaction, health, wellness, and community in the context the garden; researching best practices in community gardening, urban farming, and permaculture farming; and compiling and reporting the results to seed further research, to tell the story of the garden, to sustain its progress, and to lay the groundwork to attract future funding. The garden was situated at the intersection of a number of loosely coupled organizations in close geographic proximity. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1548051812442967">Weick (1976)</xref> noted, loose coupling carries connotations of impermanence, dissolvability, and tacitness, all of which are potentially crucial properties of the glue that holds organizations together. During the data collection and analysis phases of this case, the authors recognized that the principles of permaculture gardening applied to human systems yielded an abundance of resources necessary for the sustainability of the loosely coupled organizations. Thus, our goal is to provide a theory of positive organizational development that enables other organizations to achieve this same abundance of resources necessary for sustainability. In the Method section of this article, we will discuss the case in further detail. In the Results and Findings section, we will show with supporting data how the principles of permaculture gardening applied to human systems yield positive outcomes for an organization.</p>

<title>Organizational Development as Complex Responsive Processes of Relating</title>
<p>From an ontological point of view, we view organizations as complex responsive processes (CRP; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1548051812442967">Trist, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1548051812442967">Trist &amp; Bamforth, 1951</xref>) that are socially constructed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1548051812442967">Berger &amp; Luckman, 1966</xref>). Because of the emergent nature of reality in CRP, there is a deficit of methods to support and encourage organizational thriving. Drawing from existing literature and the featured case, this article fills that gap with a set of tools and processes that support the emergence of intentional positive organizational development. We situate the theory of sustainable organizing in positive organizational scholarship in that we “focus on the social, contextually-embedded, and dynamic processes and structures associated with positive states and activities of and in organizations” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1548051812442967">Fredrickson &amp; Dutton, 2008</xref>, p. 1).</p>
<p>In the past century, the discipline of organizational development has shifted from linear models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1548051812442967">Taylor, 1911</xref>) of planning and control to processes in constant flux and transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1548051812442967">Bohm, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1548051812442967">Gleick, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1548051812442967">Morgan, 1998</xref>). Viewing organizations as CRP offers a radically different perspective on the nature of organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1548051812442967">Fonseca, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1548051812442967">Griffin, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1548051812442967">Griffin &amp; Stacey, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1548051812442967">Shaw, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1548051812442967">Stacey, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1548051812442967">2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1548051812442967">2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1548051812442967">Stacey, Griffin, &amp; Shaw, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1548051812442967">Streatfield, 2001</xref>). The concept of emergence became prominent in the 1990s with the advent of complexity theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1548051812442967">R. Lewin, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1548051812442967">Waldrop, 1992</xref>) and is now recognized as a defining property of complex systems. Complexity theory suggests that if there is enough connectivity between the actors in a system, a new order will emerge spontaneously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1548051812442967">Goldstein, 1999</xref>). In our action research case, the clients desired a new order of connectivity and sustainability.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1548051812442967">Critchley and Stuelten (2008)</xref> describe organizations as dynamic social processes of communicative interaction. Communication is broadly defined and includes any form of gesture and response between at least two people, making the quality of relationships and of communicative processes the key factors in the quality of organizations that emerge. Although the quality of relationships within organizational systems requires deliberate acts of maintenance, too much stability will result in a loss of vitality. When this happens, it becomes the role of managers and organizational development (OD) practitioners, as facilitators of CRP, to deliberately disturb the relational patterns, allowing new patterns to emerge and creating a sense of aliveness. As we will reveal in the Method section below, we deliberately used appreciative inquiry and metaphorical sense making to create a collective identity and a new organizational culture. An example of the deliberate disturbance of relational patterns occurred when the researchers solicited garden participation from the neighboring community. By canvassing the neighborhood, engaging the community, and integrating neighbors in garden work parties, new patterns, connections, excitement, and garden advocates emerged.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1548051812442967">Stacey (2002)</xref> suggests that leaders and OD practitioners operate most effectively by focusing on “what is” rather than “what should be.” He suggests that reflective conversations, where participants engage with the emerging organization and their perception of it, are a powerful tool for surfacing the immediate reality. Active engagement in the conversation, Stacey suggests, will inevitably alter what emerges. As we shall see, the importance of this active engagement is found in the first principle of sustainable organizing, which requires that participants <italic>observe and interact</italic>. An example of this grounding in the present moment through reflection occurred during a garden work party. As OD practitioners, we asked garden party participants if they were a fruit or vegetable in the garden what would they be. By doing so, we focused on the effective operational mode of complex responsive processes described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1548051812442967">Stacey (2002)</xref>. We engaged stakeholders in focusing on “what is” through reflective conversations while they participated with the garden and with each other. CRP is a manifestation of the constructionist principle, which suggests that as we talk, so we make (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1548051812442967">Cooperrider &amp; Whitney, 1999</xref>). As we engaged stakeholders in deliberate conversations that anchored them in the garden, its experience, and its vision, we built a reality of engagement and a culture of growth and promise.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1548051812442967">Critchley and Stuelten (2008)</xref> perceive a clear difference between natural phenomena and social phenomena, the latter emerging as humans interact with one another and with their environment. They conclude that unlike natural phenomena, social interaction cannot be reduced to mathematical formulas. Based on this distinction, they set CRP apart from all other theories that have offered insight about the nature of human organizing based on examples found in nature. It is this assumption that the theory of sustainable organizing questions. We agree that the network of relationships that gives rise to human organizations cannot be adequately described using mathematics. However, we still have much to gain by studying natural systems and exploring what they have to teach us about human organizations.</p>

<title>Permaculture Gardening</title>
<p>The contraction of the words “permanent” and “agriculture” is credited to the mid-1970’s collaboration between Australians <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1548051812442967">David Holmgren and Bill Mollison (1978)</xref>. Their approach, merging systems thinking and design, is less their invention than their observation. The interlocking ecosystem of plants, insects, and animals is a fundamental reality of life on Earth, sustaining human life while it waits to be discovered as an inspiration for sustainable design of all sorts. In the theory offered, it is adapted to organizational development processes.</p>
<p>Permaculture gardening is centered on a particular cultivation and design methodology, one that uses nature as its model and strives to create a designed ecosystem modeled on natural patterns, maximizing output (food production) while minimizing input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1548051812442967">Hart, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1548051812442967">Holmgren, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1548051812442967">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1548051812442967">Jacke, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1548051812442967">Mollison, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1548051812442967">Mollison &amp; Holmgren, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1548051812442967">Mollison &amp; Slay, 1992</xref>). These characteristics are the essence of sustainability in biological ecosystems. Holmgren extracts the following 12 design principles from his study of natural ecosystems: (1) observe and interact, (2) catch and store energy, (3) obtain a yield, (4) apply self-regulation and accept feedback, (5) use and value renewable resources and services, (6) produce no waste, (7) design from patterns to details, (8) integrate rather than segregate, (9) use small and slow solutions, (10) use and value diversity, (11) use edges and value the marginal, and (12) creatively use and respond to change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1548051812442967">Holmgren, 2007</xref>). In the Results and Findings section, we explore each of these design principles from its original permaculture frame of reference and then adapt them to an organizational development frame of reference with the support of data from the action research case.</p>

<title>Setting</title>
<p>This case is situated within a small community of organizations linked by the geographic proximity of a shared campus. The stakeholder organizations include Fairhill Partners, the governing body of the campus (on campus); Center for Ecological Culture (on campus); Intergenerational Health and Wellness Center (on campus); Center for Creative Aging (on campus); and the Intergenerational School (on campus). Additionally, the case aligned with a number of other organizations at multiple levels including the Judson Park retirement home (in close proximity to the campus), the local neighborhood (in close proximity to the campus), and the Cleveland urban farming initiative (in close proximity to the campus; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1548051812442967">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<p>The leaders of the stakeholder organizations had agreed to develop a part of the shared campus into a permaculture garden. Their vision was a garden that would produce unique benefits to each of the stakeholder groups, the community, and the city, as well as link the organizations in new and unforeseen ways. This, it was thought, would encourage innovation and interorganization collaboration. The benefits proposed included curriculum development, food yield, intergenerational interactions, land beautification, spiritual health, and holistic well-being. The leaders of the respective organizations also planned to cocreate and comanage the garden.</p>

<title>Research Design</title>
<p>A team of six researchers, four of whom are the authors of this article, were invited to achieve the objective of developing a scalable and replicable model for a forest garden that existed at the intersection of education, intergenerational interactions, the community, and health and wellness. The researchers collaborated with two lead clients: the Director of the Center for Creative Aging and the Director of the Center for Ecological Culture. The lead clients were accessible, engaged, and passionate project participants. Their energy was evident from the beginning of the project. The researchers held numerous meetings with the lead clients during early stages of the project. These meetings established a shared understanding and purpose that, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1548051812442967">Hinrichs (2009)</xref> has suggested, led to commitment and served as a linking and coordinating mechanism through the conclusion of the researchers’ role and beyond. The researchers employed an action research methodology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1548051812442967">K. Lewin, 1948</xref>) consisting of iterative stages of diagnosis, planning, action, and fact finding.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1548051812442967">
<title>Planning</title>
<p>The research team initiated the project with excitement, curiosity, and high expectations for client-system impact. The 120-day engagement was divided into four phases: (1) information collection and discovery, (2) preparation and data gathering, (3) analysis, and (4) report delivery. Each team member was designated to at least one stakeholder group. A contract that outlined the project timeline, objective, scope, deliverables, plan of action, resource list, logistics, and client and OD practitioner responsibilities was submitted to and approved by the client. The objective of the case was to develop a scalable and replicable model for an intergenerational forest garden. The objective included experiencing the garden through assisting in its creation, capturing and documenting the initial development, and gathering personal reflections on the experience; investigating through action research and literature review the intersections of education, intergenerational interaction, health, wellness, and community in the context the garden; researching best practices in community gardening, urban farming, and permaculture farming; and compiling and reporting the results to seed further research, to tell the story of the garden, to sustain its progress, and to lay the groundwork to attract future funding (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1548051812442967">Figure 2</xref>).</p>

<title>Data Collection and Analysis</title>
<p>Research was focused on the intersections of education, health, wellness, intergenerational interaction, and community in the context of the garden. As awareness grew, so did the connections and interactions between the researchers and the stakeholders, the researchers and the garden, and the stakeholders and the garden. Data were collected through a literature review, biweekly onsite client meetings, conference calls, stakeholder interviews, and garden events. The researchers worked with an extensive web of stakeholders to develop a new course of action to help the community improve its work practices to sustain the garden and its proposed benefits.</p>
<p>Telephone and on-site interviews with schoolchildren, schoolteachers, parents, administrators, and elderly home residents were conducted throughout the project. The focus of the interviews was on meaning making and soliciting future engagement using appreciative inquiry. Questions were asked such as “If you were a fruit or vegetable in the garden, what would you be?” and “What is your greatest hope for the garden in 10 years? What will you have done to contribute to this vision?” The personification of a vegetable or fruit gave insight into what an individual might contribute or offer to a larger human system. One respondent answered, “I think I would be a lemon, because they are colorful and bright and give a sense of cheer and joy to people looking at them.” Another responded, “I would say broccoli, it is very healthy and has a great color.” In addition to meaning making, appreciative questions expanded people’s sense of what is possible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1548051812442967">Cooperrider, Whitney, &amp; Stavros, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Events were promoted by email, neighborhood canvassing, and a flyer circulated throughout the stakeholder network. Research team members reached out to their respective stakeholder group to maximize participation. The experience was meaningful and enthusiasm was contagious. Enthusiasm also spread when stakeholders shared inspirational stories from the garden with their respective stakeholder group, and thus the energy broadened and built (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1548051812442967">Fredrickson, 2003</xref>). This was particularly evident when the researchers leveraged a workshop at the garden that was conducted by permaculture expert, Dave Jacke. The team actively promoted the high-profile event, which served as a powerful project anchor by attracting a wider network of passionate participants to spread the word of the garden and its benefits.</p>
<p>Data gathering also included photo and video documentation that chronicled the transformation of the garden. Often, visual images spark more intense emotions than words. These images allowed researchers and participants to see what may not have been seen in the first place. A public website was created to support the client in sustaining the edible forest garden. The site memorialized and revealed the transformation as it occurred. It also served to seed further connections and conversations, as well as create a sense of participation in the meaning-making process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1548051812442967">King, 2010</xref>) throughout the project and beyond. The site included the literature review, links to exemplar websites, inspirational quotes and pictures, as well as photos and videos recorded throughout the process to foster ongoing public relations and dialogue for the intersections of education, intergenerational interaction, health, wellness, and community in the context of the garden.</p>
<p>The researchers’ official involvement with the project ended with client-system report outs on the campus. The entire research team, clients, teachers, parents, elderly home residents, students, and project team family members attended the event. It was a moving day filled with positivity, optimism, and hope. A successful transfer of responsibility from the researchers to the client was achieved. There was a sense of sustained commitment and energy in the air. The research team and clients both knew that this was much more than a well-executed project. There was no doubt that the energy would sustain because of the quality of work, extensive data gathering and analysis, project meaning, and the intentional efforts to create transferrable deliverables.</p>

<title>Results and Findings</title>
<p>The key findings of this case are an extension of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1548051812442967">Holmgren’s (2007)</xref> 12 permaculture principles. These principles, adapted to human systems, build the theory of sustainable organizing, or

<title>Observe and Interact</title>
<p><italic>Observe and interact</italic> implies that by taking the time to engage with nature, we can design solutions that suit our particular situation. Of this principle, Holmgren says that facilitating the generation of independent, even heretical, long-term thinking needed to design new solutions is more the focus of this principle than the adoption and replication of a proven solution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1548051812442967">Holmgren, 2007</xref>). He further says that simply copying models of land use already existing in our culture will stifle the creativity needed for real solutions. The techniques that work on one combination of land, plants, and people may not work with a different combination.</p>
<p>Applied to human systems, organizations are sustainable because they evolve and adapt. Mindful observation supports the ability of organizations to size up and act on unexpected threats before they escalate out of control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1548051812442967">Weick et al., 1999</xref>) and thereby fosters organizational resilience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1548051812442967">Sutcliffe &amp; Vogus, 2003</xref>). Vigilant and mindful <italic>observation and interaction</italic> by and with all stakeholders ensures maturity, growth, evolution, and adaptation. A commitment to <italic>observe and interact</italic> also helps constrain the ever-present temptation to simply copy the gimmicks of other successful organizations in the hope of replicating their success.</p>
<p>In the action research case, we realized that as consultants we needed to play a very active role in promoting the project to stakeholder groups early on to ensure <italic>interaction</italic>. There was an enormous sense of gratification on <italic>observing</italic> a class being taught in the garden. Children were laughing and exploring and the teacher was applying examples from the garden to her lesson. This design principle may be the most important one for sustainable organizing. Without <italic>observation and interaction</italic>, even the most perfectly conceived plan would outlive its functionality and usefulness. Organizations are sustainable when they evolve and adapt.</p>
<p>Instead of diving into organizational design recommendations and the implementation of these recommendations, we were mindful and waited for design to emerge. This long-term open-ended planning approach fostered new sustainable solutions. The importance of “heretical long-term thinking” to fostering organizational resilience and thriving has been noted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1548051812442967">Sutcliffe and Vogus (2003)</xref> as an ability to make trade-offs between organizational growth and continued investments in organizational competence.</p>

<title>Catch and Store Energy</title>
<p><italic>Catch and store energy</italic> suggests that by developing systems that collect resources when they are abundant, we can use them in times of need. Plants <italic>catch</italic> energy from the sun and <italic>store</italic> it as biomass, making it available for later use.</p>
<p>Applied to human systems, the <italic>catching</italic> and <italic>storage</italic> of energy is just as complex but is likely more difficult to define. Groups of people, such as the individuals in them, find themselves most vibrant and alive when their activities are most closely aligned with their mission and purpose. The application of this design principle is to align an organization as closely as possible to its respective core mission in all of its actions. Thus, when the need arises for adaptability in response to threats, the culture of the organization is strong. Whole-system engagements that allow contribution at all levels in which shared ideas and plans are <italic>captured</italic> help drive and sustain positive change.</p>
<p>In the action research case, this principle is evident in three examples, which we will highlight. First, the research team contributed to the change by connecting (or <italic>catching</italic>) the primary clients with multiple stakeholder groups, thus enabling them to draw on <italic>stored</italic> resources at later stages. The researchers intentionally conducted advanced planning and promotion of the project report outs and included the whole stakeholder system. The day of report outs was intentionally designed as an opportunity to celebrate a successful project, prompt discussions and connections, and encourage sustained involvement. A highlight of the day was viewing a class being held in the garden concurrent to the event. High levels of energy and a commitment to learning have been identified as core components of individual and organizational thriving (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1548051812442967">Spreitzer &amp; Sutcliffe, 2007</xref>). Second, our work was captured (<italic>caught</italic>) in a written report, slide presentation, photo library, video, and website. Our intent was always to create an easily transferrable deliverable that would have a significant and sustaining (<italic>stored</italic>) impact on the garden project, the stakeholder organizations, and the world in general. And third, each stakeholder group was able to pursue an application of their common activity to accomplish their purpose in the context of the garden. The school gained a live learning lab for science and social education. The center for creative aging gained another point of interaction for elders and children. The center for ecological culture gained an exemplar of multiple stakeholder groups collaborating with one another and with nature to achieve a self-sustaining environment. As involvement with the garden helped each organization move closer to its own mission, the energy of mutual benefit and accomplishment accumulated and fed itself (<italic>catch and store</italic>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1548051812442967">
<title>Obtain a Yield</title>
<p><italic>Obtain a yield</italic> ensures that truly useful rewards are a part of the work that is being done. The task of obtaining and measuring a yield is straightforward for garden production. Seeds are planted and grow into plants that produce fruit. The fruit of the plant is the yield from the garden, which can be easily quantified and readily consumed. The enjoyment and nourishment from eating the fruit is part of the reward for having cultivated it.</p>
<p>Applied to human systems, <italic>obtaining a yield</italic> becomes much more complex to measure. Profit-making ventures are perhaps the easiest to measure in that the yield is measured by the return on investment, an easily quantified value if it is money that is invested with the goal of producing more money in return. Ultimately, the yield must be defined in terms of the organizational mission or objectives. Once the mission and objectives are clear, a frame of reference indicates progress toward or away from that mission.</p>
<p>In the action research case, beyond simply explaining activities in terms of each organization’s mission, vision, and values, involvement must produce observable results. Follow-up conversations with the client-system indicate a sustained <italic>yield</italic> of interest and involvement. Seven months after the project closed, one of the clients commented,
<disp-quote>
<p>I am in DC at AARP, EPA, and other green organizations literally presenting the garden and related programs today and the virtual garden and related programs tomorrow . . . so your efforts are being well watered and are growing well. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1548051812442967">Whitehouse, 2011</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Another example of <italic>obtaining a yield</italic> was evidenced in the conversation one of the researchers had with one of the Intergenerational School students. The researcher asked the student, “When you come back to the garden next year, what are you most excited about?” The student responded that he was most excited about tasting the berries that would grow on a certain bush. This response revealed that this student understood that a certain plant would grow food, that he could eat the food, and that it would taste good. These key learning of where food comes from and how to access healthy options was clearly an example of a positive outcome of the garden and its interactions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1548051812442967">
<title>Apply Self-Regulation and Accept Feedback</title>
<p>Tied to <italic>observe and interact, apply self-regulation and accept feedback</italic> allows a system of organizations to evolve in a stable way. In permaculture gardening, inappropriate activities are discouraged to ensure well functioning systems.</p>
<p>Applied to human systems, s<italic>elf-regulation</italic> consists of formal articles of incorporation, bylaws, and governing principles. Organizational systems and processes must be designed to ensure opportunities for ongoing communication, agreement, alignment, and evaluation. <italic>Accepting feedback</italic> manifests itself in human organizations as orientation toward and capacity for learning, for trying new things, taking risks, and for learning from mistakes. Organizations build capabilities (i.e., sets of routines) and new competencies from their learning. This collective capability fosters organizational resilience in that it enhances the capacity of the organization to respond to the demands of an unpredictable world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1548051812442967">Spreitzer &amp; Sutcliffe, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>In the action research case, <italic>self-regulation and feedback</italic> to the client included establishing a rotating board of directors, creating a system for voting, scheduling ongoing surveys and interviews of stakeholders, and developing curriculum to provide opportunities for students to <italic>collect feedback</italic> from garden participants. The researchers’ work helped establish the need to cultivate elements of formal organizing. Rather than define these as part of the outcome of the research, the team worked to demonstrate the need for these elements and to set a framework in place within which the organizations could organically pursue them and <italic>self-regulate</italic>. In doing this, the researchers encouraged cocreation among the stakeholders consistent with the metaphor of the garden.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1548051812442967">
<title>Use and Value Renewable Resources and Services</title>
<p>To <italic>use and value renewable resources and services</italic> is to make the best use of nature’s abundance and to reduce our consumptive behavior and dependence on nonrenewable resources. Observation of natural ecosystems reveals that life on Earth is dependent on cycles. The carbon cycle traces the path of carbon from the atmosphere through the metabolism of organisms. The water cycle traces the path of water through precipitation from the atmosphere to the ground, to streams and rivers, collecting in reservoirs and oceans, only to evaporate into the atmosphere and precipitate again later.</p>
<p>Applied to human systems, the <italic>renewable resource</italic> is the people and the natural environment involved in sustaining a system. It implies investing in the needs of individuals and of the natural environment such that they do not become depleted but rather become renewed and in turn support the renewal of the organization in response to external challenges. Healthy organizations recognize the need for individual renewal and provide opportunities for members to seek it and to avoid being consumed by the demands of the organization.</p>
<p>In the action research case, we ensured that all stakeholder groups were invited to participate such that we could <italic>use and value</italic> their time, talent, and capital. The students of the Intergenerational School have <italic>used</italic> the garden as a focal point of learning <italic>and valued</italic> it by tending to the garden and eating the output. The Judson retirement community has <italic>valued</italic> the garden by offering opportunities for elders to maintain the hobby of horticulture, to transfer their knowledge, and to relax among nature and with youth.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-1548051812442967">
<title>Produce No Waste</title>
<p>In a biological ecosystem, <italic>producing no waste</italic> suggests that the waste of every organism is food for another. Applied to human systems, <italic>waste</italic> arrives in the form of purposeless activity, bureaucracy, or requirements that persist beyond their usefulness. In human ecosystems, the more important question becomes, “How can I prevent or eliminate <italic>waste</italic>?” The prevention of waste in human systems, as in permaculture, is facilitated through <italic>integrating rather than segregating</italic> between system components. Segregation fosters disconnection, duplication, and the inevitable waste generated by competition within the system. Integration fosters connectivity, shared resources, and efficiencies associated with collaboration as opposed to within system competition.</p>
<p>In the action research case, the series of work parties not only served as an opportunity for learning but also connecting and fostering sustained involvement and integrating stakeholders. Garden transformation unfolded in front of participants’ eyes and there was a sense of accomplishment, which supported sustained commitment.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-1548051812442967">
<title>Design From Patterns to Details</title>
<p>Holmgren suggests that by stepping back, we can observe <italic>patterns</italic> in nature and society. These can form the backbone of our <italic>designs</italic>, with the <italic>details</italic> filled in as we go. <italic>Patterns</italic> in nature are recurring aggregations of <italic>details.</italic></p>
<p>Applied to human systems, dimensions of <italic>designing from patterns to details</italic> include a division of labor and <italic>patterns</italic> associated with who does what: specializing or generalizing, simultaneous or in shifts, as well as homogenous or heterogeneous combinations. The selection of an organizational pattern is not static but evolving. The key is to intentionally choose and implement a <italic>pattern</italic>, then <italic>observe</italic>, accept <italic>feedback</italic>, and <italic>interact</italic> to change it when something different will <italic>obtain a greater yield</italic>.</p>
<p>In the action research case, the <italic>pattern</italic> applied to the emergence of the garden was to keep the two lead clients at the center of the action. They provided the vision and energy to drive the project forward, while the research team helped capture that vision in a way that could easily be shared with others. Organizing stakeholders through activities and proposed strategies also helped provide the <italic>patterns</italic> for organizing described above. Inherent stakeholder network linkages were recognized and leveraged by the researchers. These network links fostered communications and positive energy within the stakeholder system. An example of this included the lead client, Dr. Peter Whitehouse, Director of the Center for Creative Aging, linked to his wife, The Intergenerational School principle, who linked to school administrators and teachers, who linked to students, and then the students connected to their parents.</p>

<sec id="section17-1548051812442967">
<title>Integrate Rather Than Segregate</title>
<p><italic>Integrating rather than segregating</italic> suggests that by putting the right things in the right place, relationships develop between those things and they work together to support each other. <italic>Segregation</italic> in systems introduces waste. Biological cycles of life rely on the circulation of nutrients. Herbivores thrive by consuming plants, while their waste excretions provide nutrients to other plants that enable plant growth. By <italic>integrating</italic> living space of complementary organisms, it reduces the effort (or external intervention) required by both to thrive.</p>
<p>Applied to human systems, points of <italic>integration or segregation</italic> occur at any point of difference: demographic differences, activity differences, role differences, responsibility differences, and so on. Interdependence is a fundamental reality of life and <italic>integration</italic> across an organization, at any point of difference, provides an opportunity for personal and organizational growth that may not otherwise exist.</p>
<p>The school in this case study is designed to make the most of age diversity. By creating intentional opportunities for <italic>integration</italic> between elders and grade-school students, the school provides health benefits for elders while exposing the students to experience insight that they might not otherwise access. Health benefits for elders from interacting with children are of particular interest to the Center for Creative Aging and have been the subject of studies by its director (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1548051812442967">George &amp; Whitehouse, 2010</xref>). By integrating the knowledge of the urban farming community with the permaculture garden community, a powerful and resilient nexus was created that revealed immediate benefits to stakeholders of both communities during the Dave Jacke permaculture workshop.</p>

<title>Use Small and Slow Solutions</title>
<p><italic>Small and slow systems</italic> are easier to maintain than big ones, make better use of local resources, and produce more sustainable outcomes.</p>
<p>In a human system, relationships between people grow from a collection of singular interactions. Trust is earned over time. Intentionally pursuing interaction and collaboration among stakeholders is the <italic>small, slow solution</italic> that builds relationships between human beings. These relationships are the organizational analog of the atom or the cell. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1548051812442967">Dutton and Heaphy’s (2003)</xref> High Quality Connections (HQC) construct offers insight on fostering higher levels of connectivity, which is defined by the number of interactions between agents within a system and the positivity of these interactions. Subjectively, HQCs are experienced through feelings of vitality and aliveness, a heightened sense of positive regard, and the sense that both people in a connection are engaged and actively participating. The one-on-one connection of one person to another is the fundamental building block of sustainable organizing.</p>
<p>In the action research case, we intentionally invited reflection during and after every stakeholder interaction. This included neighborhood awareness of the garden and follow-up solicitation for involvement, plus reflective questions in interview protocol such as “What was a high point experience of your time in the garden today?” This type of reflection coupled with multiple opportunities to foster connections and relationships with various stakeholders supported frequent positive interactions between actors in systems. “[P]sychological growth occurs in mutually empathic interactions, where both people engage with authentic thoughts, feelings and responses. Through this process they experience mutual empowerment, greater knowledge, sense of worth, <italic>and a desire for more connection</italic>” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1548051812442967">Dutton &amp; Heaphy, 2003</xref>, p. 272).</p>

<sec id="section19-1548051812442967">
<title>Use and Value Diversity</title>
<p><italic>Diversity</italic> is a unique characteristic of forest gardens as compared with industrial agriculture or traditional gardening. <italic>Diversity</italic> reduces vulnerability to a variety of threats and takes advantage of the unique nature of the environment in which it resides.</p>
<p>Applied to human systems, it is now well recognized that when properly managed, diversity within human systems is directly correlated with an organization’s creativity and hence with its ability to respond in innovative ways to external challenges. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1548051812442967">Seel (2006)</xref>, diversity is one of the conditions for emergence. It fosters a “possibility space” from where innovative responses to external stimuli emerge. Effective managerial processes mediate the positive effect of diversity.</p>
<p>In the case study, the need to intentionally <italic>use and value diversity</italic> in the organizational sense arises not so much from the individuals who participate in the garden as it does in the ongoing leadership for the garden. Providing diverse representation from each of the stakeholder organizations is crucial. Ongoing leadership involvement from each of the stakeholder groups will ensure that the garden supports the respective groups’ objectives and will lead to better decisions by bridging multiple perspectives. The research team modeled this principle through its division of labor for the project, leveraging individuals’ strengths, as well as their physical proximity to (or distance from) the garden. The team directly and indirectly facilitated collaboration among the various stakeholder organizations by drawing on the diverse resources embedded within the action research team and among the loosely coupled organizations engaged around the permaculture garden. When an individual’s diverse potential is realized, it creates positive affect, which in turn fosters a desire for greater connections, which sets into motion another positive spiral of connectivity and, in this way, fosters organizational resilience. When diversity is combined with connectivity, the result is resilience through increased information flow and increased likelihood that a creative and innovative response will be found for an external challenge.</p>

<sec id="section20-1548051812442967">
<title>Use Edges and Value the Marginal</title>
<p>In permaculture gardening, the <italic>edges and margins</italic> are where the most interesting events take place; these are often the most valuable, diverse, and productive elements in the system. Where the meadow meets the forest, the environmental conditions create the opportunity for plants that need partial sun. These plants would neither survive the full shade of the forest floor nor the full sun of the exposed meadow. As a guide to design, these areas dramatically expand the diversity of life that a given area can accommodate.</p>
<p>Applied to human systems, <italic>edges</italic> exist in multiple ways in human organizations: between departments, between an organization and its stakeholders, between leaders and followers. Relational interaction most effectively <italic>uses edges and values the marginal</italic> and in turn yields creativity and innovation. At these intersections, not just people, but also their ideas, passions, and visions come together to create a thriving environment and growth.</p>
<p>In the action research case, the garden was an intersection between multiple organizations, which were themselves marginal to their individual sectors. The urban food movement was at the margin of nutrition in urban communities. The intergenerational school was at the margin of the mainstream educational sector. The Center for Creative Aging was at the margin of more traditional approaches to elder health care. Permaculture is an emerging but still marginal movement in the larger agricultural sector. As such, the project was situated at the intersection of multiple marginal systems. As higher levels of creativity are found in marginal areas, it could be predicted that the outcome of the project would be innovative and disruptive.</p>

<title>Creatively Use and Respond to Change</title>
<p>Holmgren has suggested that we can have a positive impact on inevitable <italic>change</italic> by carefully observing and then intervening at the right time. <italic>Change</italic> is inherent to living systems. It is a large part of what it means to be alive. The plants of the garden flow through their individual lifecycles, germinating, maturing, and eventually dying. The different species have different lifecycles and their interaction over the long-term embodies <italic>change</italic>.</p>
<p>Applied to human systems, <italic>creatively using</italic> and responding to <italic>change</italic> however, takes intentional effort. This principle loops the thought process back to the first design principle, <italic>observe and interact</italic>. It is through <italic>observation and interaction</italic> that <italic>change</italic> is first perceived, which is a necessary prerequisite to a <italic>creative</italic> response. Organizations that design for agility and intentional efforts to maximize innovation and creativity can outperform through rapid change and uncertainty. In the organizational sense, the influx and outflow of individual people is one of the most obvious forms of change.</p>
<p>In the action research case, this influx and outflow manifests itself in a new tenant on the campus, new students in the school, and new elders in the retirement home. The flow of people through the garden will change with the seasons. The coming and going of individuals, with their varied perspectives, talents, and interests, is one of many opportunities to use <italic>change</italic> for growth and adaptation. The research team contributed to this change by connecting the primary clients with multiple stakeholder groups and with knowledge from multiple disciplines. Their documentation of the experience through the written report, photography of the site, and the promotional video can provide a catalyst to draw others into the garden, where they can change the landscape and be changed in the process.</p>

<title>Limitations and Implications for Future Research</title>
<p>We have proposed that each of Holmgren’s 12 permaculture principles has direct application to human organizations and that, when consistently applied, these 12 principles will lead to resilient human organizations that provide opportunities for emergence. Yet there is a lot that remains to be studied, including an individual level of analysis, factor analysis of the principles, and connecting organizations with nature. Additionally, we recognize that this theory emerged from one case.</p>
<p>The case illustrated was situated within a loosely coupled system of organizations. Further research should be conducted on both singular organizations and networks of organizations. The deliverables of this case serve as an impetus for multifaceted action including further permaculture and intersection research. The featured case evaluates the garden as an intersection. This theory does not necessitate human interaction with nature, even though the theory was developed through the experience of human’s interaction with nature. Others should further evaluate and research whether nature, as an intersection, has unique payoffs to sustainable human system organizing.</p>
<p>Although we have focused our analysis on the organizational level, we believe there are data and a lot of opportunity to study the individual level, particularly in respect to high-quality connections (HQCs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1548051812442967">Dutton &amp; Heaphy, 2003</xref>) and the broaden and build theory of positivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1548051812442967">Fredrickson, 2003</xref>). We have discussed both briefly as they pertain directly to the building blocks of <italic>small and slow solutions</italic> and the contagion and expansion of organizational learning in <italic>catch and store energy</italic> when there is positive affect. Fredrickson’s broaden and build theory explains how positive emotions broaden people’s modes of thinking and action, which over time builds their resources, ranging from physical and intellectual to social and psychological (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1548051812442967">Fredrickson, 2003</xref>). Positive emotional experiences can be transformational and fuel upward spirals toward individual flourishing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1548051812442967">Fredrickson, 2003</xref>). Individual upward spirals can, in turn, lead to organizational flourishing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1548051812442967">Fredrickson, 2003</xref>). Emotions typically follow appraisal of personal meaning. Thus, if organizations want to foster positive emotions in individuals, they should create a work context that allows individuals to derive personal meaning from experiences of “competence, achievement, involvement, significance and social connection” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1548051812442967">Fredrickson, 2003</xref>, pp. 174-175). As described above, HQCs between humans at work are one way to foster meaning. We suggest that the facilitation of connectivity with nature at work offers another pathway to elicit physiological, affective, and cognitive positive spirals that broaden the human thought–action repertoire and that the HQCs created with nature lead to high-quality social connections and to greater connectivity within a human system. This can be found in natural landscapes and settings that occur in proximity to or on the campus of organizations.</p>
<p>And finally, we have developed the theory of sustainable organizing by including and applying all 12 of Holmgren’s permaculture principles to a network of organizations. Once a study with a larger sample has been conducted, a factor analysis will determine whether there are connections among principles or priority placed on certain principles to yield the desired outcomes.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>We have presented a multiparadigm perspective of sustainable organizing. We built on the permaculture evolution of permanent or sustainable agriculture to one of permanent or sustainable culture by proposing that each of Holmgren’s 12 permaculture principles has direct application to human organizations. We propose that when these principles are consistently applied to human systems, they lead to resilient human organizations that provide opportunities for emergence. We have defined sustainable organizing as the conscious design of an organization in ways that mimic the patterns and relationships found in nature, yielding an abundance of resources necessary for the sustainability of the mission of the organization without compromising the needs of future generations of stakeholders to continue that mission. We have shown how this theory was developed through a 120-day action research case. Our goal has been to provide a theory of positive organizational development that enables other organizations to achieve an abundance of resources necessary for sustainability.</p>
