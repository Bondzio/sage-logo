<abstract>
<p>The task of ‘doing’ ecotheology always already involves multiple perspectives and maps of various terrains. This short essay suggests three ‘prolegomena’ for doing planetary theology: embracing polydoxy, some form of agnosticism and the transgression of boundaries.</p>

<p>The growth of truth in a living ground signifies earthen sturdiness in space and time, something worlds apart from the stability of an abstract foundation in changeless truth.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0040571X12461222">1</xref></sup></p></disp-quote>
<p>I begin my reflections on ‘Mapping ecotheology’ with one of my favorite quotations. This epigram draws out the significance of ‘doing’ theology in the context of an evolving, planetary community. The mapping metaphor is thus crucial to such ‘spiritual cartographies’ in that it reminds us that grounds are far from eternal, unchanging foundations.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0040571X12461222">2</xref></sup> Always keeping in mind that ‘the map is not territory’, we can begin to chart the ways in which theologies shape the contours of earth bodies, landscapes, and the future of planetary becoming, without fearing that a given map will out-truth any other map.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0040571X12461222">3</xref></sup> In other words, questions of truths move from the realm of substantive metaphysics and epistemological representationalism towards that of aesthetics and ethics. Not all of the scholars involved in this project or reading this reflection will agree with my own map, but we may be able to find linkages between our ever-changing maps in a way that brings into sight new and emergent possibilities for the thriving of the planetary community. Having said that, in the short space allotted here, I want to identify three components of theological map-making that I find crucial in terms of grounding our meaning-making practices in the wider earth community: namely, the concept of polydoxy, the role of agnosticism and the role of transgression in theological anthropology. There are many other points that could be discussed in terms of ecotheological methods, yet these I find extremely helpful theological prolegomena for understanding how multiple methods might contribute to some common grounds.</p>
<sec id="sec1-0040571X12461222"><title>Polydoxy and multi-perspectivalism</title>
<p>In the process of opening theological methodologies onto our planetary context, perhaps one of the first points of order is to deal with the legacy of the ‘tunnel of time’ in Christian theologies. The basic concept of the tunnel of time, also known as onto-theology, is that creation begins from an ultimate origin, often understood as creation <italic>ex nihilo</italic> by an omnipotent God, and is moving towards an ultimate end, telos or salvation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0040571X12461222">4</xref></sup> The construction of this understanding of time over the first 500 years or so of Christian theology is, well, quite understandable. If one thinks of the contexts out of which such theological doctrines were constructed, it was one of a much smaller world. People did not travel as much; there was no mass communication or transportation; and only an elite group of people made it into the ranks that enabled the study and construction of Church theology. Daily life and one’s entire life was much more localized so that belief in a single, ultimate reality was much more possible. Such a construction of time is challenged as we fast forward to the modern scientific revolution, industrialization, and the current era marked by technologies of globalization. Through technologies of speed (mass communication and transportation) we are literally in contact with multiple conflicting truths around the globe on a daily basis.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0040571X12461222">5</xref></sup> More and more people (whether by choice or forced migration) live in multiple places throughout their lives. We are in a very real sense hybrids of technologies, multiple religions and multiple ways of being and becoming in the world. Furthermore, as critical race theory, feminist thought, comparative religions, liberation theologies, queer theories and ‘post’-thought in general bring more voices to the roundtable of constructing theological maps, a greater awareness of the multiple theological voices existing throughout the history of Christianity has been gained. Such polydoxy is more and more the norm in theologies, and ecotheologies must also take this into account.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0040571X12461222">6</xref></sup> Through the information that we gain from evolutionary, ecological, physical and other sciences, the multi-perspectivalism that we find in the human realm ought also to be extended to the rest of the becoming planetary community. Human exceptionalism, like sexism, racism, cultural imperialism and other ism’s, also breaks down in our contemporary planetary contexts. Instead of certainty in our theological projections, we might then also need to embrace a great deal of agnosticism and ambiguity to allow for the voices of planetary others to be heard.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-0040571X12461222"><title>Agnosticism, ambiguity and the role of deconstruction</title>
<p>Elsewhere, I have suggested a type of phenomenological approach to epistemology, which I term a viable agnostic theology.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0040571X12461222">7</xref></sup> In other words, we can only see, hear, taste, smell, touch and think so far into the past and future before our knowing shades off into mystery. Even with the extension of our senses through technologies, the very distant past and very distant future are ambiguous and uncertain. Rather than placing certainty where it ought not to be, perhaps it is time to practise unknowing at the edges of our knowledge once again.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0040571X12461222">8</xref></sup> Such unknowing keeps us open towards planetary others (human and non-human) and towards emergent possibilities for becoming.</p>
<p>Even beyond apophasis and negative theological methods, our multi-perspectival, ambiguous context may call for understanding truth as various ‘regimes of truth’ or ‘lines of flight’ ever persuading us towards different ways of becoming.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0040571X12461222">9</xref></sup> Thomas Tweed’s understanding of religion as ‘crossing and dwelling’, Richard Kearney’s understanding of anatheism and Mark Taylor’s theology <italic>After God</italic> are different examples of the types of truth claims we might make when truth takes seriously the undoing of knowledge.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0040571X12461222">10</xref></sup> Such an understanding of truth is a move from truth as representational towards that of truth as performative, ethical and aesthetic.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0040571X12461222">11</xref></sup> Such truths recognize the contextual nature of being a meaning-making creature in the context of multiple planetary others all in the process of evolving and co-constructing planetary communities.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-0040571X12461222"><title>Transgressing boundaries and planetary identities</title>
<p>The third and final component for an ecotheological method, and for planetary theologies, has to do with transgressing the very boundaries of our humanity. If the boundaries that we create to understand our realities are permeable, our subjectivities are always already multiple (made up of multiple bio-histories of human and earth others), and we are evolving towards unknown possibilities, then we ought to imagine theologies that transgress the categories of humanism. In other words, human exceptionalism is at the heart of a theological anthropology that takes humanity to be an ontologically and metaphysically sealed category. Such human exceptionalism is at the heart of anaemic understandings of liberal humanism: it serves to reify humanity as a category over and against the rest of the becoming planetary community.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0040571X12461222">12</xref></sup> We evolve with other plants, animals and minerals, and with technologies.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0040571X12461222">13</xref></sup> We are thus both always already a multitude of subjectivities, a mixture of bio-histories, nature-cultures and imagined-materials.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0040571X12461222">14</xref></sup> Theologies of and for the planetary community can no longer reify humans as somehow apart from machines and technology (on the one hand) and the rest of the natural world (on the other hand). We are hybrid, cyborg, always transgressing the boundaries of our humanity, our understandings of sex and sexuality, our understandings of race and able-bodiedness and the boundaries of religious identity. In the end, a planetary theological method might take seriously the idea that we may transgress the boundaries of theology and that new, multiple meaning-making practices will emerge, which we never before dreamed possible.</p>
