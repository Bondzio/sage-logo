<p>Americans have always had a fascination for Rome and its history, identifying with its humble beginnings and its accidental growth to world empire. Our founding fathers admired Rome, and the authors of <italic>The Federalist Papers</italic> signed their names as Publius, as if to identify with the Republican ideal. The parallels to America are striking. Both Rome and America began with a collection of misfits – Rome, despite the elegant mythology of Aeneas and Romulus, with escaped slaves and criminals, and America, with people who did not agree with the establishment, refugees from debtors’ prisons (Georgia), and later, the ‘huddled masses yearning to breathe free’ from all over Europe. Another parallel is that Rome and the United States have both had a distaste for the idea of ‘kingship’, even though in both societies executives have had as much power as any king.</p>
<p>During the 400 years of the Roman Republic’s existence, there was constant war. There were only two periods in which peace reigned for more than 10 years. America, too, in spite of our sense that we are a peaceful nation, has had few prolonged times of peace. The last major Native American war ended in 1890, and the longest time without war were the years between the War of 1812 and the Mexican War of 1846. The Roman Republic came to an end after the Battle of Actium in 31 BCE. After that, Augustus ruled alone for 46 years, and his descendants for another 53 years. This reign established the <italic>Pax Romana</italic>, a period without major conflicts except for the disaster in the Teutoburg Forest, when three legions were slaughtered by the Germans, stopping Rome’s eastward expansion forever.</p>
<p>Greg Woolf has given us an interesting though unorthodox synthesis of Roman history from its mythical (unreliable) origins to the beginnings of the Muslim conquests. It is a learned and wide-ranging work, embracing the findings of contemporary archaeology, and is changing many of our preconceptions of Rome. The Republic, greatly admired by America’s founding fathers, was rife with corruption and unable to manage its political expansion. This prompted a cult of personality that began with Marius and Sulla and ended in a series of civil wars. This period of civil strife lasted, intermittently, for about a century until the start of the Principate or Empire, when Augustus changed the rules by designating himself absolute ruler as <italic>princeps</italic> or ‘first citizen’, retaining only the shell of Republican institutions, including the Magistracies and Senate. This rule by a single individual was accepted at first because, weary of civil strife, most Romans were grateful for peace, security, and prosperity. Consequently, the transition from Augustus to Tiberius was smooth, as was the acceptance of emperors of the Julio-Claudian line until 68–69, the year of four emperors, since there were no blood successors of Nero. Woolf points out that the Romans were quite willing to abridge their freedom for the wealth which came pouring in as tributes from the Provinces. The economy became more and more dependent on slavery as the rural population drifted into the city where ‘bread and circuses’ were able to keep the restive citizens quiet.</p>
<p>Woolf’s erudition is extraordinary. He is at ease comparing Rome to other empires in Persia, China, India, and the Americas, and is aware of the many mitigating factors, including plague, climate change, and the impact of religion. He points out that Rome, in many ways, was an accidental empire that allowed some latitude to local government but created animosity by its ‘tribute’ or tax policy. This became so oppressive that regions on the margin accepted foreign invaders when the Empire began to collapse.</p>
<p>The City of Rome in its ‘high and palmy state’ had over a million inhabitants and acted as a magnet for unregulated immigration from all parts of the Empire. But by the fourth century the population had declined, with the center of Empire transferred by Constantine to the ‘new Rome’, Constantinople, when the west was absorbed by the German barbarians. The Roman Empire became the Greek Byzantine Empire that lasted for another 1000 years, though under constant pressure from the rise of Islam in the seventh century. Rome, however, became the center of the papacy, a new kind of empire, which many consider at least as pervasive as its predecessor.</p>
<p>Woolf demonstrates that the remains of buildings and monuments, as skeletons that can be fleshed out to give a clearer picture, can give us a more nuanced view of Roman civilization, showing that from the third century there was an exodus from the cities to lavish country estates, causing the break-up of the effective bureaucracy and the unwillingness of citizens to accept civic responsibilities in their communities. The idea of Rome as the ‘Eternal City’ persists, and we remain fascinated by a political entity that was adaptable and managed to survive for such a long time. America, too, can learn from Rome’s history, and Woolf’s synthesis is a good place to start.</p>
