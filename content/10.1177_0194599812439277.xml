<sec id="section4-0194599812439277">
<title>Subjects and Methods</title>
<p>From March 2007 to September 2010, a retrospective review was performed of 490 patients with PTMC who underwent total thyroidectomy and central lymph node dissection with or without lateral cervical lymph node dissection. The clinicopathologic results were reviewed, and the incidence and patterns of lateral cervical lymph node metastasis were analyzed.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0194599812439277">
<title>Results</title>
<p>The overall frequency of central and lateral LNM was 39.6% and 3.0%, respectively. The incidence of lateral lymph node metastasis in level IIa, III, IV, Vb, IIb, and Va was 46.7%, 53.3%, 73.3%, 6.7%, 6.7%, and 20.0%, respectively. Lateral LNM without central LNM was observed in 3 (0.6%) cases of PTMC. A multivariate analysis revealed that the predictive factors for the presence of lateral lymph node metastasis are male sex, increased tumor size, T4 stage, and pathologic central lymph node metastasis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0194599812439277">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Although lateral LNM was rare, the surgeon should perform thorough preoperative studies to look for lateral LNM in cases of PTMC if the patient is male, has a relatively larger tumor size, and has aggressive mass and also to look for the possibility of skip metastasis. Lymph node metastasis involving the spinal accessory chain (IIb) was not that rare, and careful level IIb lymph node dissection should be considered for patients who will undergo a modified radical neck dissection for lateral LNM.</p>

<p>The metastasis of papillary thyroid carcinoma into lymph nodes is common.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599812439277">1</xref></sup> The presence of lymph node metastasis can affect local tumor recurrence and patient survival rate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599812439277">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599812439277"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599812439277"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0194599812439277">5</xref></sup> Systematic dissection to remove lymph nodes with metastasis has been shown to increase the patient survival rate and reduce disease recurrence.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599812439277">3</xref></sup> But disputes are still being made regarding the importance of lymph node metastasis in papillary thyroid carcinoma and on the extent of lymph node dissection needed. Recently, the occurrence of papillary thyroid microcarcinoma is increasing, and lymph node metastasis of papillary thyroid microcarcinoma has been known to show findings without revealing many differences from the papillary thyroid carcinoma of more than 1 cm. Lymph node metastasis of papillary thyroid microcarcinoma has been reported to have no effect on patient survival rate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0194599812439277">6</xref></sup> and to have effects on the recurrence of the disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0194599812439277">7</xref></sup> Although protocols have been newly established that indicate the surgical extent needed to adequately manage papillary thyroid microcarcinoma and for prophylactic central lymph node dissection,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0194599812439277">8</xref></sup> many disputes are still made regarding the extent of lymph node dissection. The present study aimed to investigate the frequency and pattern of central and lateral cervical lymph node metastasis from papillary thyroid microcarcinoma.</p>
<sec id="section7-0194599812439277" sec-type="materials|methods">
<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<p>The surgical department of the present hospital saw 542 patients with papillary thyroid microcarcinoma between March 2007 and September 2010. A retrospective investigation of the clinical and pathological elements was performed on the 490 patients who received total thyroidectomy. This study was approved by the institutional review board at Ulsan University Hospital. The 52 patients who received completion thyroidectomy for a previous thyroid operation were excluded. Ultrasonography was performed on all patients before the surgery. An ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration (FNA) was performed in patients who were found to have lymph node suspicious for the presence of metastasis by the radiologist. The criteria for suspicious lymph node metastasis were lymph node diameter of 1.0 cm or more, a hypoechoic pattern, irregular cystic appearance, internal calcification, and a rounded shape with increased anteroposterior diameter. Thirty-four patients (6.94%) underwent FNA of the lateral cervical lymph nodes based on the ultrasound result. Total thyroidectomy and central cervical lymph node dissection were performed on all patients. Patients who were found to have lateral cervical lymph node suspicious for metastasis either from the ultrasound done before the surgery or from ultrasound-guided FNA underwent total thyroidectomy with modified radical cervical dissection. The dissected lymph nodes were classified by the surgeon in accordance with the classification method suggested by the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0194599812439277">9</xref></sup> for biopsy. The metastasis in each dissected part was confirmed histologically. Clinicopathologic characteristics, including the patient’s age and sex, multiplicity of the disease, tumor size, extrathyroid extension, lymphovascular invasion, presence of perineural invasions, number of lymph nodes with metastasis, and stage were investigated.</p>
<p>Statistical analyses were performed by using SPSS 18.0. A χ<sup>2</sup> test, Mann-Whitney test, and logistic regression analyses were used for the analysis of the variables related to the lymph node metastasis. A <italic>P</italic> value of less than .05 was regarded as a statistically significant result.</p>

<sec id="section8-0194599812439277" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>Among the total of 490 patients, 62 were men and 428 were women. The mean age was 45 years (range, 20-78 years). The mean size of the tumor was 6.56 mm (range, 2-10 mm). Multiplicity of the tumor was seen in 140 patients (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0194599812439277"><bold>Table 1</bold></xref>). Extrathyroid extension by the tumor was present in 256 cases. One hundred five cases revealed lymphovascular invasion, and 35 cases had perineural invasion. The results of the FNA were reactive hyperplasia in 21 cases, lymph node metastasis in 9, and atypia in 4. Among the 21 patients who had reactive hyperplasia, 2 patients underwent lateral neck dissection because of high suspicion of lymph node metastasis, of which 1 patient was confirmed to have lymph node metastasis on the permanent biopsy result. Among the 4 patients with atypia on FNA, 3 patients had confirmed lateral neck lymph node metastasis after operation. Three patients performed lateral neck lymph node dissection without preoperative FNA, and 2 had confirmed lateral neck lymph node metastasis.</p>

<p>The surgical extent included total thyroidectomy and central cervical lymph node dissections in 472 cases, and additional lateral cervical lymph node dissection was performed in 18 cases. In 21 patients with T4a, the more extensive surgical excision was performed. There was invasion of the recurrent laryngeal nerve in 8 patients. The nerve was cut and reinnervated. In 1 patient, there was partial invasion of the esophageal outer muscle, and the longitudinal muscle was partially resected. There was partial invasion of the inferior pharyngeal constrictor muscle in 13 patients, and the muscle was partially resected.</p>
<p>Among the total of 490 patients, 209 were found to have cervical lymph node metastasis, resulting in a 42.7% rate of positive lymph node metastasis. Central cervical lymph node metastasis was observed in 206 cases (42%). Among the 18 cases who received lateral cervical lymph node dissection, 15 (3.1%) had lymph node metastasis. Of these, 12 had both central cervical and lateral cervical lymph node metastasis, and the rest (3 cases) had skip metastasis, in which the lateral cervical lymph node had metastasis while the central cervical lymph nodes had no metastasis (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0194599812439277"><bold>Table 2</bold></xref>). A comparison of metastasized lymph node numbers of lateral cervical lymph node metastasis between patients having lateral cervical lymph node metastasis without central cervical lymph node metastasis and patients having central cervical lymph node metastasis resulted in 1.00 ± 0.00 and 5.08 ± 3.43, respectively. Although the result did not show a statistically significant difference between the 2 groups, the number of lateral cervical lymph node metastases was smaller in patients with skip metastasis.</p>

<p>Among the patients with skip metastasis, 2 had lower jugular vein lymph node metastasis and 1 had posterior triangle lymph node metastasis. Metastasis involving the upper (level IIA), middle (level III), and lower (level IV) jugular lymph node were observed in 7 cases (46.7%), 8 cases (53.3%), and 11 cases (73.3%), respectively. Transverse cervical lymph node metastasis (level VB) was observed in 1 case (6.7%). Upper spinal accessory lymph node (level IIB) and lower spinal accessory lymph node (level VA) metastasis were observed in 3 cases (20%) and 1 case (6.7%), respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0194599812439277"><bold>Figure 1</bold></xref>). When the clinicopathologic characteristics of the 15 patients with lateral cervical lymph node metastasis were reviewed, we found that lateral cervical lymph node metastasis was observed in 8.1% of male patients compared with 2.3% of female patients. The difference was statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> = .030). With the increase in tumor size, the lateral cervical lymph node metastasis was prevalent with the increase of tumor numbers.</p>

<p>Cases having lymphovascular invasion or perineural invasion showed presence of lateral cervical lymph node metastasis. Cases with T4a stage had more frequent lateral cervical lymph node metastasis (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001). The presence of lateral cervical lymph node metastasis was more frequently observed with increasing number of central cervical lymph nodes with metastasis. No relationship was seen between the patient’s age or perithyroidal extension with the presence of lateral cervical lymph node metastasis (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0194599812439277"><bold>Table 3</bold></xref>). Multivariate analyses were performed to determine any relationship between the independent variables with the presence of lateral lymph node metastasis. The results indicated that lateral cervical lymph node metastasis was more frequently observed in male patients, larger tumor size, T4 stage, and pathologic central lymph node metastasis. The results were statistically significant (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0194599812439277"><bold>Table 4</bold></xref>). The Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test appears significant with a probability of .935. The estimated statistical model seems appropriate.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>With the recent developments in ultrasonography, impalpable small-sized papillary thyroid microcarcinomas have been frequently detected. Papillary thyroid carcinoma measuring less than 1 cm in size is defined as papillary thyroid microcarcinoma.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0194599812439277">10</xref></sup> Many disputes are still made regarding the surgical extent of dissection and the lymph node dissection in cases of papillary thyroid microcarcinoma. The causes of such disputes are based on reports that the prognoses of patients affected with papillary thyroid microcarcinoma were not affected by the surgical extent, that papillary thyroid microcarcinoma tumor size did not change after continuous monitoring without surgical treatment, and that metastasis into surrounding lymph nodes is rare among patients with papillary thyroid microcarcinoma.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0194599812439277">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0194599812439277">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>Therefore, according to the recent American Thyroid Association (ATA) guideline, the surgical extent for managing papillary thyroid microcarcinoma has been reduced along with the reduction in the extent of lymph node dissection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0194599812439277">8</xref></sup> The incidence of lymph node metastasis in cases of papillary thyroid microcarcinoma is different, with reports of central cervical lymph node metastasis ranging from 32% to 64.1%,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0194599812439277">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0194599812439277">13</xref></sup> and from 3.7% to 44.5% for lateral cervical lymph node metastasis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0194599812439277">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0194599812439277">14</xref></sup> The presence of lymph node metastasis has been reported to increase the risk of disease recurrence.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0194599812439277">15</xref></sup> The rates of central cervical lymph node metastasis and lateral cervical lymph node metastasis in patients with papillary thyroid microcarcinoma who were operated on at the present hospital were 39.6% and 3.0%, respectively. The performance of lateral cervical lymph node dissection was relatively low because the surgery was performed only after the patients were found to have suspicious findings on ultrasonography before the surgery. Although lateral cervical lymph node metastasis has been known to occur after a positive central lymph node metastasis in most cases, the occurrence of lateral cervical lymph node metastasis without the central cervical lymph node being affected (skip metastasis) has been reported.</p>
<p>The present study found 3 cases of direct lateral cervical lymph node metastasis without the presence of a central cervical lymph node metastasis. The fewer lymph nodes showing metastasis in the lateral cervical region corresponded with other reports.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0194599812439277">16</xref></sup> The lymph node metastasis pattern among the patients showing skip metastasis were metastasis into the lower jugular vein lymph nodes in 2 cases and into the posterior triangle lymph node in 1 case, all of which involved the lower compartment of the neck. Since lymph nodes in the lower compartment of the neck can have metastasis even without central cervical lymph node involvement, the presence of lateral cervical lymph node metastasis should be fully examined by ultrasonography before surgery even if patients were found to have no central cervical lymph node metastasis.</p>
<p>The lateral cervical lymph node metastasis was found to frequently involve the lower, middle, and upper jugular vein lymph nodes, in that order, and metastasis was also observed in the upper spinal accessory lymph nodes. This pattern of metastasis was similar to cases with papillary thyroid carcinoma.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0194599812439277">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0194599812439277"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0194599812439277"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0194599812439277">20</xref></sup> Although metastasis into the upper spinal accessory lymph node is relatively small compared with jugular vein lymph node metastasis, the extent of the dissection should include the upper spinal accessory lymph nodes if lymph node metastasis is suspected during the surgery. If it is not fully dissected and results in recurrence of the disease, the reoperation and adequate lymph node dissection will be more difficult because of the adhesions from the previous surgery. Damage to the spinal accessory nerve is also more likely when reoperation is attempted. Therefore, enough lymph node dissection has to be performed from the outset when lymph node metastasis is suspected after thorough examinations before the surgery and when lymph node metastasis is suspected during the surgery.</p>
<p>Male patients, increased tumor size, T4 stage, and pathologic central lymph node metastasis can increase the chances of lateral cervical lymph node metastasis, as in previous reports.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599812439277">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0194599812439277">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0194599812439277">21</xref></sup> The univariate and multivariate analyses showed that the primary tumor size is a significant factor associated with lateral lymph node metastases. The average tumor size difference between the 2 groups is 1.5 mm. It may be hard to use this figure in the clinical setting, however. Moreover, even if the size is small, more invasive cancers tend to have more lymph node metastasis. Since all of these tumor characteristics can be confirmed in the pathological findings only after a surgery, it may be quite difficult to know these data before surgery. Therefore, careful ultrasonographic examination has to be made before the surgery to confirm the presence of lateral cervical lymph node metastasis and to decide on the extent of the surgery.</p>
<p>No disease recurrence has been documented up to the time this article was written. However, the follow-up periods were too short to adequately evaluate for recurrence. This study was limited by the fact that ultrasound was the only tool employed to evaluate for lateral lymph node metastasis. The incidence of lateral lymph node metastasis in this study was low compared with that of a previous study. In addition to ultrasound, computed tomography and thyroglobulin measurement in the washout can improve the diagnostic accuracy of identifying lateral neck lymph node metastasis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0194599812439277">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0194599812439277">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>There were 2 complications when modified radical neck dissection was done: chylous fistula and seroma. Modified radical neck dissection should be done when there is good justification because more dissection comes with more morbidity.</p>
<p>Since the survival rate for patients undergoing surgery to remove a papillary thyroid microcarcinoma is quite high, the most important issue for patients is to avoid having repeated surgeries. A precise determination of the extent of the first operation will reduce the chances of reoperation due to disease recurrences.</p>
