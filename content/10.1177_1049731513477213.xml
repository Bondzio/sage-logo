<p>The need for statistical analysis in single-subject designs presents a challenge, as analytical methods that are applied to group comparison studies are often not appropriate in single-subject research. <italic>SSD for R</italic> is a robust set of statistical functions with wide applicability to single-subject research. It is a comprehensive package of statistical tests and produces accompanying graphs for almost every function. These include, among others, tests of autocorrelation, <italic>t</italic>-tests, effect sizes, median and celeration χ<sup>2</sup> analyses, and control charts. All functions and graphs are described in a series of tables. Since <italic>SSD for R</italic> is open source, it is freely available and can be accessed on the authors’ website, www.ssdanalysis.com. Additional support, including video tutorials and sample data are also available at no charge.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Single-subject research designs, also referred to as single-case evaluations or <italic>n</italic> = 1 designs, are unique in the realm of research designs as they can serve dual purposes. Often, these evaluations are not designed, at least initially, as research studies, but as a method for social workers to assess their own practices. The notion of social workers evaluating their practices has historically been supported by the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1049731513477213">National Association of Social Workers (NASW) Code of Ethics (NASW, 2008)</xref>. More recently, the Council on Social Work Education’s Educational Policy and Accreditation Standards has promoted engaging in research-informed practice and practice-informed research as one of the 10 core social work competencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1049731513477213">Council on Social Work Education (CSWE), 2008</xref>). The Council has also promoted using data for the purposes of monitoring client progress and evaluating the effectiveness of interventions (CSWE, 2008; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1049731513477213">Rubin &amp; Babbie, 2013</xref>). Therefore, single-subject research is moving in the direction of being used within the social work profession from being primarily evaluative of individual practice to also include publishable research (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1049731513477213">Bernad-Ripoll, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1049731513477213">Burke, Kuhn, &amp; Peterson, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1049731513477213">Kazi &amp; Wilson, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1049731513477213">Schudrich, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Analysis of single-subject research typically occurs on two levels: Visually and statistically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1049731513477213">Mattaini, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1049731513477213">Rubin &amp; Babbie, 2011</xref>). Visual analysis of data is the most commonly used approach, particularly in practice evaluation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1049731513477213">Kazdin, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1049731513477213">Orme &amp; Combs-Orme, 2012</xref>); however, there are situations in which visual analysis alone may not be sufficient. For example, supplemental statistical analysis may be valuable if the effects are small; the variation is large; the effects of the intervention do not appear immediately as phases change there is no clear trend in the data within phases; or when there may be an issue of autocorrelation, which is nearly impossible to detect through visual inspection alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1049731513477213">Kazdin, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1049731513477213">Thyer &amp; Myers, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>As the evidence-based practice movement builds in the social sciences, there is increasing opportunity to include practice-informed research in evaluating the effectiveness of interventions. Therefore, strong research design and statistical analysis are necessary to determine whether an intervention has a causal relationship with outcome measures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1049731513477213">Higgins &amp; Green, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1049731513477213">Kratochwill et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1049731513477213">Nugent, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The need for statistical analysis in single-subject designs, however, presents a challenge, as analytical methods that are applied to group comparison studies are not appropriate in single-subject research. This is due to the fact that single-subject research typically compares measured outcome/outcomes over time under varying conditions, but across the same client unit (e.g., individual, family, or group). Therefore, it is often appropriate to apply different statistical procedures and analysis in single-subject designs than in group comparisons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1049731513477213">Kratochwill et al., 2010</xref>). These consist of both parametric and nonparametric methods including analysis of autocorrelation, effect size, regression methods, standard deviation band analysis, conservative dual criteria analysis, and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1049731513477213">Bloom, Fischer, &amp; Orme, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1049731513477213">Fisher, Kelley, &amp; Lomas, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1049731513477213">Kratochwill et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1049731513477213">Nugent, 2009</xref>). Some of these methods are capable of supporting both statistical and visual analysis.</p>
<p>Until now, there has been little in the way of software to help those interested in conducting single-subject research collect, analyze, and interpret their data. While not explicitly shared in published research, many authors appear to use Excel to plot simple line graphs of their data. SINGWIN was the first software package developed by Auerbach, Schnall, and Heft LaPorte in 1999 specifically for the analysis of single-system data in the social sciences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1049731513477213">Auerbach, Schnall, &amp; Heft-LaPorte, 2009</xref>). SINGWIN was originally developed for educational purposes in order to make the visual and statistical analysis of practice data available to students. It includes <italic>t</italic>-tests and χ<sup>2</sup> tests, among other statistical procedures, and graphs that are written specifically for this type of data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049731513477213">Conboy, Auerbach, Beckerman, Schnall, &amp; LaPorte, 2000</xref>). As such, the package has some limitations: Data entry is limited to a single behavior, group data cannot be analyzed, it works only in a Windows environment, and most procedures are limited to A–B designs. Despite these limitations, SINGWIN has been effectively used in published research studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1049731513477213">Cole, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1049731513477213">Schudrich, 2012</xref>), and SINGWIN has been promoted as an effective tool for analyzing data in single-subject research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1049731513477213">Fisher et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1049731513477213">Jindani &amp; Newman, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1049731513477213">Rock &amp; Cooper, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Because of the limitations of SINGWIN, a new software application has been developed in R, a statistical programming language, to analyze single-subject data in the social sciences. While not designed to replace SINGWIN, this new application, named <italic>SSD for R</italic>, has advanced capabilities that may make it more suitable for advanced, publishable research in agency or other settings. These include comprehensive visual and statistical functions for cases that could be considered “single-subject,” whether those cases include individuals, couples, families, groups, or communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1049731513477213">Auerbach &amp; Zeitlin Schudrich, 2012</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section2-1049731513477213">
<title>SSD for R</title>
<p>
<italic>SSD for R</italic> does not have the limitations found in SINGWIN. It is a set of functions written in R for the analysis of single-system design data. R is open source (free of charge) and is compatible with Windows, OSX, Linux, and other UNIX variants. R is similar to S, a program developed at Bell Laboratories by John Chambers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1049731513477213">The R Project for Statistical Computing, n.d.</xref>). It is a programming language for statistical analysis and graphics, which features:</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>an effective data handling and storage facility,</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>a suite of operators for calculations on arrays, in particular matrices,</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>a large, coherent, and integrated collection of intermediate tools for data analysis,</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>graphical facilities for data analysis and display either on-screen or on hardcopy, and</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>a well-developed, simple, and effective programming language, which includes conditional, loops, user-defined recursive functions, and input and output facilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1049731513477213">The R Project for Statistical Computing, n.d.</xref>, paragraph 5).</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>In other words, R provides an environment where statistical techniques can be implemented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1049731513477213">The R Project for Statistical Computing, n.d.</xref>). R’s capabilities can be extended through the development of functions and packages. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1049731513477213">Weisberg and Fox (2010</xref>, p. xiii) state, “one of the great strengths of R is that it allows users and experts in particular areas of statistics to add new capabilities to the software.” <italic>SSD for R</italic> is a set of functions that extends the capacity of R to analyze single-system data. Because <italic>SSD for R</italic> interfaces with Excel, the user can enter multiple dependent (i.e., the behaviors under study) and independent (i.e., baseline/intervention phases) variables. Furthermore, users can analyze any number of phases as well as employ any number of research designs such as A-B, A-B-A, A-B-A-B, B-A-B. There are also procedures for analyzing group data and for the analysis of task-completed data.</p>
<p>As the needs of the single-subject research community grow, it is the authors’ intention to provide comprehensive materials to bolster the usability of the <italic>SSD for R</italic> functions. This will include additional functionality as the need arises and complete documentation, including help files.</p>
<sec id="section3-1049731513477213">
<title>Entering Data</title>
<p>One of the simplest ways to bring client data into <italic>SSD for R</italic> for analysis is by entering it into Excel and then importing it into <italic>SSD for R</italic>. A separate Excel file is needed for each client/group; however, multiple behaviors for each client/group can be tracked in a single Excel file. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1049731513477213">Figure 1</xref> displays an example.</p>

</fig>
<p>Notice that the first row (labeled 1), displays the name of the dependent variables across the columns beginning with column A. For each dependent variable, a phase variable needs to be created that indicates in which phase the measurement occurred. For example, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1049731513477213">Figure 1</xref> displays two dependent variables for a hypothetical client. These variables are called yell and cry. We then created associated phase variables that we called pyell and pcry. In these phase variables, “A”s and “B”s were entered for each observation of the dependent variable to denote in which phase the observation was made. Separate phase variables need to be created for each dependent variable being measured as phase lengths can differ for each dependent variable. Also notice that for “cry,” a third phase, labeled B1 in Excel, was added to denote an enhancement of the original B, or intervention, phase.</p>
<p>Beginning in row 2, data are entered for each time the behavior is measured. Phase changes are marked with “NA” in the behavior and phase variables. Data entry Excel files need to be saved as comma-delimited files. An <italic>SSD for R</italic> function, <bold>Getcsv()</bold>, is used for importing data into <italic>SSD for R</italic> that was created in Excel.</p>

<p>In accordance with accepted statistical analysis of single-system data, the phases should be tested for autocorrelation using the ABrf2 function before testing for statistical differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1049731513477213">Bloom et al., 2009</xref>).

As an example, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1049731513477213">Figure 3</xref> shows output for the <bold>ABrf2</bold> function for our hypothetical client’s yelling behavior. From this output, we see that the autocorrelation is low and not significant in either phase (<italic>r<sub>f</sub>
</italic>
<sub>2</sub> = −0.57 for the baseline and <italic>r<sub>f</sub>
</italic>
<sub>2</sub> = −0.23 for the intervention, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .05 for both phases).</p>

</fig>
<p>Before deciding how to statistically analyze our client’s yelling behavior between phases, it is helpful to determine whether there is a trend in one or more of the phases. This can be accomplished using the <bold>ABregres</bold> function in <italic>SSD for R</italic>. The visual output for this is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1049731513477213">Figure 4</xref>.</p>

</caption>
<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1049731513477213-fig4.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>We can see from this output that there is no trend in either the baseline or the intervention, and statistical output from this function indicates that the slope for the baseline is −0.02 (<italic>p</italic> &gt; .05) and is −.04 for the intervention (<italic>p</italic> &gt; .05).</p>
<p>Since there is no issue of autocorrelation and there is no trend in either phase, we can compare yelling behavior across phases by using a <italic>t</italic>-test, which is accomplished in <italic>SSD for R</italic> with the function <bold>ABttest</bold>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1049731513477213">Figure 5</xref> shows output from this function.</p>

<title>Group Data Analysis Example</title>
<p>A major addition in <italic>SSD for R</italic> is the abilty to analyze group data. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1049731513477213">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1049731513477213">7</xref> display an analysis of group cohesion over 8 weeks for eight different group members. The data come from an example found in <italic>Evaluating practice: Guidelines for the accountable professional</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1049731513477213">Bloom et al., 2009</xref>). The boxplot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1049731513477213">Figure 6</xref> is generated automatically when the <bold>ABdescrip</bold> function is used. It displays the degree of variation in cohesion between group members with the last week showing the lowest degree of difference between group members. Additionally, descriptive statistics for each week is provided. As displayed in Figure7, group data can also be analyzed between phases. In this case, an above median χ<sup>2</sup> analysis was completed to discern whether group cohesion improved between phases. Although not significant (<italic>p</italic> = .055), 71% (28 of 39) of scores above the baseline median level of cohesion occurred during the intervention. When appropriate, regression, <italic>t</italic>-tests, median line analysis, and celeration line analysis can also be conducted on group data.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>
<italic>SSD for R</italic> is a robust set of statistical functions with wide applicability to single-subject research. Since it is open source, it is freely available and can be accessed on the authors’ website, www.ssdanalysis.com.</p>
<p>This website contains links to download R and RStudio, a graphical user interface that enables simultaneous viewing of statistical and graphical output. The website also contains numerous videos that provide tutorial support for the use of <italic>SSD for R</italic> functions, a method for registering to keep up-to-date with improvements to the website and functions, additional supporting documentation, and comprehensive examples for each function.</p>
<p>It is the authors’ hope that <italic>SSD for R</italic> will enable social work practitioners and researchers to conduct more advanced and rigorous forms of single-subject research. As the field of practice-based social work research grows, it is the authors’ intention to dynamically improve and adapt <italic>SSD for R</italic> to meet the needs of the research community.</p>
