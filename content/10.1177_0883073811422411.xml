<abstract>
<p>There are few dedicated pediatric neurophysiology services in Africa. Optimizing the efficiency of these units is essential for the large populations they serve. Two hundred eighty-seven electroencephalogram (EEG) studies, performed in a sub-Saharan neurophysiology unit, were analyzed for referral sources, appropriateness of referral, reporting consistency, and use in confirming epilepsy or a neurologic process. Pediatric neurologists requested 24% of the electroencephalogram studies and pediatricians 45%. Pediatric neurologists requested more appropriate referrals than pediatricians or nonspecialists. The electroencephalogram studies assisted management in 40% of cases. Electroencephalogram studies for nonepileptic indications, such as syncope, were highly predictable and typically normal. Education and training in the management of children with epilepsy could improve requesting practice and the subsequent usefulness of electroencephalograms in the diagnosis of epilepsy syndromes. This is especially important in the context of a resource-poor country.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Hans Berger was the first to recognize the use of brain wave frequencies as a clinical tool in 1929.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0883073811422411">1</xref>
</sup> Electroencephalograms have since been used for assessment of epilepsy.</p>
<p>Types of electroencephalogram abnormalities are established for many childhood epilepsy syndromes.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0883073811422411">2</xref>
</sup> However, existing management guidelines for the use of electroencephalograms often fail to include the pediatric age groups.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0883073811422411">3</xref>
</sup> There are no studies from sub-Saharan Africa that analyze the usefulness of and problems related to pediatric electroencephalogram testing.</p>
<p>The neurophysiology unit at the Red Cross War Memorial Children’s Hospital is the only dedicated pediatric service in Southern Africa. More than 1000 electroencephalogram studies are performed annually. The electroencephalogram studies performed by this unit are representative of the spectrum of neurophysiology findings in children with epilepsy from the Western Cape and surrounding provinces.</p>
<p>The provision of adequate clinical information on the request form is important to assist the interpretation of studies. A study of 500 electroencephalogram studies demonstrated that correct prediction was possible in 81% of routine studies based on request form data.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0883073811422411">4</xref>
</sup> Deficiencies in this process are recognized<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0883073811422411">5</xref>
</sup> and standard guidelines often fail to be addressed in pediatric practice.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0883073811422411">3</xref>
</sup> This was illustrated in an audit of guidelines in the United Kingdom, aimed at attaining optimal request form information, where no specific change in clinical referral patterns were found before or after the guidelines were introduced.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0883073811422411">6</xref>

</p>
<p>This pilot study delineates the range of neurophysiologic abnormalities in a pediatric population and examines referral patterns. The aims of the study were as follows:<list list-type="order">

<title>Methods</title>
<p>Consecutive patients (in- and outpatients) undergoing electroencephalograms from March 2009 to May 2009 were reviewed in a prospective observational study. All electroencephalogram studies were performed using electrode placements according to the 10/20 system (bipolar and neonatal montages). The recordings were performed in the awake, natural sleep, and sedated state. All awake recordings lasted for 15 minutes with two eye opening and closing maneuvers, 3-minute hyperventilation and 2-minute posthyperventilation followed by intermittent photic stimulation ranging from 3 to 33 Hz at 5-second intervals. Natural and sedated sleeps were recorded for 30 minutes ideally into slow-wave sleep. Patients were excluded if there was insufficient clinical data or excessive artifact. Repeat studies were documented. These were performed either following a normal awake study, when a sleep study was indicated, or as a part of a follow-up assessment.</p>
<p>Electroencephalogram findings were reviewed independently by two readers (a senior clinical neurophysiology technologist and a pediatric neurologist). The readers were given the age and mental state of the child prior to reporting the electroencephalogram.</p>
<p>The guideline for electroencephalogram studies by the National Institute of Clinical Excellence<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0883073811422411">7</xref>
</sup> formed part of the template for the data collection. A structured questionnaire to score the electroencephalogram activity was used. This included documenting background rhythms, activation procedures (hyperventilation and intermittent photic stimulation), sleep activity, normal variants, abnormal activity (spike and wave activity or slowing focal or generalized), and suppression (burst or generalized). The overall electroencephalogram findings were noted as normal or abnormal and were compared using the Cohen kappa statistic.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0883073811422411">8</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>The analyses of the electroencephalogram studies were performed independently. The findings were compared and key electroencephalogram features documented.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0883073811422411">2</xref>
</sup> In the final discussion, firm conclusions were drawn as to likely diagnosis of epilepsy based on the electroencephalogram alone and the rate of variance in findings analyzed.</p>
<p>The clinical data were documented from the medical records by a separate individual who recorded the patient demographics, including the age of onset of seizures, area of abode, reason for referral, type of seizure, suspected diagnosis, and treatment.</p>
<p>The data from the electroencephalogram and the clinical findings were categorized into subgroups A to F (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0883073811422411">Table 1</xref>
). The results from categories A to D were considered useful to the patient management, whereas categories E and F did not add to the management of the patients.</p>

<p>The usefulness of the electroencephalogram in isolation, in suggesting a specific epilepsy diagnosis, was compared with the diagnostic conclusions once the clinical information was available.</p>
<p>The spectrum of diagnostic categories of patients with epilepsy was documented to provide data on the epidemiology of types of epilepsy referred to our center. Diagnostic categories followed those listed by the International League Against Epilepsy.<sup>

<p>The normal electroencephalogram studies were reviewed to ascertain whether the clinical history provided consistent factors that would predict normal results.</p>
<sec id="section3-0883073811422411">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>The Shapiro Wilk test was used to determine whether data were normally distributed, and medians and ranges were presented where data were not normally distributed. Frequency distributions were reported. Agreement between raters was assessed using Cohen’s kappa statistic. Because the data were categorized as abnormal and normal, a weighted kappa was presented to account for the ordering of these categories. Agreement was deemed poor if kappa was &lt;.2, fair if between .21 and .40, moderate if between .41 and .60, good if between .61 and .80, and very good between .81 and 1.00. A <italic>P</italic> value less than .05 was used as the standard cutoff for statistical significance for all the analyses. All analyses were performed using Stat 11.1 (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX).</p>
<p>The decimal point was rounded up to attain the calculated percentages.</p>

<p>There were 32 (19 male, 13 female) repeat studies. The majority of the repeat studies (69%) were in the asleep state since the awake recordings were not helpful. Other repeat studies were performed where follow-up studies were indicated, such as for epileptic spasms.</p>
<p>The median age at the time of the referral was 4 years (range 12 days-16 years). Referral letters, or forms, were completed for 195 patients (68%). Bipolar montage was used in 204 (71%) and neonatal montage in the remainder. One hundred seventy-eight (62%) studies were performed awake, 81 (28%) in sedated sleep, 19 (7%) in natural sleep, and 9 (3%) patients had decreased level of consciousness. One hundred twenty-four electroencephalogram records were available on paper and 163 were digital.</p>
<p>Patients originated from the surrounding urban areas (87%), rural regions (9%), other provinces (3.5%), and as far afield as Harare (Zimbabwe, 0.3%).</p>
<p>Eighty-six percent of referrals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0883073811422411">Figure 2</xref>

<p>The electroencephalogram in isolation (without clinical information) confirmed a neurologic process in 114 studies (87 patients). Lack of clinical information meant that a diagnosis of epilepsy was possible in 61 patients from categories A, B1, B2, and C. When combining the clinical data with electroencephalogram results in the 114/287 (40%) studies, it was possible to draw more definite conclusions as regarding the presence of epilepsy, prior seizures, or status epilepticus (categories A, B1, B2, B3, B4, and C) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0883073811422411">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0883073811422411">2</xref>

) were normal (62%). Of these, 115 (67% of the normal group) had a history suggestive of epilepsy (Category E). The electroencephalogram did not alter patient management in this group. As part of standard practice, repeat studies were recommended but not undertaken during the time frame of the study. Fifty (29% of the normal group) were considered unlikely to have epilepsy based on the clinical history (Category D). The electroencephalogram was considered indicated as part of a clinical workup for problems such as aggressive outbursts, jerks in sleep, involuntary movements, and apneic spells. For Category D, the electroencephalogram was useful as a normal result supported the low likelihood of epilepsy in this group. Eight patients (5% of the normal group) had nonspecific clinical information not suggestive of epilepsy, and the indication for an electroencephalogram was unclear.</p>

<p>All patients considered who were unlikely to have epilepsy (17%) from the clinical description of their events had normal electroencephalograms. Although some of these referrals may not have required electroencephalogram studies, screening was often helpful as part of a broader workup in children for whom the diagnosis was not clear. This approach was supported in other studies.<sup>

<p>Electroencephalography is at risk of much abuse and overutilization.<sup>

</sup> A study addressing the use and misuse of electroencephalogram studies in 234 patients concluded that 26% of referrals were inappropriate based on the national UK guidelines.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0883073811422411">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0883073811422411">12</xref>
</sup> Another study of 600 patients found that the number of inappropriate studies was reduced when referrals were screened by a neurologist.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0883073811422411">13</xref>
</sup> This would not be practical in our setting given the number of referrals and staffing limitations.</p>
<p>Forty percent of patients with normal studies had clinical histories suggestive of epilepsy. Although the diagnosis of seizures and epilepsy is straightforward in some patients, it can also be one of the greatest clinical challenges especially in children.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0883073811422411">3</xref>
</sup> Electroencephalography should not be used in isolation to diagnose or exclude the condition.<sup>

</p>
<p>The challenges of consistent interpretation of scalp electroencephalogram are recognized.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0883073811422411">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0883073811422411"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0883073811422411">19</xref>
</sup> Two studies using three electroencephalographers each looked at interobserver reliability between complex partial seizures (temporal and extratemporal) and patients with childhood idiopathic epilepsy.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0883073811422411">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0883073811422411">20</xref>
</sup> The former had good to excellent levels of accuracy for temporal lobe compared with extra–temporal lobe complex partial seizures. The latter found an almost perfect agreement for ictal discharges and suboptimal for interictal discharges.</p>
<p>The reliability of the electroencephalogram report from a neurophysiology service is of importance for the patient and clinician but there is no criterion standard for training and interpretation of electroencephalogram studies.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0883073811422411">21</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>The majority of our patients were referred by the medical outpatient department, staffed by medical officers with pediatric experience but who are not necessarily qualified pediatricians.</p>
<p>At present, there are no clear guidelines to recommend referral of a patient for an electroencephalogram study. Previous studies suggested that use of guidelines for pediatricians in developed world settings have little impact on practice or outcomes.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0883073811422411">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0883073811422411">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0883073811422411">6</xref>
</sup> Ideally, effective guidelines should encourage comprehensive completion of existing referral forms and an adequate seizure description that would improve interpretation of the electroencephalogram. Our unit is in the process of extending our request form and providing training to as many of the referring clinicians as possible in the role of electrophysiology studies.</p>
<p>Reports based on the electroencephalogram study may include a description of the neurophysiologic finding only but are more useful if they address management implications to the child. Policy in our unit is to undertake the latter, specifically stating if an electroencephalogram is consistent with epilepsy, if a further study is recommended (repeat electroencephalogram or neuroimaging), and if referral to the neurology service is necessary. Referring clinicians are contacted directly in emergency situations such as status epilepticus or infantile studies and the neurology staff involved. For purposes of the study, 16% of the group were excluded because of artifact in the electrophysiology recording or insufficient clinical information. The studies with artifact were in nonurgent referrals, and repeat studies were recommended but undertaken outside the study time. The patients lacking sufficient clinical information were typically referred from other hospitals, often for urgent studies; bookings were made telephonically and reports should have accompanied the patient but in these cases did not. The policy of the unit is to be inclusive and it is exceptional for a request for an electroencephalogram study not to be undertaken even if, as illustrated, the technicians lack clinical information.</p>
<p>The geographic distribution of referrals in this study demonstrates that the majority of the patients came from local urban areas. The surrounding rural areas do not have an electroencephalogram service. Travel is expensive and the population is poor, so it is likely that many patients outside the metropole are not investigated when presenting with seizures. The referrals from other provinces and countries are due to the lack of access to comprehensive neurophysiology screening for children in these areas. The numbers of patients assessed from these areas are most probably underrepresented, and a greater proportion of children with epilepsy remain without investigation or management. This study illustrates the importance of access to a dedicated neurophysiology department and need for expansion of services. Evidence of the extent of this treatment gap was illustrated in rural Kenya where 89% of children with epilepsy were not receiving anticonvulsant drugs.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0883073811422411">15</xref>
</sup> The global treatment gap for resource-poor countries is estimated at 56%.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0883073811422411">22</xref>
</sup> Ideally children would be screened by a neurologist to identify relevant patients who would benefit from an electroencephalogram. However, child neurologists in Africa are as scarce a resource as pediatric electroencephalography services.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0883073811422411">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0883073811422411">24</xref>
</sup> For the population of 283 million in West Africa there are 118 neurologists, at a ratio of 1:2.4 million of the population. The majority of the neurologists work in major urban areas and teaching hospitals, and the rural areas are underserved. Currently, in 15 West African countries there are only 5 institutions with training capacity in adult neurology.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0883073811422411">23</xref>
</sup> It is not known whether training in pediatric neurology or neurophysiology is offered by these institutions.</p>
<p>There is a paucity of reported information on the burden, etiology, or type of epilepsy in children from resource-poor countries.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0883073811422411">25</xref>
</sup> Diagnostic neurophysiology services as described in this report serve a huge population and provide an important role in accurately diagnosing epilepsy.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0883073811422411">25</xref>
</sup> The significant treatment gap in the management of epilepsy is considered related to cost, manpower, cultural beliefs, and lack of access to anticonvulsant drugs.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0883073811422411">22</xref>
</sup> The additional issue of lack of access to neurophysiology assessments compounds these challenges further.</p>
