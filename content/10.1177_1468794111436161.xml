<p>While the subjectivity of informants’ lifeworlds is well-recognised, addressing anthropologists’ own subjectivity during the research process has historically proved more difficult. A growing body of work on the emotions’ role in fieldwork addresses this tension; <italic>Emotions in the Field</italic> is Davies and Spencer’s second edited collection on this topic (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1468794111436161">Spencer and Davies, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The editors advance the discussion by arguing that emotions, as cognitive phenomena, are open to empirical investigation in their impact on the fieldwork process; a recognition which potentiates an informative dialogue between anthropology and psychology. This volume aims to bridge the historically-embedded divide separating the two, demonstrating how qualitative research can be enriched through an engagement with both the emotional and psychological domains.</p>
<p>Psychology’s potential as a framework for engaging with researcher subjectivity is a central theme, with contributions exploring the impact of the anthropologist’s psychological state on research outcomes. While Davies shows how disoriented psychological states during field research can provide new perspectives, Cook asserts that recognising such disorientation as part of the fieldwork process facilitates researcher wellbeing and deepens field engagement. She compares becoming a Buddhist nun during fieldwork with becoming an anthropologist; her acceptance of difficult emotions as processual deepening her immersion in both her meditation practice and her research.</p>
<p>The concepts of psychological practice are also shown to offer new frames of interpretation: Crapanzano uses the meta-principle of ‘the Third’ to explain how researcher and informant jointly frame their interaction through a shared symbol or concept, while Lorimer employs the psychoanalytical concept of countertransference to show how she accessed a psychiatric patient’s inner subjectivity through observing her own fieldwork emotions. Both support the editors’ assertion of the inherent ‘relationality’ of the fieldwork process, with Lorimer’s hypothesis that such individual psychological states as depression are relational suggesting a mutually illuminating interdisciplinary engagement.</p>
<p>An important contribution of this volume is such demonstration of how field knowledge is mediated through the subjective fieldwork experience; its emotional impact transforming both the researcher and their research. In a moving account of his personal reactions to Israel’s bombing of the Lebanon, Hage observes how awareness of his ‘ethnographic vacillation’ between the emotional, analytical and political increased his understanding of both his research area and his field relationships. Hsu demonstrates the extent of researchers’ subjective, embodied fieldwork engagement in reflecting that her bodily response to the Tian’anmen massacre mirrored ‘the silent existent pressure on the social body’, its profound emotional impact deepening her informant relationships while ultimately necessitating those memories’ eclipse. In highlighting the impact of such emotionally-charged research, this volume will be particularly significant for the growing body of researchers working in politically turbulent regions.</p>
<p>Finally, the volume explores how forms of knowledge other than those conventionally framing qualitative research, such as ‘the bodily, emotional, or imaginal’ (Davies, this volume), can illuminate new areas, such as Hastrup’s realisation that landscape can structure both relationships and emotions through her embodied presence in the field. Consequent to such field immersion, contributors describe how they found themselves interpretively deploying informants’ ‘ways of knowing’ to understand unfamiliar experiences. Vivid accounts of such ‘raw moments’ (Hastrup, this volume) hint at academic epistemologies’ limitations in inscribing the experiential and non-cognitive aspects of informants’ lifeworlds, as when Luhrmann understands magic’s power by feeling it course through her body, igniting the batteries in her backpack.</p>
<p>Such interpretive use of local knowledge demonstrates how the shared space between informant and anthropologist casts new light on both realities, creating channels of mutual empathy and insight. As Jackson reports, managing field emotions by consulting Kuranko dream interpreters increased his field understanding in a way precluded by other coping strategies. Such recognition of field knowledge as the created, dialectical outcome of researcher-informant engagements temporarily stems the unidirectional researcher/researched power-flow lamented in Behar’s argument for an emotionally-engaged anthropology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1468794111436161">1996</xref>: 26).</p>
<p>Davies and Spencer ask important theoretical questions, inviting further research into the volume’s multiple strands. Its ethnographic richness demonstrates how attending to the emotional and psychological can profoundly affect researchers’ ability to understand and engage with informants, reinforcing the editors’ call to rethink anthropology’s engagement with these domains. This involves more than incorporating neglected sub-fields into a debate characterised by ‘tired binaries’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1468794111436161">Wilce, 2004</xref>: 2): it entails removing barriers to understanding by recognising these forms of knowledge as vital components of the qualitative research process. It would be particularly interesting to see a further extension of their arguments into the anthropology of conflict, and greater discussion of ethical considerations. In this volume’s relevance to wider research methodology, it is also worth considering how anthropological debates might be usefully shared across the qualitative research community. Thought-provoking, stimulating and at times moving, this volume will be a stimulating tonic for jaded researchers, while its personal insights into fieldwork’s daily realities render it a thoughtful volume for those about to embark on field research.</p>
