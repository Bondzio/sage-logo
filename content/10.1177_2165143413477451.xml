<abstract>
<p>This literature review examined publication patterns in the journal of <italic>Career Development and Transition for Exceptional Individuals</italic> across 35 years of publication. Overall, 732 contributors affiliated with 267 organizations were identified in our analysis of 436 articles. Frequency counts identified the most productive scholars in terms of number of articles authored and their institutional affiliation. Twenty-three individuals, predominately representing colleges and universities, contributed 6 or more articles. Findings reflect the collaborative nature of scholarship in career development and transition and an overall trend toward multiple authored publications. There is a need to engage or support individuals affiliated with local or state education agencies, vocational rehabilitation, and community rehabilitation programs, or individuals working outside of the United States in generating scholarship, as these groups were underrepresented in our findings. Suggestions for increasing authorship representation reflecting all transition stakeholders and the importance of collaboration in building the transition and career development knowledge base are discussed.</p>

<p>Historical accounts of progress toward improving community participation and economic self-sufficiency for youth with disabilities describe three distinct movements contributing to the evolution of the discipline known as career development and transition for youth with disabilities: (a) work study (1960s), (b) career education (1970s), and (c) the transition movement (1980s and 1990s; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2165143413477451">Browning, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2165143413477451">Halpern, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-2165143413477451">Szymanski &amp; Danek, 1985</xref>). The characteristics and discoveries defining these movements reflect the collective efforts of parents and families of individuals with disabilities, public policy makers, disability advocates, researchers, educators, rehabilitation professionals, and other human service providers.</p>
<p>The formation of the Division of Career Development (DCD), which was approved by the Council for Exceptional Children in 1976, represents the determination of scholars and practitioners to advance the discipline and improve the preparation of students with disabilities for life after high school. The pioneer members of DCD—including President Dr. Donn Brolin and Research Director Dr. Andrew Halpern—facilitated the development of the Division’s journal, <italic>Career Development and Transition for Exceptional Individuals</italic> (<italic>CDTEI</italic>), with the inaugural issue being published in April of 1978. The journal continues to serve as a forum for describing and evaluating the practices, policies, and research that have helped to advance the profession as well as drive systematic change in the delivery of services and supports for youth and young adults with disabilities.</p>
<p>It is widely recognized that the evolution of a profession depends on members of the profession working to refine and extend the body of knowledge that guides practice in that field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2165143413477451">Kraemer &amp; Lyons, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2165143413477451">Richter, Schlomer, Krieger, &amp; Siler, 2008</xref>). As such, scholarly publications in <italic>CDTEI</italic> have advanced the profession by disseminating knowledge that has influenced preservice training and continuing education for transition specialists, best practices in school and community settings, and advocacy efforts to ensure youth and young adults with disabilities receive appropriate supports during the transition process. Certainly, other journals in the fields of education, rehabilitation, and disability studies publish articles related to career development and transition for youth with disabilities, but <italic>CDTEI</italic> is the only major journal focused exclusively on career development and transition. The authors who have contributed articles to <italic>CDTEI</italic> during its 35 years of production have chronicled the history of the transition field, and it is important for prospective and practicing professionals in the field to understand the sources (i.e., authors and institutions) of articles that have shaped their recommended and emerging practices.</p>
<p>In addition to influencing the practice of transition and career development, publication in academic journals, such as <italic>CDTEI</italic>, serves other purposes for authors and institutions. In academia, authorship of professional publications brings increased recognition and scrutiny to one’s scholarly work and is necessary in advancing one’s career. Within the promotion and tenure process at colleges and universities, one measure of faculty productivity is often tied to the number of publications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2165143413477451">Boyer, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-2165143413477451">Toutkoushian, Porter, Danielson, &amp; Hollis, 2003</xref>). In some instances, the frequency of bibliographic citations by other researchers attributed to one’s scholarship is viewed as an indicator of academic accomplishment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2165143413477451">Jasco, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-2165143413477451">Peterson, Wang, &amp; Stanley, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Publications in academic journals also bring increased recognition and resources to authors and the institutions or organizations they represent. In national rankings of education programs, conducted by <italic>U.S. News and World Report</italic> and the Carnegie Foundation, publication productivity is a frequently used measure in program evaluation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2165143413477451">Clark, Warren, &amp; Au, 2007</xref>). Specific university academic departments or programs may receive funding, obtain faculty lines, and attract students based on the perceived quality and reported quantity of publications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2165143413477451">Bellini &amp; Rumrill, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>As publication quantity and quality are assessed during reappointment, tenure, promotion, and merit pay reviews, it is far more challenging to assess the broader significance of one’s work to the profession (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2165143413477451">Boyer, 1990</xref>). Because <italic>CDTEI</italic> is a leading journal in the area of transition-focused education, an historical analysis of authorship rates within the journal may provide evidence of the authors who have shaped the discipline and the practice of transition-focused education. College and university students in special education and related fields, practitioners, other researchers, and policy makers who want to understand the history of the transition field need to know which authors and which institutions have contributed to the only journal in our field that focuses singularly on career development and transition. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine publication patterns in <italic>CDTEI</italic> since the journal’s inception in 1978. The following section describes our empirical literature review approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2165143413477451">Rumrill, Cook, &amp; Wiley, 2011</xref>) in which we quantified and aggregated contributions to <italic>CDTEI</italic> by author and affiliation.</p>
<sec id="section1-2165143413477451" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>Complete bibliographic information for each article published between October 1978 and December 2012 in <italic>CDTEI</italic> was accessed electronically through WorldCat and entered into a Microsoft Excel (2010) database. The resulting database contained 581 citations, including articles reflecting empirical research, editorial comments, book reviews, research briefs, and sections of the journal titled “Reports,” “News From Washington,” “Perspectives,” “ERIC Notes,” “Personnel Preparation,” and “In Other Sources.”</p>
<p>Following the documentation of bibliographic information, a second review of each article was completed for the purpose of documenting: (a) institutional or agency affiliation for every author referenced in each article, (b) location of the author (U.S. based or outside of the United States), and (c) whether the article reflected empirical or nonempirical research. Then, bibliographic citations were arranged in alphabetical order by the lead author’s last name resulting in a grouping of publications by the same author. The “find and select” feature of Microsoft Excel (2010) was used to identify additional articles in which the author may have contributed as well as authors who contributed to publications but were not identified as lead authors for any article. Simple frequency counts were used to identify the number of authors (e.g., single or multiple authors) contributing to articles for every issue of the journal published from 1978 through December of 2012.</p>
<p>Our inclusion criteria for the study represented aspects of the article and authorship. Consistent with methods used in other analyses of publication productivity, articles containing three or fewer pages or representing special characteristics of the journal or specific issues were removed from the database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2165143413477451">Jones et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-2165143413477451">Smith et al., 2003</xref>). These included editorial comments, book reviews, research briefs, and sections of the journal titled “Reports,” “News From Washington,” “Perspectives,” “ERIC Notes,” “Personnel Preparation,” and “In Other Sources.” Following removal of these articles from the original database, 436 articles were used in our analyses. In reference to authorship, contributors with 6 or more articles were included in our analyses. We used these criteria due to the high number of authors who contributed to three or less articles and the fact that all authors regardless of authorship position were considered in our analyses.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-2165143413477451" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>During the 35 years of publication, our analysis identified 732 contributors to the 436 articles we reviewed. Contributors were affiliated with 267 organizations with more than two thirds (64.9%) of articles identifying an institution of higher education as their affiliation at the time of publication. There was less representation from authors affiliated with local education agencies (16.9%), community rehabilitation programs (5.6%), disability and advocacy organizations (5.2%), state departments of education (3.4%), public or private research organizations (2.2%), the federal/state vocational rehabilitation agency (1.5%), or federal government agencies (0.7%). The overwhelming majority of the 267 organizations represented U.S.-based institutions or organizations; internationally based institutions or organizations represented just 3.4% of all articles.</p>
<p>The publication productivity for all authors with six or more articles is reflected in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-2165143413477451">Table 1</xref>. Authors were ranked in order of productivity as measured by the total number of articles, regardless of authorship position. The authors per article column represents the mean number of authors for the author’s publications, which ranged from 1.8 to 5.1 authors. The range in frequency for first-authored publications is 1 to 6 and for single-author publications 0 to 4. For all of the 23 authors ranked, each had at least one institutional affiliation listed that represented a college or university, with colleges and universities identified as the most prevalent affiliation overall with 26 different institutions or organizations identified. The most prevalent institutional affiliations for ranked contributors included the University of Oregon (<italic>n</italic> = 4) and the University of Kansas (<italic>n</italic> = 3).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This article provides an examination of publication productivity based on the number of articles authored or coauthored within <italic>CDTEI</italic> from 1978 through December of 2012. In our analysis, the mean number of authors per article was used as a measure of collaboration. Much of the scholarship published by the authors in this journal represents collaborative work, which may speak to the interdisciplinary nature of the field. It might also suggest a potential relationship between publication productivity and collaboration. However, the mean number of authors is quite variable across the publication productivity of ranked authors.</p>
<p>Collaborative research is important not only because it relates to knowledge generation but also because the discipline evolves and responds to economic and social influences. University researchers, practitioners and service providers, individuals with disabilities, public policy makers, and others lend unique expertise and perspectives to the research process that are critical in addressing challenges in transition-service delivery and improving the postschool experiences of individuals with disabilities. The collaborative process also facilitates the transfer of knowledge across disciplines including the tacit knowledge one gains through the exchange of ideas and information during the research process.</p>
<p>Institutional affiliation of authors, although primarily limited to colleges and universities, was diverse and included authors representing 26 colleges and universities. As previously noted, the University of Oregon (<italic>n</italic> = 4) and the University of Kansas (<italic>n</italic> = 3) were most represented in authorship affiliation. Seven other institutions were each represented by at least two authors in our analysis. The number of researchers within a discipline and lines of inquiry related to an overarching topic such as career development and transition may also contribute to one’s publication productivity. The presence of colleagues with similar lines of inquiry at the same institution lends itself to opportunities for collaborative work that may extend one’s research program. The availability of institutional colleagues with similar interests provides opportunities to share ideas and to collaborate in securing resources such as monetary support to carry out research, graduate student assistance, reduction in teaching responsibilities, and other resources that are helpful in sustaining a coordinated research program in the area of transition.</p>
<p>It should be noted that relatively few articles were contributed by authors representing school districts and nonprofit agencies, nor were there many international perspectives presented in <italic>CDTEI</italic> articles. Involving practitioners, administrators, parents, and disability advocates in research related to transition and career development significantly enhances the knowledge base in our field. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2165143413477451">Rumrill et al. (2011)</xref> noted that research findings in the field of special education are only as important as the extent to which findings can be translated into practices that improve educational services and outcomes for children with disabilities. The growing evidence-based practice movement in our field requires university-based researchers to work in close collaboration with teachers, service providers, and school administrators to ensure that research is practically relevant, and university-based researchers can help practitioners and administrators to evaluate their interventions and programs in scientifically sound ways.</p>
<p>Issues of globalization are important in any field, and transition and career development is no exception. <italic>CDTEI</italic> might consider commissioning a special issue on cross-cultural or international aspects of the field, soliciting contributors from other countries to share their perspectives on the transition process for youth with disabilities. Interventions well known to the American systems of education and rehabilitation, including supported employment for one, can trace their origins to other countries, and many countries have modeled civil rights legislation for people with disabilities after the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990. Indeed, there is much to be learned from sharing perspectives and research findings with fellow researchers across the globe.</p>

<title>Limitations and Suggestions for Future Research</title>
<p>There are several limitations to this research. First, we used simple frequency counts as a measure of publication productivity as our goal was to identify the most frequent contributors to <italic>CDTEI</italic> during its 35-year history. The analysis of publication productivity is exclusive to articles appearing in <italic>CDTEI</italic> and may also understate a particular author’s contributions to the discipline. Researchers and academics aim to advance knowledge and practice through publications in multiple journals or through other forms of scholarly work, as opposed to a single journal. Additional research aimed at exploring the contributions of researchers across disability-related, rehabilitation, and special education journals may provide evidence that supports or extends our findings to identify other individuals who have consistently published in the career development and transition literature.</p>
<p>Publication productivity as measured by frequency of publication does speak to an author’s scientific lines of inquiry and the importance of an ongoing research program. The authors with publications appearing many times in the journal are following the incremental and linear model of knowledge generation, building an understanding of this important content area adding data one study at a time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2165143413477451">Rumrill et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-2165143413477451">Sudsawad, 2007</xref>). Publication of research findings is essential to the continued advancement of the profession and contributes to the evidence-base in the area of transition—which, in turn, guides practice.</p>
<p>It is important to note that our analysis does not speak to the quality of the articles or the significance of the work in advancing career development and transition policy or practice. Research combining the number of publications for an author as well as a measure of significance (e.g., citation analysis) may speak to the impact of one’s work on the field. The rationale being that the more times an article is cited by others, the more valuable the article is viewed in terms of generating knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2165143413477451">Cook &amp; Hulett, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Our analysis identified very few contributors with institutional affiliations outside academia or the United States. Future directions for <italic>CDTEI</italic> would be to encourage authors to actively engage with practitioners on research and other forms of scholarship that aims to extend the involvement of transition or educational providers, such as school administrators, special educators, and transition specialists in research. The primary readership of <italic>CDTEI</italic> consists of practitioners, and it would be interesting to read more articles generated from school or agency-based scholars. <italic>CDTEI</italic> would also be well served to develop special issues around international themes as a means of attracting manuscript submissions from around the globe. During the early years of the journal, there were special features within each issue in which articles shared timely information about policy and practice, such as the “News From Washington” section. <italic>CDTEI</italic> might wish to consider a similar approach aimed at including topical features within each issue related to international perspectives or scholarship generated through the collaborative efforts of practitioners and researchers.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Since its inception in 1978, <italic>CDTEI</italic> has been the leading outlet for research and scholarship in the area of transition for youth and young adults with disabilities. Mostly in collaborative, coauthored articles, in keeping with the interdisciplinary, team-oriented nature of the field itself, transition scholars have documented, evaluated, and, in some cases, shaped the professional practices by which services and supports are provided to people with disabilities and their families during the critically important developmental period of youth and young adulthood. By codifying and aggregating the contributions of authors and institutions to <italic>CDTEI</italic> over the past 35 years, our intent in conducting this study was to recognize the efforts of scholars who have worked so assiduously to build the knowledge base in the interdisciplinary field of transition.</p>
