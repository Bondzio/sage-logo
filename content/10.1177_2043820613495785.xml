<p>Elizabeth Povinelli’s account of ‘ordinary, chronic, and cruddy’ (p. 3) suffering in late liberal settler societies is, among many things, a valuable contribution to the recent temporal turn in studies of cultural politics (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2043820613495785">Hemmings, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2043820613495785">Muñoz, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2043820613495785">Tadiar, 2009</xref>). Parallel to the earlier spatial turn, this renewed emphasis on temporality delves more deeply into the meanings, rationalities and grammars of discursive time, and how they help differentially dispose of bodies, subjects and spaces in the present. I will focus here on Povinelli’s exploration of grammatical tense, and how it is essential to producing these material, and therefore ethical and political, effects. I will then offer a conjecture, prompted by the case of a non-settler society, on inflections useful for a more variegated account of whiteness.</p>
<p>Two tenses are especially prominent and mutually implicated in <italic>Economies of Abandonment</italic>. The past perfect locates others, especially racialised others, in the past, by claiming ‘they have always been that way’. Their current suffering is self-inflicted due to the pathological historical demands of their ‘genealogical societies’ of origin, to which they stubbornly remain attached. But late liberal governance attempts to reform its laggard subjects, proclaiming that the additional suffering it inflicts in the process ‘will have been worth it’ at some future date when the other becomes an equal in the only proper milieu, the market. The past perfect sacrificed to the future perfect are tenses of colonialism rearticulated under neo-liberalism. They are not abstract; they are locatable in specific speech acts by people ranging from anthropologists to politicians, most notably as they narrate the withdrawal of social welfare provision from the vulnerable as a promissory note of future redemption. Some will not survive this transition from past to future perfect, but that is the necessary if regrettable logic of the all-governing market.</p>
<p>Discursive formations specific to time and place provide common ground for this differential inclusion and its narrative denial of responsibility for present suffering. Povinelli proposes a ‘governance of the prior’ for liberal settler societies, which relies upon the long-naturalised assumption that an older claim has priority over a newer one, for example, ‘we were here first’. This creates a double bind: how to recognise the distinct claims of indigenous communities who, unarguably, were there first, while at the same time uphold the universal sovereignty of the settler state, whose founding violence must be located in the past, prior to all, for its actions guaranteeing society’s future to be legitimate.</p>
<p>Sometimes lying will do. <italic>Terra nullius</italic> declared prior inhabitants non-existent, thereby deeming colonisers the first inhabitants. Multiculturalism is a more recent strategy, in which the differences that historical priority produces are recognised by the state, but as is well known, ultimately on the state’s own terms. Such a politics of cultural recognition has fallen out of favour under neo-liberalism, and Povinelli explores several examples from Australia and the United States of communities most disadvantaged by this transition. Space precludes a summary, but effects on indigenous Australians have been especially dire, as successive Liberal-led and Labour governments have re-embraced the tense of Aboriginality and sought to finally deal with alleged long-standing cultural pathologies of indigenous people once and for all, liberating them to participate in the market as unencumbered and therefore equal individuals. The governance of the prior may be especially visible in settler states, but Povinelli notes that it both precedes and exceeds indigenous-settler relations (and indigeneity is not the only othering she addresses). Yet, she is reluctant to cut the cord connecting it to colonialism (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2043820613495785">Povinelli, 2011</xref>), due to her personal and professional commitment to an indigenous community in the Northern Territory, and due to the genealogy of the governance of the prior having yet to be written.</p>
<p>How ubiquitous is the governance of the prior in liberal societies? Taking present-day Britain as an example, is the redemptive promise of austerity authorised by a ‘tense of the other’? Is race, that quintessentially colonial marker of otherness, still essential to its operation? Since the election campaign that brought the Conservative-led coalition government to power in May 2010 in the midst of the financial crisis, the mantra of now-Prime Minister David Cameron and Chancellor George Osborne has been, ‘We’re all in this together’. But as the poor and middle class face benefit cuts and the wealthy face tax cuts, it is clear that ‘we’ are included in ‘this’ in quite different ways. Cameron and Osborne are always careful never to disclose the full terms of inclusion in this togetherness. Endlessly asserting that everything they do is ‘fair’ has proven enough. Even a recent vote, as of this writing, the delink welfare benefits from the inflation index to save money was sold as ‘fair’, as ‘skivers’ should not be getting larger annual raises in percentage terms than ‘strivers’. This sort of neo-liberal retrenchment is depressingly familiar the world over, but how is this an example of the governance of the prior?</p>
<p>Clearly a notion of future redemption is at work here, as the deserving poor are now called strivers. Moralising poverty is nothing new of course, but today a striver can become anything. Even the opposition Labour Party have taken strivers to be their natural constituency. In his 2011 Labour Conference speech, party leader Ed Miliband baldly stated, ‘Do we treat the person who contributes to their community the same as the person who doesn’t? My answer is no. Our first duty should be to help the person who shows responsibility’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2043820613495785">Miliband, 2011</xref>). In a recent collection of short position papers by party supporters published by LabourList, strikingly absent is concern for the vulnerable, the traditional leaven for talk of the deserving poor. It is confined to one chapter by Sue Marsh, blogger of <italic>Diary of a Benefit Scrounger</italic>. She uses blunt language to counter the image of disability claimants making a ‘lifestyle choice’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2043820613495785">Cruddas, 2013</xref>: 58). But in a call for more holistic and flexible support, she notes it is needed ‘to level the playing field with non-disabled peers. (Not better it you note, just level it.)’ The striving, entrepreneurial subject is always the ideal, even when neo-liberalism as an ideology or social formation is being directly criticised (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2043820613495785">Cruddas, 2013</xref>: 10, 22, 34, 47, 52, 85).</p>
<p>Povinelli’s autological subjects, the strivers with their bright futures, are present and accounted for. But the grammar of this pseudodebate also requires a ‘tense of the skiver’. The Tories provide this by shamelessly borrowing the tabloid language of the shirker, the scrounger and the skiver, as pathological products of multigenerational poverty. Significantly, such people are often explicitly racialised as white, and the future of the ‘white working class’ is a consistent subject of concern in the press. To be sure, there is plenty of hand-wringing over brown and black people too, and there is always an underlying discourse of brown and black underachievement in British media and political discourse. But currently fashionable anxieties tend to focus more explicitly on cultural baggage brought in from the outside by ‘choice’. Seemingly always figured as immigrants, non-white Britons by definition <italic>ought</italic> to be autological subjects because by definition immigrants are striving to better their lives. Thus, in contrast to the claims of indigenous and formerly enslaved groups in settler states, it is in the British state’s gift to accept their priorities or not. With multiculturalism falling out of favour across the political spectrum, pressure is on for a more active governance of the prior-as-externality. But despite this different spatiality, temporality remains much the same – the past perfect (‘they have always been this way’) as the colonial tense of the non-white other.</p>
<p>But does fixing the skivers of the white working class require a different narrative tense? They too <italic>ought</italic> to be working (that there are no jobs is apparently irrelevant), but here because they are white. Colonial genealogies have some purchase when confronting dehumanising discourses such as the ‘feral youths’ of ‘sink estates’, but the indelible fact of whiteness always intrudes as an increasingly explicit racialisation in public debate. The white working class is a victim of industrial decline, which pulled the rug out from under the priorities of community and solidarity. Governmental discourse since Thatcher has indeed argued that these priorities must go in the brave new neo-liberal world. Cameron softens this by envisioning an unfunded ‘Big Society’, and One Nation Labour incoherently hope to reinstate such priorities in neo-liberal strivers while making bankers pay a bit more tax.</p>
<p>But the key here is that the white working class has <italic>not </italic>‘always been this way’, and the anxious marking of their race indicates concern they are becoming as if they were so. This failure of whiteness renders this group a different other whose ‘tense’ in governmental discourse is conditional. For the Tories, in power, this is a predictive conditional: ‘When we cut their benefits, they will be in work’. For Labour, this is a speculative conditional: ‘If we were to offer job training as a condition for benefits, they would be in work’. It is back to the future for this othered whiteness, with optimism about its reform based on the hope that they have <italic>not yet</italic> always been that way.</p>
