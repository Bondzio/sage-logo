        <p>One of the distinctive features of the Indian sub-continent is its rich religious
          diversity. This article examines two political responses to religious diversity, one, in
          third century <sc>BCE</sc> and the other in the middle of the last century as India became
          independent from British colonial rule. In Ancient India, Emperor Asoka issued edicts that
          advised people of all religious faiths to live together and claimed that the condition of
          sociability are fulfilled by all religious perspectives as each values self-restraint and
          self-purification. In the public arena, this translates into restraint of speech and
          civility towards one another. Modern India presented an entirely different scenario. Here
          the state had to respond to well demarcated, often conflicting religious communities, each
          of whom, was at least partially committed to freedom and equality-oriented reforms. This
          necessitated that the state take a somewhat combative stance towards both inter and
          intra-religious domination. The article argues that the only way in which to undermine
          these forms of domination is that the state adopts a policy of principled distance towards
          all religions.</p>

    <p>The fact of India’s rich diversity is widely registered, as also the general evaluation that
      its historical record in managing religious diversity has not been bad. Less understood is how
      this was achieved in the past or reproduced now. Even lesser known is what this really means,
      what the extent and depth of such achievement is.</p>
    <p>In this article, I hope to explore the conceptual resources in India to properly deal with
      religious diversity. What are contemporary India’s moral expectations in response to religious
      plurality? To answer this I present what, in my view, is the best interpretation of
      constitutional secularism in India. Furthermore, I view it as an imaginative and morally
      defensible response to the specific conditions of inter-religious conflict in a country on the
      verge of political independence. I do not intend this account to be historically accurate or
      exhaustive but I hope that the broad contours I draw here provide some explanation of the
      nature of Indian secularism. The allusion to a historical narrative is more to make my account
      of secularism plausible and less to capture the history of that period in detail. I don’t want
      the reader to forget that this article is an exercise in political theory not history.</p>
    <p>Indeed, my ambition is somewhat monumental. I wish to take the reader back into time to
      almost 2500 years ago. Here, I focus on political responses to religious diversity in Emperor
      Asoka’s reign. I do this in order to give the reader a glimpse into one of ancient India’s
      best normative assessments of religious differences. Some clarification is required with even
      greater urgency in this context. I do not wish to convince the reader that Asokan Empire was a
      pre-cursor to modern Indian secularism. I am not suggesting that there is historical
      continuity or connectedness between ancient and modern responses to religious diversity. Even
      if some continuities exist, it is not my intention to demonstrate them. My objective is served
      if the reader is adequately convinced that there are at least two distinct responses in the
      collective repertoire of India from which all of us might draw some suitable lessons to manage
      religious diversity today. Undoubtedly, many more responses, from within (for example, Akbar)
      India and outside it (for example, the Ottoman Empire), can enrich this rather meagre stock
      but I focus quite arbitrarily on these two which I find deeply interesting and innovative.
      Since most societies today are characterized by religious diversity, we might ask if such
      experiments with religious diversity hold a lesson for other similarly placed societies.</p>
    <sec id="section1-2321023013482786">
      <title>Religious Diversity and Domination</title>
      <p>What does religious diversity mean? We might first distinguish between diversity
          <italic>of</italic> religion (External) and diversity <italic>within</italic> religion
        (Internal).</p>
      <p>External diversity exists when different co-existing religions, each with a distinct
        identity of its own, exist within a single society. Examples include Israel with Jews,
        Muslims and Christians or contemporary European Societies with Jews, Christians, Muslims,
        Hindus and Sikhs and India which has always had multiple religious communities.</p>
      <p>Internal diversity also takes two forms. The core beliefs, values and practices of any
        religion are invariably interpreted and elaborated differently by different sub-groups
        within a religion. This increasing internal differentiation creates a horizontal diversity
        that could cut very deep, creating schisms that often lead to bitter wrangling and sometimes
        violent conflict. Examples include Protestants and Catholics, the many denominations within
        Protestantism, or within Islam, Shias, Sunnis. Ismailis, Ahmedis etc. Likewise, Hindus could
        be seen to be differentiated into Vaishnavites, Shaivites and so on. Such internal diversity
        is fairly well recognized. Less acknowledged is what might be called vertical or
        hierarchical diversity. Sometime during the course of the evolution of religions, some
        people are barred from participating in its mainstream rituals and practices. Over time,
        such groups are compelled to develop their own beliefs and practices that stand within an
        overall relation of subordination to the mainstream. They possess less or no value in
        relation to dominant practices and beliefs. Such powerless groups develop their own distinct
        modes of religiosity within an overarching system from which they have little escape. Thus
        people of the same religion engage in diverse practices that are hierarchically arranged.
        For example, caste-ridden Hinduism makes a distinction between pure and impure practices.
        Practices performed by certain castes are pure, and members of other castes are excluded
        from them. For instance, women or <italic>dalits</italic> may not be allowed entry into the
        inner sanctum of temples and in many cases even into the precincts of an upper-caste
        temple.</p>
      <p>This example already brings home a point that I ought to have made at the very outset of
        this discussion. Every form of diversity, including religious diversity, is enmeshed in
        power relations. If so, endemic to every religiously diverse society is an illegitimate use
        of power whereby the basic interests of one group are threatened by the actions of another.
        It further follows that inherent in religiously diverse societies is the possibility of both
        inter-religious and intra-religious domination—a broad term that encompasses discrimination,
        marginalization, oppression, exclusions, humiliation and the reproduction of
            hierarchy.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-2321023013482786">2</xref></sup></p>
      <p>To sum up, most societies are marked by religious diversity in each of the three forms
        specified above. Endemic to these diversities is intra- and inter-religious domination. A
        society deals well with religious diversity when it manages to continually reduce both these
        forms of domination. Its record in managing diversity is bad when it allows or fosters
        institutionalized religious domination. However, the reader may notice that though its
        success in handling religious diversity presupposes that it has the conceptual resources to
        do so, its failure does not automatically entail that it has no such resources. To be sure,
        without such resources, a society is destined to fail. But institutionalized religious
        domination might grow because such resources are neglected, ignored, deliberately suppressed
        and so on.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="section2-2321023013482786">
      <title>Modern India</title>
      <p>Modern India provides one such instance of a society mishandling the cohabitation of its
        many religious groups, despite the vast resources it possesses to ensure that they all
        flourish. Such mismanagement occurred, wittingly or unwittingly under colonial rule. But it
        continues to happen in India even after independence. How can such mishandling be reduced?
        How did newly independent India imagine the political response to problems endemic to
        religious diversity?</p>
      <p>As India came closer to its independence from British colonial rule, sadly it became more
        and more deeply divided. By 1940s, vocal sections of the Muslim elites had raised the demand
        for a separate nation–state, Pakistan, paranoid that a nation based on universal adult
        franchise would not only be Hindu but invariably have a Hindu state, detrimental to Islam
        and to sub-continental Muslims.</p>
      <p>This demand was part of and in response to the majority–minority syndrome, a condition of
        spiralling estrangement between Hindus and Muslims, one where animosities between groups
        circulate freely, adding layers upon layers of mutual grievances and where antagonistic
        games are played with no other end in mind except defeat and humiliation of the other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2321023013482786">Bhargava, 2010</xref>). Not that Muslim
        elites alone were to blame for the syndrome. Far from that, sections of Hindus had also
        built an exclusivist ideal of a purely Hindu nationalism, had begun to use a supremacist
        language and constructed a deeply divided memory of the nation’s past. They branded all
        Muslims as invaders, forgetting that many converts to Islam were probably one of the many
        original inhabitants of the land. Anyhow, prospects of inter-religious domination loomed
        large, fears that did not go away with the formation of Pakistan because although reduced,
        Muslim population was still substantial, about 12 per cent of the population, five crores in
        absolute numbers then and twelve crores now.</p>
      <p>The syndrome had another significant consequence. The 19th century had witnessed in India
        the growth of a number of freedom and equality-centred reform movements among both Hindus
        and Muslims. But the majority–minority syndrome set off by inter-religious rivalries
        forestalled these reforms, indeed intensified anti-reform tendencies. As B.R. Ambedkar, the
        great leader of Dalit put it, <disp-quote>
          <p>When groups regard each other as a menace, all energies are spent on meeting this
            menace. The exigencies of a common front against one another generate a conspiracy of
            silence over social evils. Internal dissent and conflict is squashed in favour of the
            idea that everyone must close ranks or the community will weaken.’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2321023013482786">Ambedkar [1940] 1990</xref>, p. 185)</p>
        </disp-quote></p>
      <p>A very real possibility existed that the legitimate interests of vulnerable sections among
        Hindus and Muslims would be neglected, partly because any articulation of their demand would
        escalate internal conflict and weaken the overall unity of each community. In other words,
        prospects of intra-religious domination loomed large too.</p>
      <p>The leadership of the newly independent country was faced therefore with a choice: either
        to tolerate, indeed to consolidate both these forms of domination by the establishment of a
        (upper caste) Hindu state or to combat them by instituting a secular state instead.</p>
      <p>It is to the credit of Indian leaders then that they chose the second option and in doing
        so developed a distinctive conception of secularism with a genuine trans-cultural potential,
        suited particularly to a context of deep religious diversity, and different from all
        available western conceptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2321023013482786">Bhargava,
          2010</xref>, pp. 63–108).</p>
      <p>Although not available as a doctrine or theory, such a conception was worked out jointly by
        Hindus and Muslims in the subcontinent and can be found in the best moments of
        inter-communal practice in India and in the country’s constitution, appropriately
        interpreted. Eight features of the Indian model are striking and relevant to a wider
        discussion of secularism.</p>
      <list id="list1-2321023013482786" list-type="order">
        <list-item>
          <p>First, multiple religions are not extras, added on as an afterthought, but present at
            its starting point, as part of its foundation.</p>
        </list-item>
        <list-item>
          <p>Second, it responds simultaneously to both inter-religious and intra-religious
            domination.</p>
        </list-item>
        <list-item>
          <p>Third, it has a commitment to multiple values—peace and toleration; liberty or/and
            equality, not conceived narrowly as pertaining to individuals alone but interpreted
            broadly to also cover the relative autonomy of religious communities as well as their
            roughly equal standing in society. This it is able to do by simultaneously granting
            individual and community-specific rights.</p>
        </list-item>
        <list-item>
          <p>Fourth, it is not entirely averse to the public character of religions. Although the
            state is not identified with a particular religion or with religion more generally
            (there is no establishment of religion), there is official and therefore public
            recognition granted to religious communities.</p>
        </list-item>
        <list-item>
          <p>Fifth, it rejects the idea that the state must intervene in religion only to control or
            suppress it.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-2321023013482786">3</xref></sup> Nor does
            it erect a wall of separation between state and religion—an interpretation of the idea
            of separation developed in the United States where religion was to keep off the state to
            the same degree and in the same manner as the state keeps off religion. The two are
            meant to do their respective jobs best when they do not enter into each other’s domain
            of jurisdiction. In India, there are meant to be boundaries, of course, between state
            and religion but they are porous. This allows the state to intervene in religions, to
            help or hinder them without the impulse to control or destroy them. The state has
            multiple roles, such as granting aid to educational institutions of religious
            communities on a non-preferential basis but also in legitimately interfering in
            socio-religious institutions that deny equal dignity and status to members of their own
            religion or to others (for example, the ban on untouchability; the obligation to allow
            everyone, irrespective of caste, to enter Hindu temples; and potentially to correct
            gender inequalities), on the basis of a more sensible understanding of equal concern and
            respect for all individuals and groups. In short, it interprets separation to mean not
            strict exclusion or strict neutrality but rather what I call principled distance.</p>
        </list-item>
        <list-item>
          <p>Sixth, this model shows that we do not have to choose between active hostility and
            passive indifference or between disrespectful hostility and respectful indifference
            toward religion. We can combine the two: have the hostility to the extent necessary but
            also show active respect; the state may intervene to inhibit some practices, so long as
            it shows respect for other practices of the religious community and does so by publicly
            lending support to them.</p>
        </list-item>
        <list-item>
          <p>Seventh, by not fixing its commitment from the start exclusively to individual or
            community values or marking rigid boundaries between public and private, India’s
            constitutional secularism allows decisions on these matters to be taken either within
            the open dynamics of democratic politics or on case-to-case basis by contextual
            reasoning in the courts.</p>
        </list-item>
        <list-item>
          <p>Eighth, this commitment to multiple values and principled distance means that the state
            tries to balance different, ambiguous but equally important values. This makes its
            secular ideal more like a contextual, ethically sensitive, politically negotiated
            arrangement (which it really is), rather than a scientific doctrine conjured by
            ideologues and merely implemented by political agents.</p>
        </list-item>
      </list>
      <p>A somewhat forced, formulaic articulation of Indian secularism goes something like this.
        The state must keep a principled distance from all public or private, individual-oriented or
        community-oriented religious institutions for the sake of the equally significant (and
        sometimes conflicting) values of peace, this–worldly goods, dignity, liberty and equality
        (in all its complicated individualistic or non-individualistic versions)—in short, helping
        to make society free from intra- and inter-religious domination. Indian secularism then is
        an ethically sensitive negotiated settlement between diverse groups and divergent
        values.</p>
      <sec id="section3-2321023013482786">
        <title>Principled Distance</title>
        <p>Let me elaborate in somewhat greater detail two key features of Indian secularism,
          namely, principled distance and its contextualist character. Indian secularism admits
          fairly strict separation at the level of ends: the state has no religious ends. At the
          level of personnel and institutions too separation exists—this is part of what is meant by
          distance. But at the third level, it maintains a flexible approach on the question of
          inclusion and exclusion of religion and the engagement and disengagement of the state,
          which depends on the context, nature, or current state of relevant religions. This
          engagement must be governed by principles undergirding a secular state, that is,
          principles that flow from a commitment to its stated values. This means that religion may
          intervene in the affairs of the state if such intervention promotes freedom, equality or
          any other value integral to secularism. For example, citizens may support a coercive law
          of the state grounded purely in a religious rationale if this law is compatible with
          freedom or equality. Equally, the state may engage with religion or disengage from it and
          engage positively or negatively, but it does so depending entirely on whether these values
          are promoted or undermined. A state that intervenes or refrains from interference on this
          basis keeps a principled distance from all religions. This is one constitutive idea of
          principled distance. This idea is different from strict neutrality, in which the state may
          help or hinder all religions to an equal degree and in the same manner; if it intervenes
          in one religion, it must also do so in others. Instead, it rests on the idea that treating
          people or groups as equals is entirely consistent with differential treatment. This idea
          is the second ingredient in what I have called principled distance.</p>
        <p>What kind of treatment do I have in mind? First, religious groups have sought exemptions
          from practices in which states intervene by promulgating a law to be applied neutrally to
          the rest of society. This demand for non-interference is made on the ground either that
          the law requires them to do things not permitted by their religion or that it prevents
          them from doing acts mandated by it. For example, Sikhs demand exemptions from mandatory
          helmet laws and from police dress codes to accommodate religiously required turbans.
          Elsewhere, Jews seek exemptions from Air Force regulations to accommodate their yarmulkes.
          Muslim women and girls demand that the state not interfere in their religiously required
          chador. Jews and Muslims seek exemption from Sunday closing laws on the ground that this
          is not required by their religion. Principled distance allows, then, that a practice that
          is banned or regulated in one culture may be permitted in the minority culture because of
          the distinctive status and meaning it has for its members. For many republican or liberal
          theories, this is a problem because of a simple, somewhat absolutist morality that gives
          overwhelming importance to one value, particularly to equal treatment or equal liberty.
          Religious groups may demand that the state refrain from interference in their practices,
          but they may equally demand that the state interfere to give them special assistance so
          that they are also able to secure what other groups are able to routinely get by virtue of
          their social dominance in the political community. It may grant authority to religious
          officials to perform legally binding marriages, to have their own rules or methods of
          obtaining a divorce, to promulgate rules about relations between ex-husband and ex-wife,
          to arbitrate civil disputes, and so on. Principled distance allows the possibility of such
          policies on the grounds that to hold people accountable to an unfair law is to treat them
          as unequal.</p>
        <p>However, principled distance is not just a recipe for differential treatment in the form
          of special exemptions. It may even require state intervention in some religions more than
          in others, considering the historical and social condition of all relevant religions. For
          the promotion of a particular value constitutive of secularism, some religions, relative
          to other religions, may require more interference from the state. For example, suppose the
          value to be advanced is social equality. This requires, in part, undermining caste
          hierarchies. If this is the aim of the state, then it may be required of the state that it
          interferes in caste-ridden Hinduism much more than in, say, Islam or Christianity.
          However, if a diversity-driven religious liberty is the value to be advanced by the state,
          then it may have to intervene in Christianity and Islam more than in Hinduism. If this is
          so, the state can neither strictly exclude considerations emanating from religion nor keep
          strict neutrality with respect to religion. It cannot, antecedently, decide that it will
          always refrain from interfering in religions or that it will interfere in each equally.
          Indeed, it may not relate to every religion in society in exactly the same way or
          intervene in each religion to the same degree or in the same manner. To want to do so
          would be plain absurd. All it must ensure is that the relationship between the state and
          religions is guided by non-sectarian motives consistent with some values and
          principles.</p>
        <p>Discerning readers would know how different this conception is from mainstream western
          versions, particularly those which developed in the United States, France and much of
          Western Europe. Unlike India’s subtle understanding of separation as principled distance,
          in America, separation is interpreted as mutual exclusion of religion/church and state for
          the sake of freedom and equality understood wholly as attributes of individuals. Mutual
          exclusion implies that neither religion nor the state would intrude into the other’s
          jurisdiction. They will both keep off each other’s domain by virtue of an unbreachable
          wall, as Thomas Jefferson once put it. The state will neither help nor hinder religion
          which will remain in the hands of individuals and their associations, a product of their
          choices.</p>
        <p>Indian secularism is different from the French model too which has its own specific
          understanding of separation as one-sided exclusion for the sake of republican equality. In
          order to enter the public/political domain as equal citizens, everyone must leave behind
          their religious identities in private. Those who fail to do so face a robust interference
          by the state. Though, religion has no power to get into the affairs of the state, the
          state retains all its powers to intervene in matters of religion—all this for the sake of
          unified political community.</p>
        <p>Finally, Indian secularism is also radically different from conceptions of secularism in
          the rest of Western Europe which does not even pretend to have equality or impartiality in
          the domain of religion. Different European states continue to remain entangled with their
          own respective national religion. They do separate from religion for the sake of liberal
          and egalitarian values outside religion but continue to offer exclusive support to the
          dominant religion. The consequence of this is the perpetuation of deep religious
          inequalities and the continuation of discriminations and exclusions for less powerful
          religions.</p>
        <p>This model which fosters critical respect for all religions by protecting the rights of
          religious minorities and with a policy of principled distance did not drop fully formed
          from the sky. It has developed in India historically. This goes against the idea
          propagated by many scholars that secularism is a western ideal, a unique product of
          Western Enlightenment and Protestantism.</p>
        <p>As the Indian example shows, this necessary link between secularism and Christianity is
          exaggerated, if not entirely mistaken. It is true that the institutional separation of
          church and state is an internal feature of Christianity and an integral part of Western
          secularisms. But as we have seen, this church-state disconnection is a necessary but not a
          sufficient condition for the development of secularism even in societies with church-based
          religions. It is clearly not a necessary condition for the development of all forms of
          secularisms. Moreover, as I have argued, the mutual exclusion of religion and the state is
          not the defining feature of secularism. The idea of separation can be interpreted
          differently. Nor are religious integrity, peace and toleration (interpreted broadly to
          mean ‘live and let live’) uniquely Christian values. Most non-Christian civilizations have
          given significant space to each. Therefore, none of them is exclusively Christian. It
          follows that even though we find in Christian writings some of the clearest and most
          systematic articulation of this doctrine, even the Western conception of secularism is not
          exclusively Christian.</p>
        <p>All right, one might say, secularism is not just a Christian doctrine, but is it not
          Western? The answer to this question is both yes and no. Up to a point, it is certainly a
          Western idea. More specifically, as a clearly articulated doctrine, it has distinct
          Western origins. Although elements that constitute secularism assume different cultural
          forms and are found in several civilizations, one cannot deny that the idea of the secular
          first achieved self-consciousness and was properly theorized in the West. One might then
          say that the early and middle history of secularism is almost entirely dominated by
          Western societies. However, the same cannot be said of its later history. Nationalism and
          democracy arrived in the West after the settlement of religious conflicts, in societies
          that had been made religiously homogeneous or had almost become so (with the exception of
          the Jews, of course, who continued to face persistent persecution). The absence of deep
          religious diversity and conflict meant that issues of citizenship could be addressed
          almost entirely disregarding religious context; the important issue of community-specific
          rights to religious groups could be wholly ignored. This had a decisive bearing on the
          Western conception of secularism. However, for non-Western societies, such as India, the
          case is different. Both national and democratic agendas in countries such as India had to
          face issues raised by deep religious difference and diversity. In India, nationalism had
          to choose between the religious and the secular. Similarly, the distribution of active
          citizenship rights could not be conceived or accomplished by ignoring religion. It could
          be done either by actively disregarding religion (as in all political rights) or by
          developing a complex attitude towards it, as in the case of cultural rights, where it had
          to balance claims of individual autonomy with those of community obligations and claims of
          the necessity of keeping religion ‘private’ with its inescapable, often valuable presence
          in the public. By doing so, Indian secularism never completely annulled particular
          religious identities.</p>
        <p>Indeed, in addressing these complex issues, the idea of political secularism was taken
          further than it had been evolved in the West. Mainstream theories or ideologies in modern,
          Western societies have taken little notice of these features. Some are wary of interfering
          in religions. Others want to keep away even from subsidizing them. But this compounds
          several problems. Communities in desperate need of help from impartial but powerful
          institutions remain unsupported. And powerful sections within religious communities that
          need to be stopped from harassing the more vulnerable members of their own community are
          unfettered. Many western societies today are struggling to deal with their postcolonial
          religious diversity. They lack the resources to deal with the problems endemic to this
          diversity. These societies are trapped in conceptions that have outgrown their usefulness.
          They would do well to look sideways to other conceptions because the later history of
          secularism is more non-Western than Western.</p>

        <title>Diversity in Ancient India</title>
        <p>Unfortunately, Indian scholars have themselves been slow to fully recognize the
          distinctiveness of Indian secularism. They assume that secularism comes only in one form,
          that the form it has assumed is western, born out of dialectic between Protestantism and
          Western Enlightenment and it is too thickly intertwined with the religious and cultural
          history of a few western societies to have any relevance to India. This view is mistaken
          because the distance between state and religion grows either because a society resists and
          offsets the vast illegitimate power of its own religion by transferring some of it to a
          separate institution, such as the state or because the presence of multiple religions in
          society necessitates that other powerful institutions such as the state do not align
          themselves to any one religion for fear that this might result in war, persecution or
          injustice. India has very little experience of the first. It has never been home
          exclusively to one religion. Its religions have never had a powerful church. But it has an
          enormous experience of the second. It has developed multiple ways to distance political
          institutions from religious powers. In what follows I provide one such example from
          ancient India.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="section5-2321023013482786">
        <title>Ancient Response to Religious Diversity: Asoka</title>
        <p>We have habitually associated Asokan Empire with ‘religious toleration’ but probably
          never paid attention to what this means or how significant his achievement was. Here I
          examine two of his many edicts to explore this issue. The 7th edict begins with ‘The
          beloved of the gods, King Priyadasi, wishes that “all <italic>pasanda</italic>s”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-2321023013482786">4</xref></sup> (followers of a school of
          thought or teachings) must dwell everywhere, in every part of his kingdom’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-2321023013482786">5</xref></sup> This seems like a simple,
          quite inconsequential statement and has been treated as such by commentators who have a
          rather sanguine view of social and religious conditions in Asoka’s India. Thus, Vincent
          Smith claims that <disp-quote>
            <p>the Dharma which he preached and propagated unceasingly with amazing faith in the
              power of sermonizing had few, if any, distinctive features. The doctrine was
              essentially common to all religions. When we apply to Asoka’s policy the word
              ‘toleration’ with its modern connotation and justly applaud the liberality of his
              sentiments, another qualification is needed, and we must remember that in his days no
              really diverse religions existed in India. Buddhism and Jainism both were originally
              mere sects of Hinduism—or rather schools of philosophy founded by Hindu
              reformers—which in course of time gathered an accretion of mythology around the
              original speculative nucleus, and developed into religions’. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-2321023013482786">Smith, 1920</xref>, p. 61)</p>
          </disp-quote></p>
        <p>The same sentiment is echoed by Radhakumud Mukerjee who says, <disp-quote>
            <p>It is to be remembered that Asoka’s toleration was easy enough among the different
              denominations of the time, which were all but offshoots of the same central faith and
              did not differ among themselves so completely as the religions of Jesus, Zoroaster, or
              Mahomet introduced later into the country. Thus it was not difficult for the emperor,
              with due credit to the liberality of his views, to discern ‘the essence of the matter
              in all sects’ and honour it duly. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2321023013482786">Mukerjee, 1928</xref>, p. 66)</p>
          </disp-quote></p>
        <p>To be sure, some commentators recognized that Asokan edicts are written in times of
          intense sectarian strife. For instance, D.R. Bhandarkar says that people in Asoka’s times
          had lost sight of the essentials of their faith and begun to focus excessively on rituals
          and theology. In these matters, there was unending acrimonious wrangling. Therefore, ‘When
          Asoka lived and preached, religious fanaticism and sectarian spirit were rampant’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2321023013482786">Bhandarkar, 1925</xref>, p. 112).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-2321023013482786">6</xref></sup> Yet even he seems not to link
          this wish of the beloved of the gods to have his subjects co-inhabit to rampant
          sectarianism or to realize its real import. Why should Asoka have said this? What could
          the context be in which he is compelled to <italic>say</italic> this? We get no sense of
          this from existing literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2321023013482786">Bhandarkar, 1925</xref>). At any rate, it is not clear what form this strife took? Were
          sects expelling one another from territories where each was dominant? Had they segregated
          one another? Was something akin to what we now call ‘ethnic or religious cleansing’
          attempted in that period? But if intense sectarian strife existed, there must at least
          have been some violence between sects, even if it was not purely motivated by doctrine. It
          is again hard to tell unless we try and imagine vividly what the background conditions
          were to some of these key edicts.</p>
        <p>The 12th edict implores that all pasandas restrain their speech, a specification of a
          more general self-restraint, <italic>samyama</italic>, mentioned in the 7th edict. This is
          seen as a virtue, even a civic virtue. But why restrain only speech? Why is this, the
          core, the <italic>saara</italic> of all pasandas? Why burden it with so much importance?
          What is the link between restraint on speech and co-existence? Does speech have the power
          to disrupt coexistence? We all know that it can but under what conditions is it so acutely
          significant as to become one of the central problems of a society and the chief concern of
          its royal edicts? Does speech have the power to push everyone over the edge or are people
          already so much on the edge that even speech can push them over it? Surely, it is easy for
          a reasonable person to tolerate people with whom she has minor differences. The difficulty
          of tolerance arises only when people with major, virtually irreconcilable differences
          encounter one another. What then is the context in which speech is virtually the sole
          carrier of deeply uncomfortable, major differences?</p>
        <p>Once we properly examine the context of the edicts, we begin to get a sense of the
          importance of the edict. For a start, an internal conflict existed within followers of
          Vedic teachings, between those who indulged in expensive and elaborate rituals and those
          who found this baroque quality entirely unnecessary, wasteful and distracting from ones
          primary objectives. Second, between those who believed in the necessity of propitiating
          gods and those who gradually moved away from this view and felt that the only significant
          action (<italic>karma</italic>) was the sacrifice (<italic>yajna</italic>) itself.</p>
        <p>A third conflict also existed. Several commentators attest to the presence of pre-Aryan
          people in India. One such group were probably called <italic>Munis</italic>, a wandering
          group of sparsely clad ascetics, deeply sceptical about the idea of a creator of the
          universe, believing that the world in which they lived was real and that salvation in this
          world was possible by exacting practical discipline (Pande, [1957]1995, pp.
              257–262).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-2321023013482786">7</xref></sup> They were
          generally pessimistic about other forms of liberation in this world and had little
          conception of any other world. The Munis are infrequently mentioned in the Vedas, but that
          is probably due to their radical difference with the Vedic tradition and their consequent
          marginalization. It does not mean that their existence in this period was rare (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2321023013482786">Kosambi, 2009</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-2321023013482786">8</xref></sup> Thus, a third major conflict
          existed between the Vedics and the pre-Vedic Munis, one ritualistic, believers in gods,
          seeking this-worldly goods and pleasures, and very largely materialist, the other
          renouncing the world of this-worldly pleasures and rituals, rejecting beliefs in gods and
          seeking liberation deep in the forests through rigorous practical discipline.</p>
        <p>In addition to the three conflicts mentioned above, at least two conflicts went much
          deeper: (<italic>a</italic>) between pre-Vedic and Vedic immanantists on the one hand and
          transcendentalists who developed the Upanishads and evolved the notion of the radical
          distinction between Samsara and Brahman/Atman, (<italic>b</italic>) An even deeper
          conflict between two different ethics, one Upanisadic, which has a transcendental
          metaphysics but no (or perhaps a weak) conception of transcendental morality and the other
          which opposes transcendental orders of the real, outer or inner world, but develops a
          strong idea of transcendental morality, one that allows judgements from outside any
          this-worldly point to be made on both self- and other-related actions of every subject.
          Allow me to elaborate.</p>
        <p>The key difference between the Rig Vedic and the Upanishadic world lies in the birth of
          the idea of radical transcendence and therefore of a duality between this cycle of birth
          and death in this world (samsara) and <italic>Brahman</italic> or <italic>Atman</italic>,
          the ultimate reality pervading the whole universe or our deepest inner, imperishable
          selves. Samsara is radically separated from Brahmana or Atman in that the latter can be
          achieved only by totally negating the former. True Liberation (<italic>moksha,
            mukti</italic>) lies in escape from the cycle of <italic>samsara.</italic> Moksha cannot
          be attained by performing sacrifices. But nor could Moksha be obtained, contra the Muni
          and early Jain tradition, by physical austerities even for thousands of years. Offerings
            (<italic>dana</italic>), sacrifices, recitations of Vedas, and performance of
          austerities may earn merit but only steadfastness in pursuit of the knowledge of Brahman
          would help us achieve Moksha or true immortality.</p>
        <p>Both Brahman and Atman are wholly outside the given, immanent and mundane world (samsara)
          and manifest a point from which one can, to use Benjamin Schwatrz’s phrase, ‘stand back
          and look beyond’ (as cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2321023013482786">Eisenstadt, 1986</xref>, p. 2) and contemplate it. Hence, the appropriateness of the
          term ‘radical transcendence’. Hence, also the aptness of the use of axiality. The
          Upanishads provide the axial turn in Indian civilization. Here we have the birth of a
          major potential conflict between vastly different weltanschauungs (world view). For
          nothing that the Vedic peoples or the Munis think to be significant is truly or ultimately
          important for Upanishadic thinkers.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, there is one sense in which the break between the pre-Vedic/Vedic and the
          Upanishadic followers may not have been total. This has to do with the necessary place of
          others in an ethic of self-realization. What follows are very tentative remarks, the
          principal import of which is that higher order other-related values or principles (let’s
          call this morality higher, separate and transcendental) are negligible or secondary in
          pre-Buddhist thought in the Indian subcontinent. For Vedic Brahmanism, Dharma has less to
          do with what we owe one another. Neither sacrificial rituals nor gods are invoked for the
          good of the generalized others, say for the Munis. In both its individual or collective
          forms, this is a self-focused ethic of fulfilment or realization. The content of this
          ethic does not change with the introduction of the idea of radical transcendence. The
          early moment of the axial turn in Indian civilization does not appear to make the
          generalized other central to its ethic of individual or collective self. To be sure,
          notions of justice, right and wrong exist, but these are probably in the hands of the
          Kshatriya king, matters decided in any given context by his will or judgement. Dharma in
          its Vedic or post-Vedic, Upanishadic senses has very little to do with what we must, by
          some transcendental necessity, owe one another.</p>
        <p>All this begins to change with developments in later Upanishadic thought and more clearly
          with the Buddha. With Buddha’s teachings, the transcendental point, to use Gananath
          Obeyesekhre’s phrase is ‘ethicised’ (in my terminology, one might say, moralized) (1985).
          From now on, judgements of the rightness or wrongness of action are ‘mediated and
          delayed’. They may even be enunciated after one’s death. This is the birth of
          transcendental morality—a transcendental evaluation of the rightness or wrongness of
          action in relation to others which affects a person’s life not in this world alone but his
          destiny after death, outside this world. This also entails a shift in the meaning of
          Dharma. Dharma from now on also begins to mean this radically transcendental morality.
          Quite clearly, there must have been not only a conflict between ancient ethics and this
          new ethic inspired by Buddha but also a contest over the meaning of key terms, such as
          Dharma. We now have two radically differing notions of dharma, one a particular ethic of a
          single-cosmos oriented (this-worldly) self-realization and the other, a transcendental
          morality for all concerned with right inter-personal conduct. Indeed, even the term
          ‘interpersonal’ is not quite correct, because the conduct in question includes how human
          beings behave towards non human animals. ‘All’ means all humans and animals, virtually all
          living species. The protest over ritual sacrifice was perhaps more against the sacrificial
          killings of animals. This made eminent economic sense but is not reducible to it. For the
          Kshatriyas, war had become a mode of life and perhaps the greatest benefit yielded by
          yajna was success in war. The kshatriyas needed animals that they stole from ordinary
          pastoralists. War on the other hand meant not only the arbitrary killing of humans and
          animals but also the destruction of people’s livelihood. Thus both pastoralists and small
          farmers may have risen in protest against war and sacrificial killing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2321023013482786">Kosambi, 2009</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-2321023013482786">9</xref></sup> Buddha’s teachings thus
          instantiates a major transvaluation of Vedic values, a ‘dynamic best captured in Assmann’s
          notion of normative inversion whereby one group’s rights and responsibilities are turned
          by another group into prohibitions and scandals’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-2321023013482786">Pollock, 2005</xref>, p. 404).</p>
        <p>I hope to have shown the deeply mistaken character of the view that religious interaction
          in Asoka’s period of rule was relatively trouble-free and that he must have had an easy
          time finding a common ground among followers of different schools of thought. It is well
          known that shared philosophical and cultural assumptions provide no immunity against
          intense conflicts. The assumption that offshoots of an entity conflict weakly with their
          parent is even more untenable. Buddhism may have been an offshoot of ‘Hinduism’ but
          conflicted with it at many levels, on many issues. As for Jaina philosphy, it is not even
          entirely clear what epistemic gain ensues to see it simply as an offshoot of Hinduism.
          Thus, Vincent Smith and Radhakumud Mookerjee clearly underestimate the depth of conflict
          in Asokan times. Thapar and Bhandarkar are right that this a period of intense and bitter
          sectarian conflict. However, in my view, even they are unable to home in on the novelty of
          what was at stake in Asoka’s period. By vividly representing the central conflicts of
          those times, this account now gives an entirely different gloss on Romila Thapar’s remarks
          that this is a period of intense sectarian struggles and to her claim that Sixth Century
            <sc>BCE</sc> was ‘the century of universal questioning’ (1961, p. 4). It also helps us
          to see the real issues at stake in those struggles—a conflict between notions of weak and
          radical transcendence as well as between immanent and transcendental moralities. The sixth
          century <sc>BCE</sc> must have been a century of massive intellectual and emotional
          turmoil with gigantic social implications, the like of which had never been witnessed
          earlier. It appears that the need of the times was a <italic>public</italic> or
            <italic>political</italic> morality—a clear statement of not only how we must treat
          ourselves (found in Brahmanical philosophies of that time), but also a firm and
          well-grounded statement on how we treat each other and all living creatures (not
          explicitly found in Brahamical philosophy but found in Buddhism in a radically
          transcendent form, a transcendental morality) but one that could arbitrate between these
          multiple, radically different, often incommensurable rival conceptions so that each could
          coexist by discovering or evolving a morality that is learnt from one another’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2321023013482786">Kosambi, 2009</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-2321023013482786">10</xref></sup></p>

      <title>The Real Significance of the 7th Edict</title>
      <p>I hope by now we also possess a much better understanding of what exactly is so novel about
        the harmless looking statement in the 7th edict. Given the many-layered, incrementally deep
        conflicts involving several different groups and the necessity imposed by trade and urban
        conditions for them to cohabit, Asoka had to evolve some way to hold them together. Buddha’s
        teachings had provided him with conceptual resources to imagine something that would be more
        than ad hoc and tactical, something long lasting and endorsable from within each pasanda’s
            perspective.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-2321023013482786">11</xref></sup> They
        had given him the hope in the development of public norms from below and the redundancy of
        orders from above. One of them was that all pasandas must dwell everywhere in his
        empire.</p>
      <p>Among historians, only D.D. Kosambi appears to have grasped the true importance of this
        statement. Kosambi believes that the edict is meant to communicate primarily to leaders of
        each pasanda rather than directly to pasandas themselves. Through the 7th edict, Asoka
        effectively grants these leaders permission to travel freely everywhere in the kingdom to
        provide them an opportunity to teach and convert each other. Asoka impartially grants this
        privilege to religious teachers of all pasandas. It is likely that the edict became
        necessary because mutual interaction and the attempt to preach one’s own ethics to others
        had begun to cause severe friction, leading to the birth of local rules forbidding one
        pasanda from communicating with or worse entering into the territory of another
        pasanda—something akin to what Sudipta Kaviraj (in personal conversation with the author) in
        a different context has called back-to-back existence. Instead of perpetuating mutual
        exclusion and the resulting homogenization of each settlement, Asoka, it seems, gives
        assurances to the leader of each pasanda that they must feel secure everywhere and
        encourages free interaction and dialogue amongst them, albeit now regulated by moral
        norms.</p>
      <p>As mentioned above, he is able to do so by virtue of a major conceptual transformation,
        facilitated by a change in the background conditions, perhaps even in the social imaginary.
        A new form of society far more heterogeneous than the original simple tribe-community had
        come into being. Living together here was terribly different but at the same time no longer
        on optional extra but inevitable, a natural part of one’s environment. To respond to the
        crisis generated by radical heterogeneity, a new legitimating ethic had become necessary.
        Buddha’s teachings made possible a different conception of Dharma. It needed a great leap of
        imagination to arrive at the view that what we call dharma can be used not only for personal
        self fulfilment or the fulfilment of the needs of specific groups but rather to ease the
        newly emergent problems of a new form of society that simply could not do without diverse
        groups. It is a discovery of the first magnitude that dharma or religion can be used to ease
        the difficulties of early society, to make the common life of diverse elements of society
        easier. It necessitated that a collective ethic substitute correct ritual by good deeds for
        the sake of others.</p>
      <p>Moreover, Buddha’s teachings opened up the possibility of the radical socio-political
        restructuring of the world and the self by politico-moral action from above. Buddha’s ethic
        included the pivotal importance of moral action. Once one stands outside the whole cosmos
        and is able to see its limitations, and once the transcendental point from which one
        examines the cosmos is viewed as emanating a moral vision, it becomes possible to imagine a
        profound restructuring of society and polity in accordance with that vision. Once again,
        D.D. Kosambi is imaginatively on to this point when he says that more than a personal
        conversion of the emperor, there appears to have taken place in Asokan times a deeper
        conversion of the whole previous state apparatus. The king not only preaches a new morality
        but is able to launch radically new political and administrative measures that includes
        public morality as an essential ingredient, and provides a framework within which radically
        differing ethics can coexist and nourish one another (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2321023013482786">Kosambi, 2009</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-2321023013482786">12</xref></sup></p>

      <title>Search for a Common Ground</title>
      <p>What, despite profound differences in world-views, could the basis of such co-existence be?
        How may people not just live together, interact face-to-face, but live together
          <italic>well</italic>? For Asoka, a morally desirable living together is possible if
        everyone follows the Dhamma. Edict 12 says, ‘The beloved of the Gods does not wish to
        overvalue gifs and sacrifice. More important than these are the reverence one’s faith
        commands or the number of its followers or its core ethical values. Even more important than
        these ethical values are the essentials of all faiths and pasandas. It is these essentials
        that constitute the common ground of these seemingly conflicting conceptions’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-2321023013482786">13</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-2321023013482786">Zimmer, 1951</xref>, p. 104).</p>
      <p>What then is the common ground among rival conceptions? For Asoka, Dhamma constitutes the
        all-important common ground, the essentials, of all pasandas. What then are these
        essentials? Interpreters here give differing answers: Dhamma is sometimes seen as virtue,
        religious truth or simply piety. But the most convincing answer, consistent with what is
        mentioned above and provided by Obeyesekre and Tambiah is that Dhamma is akin to
        transcendental morality. If so, it is fair to say that for Asoka, rites and rituals have no
        meaning unless embedded within an ethical perspective and whatever ethical import is present
        in these gifts is overridden by their lack of moral significance. This is why they may be
        offered only <italic>as long as they are not injurious to anyone</italic> (humans as well as
        non-humans). No animal may be killed in order to be sacrificed. Nor should there be any
          <italic>samaja</italic> (assembly) for such a purpose, implying that other kinds of
        assemblies, especially the Sangha, are permissible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2321023013482786">Nikam &amp; Mckeon, 1962</xref>, pp. 50–60).</p>
      <p>What then is the content of dhamma? The fundamental principle of dhamma is
          <italic>vacaguti,</italic> variously interpreted as restraint on speech or control on
        tongue. It is significant that the edicts recommend that there be restraint on speech but
        have little to say on restraining actions. It is almost as if the spoken word is not only
        more important than the written word but also more significant than physical action. Here
        again, it is crucial to retrieve the surrounding context of Asokan edicts.</p>

    <sec id="section8-2321023013482786">
      <title>The 12th Edict: Restraint on Speech</title>
      <p>We can’t recover that world but we can imagine one where virtually nothing is written or
        read. Writing and reading have not yet taken possession of our psyche (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2321023013482786">Mukerjee, 1928</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-2321023013482786">14</xref></sup> Language is rooted and resides almost
        entirely in sound. Text, meaning something strung together, is also only spoken and heard.
        The entire complex of Art, Philosophy, and ‘Religion’—poetry, our deepest metaphysical
        thoughts, acts to honour gods and goddesses are all spoken, recited, sung, chanted and
        heard. All these are composed, transmitted, stored, reproduced and enriched orally. One
        might even say then that life itself is lived in sound. And, perhaps, destroyed in sound
        too.</p>
      <p>Not only life but also public life is lived and extinguished in sound. After all, when
        words flow off the tongue effortlessly, they also tumble out inadvertently and what is
        worse, carelessly. But then, words that matter must be enunciated with great care, even
        greater thought, for once uttered they can’t be withdrawn. It is important in such cultures
        to differentiate such unguarded speech from one that carries weight or is valued. Words in
        oral cultures have always had enormous power. They can beckon gods to help us tide over
        problems, create something out of nothing, empower or disempower others, turn them into
        stone, even kill them. Words can be weapons or an elixir. They can soothe or cause grievous
        hurt. In oral cultures, words have magical potency.</p>
      <p>One can hardly overestimate the immediacy and vibrancy of social interaction and, more
        pertinently, the agonistic energies in predominantly oral societies and its publics. Verbal
        duels, speech fights, word-wars, verbal tongue lashing of adversaries in intellectual
        combats—all these are commonly found in societies largely unaffected by writing. Moreover,
        vitriolic reciprocal name-calling exists frequently with fulsome expression of self-praise
        and excessive bragging about one’s own prowess.</p>
      <p>Given this context, one can now understand why oral speech acts appear to have more weight
        than all other forms of action. It is almost as if the greatest harm that might be inflicted
        on the other is through speech rather than physical action.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="section9-2321023013482786">
      <title>Two Forms of Self-Restraint</title>
      <p>We do not have much evidence of the verbal battles and hate speech of that period but the
        edicts imply that verbal wars in that period were intense and brutal. They simply had to be
        reined in. But what kind of speech must be curbed? Edict 12 says that speech that without
        reason disparages other pasandas must be restrained. Speech critical of others may be freely
        enunciated only if we have good reasons to do so (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2321023013482786">Mukerjee, 1928</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-2321023013482786">15</xref></sup> However, even when we have good reasons to
        be critical, one may do so only on appropriate occasions and even when the occasion is
        appropriate, one must never be immoderate. Critique should never belittle or humiliate
        others. Thus, there is a multi-layered, ever deepening restraint on one’s verbal speech
        against others. Let us call it <italic>other-related self-restraint</italic>. However, the
        edict does not stop at this. It goes on to say that one must not extol one’s own pasanada
        without good reason. Undue praise of one’s own pasanda is as morally objectionable as
        unmerited criticism of the faith of others. Moreover, the edict adds that even when there is
        good reason to praise one’s own pasanda, it too should be done only on appropriate occasions
        and even on those occasions, never immoderately. Undue or excessive self-glorification is
        also a way to make others feel small. For Asoka, blaming other pasandas out of devotion to
        one’s own pasandas and unreflective, uncritical, effulgent self-praise can only damage one’s
        pasanda. By offending and thereby estranging others, it undermines one’s capacity for mutual
        interaction and possible influence. Thus, there must equally be multi-textured, ever
        deepening restraint for oneself. Let this be <italic>self-related
        self-restraint</italic>.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere, in the 7th edict, Asoka emphasizes the need not only for self-restraint, samyama
        but also <italic>bhaavshuddhi</italic>, again a self-oriented act. Bhaavshuddhi is
        frequently interpreted as self-purification, purity of mind. However, this term is ambiguous
        between self-purification within an ethic of individual self-realization or one that at
        least includes cleansing one’s self of ill-will towards others. My own view is that in the
        context of the relevant edicts, the moral feeling of goodwill towards others or at least an
        absence of ill will towards others must be a constitutive feature of what is meant by
        bhaavshuddhi, a crucial part of the more general purification of <italic>bhaava</italic>.
        Self-restraint and self-purification are not just matters of etiquette or prudence. They
        have moral significance.</p>
      <p>Given all this, and in order to advance mutual understanding and mutual appreciation, it is
        better, the edict says, to have <italic>samovaya</italic>, concourse. An assembly of
        pasandas where they can hear one another out, communicate with one another. They may then
        become <italic>bahushruta</italic>, i.e., one who listens to all, the perfect listener, and
        open-minded. This way they will not only have atma pasanda vraddhi, the growth in the
        self-understanding of one’s own pasanda but also the growth of the essentials of all
        (saravadhi or saravraddhi). The edicts here imply that the ethical self-understanding of
        pasandas is not static but constantly evolving and such growth is crucially dependent on
        mutual communication and dialogue with one another. Blaming others without good reason or
        immoderately disrupting this process, apart from damaging dhamma, diminishes mutual growth
        of individual pasandas.</p>
      <p>The edicts add that no matter how generous you are with gifts and how sincere your devotion
        to rituals, if you lack samyama, bhaavshuddhi and the quality of bahushruta, then all the
        liberality in the world is in vain. Conversely, one who is unable to offer gifts but
        possesses the aforementioned virtues lives a dhammic life. Thus, one whose speech
        disrespects no one, who has no ill will towards others and who does no violence to living
        beings is truly dharmic. Dharma is realized not by sacrifice but by right speech and
        conduct.</p>

    <sec id="section10-2321023013482786">
      <title>Is this Toleration?</title>
      <p>Thapar says, ‘The 7th edict is pleading for toleration among all sects’ (1961, p. 139).
        Likewise, the term ‘religious tolerance’ is also used by Tambiah (1977, p. 64). Is the term
        ‘toleration’ or ‘tolerance’ appropriate in this context? In the classical seventeenth
        century meaning of the term, to tolerate is to refrain from interference in the activities
        of others even though one finds them morally disagreeable, even repugnant and despite the
        fact that one has the power to do so (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-2321023013482786">Mendus, 1989</xref>). Here one puts up with, even suffers the morally reprehensible
        activities of others. The powerless other escapes interference of the powerful because the
        latter shows mercy towards them, a virtue in the powerful exercised in relation to those who
        do not really deserve it. Let’s call this a hierarchical notion of toleration, given the
        asymmetry of power between the two groups and the attitude of superiority that one has
        towards the other. A second conception exists: Two groups, equally powerful, may also
        tolerate one another. Each has power to interfere in the activities of others and each finds
        the other morally repugnant but both refrain from doing so because the mutual costs are too
        high. This is modus vivendi toleration. Clearly the Asokan case does not fall within either
        of these two conceptions.</p>
      <p>A third conception is also non-hierarchical. Here A and B refrain from interfering in each
        other’s activities out of indifference and because they don’t particularly believe that one
        is more powerful than the other. True, they do not heartily approve of each other. The
        acceptance of one another may be somewhat grudging, more out of resignation than enthusiasm.
        It may also be true that this new disposition is a result of the dilution of the perceived
        power of the larger group, softened by the force of principles or reason or commerce or due
        to the disuse of collective power in matters concerning ultimate ideals. Neither really
        cares for another, as long as each keeps out of the other’s way. This is live and let live
        attitude, one that is found in post-industrial, individualist, liberal societies. Everyone,
        in this conception, has a right to be, as long as he or she causes no harm to others. I may
        disapprove of what you do but as long you do it in your privacy and not in my face, I don’t
        really care. The Asokan case does not fall under this conception either. If none of these
        conceptions is able to cover the Asokan case, then why use the term?</p>
      <p>The basic idea of toleration is that A does not accept B’s views or practices but still
        refrains from interfering in it, éven though A has the power. A fourth conception may not
        violate this basic idea and yet be distinct from the other three conceptions. Parents often
        put up with the blemishes of their children which they would not suffer in others. We choose
        to overlook a fault in our lover, even in our close friends that we would not excuse in
        others. We might endure deep difference in world views in fellow citizens because we value
        fraternity. In all such cases, we put up with dislikeable states of doing or being in others
        even if we have some power to do something about them simply because we have love or
        love-like feelings for them. Here one tolerates not despite hate but rather because one
        loves the other. A mixture of love, friendliness and fellow-feeling is in the background or
        becomes the ground of a different conception of toleration.</p>
      <p>Unlike other conceptions which presuppose the idea that oneness with significant others as
        well as God is achieved by abolishing/ignoring/belittling the radical other, i.e., by
        eliminating plurality, here, in the second conception, oneness is attained by accepting all
        radical others as equally significant because they variously manifest one supreme being or
        concept. Thus to tolerate is to refrain from interfering in the life of others not despite
        our hatred for them, nor because we are indifferent to them but because we love them as
        alternative manifestations of our own selves or deeply care for some basic norm common to
        all of us. We may not be able to do or be what they are, we may even dislike some of their
        beliefs and practices but we recognize that they are translations of our own selves or of
        gods within each of us. This binds us together in a relationship of lasting affection.</p>
      <p>So suppose A accepts the value of many but not all of B’s beliefs and practices but
        recognizes that the beliefs and practices he does not accept follow from some of those he
        does or that some beliefs and practices he is unable to endorse follow inescapably from B’s
        different background, then out of respect for some of his beliefs and practices, A would put
        up rather than interfere with those with which he disagrees. Asoka’s views, I believe to
        have shown, fall broadly within this fourth conception. If so, one might use the term
        ‘toleration’ in this context, as long as one is careful not to confuse it with the other
        three, more standard conceptions.</p>
      <p>But in the end it is perhaps better to avoid using the term ‘toleration’. No matter what
        its surrounding context, toleration focuses solely on a set of other-related
        self-restraints. But Asokan edicts clearly go beyond this by also making it necessary to
        observe a set of self-related self-restraints. In mutual toleration, each observes identical
        forms of self-restraint: I don’t interfere in your beliefs and practices and you don’t in
        mine. But the edicts speak instead of what we might call correlative self-restraints. One is
        not asked to refrain from excessively criticizing others and one self. Instead, one is asked
        not to, immoderately and without good reason, be critical of others or indulge in the
        correlative practice of self-praise, quite a different thing altogether. It is by
        simultaneously observing both forms of self-restraint that one completes a moral act. It is
        better to say then that the edicts outline original norms of civility and principled
        coexistence among radically differing pasandas in a deeply heterogeneous society.</p>
      <p>The distinction between the two forms of self-restraint is important because it helps us to
        more clearly see why Asoka’s political morality is not reducible to but goes beyond
        toleration in every sense of the term. An example here from our own time might illustrate my
        point. India is a country where a majority of its people either call themselves or are taken
        to be Hindus. Though not entirely, the ethos of many of India’s social and political
        institutions is saturated by one or the other strand of ‘Hinduism’. So, regardless of our
        evaluative judgement, it would not be entirely incorrect to say these institutions are
        somewhat Hinduized or wear a Hindu look. Yet, India also has Muslims, Christians, Parsees,
        Buddhists, Jains, Sikhs, atheists and people with many other not so easily definable
        outlooks. Sections of Hindus may find their practices disagreeable, morally discomforting or
        just downright strange but they tolerate them. They may collectively have power to interfere
        in them, even banish them, but they refrain from doing so. Indeed, legally they have no
        other option. These religious communities have rights not to be interfered within their
        religious and cultural practices. But the minorities will not be able to effectively
        exercise their rights, if Hindus do not possess the capacity for other-related
        self-restraint. Most Hindus do as a matter of fact exercise such restraint. But is this
        sufficient for a morally justified co-existence between Hindus and minority communities?
        Suppose then that community-specific rights of minorities are respected but Hindu
        self-assertion becomes more pronounced. Let us say they build new temples around every
        corner, ensure that these are mightier in size than mosques and churches, fund new radio and
        television channels that stream Hindu teachings and no other, introduce text books that
        speak largely of and glorify Hindu gods and goddesses, change national and state symbols in
        order to make them explicitly and exclusively Hindu and so on. What would its impact be on
        the psyche of the minorities? Most likely, it will increase their sense of social and
        cultural alienation. It will force them to feel left out of many public domains. It might
        even lower their self-esteem. Alternatively, Hindus can show some self-related
        self-restraint, so as not to show off, to not always wear their religion and culture on
        their sleeve, to not always advertize their wares, as it were. Indeed, to persistently
        announce in public than you are the boss in your own country might be a sure sign of deep
        rooted insecurities and anxieties, one that is both potentially damaging to others and to
        oneself. Abandoning this self-related self-restraint might then adversely affect everyone,
        destroy the very fabric of contemporary Indian society.</p>
      <p>I have argued that Asoka’s conception and policy of dhamma cannot be properly understood
        unless we vividly imagine the background conditions within which it emerged. The ambition of
        a new public morality widely endorsed by all affected groups could not have been possible
        without the pressing need to come up with a novel initiative in conditions of acute conflict
        among rival world views. At the centre of these struggles were bitter disputations between
        predominantly one-world oriented practitioners of ritual sacrifice and those who opposed
        such violent rituals and sought a new transcendental, world-negating morality for all. The
        availability of new conceptual resources forged during these disputes made it possible to
        devise a new policy that, though not guaranteed to succeed, gave the hope for a durable
        principled coexistence between groups engaged in fierce verbal disputes. This new political
        morality placed at the centre a series of self and other-related self-restraints. Only the
        simultaneous exercise of these new voluntary constraints could ensure amicable collective
        living. This policy might be called ‘toleration’ but only by a massive change in its
        dominant meaning. On standard interpretations, toleration involves the privatization of ill
        will or hatred. Both must be neutralized if not expunged. However, this new notion implies
        no such thing. Quite the contrary, for it presupposes in the background something closer to
        good will and respect. But in the end, even this might not be appropriate. Till we discover
        a suitable prakrit, pali or sanskrit term, it is best to call it civil.</p>

      <title>Conclusion: Lessons for Our Own Times</title>
      <p>Contemporary polities, including India can draw lessons from each of these normative models
        of how religious diversity must be handled. From Asokan edicts we learn first that we need a
        minimalist common foundation built from elements found in every normative perspective that
        shapes the lives of cohabiting citizens. For Asoka such a foundation consisted of purity of
        heart and restraint on speech. Contemporary polities, likewise, must search for analogues of
        these ethical norms. An even more important lesson to be drawn is that the moral restraints
        that constitute this foundation must be viewed not only as obligation or duties towards
        others but as something we owe to ourselves. An excessive focus on obligation towards others
        frequently neglects that other related moral norms cannot function adequately unless proper
        self-related norms that go deeper than our interest are also put in place.</p>
      <p>From constitutional Indian secularism we might learn that in religiously diverse societies,
        democratic states must maintain a distance from all systemic religious and non-religious
        world views. The primary goals of a polity cannot be defined by any one world view. All
        citizen of a polity must find ways of identifying with the state that governs them.
        Moreover, such distance need not entail strict separation between state and different
        religious and non-religious world views. The state may engage with or disengage from them,
        engage with them positively, to help them or negatively, to hinder them, and may do so
        differentially, that is, relate to some more than others, all depending on which course of
        action minimizes inter or intra-religious domination. Contemporary India seems to have
        forgotten this crucial but elementary founding idea. Most western or west-inspired polities
        appear not to have even begun to learn the alphabet or grammar of this normative
        language.</p>

        <p>‘His Sacred and Gracious majesty desires that in all places should reside people of
          diverse sects (pasandas). For they all desire restraint of passions (samyama) and purity
          of heart (bhava-sudhi). But men are of various inclinations and of various passions. They
          may thus perform the whole or a part (of their duties). But of him whose liberality is,
          too, not great, restraint of passion, inner purity, gratitude and constancy of devotion
          should be indispensable and commendable’ (translated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2321023013482786">Mukerjee, 1928</xref>, pp. 149–150).</p>

        <title>Rock Edict XII</title>
        <p>King Priyadarsi honours men of all faiths, members of religious orders and laymen alike,
          with gifts and various marks of esteem. Yet he does not value either gifts or honours as
          much as growth in the qualities essential (<italic>sàra-vadhi</italic>) to men of all
          faiths. This growth could take many forms, but its root is in guarding one’s speech
            (<italic>vachi-gutì</italic>) to avoid extolling one’s own faith and disparaging the
          faith of others improperly or when the occasion is appropriate, immoderately.</p>
        <p>The faiths of others all deserve to be honoured for one reason or another. By honouring
          them, one exalts one’s own faith and at the same time performs a service to the faith of
          others. By acting otherwise, one injures one’s own faith and also does disservice to that
          of others. For if a man extols his own faith and disparages another because of devotion to
          his own and because he wants to glorify it, he seriously injures his own faith.</p>
        <p>Therefore concord (<italic>samavàyo</italic> or <italic>samanvaya</italic>) alone is
          commendable, for through concord men may learn and respect the conception of Dharma
          accepted by others. King Priyadarsi desires men of all faiths to know each other’s
          doctrines and to acquire sound doctrines. Those who are attached to their particular
          faiths should be told that King Priyadarsi does not value gifts and hours as much as the
          growth in the qualities essential to religion in men of all faiths. Many officials are
          assigned to tasks bearing on this purpose—the officers in charge of spreading Dharma, the
          superintendents of women in the royal household, the inspectors of cattle and pasture
          lands, and other officials. The objective of these measures is the promotion of each man’s
          particular faith and the glorification of Dharma (translated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2321023013482786">Nikam &amp; McKeon, 1962</xref>, pp. 58–59).</p>

          <p>This is one of the most difficult terms to translate. Its standard meaning is
            ‘heretic’, but clearly Asoka does not use it in this sense. The standard translation is
            ‘sect’ which is unsatisfactory because of its Christian association. There is an
            imaginative suggestion, now rejected, that it might be linked to
            <italic>prasha</italic>, a term in <italic>avestha</italic> and similar to
              <italic>prashna</italic> in Sanskrit, meaning ‘question’. An imaginative translation
            could then have been a group of questioners or enquirers. But there is no strong
            evidence to support this view. Radha Kumud Mookerjee links it to
              <italic>Parishad</italic>, meaning assembly. But that too is not accepted by everyone.
            Perhaps, the best translation would be ‘followers of a school of thought or teachings’.
            I use it here to mean this and will continue to use the Prakrit word ‘pasanda’ in the
            main text.</p>

          <p>The identification of King Priyadarshi with Asoka was confirmed by an inscription
            discovered in 1837(I understand from Dhammika’s introduction that this inscription was
            discovered in 1837. However, the confirmation that King Priyadasi mentioned in the edict
            was that Asoka came only in the year 1915. Following is what Dhammika wrote: In 1837,
            James Prinsep succeeded in deciphering an ancient inscription on a large stone pillar in
            Delhi. Several other pillars and rocks with similar inscriptions had been known for some
            time and had attracted the curiosity of scholars. Prinsep’s inscription proved to be a
            series of edicts issued by a king calling himself ‘Beloved-of-the-Gods, King Priyadasi’.
            In the following decades, more and more edicts by this same king were discovered and
            with increasingly accurate decipherment of their language, a more complete picture of
            this man and his deeds began to emerge. Gradually, it dawned on scholars that the King
            Priyadasi of the edicts might be the King Asoka so often praised in Buddhist legends.
            However, it was not until 1915, when another edict actually mentioning the name Asoka
            was discovered, that the identification was confirmed).</p>

          <p>There is virtual consensus that this was a period of bitter sectarian strife.
            Bhandarkar says, ‘It is plain that there was friction and bitter spirit between these
            (Ajivikas, Nirgranthas and Buddhists) sects’ and ‘When Asoka lived religious fanaticism
            and sectarianism was rampant’ (Bhandarkar,1925, p. 112).</p>

          <p>Also see Edward Fitz Patrick Crangle (1994, p. 28). Crangle says, <disp-quote>
              <p>Early Vedic practices involve, by and large, a worldly attitude whereby the
                worshipper seeks to appease gods by performing various ritual sacrificial
                ceremonies. The Rg Veda, however, mentions some opposed to Aryan rituals … These
                were unbelievers, riteless people … Outstanding in this regard were the Munis … The
                Rig Vedas offer the earliest literary evidence for the existence of Munis.</p>

          <p>D.D. Kosambi also mentions the existence of non-Aryan people called nagas who were
            settled in parts of what now are Bihar and UP. They did not speak the Aryan language and
            appeared not to have any contact with the Aryans. This appears to confirm G.C. Pande’s
            claim that a group of wondering ascetics called Munis, marginal to Vedic life, also
            existed in the region.</p>

          <p>‘There were sound economic reasons for Asoka’s change to rule by morality, from the

              (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2321023013482786">Kosambi, 2009</xref>, p. 223).</p>

          <p>Kosambi proposes that a number of sects with subtle metaphysical differences arose in
            protest against the ‘monstrous cancerous growth of sacrificial ritual in the tribal
            kingdoms’. The greatest fruit of the <italic>yajna</italic> sacrifice was success in
            war; fighting was glorified for its own sake as the natural mode of life for the
            kshatriyas, while the brahmin’s duty and means of livelihood was the performance of
            vedic sacrifices (2009, p. 166).</p>

          <p>Sadly, this might have been the primary reason why his empire was so brief, ephemeral
            and anomalous. Equally, this surely is the only reason why Asoka’s Dhamma continues to
            be remembered more than 2000 years later.</p>

          <p>Kosambi claims that ‘Finally the rules governing ordinary people and the ruler himself
            stemmed from the same moral source. This was quite unlike the statecraft recommended by
            Chanakya where an entirely amoral ruler committing all kinds of crimes against subjects
            and neighbours reigned over a morally regulated population’ (2009, p. 200).</p>

          <p>Zimmer (1951, p.104) argues that Asoka, rather than trying to uphold one view or the
            other—and thereby identifying himself with one school or the other—sought to emphasize
            what he held to be the ‘essence’ common to all sects and schools. Doing otherwise would
            have been to encourage a more vociferous conflict of ideas and practices among these
            sects and schools, thereby compromising the concord and cohesion he was trying to build
            up within his kingdom.</p>

          <label>14.</label>
          <p>This is denied by many scholars who wrote early in the twentieth century. Mukerjee
            writes that literature and culture seem to have filtered down to the masses so as to
            produce a comparatively large percentage of literacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2321023013482786">Mukerjee, 1928</xref>, p. 102). Vincent Smith (1920, p.
            139) points out that the existence of edicts in the vernacular shows mass literacy. Such
            views are naive. The epigraphic habit had barely begun to form in Asoka’s time. The
            rulers had begun to play with the new technology, no doubt. Asoka can even be credited
            for having realized the enormous future potential of writing and to have been among the
            first to have used it for dissemination and ‘moral conquest’. But mass literacy at that
            time is inconceivable, because there was little need for it. Besides, a large
            heterogeneous empire dictated that edicts be written in different languages. Nothing
            about widespread literacy can be inferred from it. To say that the edicts were written
            in the vernacular would entail that Greek and Armaic were vernacular languages, which is
            absurd. It is best to go along with Stanley Tambiah on this issue. He writes, ‘The
            intellectual milieu in which early science and philosophy advanced was essentially oral,
            small scale and face to face. If this was true of early Greece, it was emphatically true
            of India in the Axial Age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-2321023013482786">Tambiah,
