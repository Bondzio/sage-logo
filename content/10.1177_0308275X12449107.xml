<abstract>
<p>This article examines the globalization of civil society through the proliferation of non-governmental organizations in developing countries. By focusing on the technologies and methods through which these new forms are globalized their expansion becomes explicable without recourse to theories of neoliberal governmentality. New organizational templates and the role of writing are highlighted in the dissemination of civil society forms in developing countries. These organizations do not represent an extension of state power but a multiplicity of peripheral positions from which actors seek contractual engagement in development relations.</p>

<p>Numerous small-scale non-governmental organizations (NGOs) are seeking to establish themselves as development actors in rural Tanzania. Often comprising serving or former public officials or staff of development projects, who consider themselves to be ‘volunteers’, such organizations aim to form partnerships with larger development agencies in order to attain a place within the social relations of international development. Tanzania as a state has long been constituted through such relations. The past 15 years have been characterized by new forms of international influence and inclusion within transnational policy regimes associated with the hegemonic policy models of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF), promoted through multiple relations with a range of bilateral, multilateral and non-governmental donor organizations.</p>
<p>The extension of small-scale NGOs in Africa, which can count as what donor organizations consider a local civil society sector, are in part an effect of these endeavours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0308275X12449107">Robins et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0308275X12449107">Fisher, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0308275X12449107">Heydemann and Hammack, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0308275X12449107">Mitlin et al., 2006</xref>). In Tanzania, perhaps the majority of these organizations are not engaged in development projects and have not obtained access to donor funds. The proliferation of local NGOs here is not best understood in terms of the practical extension of neoliberal governing in which civil society organizations assume responsibilities of the state within relations of verticality and encompassment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0308275X12449107">Ferguson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0308275X12449107">Gupta and Ferguson, 2002</xref>). New local NGOs regard themselves as development agents in waiting, occupying a position of adjacency to development relations.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0308275X12449107">1</xref></sup> Consequently, much of their everyday practice is oriented towards enacting a state of readiness for inclusion in development. Although individuals associated with such organizations may not be active in development work, they are actively engaged in the work of organizational development. This work takes the form of engagement in what are termed ‘capacity building’ activities, as well as the production of a range of representational devices which articulate the possibility of a future engagement in development. These include the forms of documentation associated with developmental civil society – mission statements, budgets and project proposals – as well as enacting readiness through institutional conformity to accepted civil society forms. Anticipatory development as a set of practices through which a relation of adjacency is established characterizes the kinds of work associated with local civil society organizations (CSOs).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0308275X12449107">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>This article explores the extension of the local NGO sector in Tanzania through an exploration of its core practices of anticipatory development. Local NGOs in Tanzania, as in some other aid-dependent settings, strive to convert their peripherality to development orders into an adjacency which will permit them to be recognized and hence included in funding streams (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0308275X12449107">Dill, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0308275X12449107">Green, 2010a</xref>). Such relations of adjacency to development are not particularly new in Tanzania, where national discourses of inclusion in development subject to citizen ownership and responsibility are long-standing, as are relations in which the national government relies on external assistance for a substantial proportion of public spending. Where aspirations routinely exceed available financial capacities of national and local governments, processes of planning and budgeting assume disproportionate significance in the everyday practice of governance at national, district and village levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0308275X12449107">Eriksen, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0308275X12449107">Schneider, 2007</xref>: 31; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0308275X12449107">Wildavsky, 1986</xref>), as does trying to obtain funding through fostering relationships with ‘<italic>wafadhili</italic>’ (donors). What is interesting about the contemporary situation is the ways in which these practices have shifted laterally to emergent organizations, as these assume positions in the reordering of Tanzanian governance and development.</p>
<p>Neoliberal political orderings have brought about important changes, not so much in the way that the state is organized in practice but in the division of labour between government and citizens and between village and district government. Local NGOs and the volunteers who comprise them compete for donor funds to undertake what has become a business of facilitating community development. Ambiguities in the constitution of civil society as a contractor in development partnerships are accentuated where discourses of sustainability and the idea of civil society as distinct from private enterprise are not only unrealistic but also occlude the motivations of actors in attempting to become social entrepreneurs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0308275X12449107">Swidler and Watkins, 2008</xref>). Almost two decades of liberalization in Tanzania have not led to a situation in which enterprise models structure the organization of state and public services, which remain dominated by government, but the creation of markets in services for government has consequences for the civil society sector, which becomes a contractor to government. Market relations and enterprise models, through competitive tendering and the sale of services, structure the organization of local and national civil society where organizations compete to become development contractors. The ‘knowledge economy of capacity building’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0308275X12449107">Phillips and Ilcan, 2004</xref>: 393) is central to this process, as are the technologies of replicabilty and dissemination that enable the dispersal of civil society forms. The extension of local NGOs in rural districts is explained in relation to the emerging market in development activity, the replicability of NGO practices and technologies of organization, and low barriers to entry.</p>
<sec id="sec1-0308275X12449107"><title>Civil society and development in Tanzania</title>
<p>This article is based on ethnographic work as an anthropologist carried out at various times between 1989 and 2005, mostly in Ulanga and Kilombero districts, and a much shorter period of research on social change and civil society carried out in Magu District in 2010.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0308275X12449107">3</xref></sup> My research has been supplemented by intermittent periods of engagement within development organizations working in Tanzania, including a year, between 1999 and 2000 spent working on governance reforms and developing CSOs for the UK’s Department for International Development (DFID). Since 2000, my work as a consultant on governance issues with several development agencies has led me to engage with NGOs in various capacities: as categories of the policy imaginary with roles to play in improving governance, as recipients of donor funding and as vocal policy advocates in Dar es Salaam. In the past decade Tanzania has witnessed an unprecedented expansion in the number of small-scale organizations seeking registration as NGOs. Initially associated with the major cities long integrated into development relationships, ongoing decentralization initiatives combined with donor programmes of civil society support are pushing this extension into small rural towns. I have increasingly come across new kinds of smaller organization at meetings in rural districts or assuming positions as ‘stakeholders’ in local government consultations. In the course of everyday conversations I have been told about the NGO projects of numerous professional people, including university teachers, district officials and clergy. Offices of local NGOs specializing in <italic>mazingira</italic> (environment), WASH (Water Sanitation and Health) or, almost everywhere, HIV and AIDS, are now not unusual in administrative centres smaller than the district. In district centres such as Bagamoyo and Magu, with populations of well under 40,000, brightly painted signboards at road junctions announce the presence of international <italic>and</italic> local NGOs.</p>
<p>This presence in district centres is more than visually striking. It presents a strident claim to reorganize social relations in Tanzania in relation to development. This reorganization is not in practice of the kind envisaged in the donor policies influenced by World Bank conceptual frames, which equate civil society expansion with enhancing accountability and creating social capital. In fostering the establishment of civil society as a distinct category of institutions, it enables the basis of differentiation between state and non-state and between market and non-market entities, forming a niche in which organizations achieving categorization as CSOs can potentially flourish. Such flourishing is made possible because of the redesign of development relations in which what is classified as civil society is contracted to play a particular role. Under current institutional regimes of international development as enacted in Tanzania,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0308275X12449107">4</xref></sup> local NGOs assume a facilitation role in relation to communities as agents and subjects of development interventions, a role previously assumed by district officials and by representatives of village governments. What amounts, in effect, to the privatization of development facilitation does not imply a wholesale transformation in the ways that development is imagined and implemented in rural districts, which continues to be based on the idea of the village as a unit of development action and responsibility. It does offer opportunities for third parties to become development entrepreneurs. Because many district NGOs are made up of staff or former staff of local government authorities, and because such staff are frequently engaged by them as short-term consultants to provide technical expertise, this situation consolidates professional relations of inequality between districts and villages, district staff and village residents, and between agents and subjects of development.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-0308275X12449107"><title>Community development after socialism</title>
<p>The privatization of rural development through civil society is a significant transition in the political culture of Tanzania which, under socialism, associated entrepreneurial activity with capitalism (<italic>ubepare</italic>) and self-interest (<italic>ubinafsi</italic>). Responsibility for mobilizing populations to ‘<italic>maendeleo</italic>’ (development), connoting a range of activities which supported national aspirations to progress, rested on government staff and members of village government (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0308275X12449107">Caplan, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0308275X12449107">Maghimbi, 1995</xref>). Government was structured hierarchically into national, regional, district and village tiers, in which policy comes down from the top and plans submitted upwards from villages, through various committee structures. Villagers, as socialist citizens, bore ultimate responsibility for development as a national project made up of the development activities of the country’s villages multiplied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0308275X12449107">Leftwich, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0308275X12449107">Pratt, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0308275X12449107">Saul, 2002</xref>). Village government operated as the lowest tier of government aligned with national development objectives, village leaders as representatives of government and of the ruling party (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0308275X12449107">Abrahams, 1985</xref>).</p>
<p>Economic and political liberalization have altered this system considerably in some respects, but not in others, resulting in a hybrid institutional architecture of governance comprising a mix of community development village-based structures and neoliberal forms. Systems of village governance, consisting of a council and committee structure, are in the process of being strengthened through the current phase of ‘decentralization by devolution’ (D by D) as part of local government reform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0308275X12449107">Green, 2010b</xref>). Whereas under socialism villages operated as a lowest tier of government within a vertical system in which villagers contributed labour and revenue for local infrastructure projects that would contribute to district development plans, the village has regained more autonomous status as a unit whose primary function is no longer its integration into wider systems but its status as a unit and agent of development. Under D by D, villages as self-governing entities resume their roles as communities responsible for their own development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0308275X12449107">Lange, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0308275X12449107">Lund, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0308275X12449107">PMORALG, 2007</xref>), a role simultaneously paradigmatic of the new politics of development to which Tanzania is subjected and that pre-dates African socialism.</p>
<p>As Nikolas Rose and others have shown, the idea of community occupies an important place in the responsiblization strategies of neoliberal governing, replacing the amorphous social as a domain of policy impact with the reflexive autonomy of communities responsible for governing themselves (1996: 57, 1999: 172; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0308275X12449107">Amin, 2005</xref>: 619). It is not, however, novel. Community as location and actor in development played a key role in colonial development policy in the decade immediately preceding independence. What changed after 1961 was not the salience of community as development actor, but the equation of fiscal with moral responsibility. Tanzania, as a poor country, no longer entitled to support through the Colonial Development and Welfare mechanism, could not finance the development of rural communities. Rural people now had to contribute to their own development through income-generating activities, ensuring household food security and the construction of infrastructure.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0308275X12449107">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>As the community development model was instituted in the years immediately after independence, district files record the difficulties faced by government staff trying to bring this about. Reluctance to contribute cash or labour was not interpreted by officials as political commentary on what was under socialism to be called ‘<italic>kujitegemea</italic>’ (self-reliance) but as indication of the unreadiness of the rural population to fully commit to the aspirations of development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0308275X12449107">Blommaert, 1997</xref>: 140).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0308275X12449107">6</xref></sup> Government circulars remark on the necessity of education and the need to adopt a unified approach in which technical staff work with rural dwellers on strategies to attack the three well-known enemies – poverty, ignorance and disease. This could not be done by working only through officials. Changing culture and attitudes required the active participation of ‘influential people’, the middle class who did not hold to backward customs and were receptive to modernity.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0308275X12449107">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>Community development as modality of intervention segued into the constitution of the village as development actor under Nyerere’s socialism, a transition which allowed both for radical community initiatives such as the Ruvuma Development Association, later a model for the creation of <italic>ujamaa</italic> villages, and villages as the targets of top-down control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0308275X12449107">Jennings, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0308275X12449107">McHenry, 1979</xref>). Not all villagers shared the government’s ambitious aspirations to development. Socialist rule is associated with forced villagization and the enforced participation of villagers in development projects through by-laws, imprisonment and fines. Such practices persisted in many parts of the country, along with a sustained discourse among government officials and party leaders about peasant backwardness and culture or, where peasants showed initiative and veered towards market relations, their tendency towards self-interest and capitalism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0308275X12449107">Costello, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0308275X12449107">Maghimbi, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0308275X12449107">Samoff, 1979</xref>). Agricultural cooperatives were incorporated into party structures and independent organizations, with the exception of professional associations for state employees and religious organizations, restricted. Opportunities for personal advancement during this period were limited in practice to public service and religious institutions, both closely aligned to educational opportunity and hence with monopolies for the production and reproduction of the middle class and to professional practice, which depended on a relationship of differentiation from villagers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0308275X12449107">Gibbon, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0308275X12449107">Jennings, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>By the late 1990s this system was at breaking point. Self-reliance in a context of rural under-production and often basic self-sufficiency in food was a failure. Tanzania resumed relations with the IMF and embarked on a rigorous programme of structural adjustment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0308275X12449107">Rugumamu, 1997</xref>). Economic stagnation, massive indebtedness and the de facto liberalization of basic trade through a thriving black market (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0308275X12449107">Bryceson, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0308275X12449107">Tripp, 1997</xref>) prepared fertile ground for the seeds of political and economic liberalization systematically sown by Tanzania’s renewed relationships with donors under the auspices of development partnerships. A donor-financed report by Hellenier advocated greater national ownership in setting development agendas in Tanzania. This, combined with status as a Highly Indebted Poor Country, paved the way for debt relief and budget support through national poverty reduction strategies brought into being a range of <italic>ex ante</italic> conditionalities, which heralded significant transformations in the business of politics and the organization of aid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0308275X12449107">Harrison, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0308275X12449107">Kelsall, 2002</xref>). Governance concerns, the priority for international financial institutions’ (IFIs) analysts, came to dominate the Tanzanian policy process and the practice of government.</p>
<p>Public sector reform, fiscal accountability and decentralization as key policies for Tanzania were implemented through successive multi-donor funded interventions from the early 1990s with a gradual transition towards direct budgetary support ten years later. These processes have had profound effects, creating a micro-climate in which new class relations and organizational forms could thrive. First, the governance agenda promoted by international donors opened up a space for new organizational forms as civil society, and this space was rapidly populated by international NGOs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0308275X12449107">Mercer, 2003</xref>). This necessitated a shift from service delivery to new areas of activity of accountability, sensitization and advocacy specified in donor policy models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0308275X12449107">Semboja and Therkildsen, 1995</xref>). Second, substantial amounts of hard currency were made available through government budgets, increased foreign investment and finance for civil society activity. Finally, university expansion, new forms of private sector employment and opportunities in the multiplying development agencies operational in Tanzania swelled the professional middle classes and those with associated competences in office work, organizing and documentation. The political economy of capacity building (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0308275X12449107">Phillips and Ilcan, 2004</xref>) sustains a real economy of hotels, conference centres, consultants and experts, both international and national (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0308275X12449107">Green, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0308275X12449107">Swidler and Watkins, 2009</xref>). In this context, the forms, artefacts and behaviours associated with development are not only widely circulated, they also come to be powerful signifiers of aspiration. Funding proposals written in the style of development agency documentation now constitute a form through which requests for financial help are couched to potential patrons. I have received several of these, including a request for cash from the owner of a local cooked food outlet (<italic>mgahawa</italic>) in Mahenge District in the style of an application for project funding. The document is headed: ‘appeal for sponsorship of financial aid for empowering the socio-economic development status of the Star restaurant’ (name changed). Such proposals are not unusual. Sometimes produced with a potential benefactor in mind, they are also commissioned by people with personal ‘projects’ so as to be prepared in the event of meeting a possible donor in future.</p>
<p>Local NGOs now populate the landscape of peri-urban districts where development is being reframed as the outcome of an interaction between villagers as communities and a new category of non-government development professionals. Jenny (not her real name), a young community development officer working for local government in Magu explained the role of different actors to me.<disp-quote>
<p>Our role is to be change agents – my office has to promote change so that people can move from the state they are in to one of sustainable development. This is essential because people need to be made aware now that government does not do anything like in the past and they have to rely on their own resources to bring development.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>In Jenny’s view, development is not simply a matter of material resources. People’s values and practices inhibit their capacities to become fully developmental.<disp-quote>
<p>People have negative attitudes. There are inherited customs which are bad – the old men marrying young schoolgirls, and superstitions such as witchcraft and so on. People need to be made aware. This is what they have to be sensitized about. To change their behaviour, to change the attitudes of the people.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>She explained that because government by itself lacks the resources to bring about the kinds of changes which can make people developmental, NGOs, supported by donors, must play a role in sensitization, in educating villagers in how to become ready for development.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-0308275X12449107"><title>Scripting civil society</title>
<p>Local NGOs play this role not because of inherent qualities of civil society or because they are close to the poor as their imagined constituency, but because they are scripted to do so in the development architecture of contemporary Tanzania, and places like it.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0308275X12449107">8</xref></sup> Development finance amounting to more than half of national budgets has heavily steered national policy agendas towards governance objectives, prioritizing decentralization and an increased emphasis on fiscal, rather than political, accountability. The idea of civil society comes into play here as a set of institutions comprising a ‘third pillar’ between the market and the state that can foster civic engagement and ‘make democracy work’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0308275X12449107">Putnam, 1993</xref>). From the early 2000s international donors embarked on their efforts to develop a civil society sector in Tanzania that could fulfil the accountability and community engagement aspirations of the new approach to aid. Couched in the idiom of partnership as implying both equality and contract, such organizations were to assume formal obligations in relation to the governance agenda (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0308275X12449107">Phillips and Ilcan, 2004</xref>). Initially, international NGOs fulfilled this function, engaging in the policy dialogue around the first Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper as a conditionality for aid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0308275X12449107">Mercer, 2003</xref>). Gradually, these same organizations, with the financial support of key bilateral and multilateral agencies, worked on building the kinds of national organizations which could operate as NGOs and assume civil society functions. Operating as an NGO was necessary for these entities to receive funding from other NGOs, hence to be part of a chain of development contracting. Operating as civil society entailed being functionally incorporated into governance relations, through taking on the work necessitated by it, such as engaging in policy dialogue and monitoring accountability.</p>
<p>Existing national popular and NGOs at the start of the Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS) decade could not easily be brought into these kinds of relations. Few in number, associated with elite advocacy groups in major cities or with strong political and professional interests, most were not amenable to inclusion in this socio-political restructuring. Moreover, the commitment to decentralization and the demand to reach the rural masses entailed devolving the drivers of civil society expansion. The 2002 NGO policy went some way towards this goal, reducing the costs of registration and hence of gaining official status, which allows NGOs look for funds. A national funding facility, the Foundation for Civil Society, which supports local NGOS working in specific areas of sensitization, HIV and AIDS, and social protection was established in 2002. In 1993 there were 224 registered NGOs in Tanzania (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0308275X12449107">Lange et al., 2000</xref>: 6). Today there are at least five times as many.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0308275X12449107">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>The scale of this sustained investment in the promotion of novel social forms has tangible effects which are evident in the district centres comprising this second wave of civil society extension. This can be clearly seen in Magu town, the administrative centre of a rural district situated on the outskirts of Mwanza, Tanzania’s second city. Integrated into the global fish industry centred on Lake Victoria and the dynamic regional economy around it, Magu’s favourable integration into Tanzanian political economy is reiterated in policy fields. Magu has long been part of large-scale programming by major donors, notably UNICEF, which attracted a number of significant players to the district during the 1990s. The district is now home to over 50 groups registered as NGOs or community-based organizations (CBOs) and an umbrella body, Magu Civil Society Network (MACSONET) to represent them (Green et al., in press).</p>
<p>Magu District conforms to the formal architecture of development in terms of civil society marshalled visibly as a sector, that is as an entity like ‘economy’ or ‘health’, which can be articulated with other entities in policy representations of cause and effect. It conforms, too, in the ways that civil society presents itself on the ground. This presence is tangible in the offices of numerous small-scale organizations found on every street in the town, with their bright signboards and elaborate logos painted on the wooden shutters of converted residential houses, recalling the conversion by international NGOs of large residences into offices on the periphery of the town. Although some organizations have large offices crammed with desks and flip charts denoting projects with which they are engaged, walls pasted with organizational charts and campaign posters from development agencies, many more appear as shuttered buildings with little sign of activity. In between these two extremes are the more usual kind of organization, whose external face comprises an acronym, an office and some ‘volunteers’, the manifestation of which is a room or two with desks and chairs, and a chart naming key post-holders within the organization. Civil society activity is visible in the daily life of the town in other ways, not so much in terms of the projects with which organizations claim to be engaged – generally in rural communities – the ‘virtuous location’ of civil society activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0308275X12449107">Mindry, 2001</xref>: 1189), but in the town’s few photocopy shops and internet cafes. Smartly dressed men and women bring documents for printing, laminating and binding and pay by the hour to sit hunched over sticky keyboards working on funding proposals.</p>
<p>CSOs are now an established peri-urban form in Tanzania, along with another institutional innovation of the 1990s, the district umbrella organization or civil society network. These district networks were an outcome of the organization-building around the consultation process for the NGO policy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0308275X12449107">AKDN, 2007</xref>: 16), which was designed to produce a national map of verticality and encompassment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0308275X12449107">Gupta and Ferguson, 2002</xref>: 982), in which regions and districts mediated between community and the sate. Networking is considered to be a characteristically civil society activity, playing on the association between community activism and social capital (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0308275X12449107">Riles, 2001</xref>). Sustained by the support of donors with strong civil society commitments, and because ‘networking’ has a place in the new relations of accountability between local government and civil society, district umbrella organizations strive to have offices in town centres, staking a claim for the status of civil society in district power relations. The offices of district umbrella organizations display these relations representationally through organizational charts and lists of member organizations. Such listings reveal the emergent mix of the range of organizations claiming affiliation and hence status as district civil society – church and diocesan organizations, including youth groups and parishes; youth networks, themselves established as projects of other organizations; and the local NGO as a special kind of small-scale organization.</p>

<sec id="sec4-0308275X12449107"><title>Constituting NGOs in Tanzania</title>
<p>In actuality, civil society as a discursive category in Tanzania is largely confined to development policy materials and documentation in English. Although the category of <italic>asasi za kiraia</italic>, meaning citizen organizations, is used as the policy equivalent of civil society in formal spaces such as the Foundation for Civil Society, ordinary people and activists alike classify district CSOs in terms of those they are seen to emulate through the usual descriptor of ‘NGO’, used by persons whether speaking Kiswahili or English. Local NGOs therefore are expected to be like the development NGOs on which they are modelled, to have offices, staff and projects, and to be involved in development as a funded field of projects and donor relations. As such, they are perceived to be quite distinct from the farmer organizations and pressure groups which characterized Tanzanian political orders in the 1970s and 1960s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0308275X12449107">Gibbon, 2001</xref>). Local NGOs display a common organizational structure, with official positions of chair, treasurer and secretary aligned around a developmental purpose usually articulated in the terms of organizational development as vision and mission. They are not expected to be membership organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0308275X12449107">Shivji, 2004</xref>: 689). The most significant personnel are those in leadership positions, usually founder members, supported by between 8 and 15 associates defining themselves as ‘volunteers’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0308275X12449107">10</xref></sup> Like the international NGOs whose forms they adopt, these organizations have a name, reducible to an acronym, and, where possible, offices identified by signboards as artefacts of official status. Some of these attributes, including their statement of objectives, organizational structure, name and office address, are necessitated by the requirements of NGO registration. Others, the office itself, with its desk and paper work, the signboards and the dress favoured by staff and volunteers associates NGO work with development work as modern, professional practice.</p>
<p>NGOs are required to have a constitution setting out their aims and organizational structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0308275X12449107">AKDN, 2007</xref>: 20). This constitution is literal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0308275X12449107">Strathern, 2006</xref>: 189). Constitutional statements of aspiration provide the basis for organizational self-identification and, in enabling self-description, for replication among mutually recognizable entities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0308275X12449107">Strathern, 1999</xref>: 173). The missions and visions which are part of these documents do not simply identify one organization among numerous others. They enact the moral constitution of civil society groupings as quite distinct from private businesses or government institutions. Emphasizing this difference is fundamental to the constitution of Tanzanian civil society, as detailed in the NGO Policy which states that: ‘NGOs shall have specific characteristics which distinguish them from government organizations or other registered private groupings’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0308275X12449107">URT, 2001</xref>:4). This difference is important in district settings, where many such organizations involve local government staff and where what such organizations do in competing for contracts could be interpreted as profit-seeking and hence as fundamentally self-interested. Here, as in much of Africa, self-interest equates with negative social values around selfishness and works against the kind of patrimonial alliance-building sought by would-be civil society entrepreneurs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0308275X12449107">Green, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0308275X12449107">Swidler, 2009</xref>). Private development businesses have yet to arise officially in district development because what donors are buying into here is not the efficiency and effectiveness claimed for private sector consultancy firms but the moral associations of civil society and assumed relation with beneficiaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0308275X12449107">Hearn, 2001</xref>: 341). The moral dimension of community engagement is valorized in training materials and civil society discourse, not only about the suitably deserving status of beneficiaries – orphans, people affected by HIV and AIDS, the disabled, poor people and so on – but also in terms of the repertoire of participatory, hence community-oriented, tools with which such organizations are expected to work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0308275X12449107">Green, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0308275X12449107">2010b</xref>). Persons paid by CSOs for the duration of project contracts therefore do not present themselves as staff who not receive salary (<italic>mshahara</italic>), but as ‘volunteers’ who receive only an ‘allowance’ (<italic>posho</italic>) (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0308275X12449107">Olivier de Sardin, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0308275X12449107">Swidler, 2009</xref>). It is the moral claim of volunteering in a CSO, rather than location or class, which informs assertions that such organizations are closer to the poor and understand intrinsically the experience of villagers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0308275X12449107">Mindry, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0308275X12449107">Pigg, 1992</xref>). Closeness here, an artefact of interstitiality, legitimates the positioning of CSOs as implementers of community development.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0308275X12449107">11</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="sec5-0308275X12449107"><title>Capacity building</title>
<p>Constitutions, and the missions and visions which comprise them, conform to a fairly standard template, a product of NGO registration requirements which demand a specific organizational form and of the multiple donor initiatives to develop CSOs. This has been accomplished through what is termed in the development field ‘capacity building’, the promotion of a set of techniques through which organizational forms can be replicated along with the organizations able to promote them. Tanzanian civil society expansion is creating a parallel set of specialist organizations designed to meet the capacity needs of these organizations in development. Originally established by international NGOs such as Oxfam, Action Aid, PACT and Hivos as part of their strategies to ‘develop civil society’ in the 1990s, this new cadre of private providers retains strong links with the organizations that established them. Staff usually comprise people who have themselves been trained by these programmes. Local capacity builders specialize in building capacity in local areas – they are not themselves situated in districts but in regional centres as their clients are dispersed across the country. They are likely to be registered as CSOs but operate as small businesses, funded either as part of top-down programmes of capacity development, and hence as contractors to capacity builders such as PACT, or paid for specific consultancy inputs by smaller client organizations. Enmeshed in chains of contracting, like the organizations they develop, they are ultimately dependant on the spending decisions of international Non Governmental Organizations.</p>
<p>Capacity building in the NGO sector has consisted of replicating what are regarded as the normative organizational forms for CSOs through training for participants in core areas of activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0308275X12449107">Green, 2010a</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0308275X12449107">12</xref></sup> The kind of organization envisaged is ‘capacitated’ when it can obtain funding and hence achieve ‘sustainability’ through implementing projects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0308275X12449107">Swidler and Watkins, 2008</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0308275X12449107">13</xref></sup> In the words of a training manual on strategic planning produced by TRACE, a Dar es Salaam-based capacity provider, itself established as a project of an international NGO:<disp-quote>
<p>The ideal situation for CSOs in Tanzania is to be strategic and therefore proactive in thinking strategically. CSOs need to think beforehand and pursue their funders to assist them financially to develop and implement a strategic plan …. As a young coming up CSO you may have to wait for a number of years before you have to build your reputation to be legible [sic] for assistance from donors. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0308275X12449107">Mwango and Mussadegh, n.d.: ix</xref>)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Training sessions offered by ‘local capacity builders’ exhibit a high degree of standardization intensified by the use of what come to count as the basic ‘toolkits’ for various requirements of organizational development. The emphasis of such trainings is on organizational development in three related areas: the organizational structure, which consists of named officers around a mission and vision; strategic planning; and developing a proposal for funding. The standardization of training and understandings of capacity is accentuated by the limited number of organizations providing training and the relations between new entrants and originators of such programmes. It is also an attribute of globalizing technologies of management, including, for example, the idea of the project which is ‘highly <italic>reproducible</italic> [as] a totality of well defined rules and procedures’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0308275X12449107">Clegg and Courpasson, 2004</xref>: 543, emphasis in the original) and what could be considered as the normative template for not-for-profit organizations transnationally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0308275X12449107">Bazin and Selim, 2006</xref>: 457; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0308275X12449107">Hwang and Suarez, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0308275X12449107">Powell et al., 2005</xref>). Standardization is not confined to this kind of intervention but is a sought attribute of development technologies more generally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0308275X12449107">Hirschmann, 1967</xref>). Interventions which are replicable and which conform to programme designs practically require standardized approaches, just as standardization theoretically permits a range of personnel to implement recognized practices across time and space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0308275X12449107">Callon, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0308275X12449107">Green, 2010b</xref>). This implementation is complex because practices are never undertaken in quite the same way, within and outside development. Nevertheless, the representation of standard ways of doing things to address standard replicable problems is an important part of the conceptual toolkit through which development problems and solutions are not merely ‘rendered technical’ but also transnationally applicable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0308275X12449107">Murray Li, 2007a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0308275X12449107">2007b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0308275X12449107">Pigg, 1992</xref>). ‘Toolkits’ for addressing a range of development issues from community-level project management to designing poverty reduction strategies are readily available on the web pages of development organizations.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0308275X12449107">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>The emphasis on replication is not unusual in the highly institutionalized context of international development, and indeed government more generally, where standard organizational forms come to be equated with rational functionality irrespective of actual effectiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0308275X12449107">Meyer and Rowan, 1977</xref>). The standardization of institutions for the delivery of education at all levels, modalities of what counts as public sector reform and the expansion of civil society itself are examples of this institutional isomorphism evident through development programming in different country settings (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0308275X12449107">Frodin, 2011</xref>). This orientation is likely to be accentuated where ‘fast policy’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0308275X12449107">Peck, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0308275X12449107">2011</xref>) necessitates a heavy reliance on policy templates and where utilization of consultancy inputs encourages their use. In such situations, of which international development is an exemplar, Meyer and Rowan’s analysis is insightful.<disp-quote>
<p>Professions, policies, and programs are created along with the products and services they are understood to produce rationally. This permits many new organizations to spring up and forces existing ones to incorporate new practices and procedures …. Institutionalized products, services, techniques, policies and programmes function as powerful myths, and many organizations adopt them ceremonially.

</sec>
<sec id="sec6-0308275X12449107"><title>Anticipatory development</title>
<p>Capacity building is not only an important part of the political economy of development in Tanzania and the wider relations in which it is embedded. In a situation in which development spending and relations prescribed by policy are being devolved to lower levels, it enables entrepreneurship around development, opening the field to new actors who can access the necessary elements to set up an organization ready to assume a place in these new contracting relations. A consequence of the availability of capacity, if not funding, is a littering of organizational building blocks and a littering of organizations in varying states of activity, along with the widespread popularization of ideas about development and NGOs as kinds of organization and activity. Attention to form is extremely important, manifested in the presentation of office space and the emphasis on documentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0308275X12449107">Elyachar, 2005</xref>), such as the mission statements and constitutions which establish an organization and facilitate registration. Documentation is necessary in order to perform civil society, of which the most critical is the funding proposal and, if successful, the various types of project monitoring reports through which implementation status is maintained. Finally, mission statements and acronyms enable the integration of registered organizations into the formal map of district governance through lists presented to local government and into the representation of national civil society. While these small organizations have offices and representatives to promote them, and a formal place in the architecture of district development, they are not necessarily undertaking development activities. Without funding to carry out activities or to implement projects for other organizations they remain dormant, NGOs in waiting, hoping for inclusion in development relations. Whatever their origins, becoming active, for CSOs, does not entail activism or generating membership or demand, but attaining a place within a set of contracting relations. This evolution from project to organization to contractor replicates the sought trajectory of the CSO development, from a funded project of a donor to a contractor implementing projects.</p>
<p>A successful contract facilitates the sought-after professionalization of an organization as a contractor in the district development landscape, in which certain organizations bid to be included in externally funded interventions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0308275X12449107">Swidler and Watkins, 2008</xref>). As such contracts are rare and capacity to obtain funding tends to be limited to organizations which already have experience of implementing projects, and hence to those which were themselves constituted as projects of projects, perhaps the majority of CSOs’ activity is about this kind of situating – what might be termed <italic>anticipatory</italic> development. Anticipatory development refers to the ways in which agents seeking a place in development orders, and associated resource steams, adopt postures premised on the possibility of this emplacement. In relation to the CSOs, this is mostly concerned with adopting the appropriate form, which enables recognition, registration and potentially capacity for funding. The emphasis on form is not simply about recognition by potential funders. In conforming to the institutional design of organizations associated with particular functions, capacity is partially assumed, by volunteers, beneficiaries and members of the public where these organizations seem to conform to popular expectations of local CSOs. In addition to the presentation of exterior forms of enacting civil society through volunteering and setting up offices, the production of documentation is critical. Civil society documentation is explicitly anticipatory – missions and visions which aspire to engagement in a future-oriented action toward specific outcomes, and the more prosaic funding proposals, with their log frame of cause and effect and carefully crafted budgets. These documentary forms provide the vehicle through which civil society can replicate itself as conforming to particular forms and a basis for engagement in what is categorized as civil society activity. Further, in anticipating development as a particular kind of activity through project proposals and budgets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0308275X12449107">Collier, 2005</xref>) they reiterate a development imaginary of governance, accountability and sectoral integration.</p>
<p>The emphasis on form as a shortcut to legitimacy and the association of civil society with particular areas of work around community engagement opens the field of competition to virtually any organization that can attain recognition as a civil society actor. Some organizations are able to use this flexibly, bidding for contracts in different sectoral areas even where the effects of their engagement lead to involvement in activities well beyond the scope of their experience. Entrepreneurial flexibility rewarded by the system incentivizes organizations to continuously shift what they claim to do and the areas in which they engage. This can be seen more generally in the transition from project- to CSO-contractor, displayed in the UNICEF established youth networks in Magu and Bagamoyo, which currently compete with other NGOs for work in the business of sensitization around HIV and AIDS, and in the transition in Magu of NGOs working with the environment to HIV and AIDS.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0308275X12449107">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is also evident in the example of two organizations which had made parallel endeavours to adopt the civil society form. The first, encountered in 2008, was a small-scale orphanage run as a the personal project of a middle-class woman in Bagamoyo rural district. Such initiatives, often an extended household in which children who have lost one parent are accommodated, are common in Tanzania. Those who run them seek support from district AIDS budgets, from individual benefactors, frequently overseas, and from small-scale donor organizations of the kind that will support informal projects. The orphanage had diversified into wider contracting opportunities through assuming status as a CSO. This had enabled it to bid for funding from a national NGO to implement a participatory research project in a neighbouring fishing village, and ultimately to obtain funding for the purchase of a fishing boat, which was intended to be utilized by the fishermen of the village. How this would happen was unresolved when I visited in 2008. The boat was unusable because the net gauge was unsuitable and neither the fishermen nor the NGO were willing to make the necessary financial contributions to replace them. The result of this shape shifting was an orphanage running an unusable fishing boat for beneficiaries who did not benefit and who were not orphans.</p>
<p>The second organization which had adopted civil society form had transitioned from a Pentecostal church in conformity with a parallel organizational template circulating in Tanzanian society – that of the small-scale evangelical pastor focused church. Feed and Tend International (FTI) was based in Magu District where it had constructed an office building at a cost of 8 million Tanzanian shillings and had a number of volunteers struggling to undertake activities with children defined as vulnerable by the district social welfare office. As well as an acronym and an office building, FTI had named officers, including a secretary and treasurer, was undertaking what it claimed were developmental – in that they were potentially fundable – activities in villages with morally deserving beneficiaries and a pile of necessary documentation, including a constitution, a mission statement and a vision. FTI’s constitution sets out its purpose and mission in English in terms which combine evangelical aspiration with the moral imperative of development. FTI was a hybrid comprising a range of organizational aspirations within a civil society skin. Although its vision is to ‘Carry out the word of God in the power of the Holy Spirit’, the purpose of the organization is ‘to meet physical and spiritual needs through relief and development’. FTI’s aims and objectives strive to be more grounded. These are:<disp-quote>
<p>to enable Christians … to cooperate in furthering integral human development, particularly through sharing with the poor and oppressed … to provide educational services, bible colleges, seminaries, public libraries and training institutions, social services, hospitals, dispensaries, clinics, youth centres, children and aged homes, hostels, restaurants, disabled homes; Relief services – food, tents, clothes, building material, water equipment, operation of fishing, agricultural and livestock farms, mining, low cost houses and other poverty alleviating programmes and projects. (FTI constitution)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>FTI’s constitution veers between development and evangelical objectives. It had initiated a savings and loans scheme, which promised high returns based on contributions from villagers. While those who had contributed cash were losing faith in its capacity to deliver the increased sums they had been promised, its ‘volunteers’ remained loyal. They had persistent faith in the capacity of FTI as constituting a CSO and, as such, as a genuine actor in district civil society and hence development. Indeed, the secretary of the organization, handing over a copy of the constitution, was at pains to show that FTI was properly constituted as a CSO and waited only to deliver. FTI was not, in his view, radically different to other CSOs in the district and beyond it. Constituted around a vision, and hence rationale for interventions among specific beneficiaries, it existed to deliver on civil society’s promise.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-0308275X12449107"><title>Documents and dissemination</title>
<p>Writing and the production of documentation is central to the constitution of what appears as the civil society sector in Tanzania, and to individual organizations. Writing is how they present themselves to others as genuine organizations, from the acronyms and logos to the constitutions and proposals through which they are structured, as well as displays of activities on office walls. Such displays realize civil society engagement in development at the same time as they articulate the nature of the relation between the organization and beneficiaries. CSOs, mostly urban-based, are only occasionally present in the communities where they undertake funded activities. Organizational presence within communities is established outside them, not through action or effects, but through writing as an act of representation. The representation of activities as part of a ‘sector’ which transcends organizations and villages is made possible through certain kinds of writing, as is the distribution of identical organizational forms through which these organizations are constituted. This dispersal and replication is supported by contemporary technologies of dispersal and replication – the photocopier, computer and internet – as well as the peripheral devices – USB sticks, compact discs and mobile phones – which allow forms to be stored and disseminated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0308275X12449107">Rabinow, 2006</xref>). It is further enabled by social strategies for the replication of development practices. These include the top-down systems of capacity building through dispersal modalities such as the training of trainers, the funding streams which demand compliance with certain documentary forms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0308275X12449107">Wallace et al., 2006</xref>) and the institution of the stakeholder workshop as a participatory form through which development practices come to be circulated and learned (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0308275X12449107">Green, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0308275X12449107">2010a</xref>).</p>
<p>Both the social and material technologies of replication have proliferated in Tanzania with increases in donor budgets, the creation of civil society funding streams and the significant price reductions in mobilizing technologies such as computers, mobile phones and photocopying, which have permitted the extension of these services to rural centres. This extension is a complex social process. Because price prohibits the accessing of these technologies by individuals, with the recent exception of mobile phones as tariffs have fallen, the dissemination of communications technologies depends on numerous individual entrepreneurs who trade in services, often broken down into smallest tradable components – for example, charging phones, the sale of phone credit and, for those without handsets, calls from phones. Entrepreneurship is not confined to the material technologies associated with civil society expansion. The sector is ruthlessly competitive, with numerous undifferentiated organizations competing for funding through a combination of generic project management strategies and the purchase of sector-specific technical expertise. As well as the formal service providers dealing in trainings and organizational development, a number of individual entrepreneurs specialize in the production of civil society documentation, notably funding proposals. This service is sought after in rural districts, where few people have the experience necessary to construct good, that is fundable, proposals. It is also used by people wanting to have proposals on hand to help in their search for patrons to support more personal projects. Civil society entrepreneurship is not restricted to countries in which the sector is being established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0308275X12449107">Rabinow, 2006</xref>: 49), but is constitutive of not-for-profits more generally where they exist as potential contractors in equivalent relations with government. The not-for-profit sector in the USA, with some 12 million employees, is similarly structured through the marketization of capacity and organizational development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0308275X12449107">Powell et al., 2005</xref>: 235). It too is characterized by the standardization of strategies and forms, reliance on consultancy inputs and excessive stylization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0308275X12449107">Hwang and Suarez, 2005</xref>: 71–81). In countries like Tanzania, where barriers to entry are low for private individuals as long as they have some skills in office practice, personal connections to gain credibility with district staff and cash to invest in document production, the expansion of the not-for-profit sector offers potential opportunities for district professional classes to gain contracting opportunities in community development and become social entrepreneurs.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-0308275X12449107"><title>Conclusion: Writing relationships to development</title>
<p>The existence of a market in civil society and associated expertise not only allows organizations to bid for work which they have no experience. It also enables new entrants to the development marketplace to access skills they need to produce the range of documentation required to participate in it. Writing forms the basis of a kind of expertise associated with civil society capacity and the basis of much activity in the form of the production of bids for grant funding and the production of tenders for development contracts. Writing not only permits the representation of organizational forms, around which people may or may not align, it also sets out relationships – between form and action, action and impact, organization and beneficiaries, putting them ‘into words’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0308275X12449107">Callon, 2002</xref>: 196). This is explicit in the NGO constitutions which situate the organization’s vision and mission in relation to the intended beneficiaries and Tanzania’s development strategy. It is also present in the strategic plans, project proposals, logical frameworks and budgets for activities which CSOs produce as part of their place in the organization of development. Such documents are not in fact concerned with the representation of actual relations, but with the capture of anticipated relations which constitute the possible basis for a contract, and with it inclusion into the formal relations of development.</p>
<p>In situations where multitudes of small-scale CSOs have come into being to compete for contractual roles within the design of decentralized development, writing a relationship to development is a necessary precondition for contracting and hence for inclusion in development relations. Specialized forms of writing thus constitute the core activity of anticipatory development, at the same time as writing permits the dispersal and extension of development’s organizational forms. The materiality of these forms is significant. Like the offices, signboards and business cards as artefacts of development in Tanzania, reports, logframes and proposals carry connotations of lives and work associated with professional status and expertise and, as the antithesis of the villagers in need of sensitization, with sophisticated urban identity.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0308275X12449107">16</xref></sup> In Tanzania, and places like it, engagement with development artefacts allows those seeking the status of development actors to access some aspects of this future engagement in the present. Development artefacts continue to connote status and professional identity in Tanzania. As such, like high-status consumer goods, they have become vehicles for ‘displaced meaning’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0308275X12449107">McCracken, 1990</xref>). Aspiration contributes to the proliferation of district NGOs in Tanzania, as does the desire of peri-urban professional classes to contribute to rural development. Plans, budgets, strategies and visions perform the work of situating civil society representationally as a player in development as a future-oriented project which has yet to be implemented. It is therefore not surprising that civil society ‘volunteers’ should perceive themselves as occupying a position proximate to development and hence positioned to incorporate others into development relations. For those outside implementation, where a project exists as a design or strategy, projects and missions provide a boundary between development and un-development, and in so doing, situate civil society agency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0308275X12449107">Yakura, 2002</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0308275X12449107">17</xref></sup></p>

<p>This article is based on several periods of work on civil society and local governance in Tanzania carried out between 2000 and 2009. These include background research on civil society in preparation for the design of a civil society support programme in 2000; research on local CSOs in Lindi in 2003; an evaluation of the governance component (including civil society and participation) of the national Local Government Reform Programme in 2007, an evaluation of civil society engagement in community research for the thinktank REPOA in 2008 and evaluation of the Dutch-supported Capacity Building for Local Governance Actors’ Programme in 2008. These projects involved visits to several districts, including Iringa Rural, Iringa Town, Mbulu, Shinyanga, Bagamoyo and Bukoba districts. Additional field work on civil society in Magu District was conducted in 2009 was supported through SNV/Twaveza’s project on local-level change and through the DFID funded Religions and Development Research Programme which examined the place of faith in development organizations. Fieldwork in Magu District was carried out at different times with Claire Mercer, Simeon Mesaki and Bashiru Ally. I am grateful to Susan Kayetta and Lemayon Melyoki, with whom I carried out work in other districts, and to the referees of <italic>Critique of Anthropology</italic> for their extremely helpful comments which have informed the revision of this article.</p></ack><notes>

The web pages of the Tanzania Civil Society Database, accessible via the Tanzania Development gateway (http://www.tanzaniagateway.org/civilsociety/) do not provide total figures but do list NGOs in sectoral categories, from which my estimate is taken. This does not include smaller community-based organizations (CBOs) which are registered at district level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0308275X12449107">Green, 2010a</xref>).</p></fn>
