<abstract>
<p>The ‘sandwich class’ is an East Asian term referring to the lower middle class. Using a large and unique micro dataset collected in Guangzhou, this paper examines empirically the potential determinants of housing affordability of the ‘sandwich class’. It is found that an individual’s self-perceived range of housing options is dependent not only on his/her current and predictable economic and financial resources, but also on his/her occupation and socio-demographic characteristics. The empirical findings are found to be robust against potential endogeneity problems and not sensitive to the regression specifications used. The empirical findings reported here help to deepen our understanding of the homeownership affordability determinants of the lower middle class in emerging economies characterised by an underdeveloped housing system.</p>

<title>1. Introduction</title>
<p>During a period of global restructuring, the rapid expansion of the middle-class population in Asia has attracted increasing attention world-wide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0042098012470398">ADB, 2010</xref>). However, their fragile situation in the housing market is still a key challenge for the sustainability of Asia’s middle-class boom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0042098012470398">Doling, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0042098012470398">Ravallion, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0042098012470398">Ronald and Doling, 2010</xref>). In Asia, a special term has been created to describe the limited access of the lower middle class to homeownership—the “sandwich class”. The term ‘sandwich class’ was once used only informally in Hong Kong, Taiwan and Singapore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0042098012470398">Kwong, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0042098012470398">Lee, 1994</xref>), but in recent years it has become increasingly popular in mainland China (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0042098012470398">Chen and Zhang, 2012</xref>). In general, the ‘sandwich class’ refers to the lower middle class that is ‘sandwiched’ between the poor masses and a small number that make up the affluent population. The term is usually used in the context of the housing policy debate and it describes the distressed situation of those middle households who feel ‘squeezed’ in polarising housing markets. In a strict sense, the ‘sandwich class’ refers to households whose income is beyond the eligibility threshold of any public assistance, but there is no room for them to purchase a decent home at full market price (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0042098012470398">Kwong, 1995</xref>). The specific background is that while the lower middle constitutes an overwhelming bulk of the middle-income class in Asia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0042098012470398">ADB, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0042098012470398">Lee, 1994</xref>), in most East Asian societies average-income earners cannot afford private homes at market prices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0042098012470398">RICS, 2011</xref>). From the popularity of the term ‘sandwich class’ in Asia, one may see how vulnerable the Asian lower middle class are in their societies and in the housing markets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0042098012470398">Kwong, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0042098012470398">Lee, 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the possibility of homeownership among the Asian lower middle class may deserve extensive attention. First, during a period of global restructuring, the rapid expansion of Asia’s middle-class population is becoming an increasingly important driver of the local economy as well as the world economy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0042098012470398">ADB, 2010</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0042098012470398">1</xref></sup> Secondly, privately owned housing is arguably working as the pillar or even the cornerstone of asset-based welfare systems prevailing in Asian regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0042098012470398">Groves <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0042098012470398">Ronald, 2007</xref>). For these reasons, the possibility of homeownership among the sandwich class has long become one of the top social concerns in these areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0042098012470398">Doling, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0042098012470398">Wang and Murie, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>China is undoubtedly the most important new emerging economy in the world. The Chinese urban housing market is new, but is experiencing rapid growth that is unprecedented in any other country (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0042098012470398">Chen <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0042098012470398">EIU, 2011</xref>). The development of the owner-occupied housing market is not only a means to boost the economy, but is also a central pillar to build the asset-based welfare system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0042098012470398">Stephens, 2010</xref>). Nonetheless, the rapid upsurge in house prices since 2003 in most major Chinese cities has spurred the issue of housing affordability for the lower middle class to become one of the top social concerns in China (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0042098012470398">Chen <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>). There is clear evidence that the Chinese housing market is increasingly producing polarising property wealth between different tenures and different cohorts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0042098012470398">Logan <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>). In 2005, home assets accounted for 71.34 per cent of the total family wealth of Chinese urban households (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0042098012470398">Liang <italic>et al</italic>. 2010</xref>). With the accelerated home price inflation in recent years, the wealth gap between homeowners and renters in China is expected to expand significantly. Meanwhile, unlike the mature housing markets in advanced economies, tenants in urban China are facing not only insufficient tenure protection but also discrimination in access to public services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0042098012470398">Deng <italic>et al</italic>. 2011</xref>). In this context, the residual proportion of the lower middle class that is trapped in the rental housing sector due to homeownership affordability problems, those classified as the ‘sandwich class’, are expected to face declining welfare security (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0042098012470398">Logan <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>). Considering the important role of the Chinese middle class in the world economy today, their growing welfare insecurity may constitute a threat not only to the stability of the Chinese economy but also to global rebalancing. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, however, no literature has systematically examined the capability of the Chinese lower middle class to realise their homeownership aspirations.</p>
<p>To bridge the gap in the literature, this paper investigates the socioeconomic determinants of homeownership affordability among the Chinese sandwich class based on data collected from a large survey conducted in 2009 in Guangzhou, one of the largest cities in China. A unique advantage of this research is that the survey data were collected under the capped price housing scheme, a special public housing policy scheme aimed at promoting homeownership among the sandwich class. Thus, it not only ensured that the questionnaire respondents were truly sandwich class, but also solicited the respondents’ self-assessed affordable home. We will show that this approach has several advantages compared with the existing literature on assessing an individual’s homeownership affordability. Rich information about the characteristics of households also enables us to produce an in-depth household-level analysis of the connections between an individual’s socioeconomic background and that individual’s self-perceived affordable home. By examining the determinants of the self-assessed homeownership affordability of the lower middle class in a transition economy that features rapid income growth, this paper provides new insights into the literature of housing affordability. Our empirical strategy is also transferable to similar research questions.</p>
<p>The rest of this paper is organised as follows. Section 2 discusses the problems of the standard approaches in measuring homeownership affordability in China and shows the advantages of our solutions. Section 3 describes the institutional background of the Chinese housing system and the special housing policy designed for the sandwich class. Section 4 introduces the data source and provides some preliminary examination of data. Section 5 explains the empirical methodology and gives the empirical findings based on a set of econometric models. Finally, section 6 closes the paper with some concluding remarks.</p>

<title>2. Literature Review and Research Approach</title>
<p>The literature on housing affordability is voluminous. However, most studies focus on advanced economies, with only a few studies having been conducted on emerging economies and China (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0042098012470398">Bertaud, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0042098012470398">Chen <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0042098012470398">Yang and Wang, 2011</xref>). Meanwhile, how to measure housing affordability is still a major challenge in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0042098012470398">Thalmann, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0042098012470398">Bertaud, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Most of the literature on quantitative measures of housing affordability typically links home price or rent to household income in a budget constraint perspective, assuming that there is a standard or a minimum socially acceptable amount of adequate housing while the capability of households to pay housing cost is fully reflected in their current incomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0042098012470398">Hulchanski, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0042098012470398">Stone, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0042098012470398">Linneman and Megbolugbe, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0042098012470398">Thalmann, 2003</xref>). The most commonly used method is the use of the housing price to income ratio or its equivalent form, the mortgage payment to income ratio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0042098012470398">Hulchanski, 1995</xref>). Another widely applied method is the ‘residual income’ approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0042098012470398">Stone, 2006</xref>). However, although these standard approaches may be useful in evaluating the general housing affordability conditions in a region, they are problematic when assessing the homeownership affordability of a specific household, especially in a fast-growing economy like China.</p>
<p>First, the standard approaches fail to catch the vital distinction between the judgement of society and the individual’s own conception of what affordable housing is (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0042098012470398">Hancock, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0042098012470398">Bertaud, 2009</xref>). The estimated range of affordable housing is sensitive to the researcher’s subjective definition of socially accepted minimum adequate housing but may not be consistent with the household’s own assessment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0042098012470398">Hancock, 1993</xref>).</p>
<p>Secondly, the standard approaches treat housing as a consumption good in all scenarios, but neglect the idea that owning a private home is an investment. That is to say, homeownership affordability is different from housing affordability. The attraction of expected asset depreciation could drive many homeowners to tolerate a much higher short-run financial burden than all the standard affordability indicators would predict. This point is especially important where the price of housing is expected to experience enduring inflation.</p>
<p>Thirdly, the standard approaches ignore the argument that homeownership affordability for a household is decided according to its life-cycle economic capability rather than its current economic resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0042098012470398">Goodman and Kawai, 1982</xref>). The literature has argued that the role of income growth potential is a crucial factor towards understanding an owner’s demand for housing in a fast-growing economy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0042098012470398">Chen <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Fourthly, the standard approaches focus only on economic capability but lack accounting relative to the importance of specific institutional settings.</p>
<p>Given this discussion, one would find that the homeownership affordability of China’s middle class is especially difficult to predict through the standard approaches of housing affordability assessment. This is not only because the income growth potential of China’s middle class contains substantial uncertainty during rapid economic growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0042098012470398">Meng, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0042098012470398">Liang <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>) but also because the newly born housing market in China has experienced an unprecedented boom over the past decade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0042098012470398">Wu <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>). Meanwhile, to assess the homeownership affordability of households in China, the following factors should at least be considered: the contribution of parents’ support, social culture, consumer preferences, the role of the housing finance system, the impacts of occupational sectors, gender and marital status, among others.</p>
<p>For this study, we adopted the questionnaire approach and directly asked respondents about their own assessment of an affordable home. Specifically, the respondents were asked to indicate the ranges of the maximum home cost that they could afford given their current and predicted economic capacity and financial resources as well as their preference for a home.</p>
<p>This approach has several unique advantages. First, what households themselves perceive about their affordable home provides an affordability measure that is insensitive to a researcher’s subjective definition of ‘standard housing’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0042098012470398">Hancock, 1993</xref>). Secondly, the households’ own estimates of an affordable home take into account investment motives, income growth potentials, consumer preferences and other influencing factors that are unobservable to researchers. Thirdly, by focusing on the self-assessed affordability among households rather than on the subjective assessment of the researcher, we can more easily incorporate the impacts of institutional features in the analysis. Finally, by analysing how the range of self-assessed affordability varies with socioeconomic and demographic characteristics, we can discover rich information on the differential determinants of homeownership affordability across households.</p>

<title>3. The Institutional Background</title>
<sec id="section4-0042098012470398">
<title>3.1 The Urban Housing Market in China</title>
<p>During the past 20 years, China has shown an impressive record in reforming its urban housing sector and has improved the average housing conditions for hundreds of millions of households within a short period of time<disp-quote>
<p>It took China approximately 15 years to build the equivalent of Europe’s entire housing stock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0042098012470398">EIU, 2011</xref>, p. 3).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The amount of new housing in urban China soared from 78.64 million square metres in 1997 to 970.30 million square metres in 2011. At the same time, the price of housing has keept a strong upward trend: the mean price of new housing achieved a stunning 179 per cent growth over the period between 1997 and 2011 (5011 RMB per square metre versus 1790 RMB per square metre).</p>
<p>Despite a heavy drop in both building activities and transaction volumes and a slight decline of housing price in 2008, the Chinese housing market recovered quickly from the shock of the global financial crisis in late 2009 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0042098012470398">Wu <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>). However, since early 2010 the Chinese government has implemented a series of aggressive austerity measures to cool down the property market. Further, with the aim of ‘killing two birds with one stone’—i.e. to make housing affordable to those at the bottom of society while at the same time stimulating domestic demand and cushioning any possible slowdown of the property market (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0042098012470398">Wang and Murie, 2011</xref>)—in 2011 the central government embarked on an ambitious plan to construct 36 million new units of government-subsidised affordable housing over the 12th five-year plan period (2011–15).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0042098012470398">
<title>3.2 The Sandwich Class in China and Their Homeownership Affordability</title>
<p>Based on the selection criterion of a daily consumption of US$2–20, the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0042098012470398">Asian Development Bank (2010)</xref> believes that 89 per cent of the total population and 91 per cent of the urban population in mainland China could be defined as Asian standard middle class in 2007. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0042098012470398">Ravallion (2010)</xref> points out, however, the middle class in developing countries are vulnerable to volatile changes in economic environments.</p>
<p>The rapid upsurge in house prices since 2003 in most major Chinese cities has forced a growing number of middle-income households to be excluded from the housing market (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0042098012470398">Logan <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>). For example, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0042098012470398">Chen <italic>et al</italic>. (2010)</xref>, in recent years only the top 20 per cent high-income Chinese urban households could afford an average-priced home without compromising their standard of living. Meanwhile, after the Chinese government abolished the welfare housing system in 1998, only a tiny number of government-subsidised affordable housing units were available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0042098012470398">Wang and Murie, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>On the other hand, according to a large number of official and academic sources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0042098012470398">EIU, 2011</xref>), the homeownership ratio in urban China is estimated at around 80 per cent. This is largely attributable to the massive wave of privatisation of public housing in the late 1990s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0042098012470398">Adams, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0042098012470398">Yang and Wang, 2011</xref>). Consequently, the affordability issue in urban China mainly refers to the new generation, the generation that formed independent families after the privatisation reform. This paper focuses on the homeownership affordability of new market entrants among the lower-middle class—those labelled as the ‘sandwich class’ in China.</p>
<p>On 24 May 2006, the General Office of the State Council (GOSC) issued a notification to all government agencies and stressed that the restructuring of the housing supply was the key to stabilising the price of housing (GOSC, 2006[37]). It is from this document that the Chinese government for the first time officially introduced the concept of capped price housing.</p>
<p>Unlike another public housing programme—the ‘economic affordable housing’ (EAH) scheme, whereby governments allot free land to developers and EAH is sold at a heavily discounted price only to low-income households (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0042098012470398">Wang and Murie, 2011</xref>)—under the capped price housing scheme, local governments will still supply land for developers through competitive bidding on the land price. To win the bid, however, developers also need to promise to sell their housing at a capped price. The price cap is usually 60–80 per cent of the market level, but its exact level is not uniformly specified and is usually determined case by case at the local level. Further, this type of housing can be sold only to households with incomes and assets below a certain ceiling set by the local government. The size of such housing also has a cap and in most cases should be no larger than 90 square metres. Therefore, this policy is explicitly aimed at assisting the sandwich class to own their first homes.</p>
<p>Despite the intense controversy over the possibility of rent seeking and welfare inefficiency under the capped price housing scheme ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0042098012470398">Deng <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>), this scheme is warmly welcomed among local governments in China. This is because they regard it as a quick means to promote homeownership among the middle class without losing too much land revenue under other public housing schemes like the EAH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0042098012470398">Wang and Murie, 2011</xref>).</p>

<title>3.3 The Capped Price Housing in Guangzhou</title>
<p>As one of the largest cities in China, with a population of 14 million at the end of 2010, Guangzhou has one of the most developed housing markets in China. The structure of the housing market in Guangzhou has been well documented in the international literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0042098012470398">Li and Yi, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0042098012470398">Chi-Man Hui, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Guangzhou was the first city to implement the capped price housing scheme. Its first attempt at capped price housing development was launched in September 2007 and the municipality government publicised the administration rule of capped price housing in January 2008 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0042098012470398">GZMLRHAB, 2009</xref>). According to this rule, the price of capped price housing should be set at around 70 per cent of market value, but must take the homeownership affordability of the middle class into account. Further, the size of housing is also subject to a cap of 90 square metres. Whenever the demand exceeds the supply, the capped price housing would be allotted through lot drawing among all applicants. The buyers are subject not only to a five-year resale restriction, but also need to pay back the 30 per cent price gap to the government even after holding the unit for five years.</p>
<p>As of September 2009, four development projects providing 7305 units of apartments were built and 7290 units were sold under the capped price housing scheme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0042098012470398">GZMLRHAB, 2009</xref>). The eligibility requirements in 2009 included permanent residency with <italic>houkou</italic> (registered residency status), head of household aged above 25 if male or above 23 if female, a family pre-tax annual income of less than 200 000 RMB for couple applicants (an annual pre-tax income threshold of 100 000 RMB for individual applicants) and, for all applicants, having no privately owned housing in Guangzhou (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0042098012470398">GZMLRHAB, 2009</xref>).</p>

<title>4.1 Data Sources</title>
<p>Between mid November 2009 and February 2010, the Guangzhou Municipal Land Resources and Housing Administrative Bureau (GZMLRHAB) conducted a large survey, the ‘survey on the demand for capped price housing’. All applicants of capped price housing were required to complete this survey questionnaire before their eligibility could be formally assessed. As the eligibility check was strictly enforced and the owners of capped price housing are subject to a five-year non-resale restriction (see earlier), there were reasons to believe that only the sandwich class would apply. High-income households would be screened out in the application process or would not have the incentive to apply; low-income households, on the other hand, would find it difficult to afford the capped price housing as the price would still be too high for them. The questionnaire data thus provide an excellent opportunity to examine the factors that affect the homeownership affordability of the sandwich group in China.</p>
<p>The survey elicited 15 789 effective respondents to the questionnaires, among whom more than two-thirds were individual applicants and about one-third were couple applicants. As the couple sample contains too much missing information on key variables, this paper uses only the sample of individual applicants, which amounts to 10 121 observations.</p>

<title>Indicator of homeownership affordability</title>
<p>As already discussed, respondents in this survey were asked to indicate the range of their own assessment of maximum home price, or maximum downpayment, or maximum monthly mortgage payments that they could afford given their current and predicted economic resources and housing preferences. Their answers are coded in five to six ordinal categories respectively. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0042098012470398">Table 1</xref> reports the details.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0042098012470398">2</xref></sup></p>

<title>Households’ individual background variables</title>
<p>With respect to current income, the survey asked respondents to report their annual income in one of the following four monotonic increasing categories: less than 50 000 RMB; 50 000–80 000 RMB; 80 000–100 000 RMB; and above 100 000 RMB. Our data suggest that more than half earned an annual income of less than 50 000 RMB and fewer than 10 per cent earned 80 000 RMB and above.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0042098012470398">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the housing literature, variability in income path or expected potential growth in income has long been believed to be one of the most relevant variables in the decision of homeownership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0042098012470398">Diaz-Serrano, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0042098012470398">Fu, 1995</xref>). In our survey, respondents were asked to provide their own assessment of future income growth in the coming three years from one of the following five ordinal categories: zero or negative; below 25 per cent; 25–50 per cent; 50–100 per cent; and more than 100 per cent.</p>
<p>It is not only the absolute amount of income that matters for homeownership affordability; the income structure matters as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0042098012470398">Diaz-Serrano, 2005</xref>). In the survey, the respondents were asked to indicate whether their income comes mainly from wages or from other sources. Not surprisingly, nearly 95 per cent of respondents reported that wages were their main source of income.</p>
<p>How the liquidity constraints of households affect their housing choices has been studied extensively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0042098012470398">Fu, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0042098012470398">Bourassa and Yin, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0042098012470398">Li and Yi, 2007</xref>). When our respondents were asked how they would finance their downpayments, 47.5 per cent answered that they would rely on savings or personal wealth as the major resource for a downpayment; 43.5 per cent suggested that credit from their parents and other relatives would constitute the majority of their downpayment; and only 8.7 per cent expected to rely on credit from friends or other channels.</p>
<p>Another key investigation in this study was to test how households with different occupational sectors differ in their homeownership affordability. The respondents’ occupational sectors are classified into seven categories: government agencies (denoted by <italic>Gov</italic>), universities or research institutions (denoted by <italic>Colle-res</italic>), public institutions (denoted by <italic>Inst</italic>), state-owned or state-invested enterprises (denoted by <italic>SOE</italic>), private enterprises or self-employed (denoted by <italic>POE</italic>), foreign-invested or joint-venture enterprises (denoted by <italic>Foreign</italic>) and other sectors (denoted by <italic>OtherInd</italic>).</p>
<p>Other individual-level control variables used somewhere in this research include education level (<italic>edu</italic>), work experience (<italic>wyear</italic>) and marriage status (<italic>marriage</italic>). The education levels are classified into five categories: high school education or lower; graduate of three-year college or equivalent, graduate of four-year university; postgraduate; and doctoral graduate. Work experience is decoded by four ranges: 5 years or less; 6–10 years; 11–15 years; and more than 15 years. Among all respondents, 74 per cent were unmarried; 19 per cent were married; and 6 per cent were divorced at the survey date.</p>

<p>It is well known that the ordinal least squares (OLS) regression method is usually not an appropriate choice for modelling discrete choices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0042098012470398">Long and Freese, 2006</xref>). Based on different assumptions on the probability distributions of the random utility term, researchers usually choose either the ordered probit model (assuming the random residual term follows a normal distribution) or the ordered logit model (assuming that the random residual term is subject to extremum distribution). Note that the differences of estimated coefficients between the two types of models are trivial.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0042098012470398">5</xref></sup> To facilitate computation and analysis, we choose the ordered probit model (OPM).</p>
<p>For the OPM, the probability of observing a given observation <italic>i</italic> for ordinal outcome <italic>j</italic> is given as follows (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0042098012470398">Long and Freese, 2006</xref>):</p>

<title>5.2 Determinants of Permanent Income and Housing Assistance</title>
<p>The housing economics literature has reached a consensus that, since housing is a long-term consumption and investment good, households make housing decisions not on their current incomes but on the basis of their expected life-cycle income, or in other words, ‘permanent income’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0042098012470398">Goodman and Kawai, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0042098012470398">Fu, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0042098012470398">Diaz-Serrano, 2005</xref>). To be specific, a robust analysis of a household’s housing demand should proceed in two stages. In the first stage, a household’s current income is regressed on its human and non-human capital. The predicted value of first-stage income regression is considered a proxy of the household’s permanent income, while the regression residual is regarded as its transitory income. In the second stage, both fitted permanent income and transitory income are included as explanatory variables in the housing demand equation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0042098012470398">Goodman and Kawai 1982</xref>).</p>
<p>Following the standard approach, we run OLS regressions to link the individual’s current income with his or her education level, work experience and occupational sectors. Column (1) of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0042098012470398">Table 3</xref> reports the results.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, we are interested to know how one’s monthly amount of HPF and housing subsidies is determined. We apply OLS regressions to link HPF/housing subsidies to one’s current income, educational background, work experience and occupational background. Columns (2) and (3) of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0042098012470398">Table 3</xref> report the results.</p>
<p>It can be seen from column (1) of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0042098012470398">Table 3</xref> that individuals with higher educational attainment and longer work experience are expected to have a significantly higher permanent income. A small negative but insignificant gap is found among females. Further, holding other factors equal, employees of government agencies have the highest expected permanent income, followed by employees of foreign enterprises and state-owned enterprises. In contrast, employees of private enterprises or self-employed persons have the lowest expected permanent income. These findings are broadly consistent with the existing permanent income estimates for urban households in urban China, as reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0042098012470398">Zheng <italic>et al</italic>. (2006)</xref>.</p>
<p>According to columns (2) and (3) of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0042098012470398">Table 3</xref>, employees of government agencies receive the highest amount of housing assistance in both HPF and housing subsidies, followed by employees in other public sectors (for example, SOEs, colleges and research institutions, and public institutions). Employees of private enterprises and other sectors have the least access to both HPF and housing subsidies. These findings suggest a significant inequality in access to housing-related assistance across sectors in urban China. Although previous literature has discussed potential inequality within the Chinese HPF system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0042098012470398">Yeung and Howes, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0042098012470398">Buttimer <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>), this paper perhaps for the first time provides empirical proof on this point.</p>

<p><italic>Notes</italic>: t<italic>-</italic>statistics in parentheses; * p &lt;0.1; ** p &lt;0.05; *** p &lt;0.01. <italic>Pincome</italic> stands for the fitted permanent income and <italic>Tincome</italic> is the fitted transitory income. The income variables (<italic>Pincome, Tincome</italic> and <italic>Fincome</italic>) and housing-related assistance (<italic>HPF</italic> and <italic>Subsidy</italic>) enter the models as continuous variables. The reference group of income structure is ‘wages as the main sources of income’(<italic>Income-wage</italic>) and the reference group of funding structure of down payment is ‘saving as the main sources of down payment’(<italic>Fpays-self</italic>). Other reference groups are the same as in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0042098012470398">Table 3</xref>.</p>
</fn>
</table-wrap-foot>
</table-wrap>
<p>The difference between column (1) and column (2) is that the former’s explanatory variables include only the permanent income estimated from the first-stage income regression, transitory income and self-perceived expected income growth, whereas the latter is augmented with several additional explanatory variables: income structure, funding structure of downpayment, housing-related assistance, education levels, occupational sectors, gender and marital status. Despite human capital variables (gender and occupational sectors) having already been utilised in the permanent income equation, we include them again in the affordability equation for the purpose of checking whether these variables have additional effects on affordability other than income effects. The analyses of <italic>affordable downpayment</italic> (<italic>ADP</italic>) and <italic>affordable monthly mortgage payments</italic> (<italic>AMP</italic>) follow the same strategy.</p>
<p>However, the interpretation of the size of coefficient in probit models or logit models is neither straightforward nor intuitive. Thus, in the analysis, we focus on the implications of the signs of the coefficients rather than on the sizes.</p>
<p>First, both permanent income and transitory income consistently have significant effects on an individual’s capability to meet the housing price. While the significant effect of permanent income is well predicted by the classical housing demand literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0042098012470398">Goodman and Kawai 1982</xref>), the significance of transitory income is a little surprising. However, previous literature has interpreted such finding as evidence that housing demand among households is subject to liquidity constraints or borrowing restrictions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0042098012470398">Goodman, 1988</xref>). As the Chinese housing finance system is underdeveloped (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0042098012470398">Deng <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>), we interpret this finding in the same way.</p>
<p>Further, even after controlling permanent income and transitory income, expected income growth in the next three years still has additional effects on home price affordability. This probably suggests that a household’s short-run income growth potentials may differ from its predicted long-term income growth path and thus has a strong and independent effect on the household’s instant homeownership aspirations.</p>
<p>Secondly, the structure of income and downpayment also matters for home purchase affordability. Across the models, the regression results consistently suggest that a household’s capability to meet the price of a home will be relatively higher if its income comes mainly from channels other than wages—for example, returns from investment in stocks and funds—holding other factors equal. This is probably because people tend to have more aggressive attitudes towards spending if they earn considerable money from investments or, alternatively, such people are more willing to make a risky investment in housing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0042098012470398">Fu, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>Meanwhile, our results also suggest that households financing their downpayment mainly through financial support from parents or relatives are more able to afford a home purchase. This is easy to understand, since such households would not have to hurry to repay the money borrowed from their parents or relatives. In China, it is common for parents to be willing to lend a large amount of money to their children without expecting their children to repay someday. However, credit from friends or other channels does not appear to give real help.</p>
<p>Thirdly, both the HPF and the housing subsidy significantly raise residents’ capability to afford the price of a home. However, this finding should be interpreted with great caution. Some researchers tend to treat the HPF as a kind of unpaid salary that does not add to the total economic capacity of employees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0042098012470398">Yeung and Howes, 2006</xref>). However, others disagree with this opinion and argue that HPF savings receive tax-free treatment from the government and the HPF loan is issued at a preferential lending rate; all these policy interventions significantly increase an employee’s financial strength in housing consumption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0042098012470398">Buttimer <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>). The evidence found in this paper supports the latter argument.</p>
<p>Fourthly, occupational sector and gender appear to have significant non-income effects on home price affordability. Since the income effects of these factors should have been largely captured in the fitted permanent income variable, their additional effect on affordability should be interpreted through consumer preference towards housing consumption or an individual’s risk-taking attitude on housing investment. While employees of colleges and research institutions are found to be associated with relatively lower expected permanent income in the first-stage income equation, they have more ambitious plans for housing than employees of other sectors do. Conversely, employees of foreign-invested sectors have conservative home plans. A possible explanation for this is that employees of colleges and research colleges are more optimistic, whereas employees of foreign-invested sectors are more conservative or even pessimistic on the future economic growth in China. This finding is consistent with what is found in recent literature that political involvement, job rank and work unit continue to play important roles in affecting the homeownership possibility of households in urban China (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0042098012470398">Li and Yi, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0042098012470398">Zheng <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0042098012470398">Yang and Wang, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Meanwhile, it is also very interesting to find that Chinese females have more ambitious home plans than males do, and singles have more aspirations to a larger home than do married people. Although we cannot provide a more detailed discussion on these findings because of space limitations, it is worth noting that these findings are broadly consistent with the predictions from the recent booming literature on the marriage market and housing demand in China (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0042098012470398">Wei <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>).</p>

<title>5.4 Empirical Findings II: Factors Affecting Affordability of Downpayment</title>
<p>It should be noted that there are some slight differences between the concept of the affordability of a downpayment and the affordability of the home price. Affordability of a downpayment measures the household’s instant payment ability, whereas affordability of home price gauges a household’s overall payment ability, both instant payment ability and long-term payment ability. Therefore, the affordability of a downpayment depends more on a household’s current wealth accumulation.</p>
<p>It can be seen from a comparison of columns (1)–(4) of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0042098012470398">Table 4</xref> that the OMP results of the downpayment affordability of the sandwich class stay almost the same as their home price affordability. However, there are a few slight and interesting differences. One new finding is that one’s capability to make the downpayment is significantly lower when the source of the downpayment is mainly borrowing from friends or other channels. Further, government employees are found to be as conservative as foreign-sector employees in making the downpayment compared with employees of other sectors. Females, although associated with more ambitious home purchase plans, are found to be conservative in paying the downpayment. In contrast, married or divorced individuals can better afford the downpayment than singles, suggesting that being married may help individuals in accumulating more personal wealth.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-0042098012470398">
<title>5.5 Empirical Findings III: Factors Affecting Affordability of Monthly Payments</title>
<p>Unlike affordability of home price, affordability of monthly mortgage payments depends mainly on the residents’ liquidity—cash flow or monthly stable income.</p>
<p>According to columns (5) and (6) of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0042098012470398">Table 4</xref>, the determinants of affordable monthly mortgage payments are largely the same as those of affordable housing price and affordable downpayment. One notable new finding is that SOE employees are as conservative as employees of foreign-invested companies in making monthly mortgage payments. Further, individuals with experience of divorce are found to be least capable of affording monthly mortgage payments.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section20-0042098012470398">
<title>5.6 Robustness Checks</title>
<p>It is well known that either an omitted variable or a measurement error or a simultaneity problem can lead to endogeneity biases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0042098012470398">Davidson and McKinnon, 1993</xref>). Particularly for expected future income growth, there might be a high possibility of an endogeneity problem—i.e. some variables contribute to homeownership affordability and expected future income growth simultaneously, but are omitted in our regressions. To check for robustness, we use educational level and occupational background as instrument variables for expected future income and run IV-probit regression and two-stage least square regression (2SLS). The regression results, although slightly different in the magnitude of coefficients, stay almost the same in sign and significance as those in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0042098012470398">Table 4</xref>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0042098012470398">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>So far we have assumed that individual home price affordability, downpayment affordability and monthly payment affordability are determined separately. However, the three indicators of homeownership affordability might be correlated. To increase the efficiency of estimation, we re-estimate the results using the technique of seemingly unrelated regression (SUR), which considers the correlation among the error terms of these three equations. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0042098012470398">Table 5</xref> shows the results. The SUR coefficient results are almost the same as the results in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0042098012470398">Table 4</xref>, but the model fitness values, as measured by AR<sup>2</sup>/Pseudo-<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup>, increase significantly.</p>

<title>6. Conclusions</title>
<p>Employing a large and unique micro dataset collected during a survey specially designed for the sandwich class in Guangzhou in early 2010, this paper has empirically examined the socioeconomic determinants of the homeownership affordability of the sandwich class in China. Unlike standard approaches in the literature, we did not compute budget-based affordability measures but instead directly asked respondents to provide their own assessment of their self-perceived range of an affordable home. This approach features several unique advantages in the analysis of homeownership affordability at the individual level. In the empirical analysis, we distinguish three indicators of homeownership affordability: affordability of the home price, affordability of the downpayment and affordability of the monthly mortgage payments.</p>
<p>Our key empirical results include the following. First, both permanent income and transitory income are critical to the sandwich class’s homeownership affordability. Secondly, higher short-run expected income growth also improves the sandwich class’s homeownership affordability. Thirdly, the source structures of both income and downpayment are found to play a significant role in determining the sandwich class’s homeownership affordability. Fourthly, housing-related assistance (Housing Provident Fund and employer-provided housing subsidies) improves the sandwich class’s homeownership affordability. Fifthly, occupational sectors, gender and marital status affect an individual’s homeownership affordability or homeownership aspiration through non-income channels. Finally, our empirical findings are found robust against potential endogeneity problems and not sensitive to the regression specifications used.</p>
<p>These empirical findings may help to deepen our understanding of the determinants of the lower middle class’s homeownership affordability in a new emerging economy with an underdeveloped housing system. It will also assist us in designing more efficient state policy to promote the lower middle class’s homeownership ratio in these economies.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0042098012470398">7</xref></sup></p>

<p>The HPF is a nationwide compulsory saving scheme enforced in China since 1994. Under the HPF scheme, employees contribute a certain proportion of their salaries to their personal HPF accounts and employers contribute an equal amount. The central policy goal of the HPF is to provide home purchase loans to HPF account holders at a preferential lending rate. See more details on Guangzhou’s HPF system on the website of the Guangzhou Housing Provident Fund Centre: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.gzgjj.gov.cn">www.gzgjj.gov.cn</ext-link>.</p>

<p>However, whether the capped price housing scheme is an appropriate programme to promote the Chinese sandwich class’s homeownership involves complicated economic and non-economic cost–benefit analysis and is beyond the scope of this paper. Thus this paper should not be taken as an endorsement of the capped price housing scheme.</p>
