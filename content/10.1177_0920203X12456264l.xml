<p>The Middle Kingdom did not have a high regard for its prodigal children until the late Qing period when authorities first displayed interest in the capital and expertise that overseas Chinese might contribute after long sojourns abroad. Although the Nationalist (Kuomintang) regime made some significant efforts, the subsequent communist government provides the most interesting story. This is partly because of the extreme swings in official policy that occurred between 1945 and 1979, but these events can also provide important context in present-day China, where ‘returned overseas Chinese’ (归国华侨 or, more broadly, 国内华侨 – just about anyone in the country with emigrant connections) are again being asked to build the motherland by establishing closer relations with the greater diaspora (see, for example, the work that I edited with Leo Douw and Cen Huang, <italic>Qiaoxiang Ties: Interdisciplinary Approaches to ‘Cultural Capitalism’ in South China</italic>, London: Kegan Paul, 1999). Seeking to fill a gap in the existing historical literature, Glen Peterson has now carefully documented why it was that a group once considered potentially useful, yet still regarded as ‘permanent outsiders’, previously failed to fit into the country’s plans for economic development.</p>
<p>After providing a brief summary of the historical patterns of emigration that first drew the attention of previous governments to ‘overseas Chinese’ communities both at home (always something of an oxymoron) and abroad, the book’s Introduction includes an informative discussion of the origins of communist attitudes. Chapter 2 contains good case studies, notably of the letter-writing campaign of the early 1950s, which, though intended to build closer ties with the diaspora, quickly proved counter-productive when followed by the extensive persecution experienced during land reform. Chapter 3, ‘The making of a special category’, explains how, after that ‘terrifying experience’, the community again received preferential treatment from late 1953 when local authorities returned some seized assets and allowed access to superior rations and foreign goods. However, Chapter 4, ‘Open for business: The quest for investment and remittances’, will probably have the most relevance for students of events taking place today. Despite a clear need to link investments with much-needed development, it was hard to go against ‘socialist transformation’ or the ideological counter current. The often grandiose plans of the far-sighted Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission and its state-run offshoot, the Overseas Chinese Investment Company (along with politically uncomfortable provincial officials in Guangdong and Fujian), ultimately accomplished very little. Only the rubber industry on Hainan Island was ever much of a success. As Peterson rightly observes, the entire programme was hampered ‘by distrust on both sides’.</p>
<p>Most readers will find Chapters 5 and 6 to be the most riveting. Here, in very much the guts of the volume, an empathetic scholar sets out to trace what motivated several hundred thousand ethnic Chinese, the vast majority from Southeast Asia, to ‘return’ to the People’s Republic. Some of these had, of course, never even seen their ancestral homeland. But everyone’s hopes were ultimately dashed by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. It is a sad tale of ‘“returned Overseas Chinese” from their arrival beginning in the early 1950s and their resettlement in cities, towns and farms across China, to their tortured efforts to find “home” in socialist China, and the eventual decision of nearly all of them to leave China’ (p. 103).</p>
<p>With its sound judgement and extensive use of Chinese-language source materials, this new book will largely replace Stephen FitzGerald’s classic, <italic>China and the Overseas Chinese</italic>: <italic>A Study of Peking’s Changing Policy 1949–1970</italic> (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1972), as the standard treatment of the early communist period. But do be aware that Peterson pays little attention to foreign policy. Nor does <italic>Overseas Chinese in the People’s Republic of China</italic> engage in a sustained analysis of the broader comparative issues that currently interest social scientists: matters such as identity, transnationalism or diaspora capitalism. More negatively given its promising title, the work provides scant coverage of the traumatic years of the ‘Cultural Revolution and beyond’ (a mere 16 pages) and, thus, manifestly requires a sequel. Unfortunately, the £80 price will severely limit sales to specialists (those who are not lucky enough to receive a free review copy) and a small number of large research libraries with an Asian studies focus.</p>
