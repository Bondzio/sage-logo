<p>Recently Mergers and Acquisitions (hereafter M&amp;As) are on the rise facilitated by the regulatory interventions of the states and business environmental reasons across the world. This book is a fair attempt in comprehensively covering the business valuation process, motives and causes of mergers, legal framework of M&amp;As in India and in the international context and the post merger integration issues. The author, Kamal Ghosh Ray (Ph.D., AICWA) is presently the Director and Professor of Finance and Risk Management, Vignana Jyothi Institute of Management, Hyderabad. He has made an attempt to converse three issues related to the M&amp;As namely, strategy, valuation and integration. These issues are relevant as they determine the success or failure of a merger deal. Organized into 19 chapters, the book has covered these issues comprehensively. The first section focuses on the basic concepts and the strategic features of M&amp;As. While explaining the motives of M&amp;As, the author relates it to the major theories associated with M&amp;As. This approach will help the readers to understand the previous research findings on merger motives since these theories emerged from different studies across the globe and can be used as an agenda for further studies. The book also offers guidance for conducting research on motives of M&amp;As.</p>
<p>In the second section, Chapters 3 to 13 explain the different aspects of business valuation in the context of business combinations. This section illustrates the importance of valuation and the author observes that corporate valuation is a critical subject, when it is referred in the context of M&amp;As and many deals failed because the acquiring company felt subsequently that it paid too much for the acquisitions. Further, it describes the various valuation techniques and dynamics of share exchange ratio. The discussion on common errors and anomalies in discounted cash flow (DCF) model of company valuation will help corporate finance students to understand the interpretation of DCF model output.</p>
<p>The book also covers valuation of intangibles like goodwill, brands, customer relations and also human resource valuation. Furthermore, it describes the various business valuation standards in North America and India. The chapters on valuation of corporate disinvestments and family business would be interesting to the learners. It explicates the basic approaches and methods of valuation of business or equity in the privatization process of the government in the context of WTO rules. Furthermore, the book throws light on the valuation of privately and publicly held companies. So the book covers almost all aspects of the valuation.</p>
<p>In addition, the book describes the various methods of financing M&amp;As like cash or stock or combination of both. The payment for M&amp;As and the methods of financing merger have significant impact on the post-merger performance. So the payment mechanism should be carefully structured to reduce the valuation risk to the acquirer shareholders, and sometimes, target shareholders. In order to provide a clear idea of these dynamics, the author has demonstrated the effects of different payment mechanisms with illustrative examples. This approach is very useful. The chapter on ‘financing of merger’ also discusses the merger financing pattern in the US and UK. In the third section, the author has made a compilation of information related to the accounting and legal aspects of mergers. The book details the pooling of interest method and purchase method of accounting with its merits and problems. The book also throws light on International Accounting Standards, Competition Act, 2002, Income Tax Act, 1961 and SEBI takeover code, etc. The final section consists of the key issues related to post-merger integration like corporate culture, cultural due diligence, integration errors, etc.</p>
<p>Even though the book has covered the key aspects of the valuation, the book is silent on the issue of determinants of valuation or merger premiums. The understanding of the determinants of merger premium is very important in identifying the valuation approaches. Since this book deals with strategy also, the author could have linked merger premium determinants with strategy. By studying the determinants of merger premium, one can know whether it is a financial valuation or a strategic valuation. Further, if we go through the valuation report of any deal, we can see some control methods apart from the traditional valuation methodologies. These control methods are used to check the fairness of valuation or exchange ratios. These methods are ignored in the book. Had it described these methods, it would have increased the intellectual worth of the book.</p>
<p>While coming to the accounting of merges, though the author explained the difference between pooling method and purchase method, he could have illustrated its impact on the financial statements in the post-merger scenario and instanced the importance of method of accounting in the valuation process. Another important aspect which is missed out in the book is the strategic similarity of the merging partners. The previous research has well documented the importance of strategic similarity and dissimilarity of the merging partners on the post-merger performance. This aspect is not contacted in the chapter ‘Strategic approach to M&amp;As’.</p>
<p>The main attraction of the book is the inclusion of the elementary concepts along with the advancements in the subject and the recent evidences. To establish the theoretical views, the author uses appropriate case studies wherever necessary. In some chapters, for instance, valuation of intangibles, for explaining brand valuation and human resource valuation, he used extracts from the annual reports of the companies and they are very useful to understand the human resource accounting trends in India. The case studies are classic and have relevance. The chapter on valuation disputes and court cases will help the learners to understand the legal aspects and modus-operandi of business valuation. This book lays great emphasis on the perplexed subject of valuation which has a special importance in the context of first time adoption and implementation of IFRS (International Financial Reporting Standards) by 2011. The book gives both conceptual and operational details of valuation aspects of mergers which is relatively unexplored.</p>
