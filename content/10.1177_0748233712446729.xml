<abstract>
<p>The present study was aimed to determine the presence and levels of aflatoxin M<sub>1</sub> (AFM<sub>1</sub>) in 120 natural yoghurt samples consisting of 80 samples of commercial and 40 samples of traditional yoghurt in Guilan province in the north of Iran. The occurrence and concentration range of AFM<sub>1</sub> in samples were determined by immunoaffinity column extraction and high-performance liquid chromatography. Analysis of yoghurts showed that all the samples were contaminated with AFM<sub>1</sub> in concentration levels ranging from 4.2 to 78.9 ng/kg. In general, 16 samples (13.33%) had higher AFM<sub>1</sub> level than the maximum tolerance limit (50 ng/kg) accepted by European Union, but the contamination level was lower than 500 ng/kg in all the samples, which is accepted by Codex Alimentarius and National Standard. The concentration of AFM<sub>1</sub> in 26 samples (21.66) was lower than 10 ng/kg. The range of contamination of AFM<sub>1</sub> was comparatively higher in traditional yoghurt (average concentration of 32.9 ng/kg) than that in commercial yoghurt (average concentration of 21.6 ng/kg; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01). Because yoghurt is the most popular dairy product consumed in Iran, the AFM<sub>1</sub> contamination is a serious problem for public health. This study reports the data of a first survey on the presence of AFM1 in yoghurt in Guilan, Iran.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>More than 300 mycotoxins had been identified but only a limited number have been found to be present in food and feedstuff at levels that could cause problems. Aflatoxins are mycotoxins produced as carcinogenic, teratogenic and mutagenic secondary metabolites by <italic>Aspergillus flavus</italic>, <italic>Aspergillus bombycus</italic>, <italic>Aspergillus parasiticus</italic>, <italic>Aspergillus nomius</italic>, <italic>Aspergillus ochraceoroseus</italic>, <italic>Aspergillus tamarrii</italic>, <italic>Aspergillus pseudotamarii</italic>, <italic>Aspergillus parvisclerotigenus</italic>, <italic>Aspergillus rambellii </italic>and certain members from <italic>Aspergillus </italic>subgenus<italic> nidulantes</italic> (<italic>Emericella</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0748233712446729">Frisvad et al., 2005</xref>). However, not all strains are able to produce aflatoxins, and hence all strains are recommended for screening of their aflatoxin production abilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0748233712446729">Fente et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0748233712446729">Moss, 2002</xref>). Aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) represents the highest degree of toxicity for animals, followed by aflatoxin M<sub>1</sub> (AFM<sub>1</sub>), G1 (AFG1), B2 (AFB2) and G2 (AFG2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0748233712446729">Gourama and Bullerman, 1995</xref>). AFM1 may be found in the milk of animals that have been fed with feed containing AFB1.</p>
<p>The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classifies aflatoxin B1 in group 1, as agents that are certainly carcinogenic to human: evaluation of the risk is well known because it is considered the most powerful hepatocarcinogenic agent in mammals. AFM<sub>1</sub>, on the other hand, is included in group 2, as an agent with possible carcinogenic effects to humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0748233712446729">IARC, 1993</xref>). The formation of AFM1, a metabolite of AFB1, occurs in the liver and it is excreted through the mammary gland in the milk of dairy cows (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0748233712446729">Cathey et al., 1994</xref>). When yoghurt was made from milk contaminated with AFM1, AFM1 was carried over into this product.</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0748233712446729">Tabari (2010</xref>) also found that the AFM1 levels differed with the milk products. Pasteurization processes, even those using UHT techniques, do not affect the AFM1 concentration drastically because of its heat stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0748233712446729">Galvano et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0748233712446729">Tabari, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>To protect consumers, particularly children, from contaminated milk and dairy products, several countries have established legislation to regulate the levels of AFB1 in feeds and AFM1 in milk. Thus, the European Union (EU) has set a maximum admissible level of 0.05 µg/kg in raw milk, heat-treated milk and milk for the manufacture of milk-based products like yoghurt (European <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0748233712446729">Commission, 2001</xref>), whereas the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has established an action level of 0.05 µg/kg in whole, low-fat and skim milk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0748233712446729">US FDA, 1996</xref>). The importance of AFM1 as a food safety hazard is reflected in the existence of a maximum permissible level of 0.05 µg/kg AFM1 in milk products like yoghurt established by the European Commission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0748233712446729">BS EN ISO 14501, 2007</xref>) and additional 17 national regulations Union, but according to the Codex Alimentarius and National Standard contamination level are lower than 500 ng/kg.</p>
<p>Guilan province in the northern part of Iran is more subject to high temperature and high humidity. These environmental conditions favor the contamination of animal feedstuffs by <italic>Aspergillus</italic> fungi. Below-normal soil moisture (drought stress) has also been found to increase the number of <italic>Aspergillus</italic> spores in the air. The increased load of spores in the air greatly increases the chances of contamination. Temperatures between 27°C and 38°C and relative humidity of 85% (corresponding to 18% grain moisture) are optimum for the growth of <italic>Aspergillus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0748233712446729">Cassel et al., 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>The objective of this work was to evaluate the level of AFM<sub>1</sub> in both industrial and traditional yoghurt in the region. This study reports the data of a first survey on the presence of AFM1 in Yoghurt in Guilan, Iran.</p>

<title>Sampling</title>
<p>In this study in 2009, AFM1 was analyzed in a total of 120 yoghurt samples collected based on the Iranian National Standard Sampling Method INS No.419. A total of 120 samples (80 samples commercial and 40 samples traditional) of yoghurt were collected. The industrial yoghurts were manufactured by dairy plants and the traditional yoghurt samples were made by local people, which offered their products to sell on the markets of Gilan province.</p>

<sec id="section4-0748233712446729">
<title>Chemicals</title>
<p>All of the solvents like acetonitrile, methanol, dichloromethane and water were of high-performance liquid chromatography grade and were purchased from Baker (Deventer, Holland). Acetonitrile and methanol used in ruggedness studies were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. Ltd. (St. Louis, MO, USA). The reference standard of AFM1 (from <italic>A. flavus</italic>, 10 µg) was purchased from Sigma–Aldrich. We prepared an AFM1 stock solution (5 µg/ml) by dissolving 10 µg of powder in 2 ml of pure acetonitrile; this solution was stable for 9 months at −20°C. The concentration was tested by a spectrophotometric method according to the European commission decision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0748233712446729">BS EN ISO 14501, 2007</xref>). Working standard solutions (0.1, 0.5, 1 and 2.0 µg/l) were prepared by appropriate dilution of pure acetonitrile and stored at −20°C when not in use; these solutions were stable for at least 3 weeks.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>A more recent advancement in quantitative extraction of AFM<sub>1</sub> and subsequent cleanup are the use of immunoaffinity columns. Modifications of the immunoaffinity-based methods for AFM1 were subsequently published and studied collaboratively, under the auspices of the International Dairy Federation and AOAC International, by a group mainly of European laboratories that could determine AFM1 in yoghurt at concentrations of 0.05 µg/l. A collaborative study resulted in the approval of AOAC method 2001 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0748233712446729">Dragacci et al., 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>The standard solutions of concentration from 0.05 to 10 µg/l AFM1 were used to find a calibration/standard curve as described by the following regression equation: <italic>y</italic> = 17.579<italic>x</italic> − 1.520, where <italic>y</italic> = area and <italic>x</italic> = amount of AFM1. The results showed the linearity of the standard curve over the range studied. The coefficient of determination (<italic>R</italic>
<sup>2</sup>) was 0.9998.</p>
<p>AFM1 was detected in all the examined yoghurt samples by average concentration of 28.2 ng/kg. The results on an amount of AFM1 are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0748233712446729">Table 1</xref>. Sixteen samples (13.33%) had higher AFM1 level than the admissible level (50 ng/kg) for adult established by the Commission of the European Communities (10% of commercial yoghurts and 20% of traditional yoghurts were contaminated higher than 50 ng/kg). In addition, 33.33% of yoghurt samples had higher AFM1 level than the acceptable level (25 ng/kg) for children (27.5% of commercial and 45% of traditional yoghurts). The range of contamination level varied from 4.2 to 64.7 ng/kg and from 7 to 78.9 ng/kg in commercial and traditional yoghurt samples, respectively.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In order to address the problem of AFM<sub>1</sub> in milk and dairy products, it is necessary to focus the attention on the most sensitive steps of feedstuff production for lactating cows. In order to prevent losses of yield and hazards for human and animal health, it is necessary to take care of cultural phases that can represent a critical point for fungal growth and mycotoxin production in an organic, low and a high-input farming system (e.g. excessive nitrogen fertilization in a high-input farming system; in organic and low-input farming system). To prevent future aflatoxin’s outbreaks, it is necessary to communicate about the potential risk deriving from unsuitable farming managements that could lead to the development of contaminated feeds and foods. However, only a few surveys refer to the occurrence of AFM1 in yoghurt. Some studies are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0748233712446729">Table 3</xref>.</p>

<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0748233712446729">Galvano et al. (1996</xref>), of the 114 samples of yoghurt, 91 (80.0%) contained AFM1 with levels ranging from 1 to 496.47 ng/kg. Later, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0748233712446729">Galvano et al. (2001</xref>) reported that in 120 yoghurts analyzed, 73 (61.0%) samples were contaminated with AFM1 at lower levels (1–32.1 ng/kg) when compared with those of the previous survey of 1996. In Campinas, Brazil, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0748233712446729">Sylos (1996</xref>) did not detect the presence of AFM1 in 30 of the tested yoghurts. According to these authors, the possible explanation for the absence of AFM1 is that cows in the Campinas area graze all year round. Another explanation could also be that the methodology used for the detection of AFM1 was the thin layer chromatography method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0748233712446729">Sylos, 1996</xref>). In a survey carried out by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0748233712446729">Kim et al. (2000</xref>) in the city of Seoul, South Korea, the presence of AFM1 was detected in 50% of the 60 yoghurt samples with levels ranging from 17 to 124 ng/kg. These results were in agreement with the study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0748233712446729">Martins and Martins (2004)</xref> who observed that AFM1 ranging from 19 to 98 ng/kg was detected in 18 (18.8%) yoghurt samples, and 78 samples (81.2%) did not reveal the presence of the toxin. Furthermore, in Turkey, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0748233712446729">Gurbay et al. (2006</xref>) verified the presence of AFM1 ranging between 62 and 366 ng/kg in 80% of 40 yoghurt samples.</p>
<p>In other study, we determined AFM<sub>1</sub> in Doogh (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0748233712446729">Tabari et al., 2011</xref>). Doogh is a yogurt-based beverage and is a popular dairy product in Iran, owing to its beneficial influence on human health and nutritional value and also found in Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, Armenia, Iraq, Syria, Turkey, as well as the Balkans.</p>
<p>We evaluate AFM1 contamination in 225 commercial doogh samples composed of traditional (115 samples) and industrial pasteurized doogh (110 samples) obtained from popular markets of Tehran, Iran. AFM1 was found in 100% of the examined doogh samples by average concentration of 49.7 ng/l. Aflatoxin M1 was detected in 151 (67.1%) samples. In Tehran, 27 of the doogh samples, 15 samples (12.8%) of traditional and 12 samples (10.8%) of industrial had higher AFM1 level than the maximum tolerance limit (50 ng/l) accepted by the EU, but the contamination level was lower than 500 ng/l in all the samples, which is accepted by Codex Alimentarius and National Standard. The results indicated that the contamination of the samples with AFM1 in such a level could not be a serious public health problem at the moment. This article represents the data of the first survey on the occurrence of AFM1 in commercial doogh marketed traditional and industrial in Tehran of Iran.</p>
