      <p>The Institute of Medicine’s <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0894318412447563">(IOM) 2010</xref> landmark report on the future of nursing addressed two issues. One issue was the problems of healthcare fragmentation, cost, quality, and accessibility and the other was the potential for the nursing profession to positively influences the aforementioned situations. The report was especially timely in light of the major changes in health insurance coverage that will accompany implementation of the 2010 Affordable Care Act (ACA).The crafters of the IOM report posited that significant improvements will be achieved by systemic changes in healthcare that will enhance nursing leadership in areas of healthcare quality assurance, cost containment, prevention, and primary care access. <italic>The Future of Nursing: Leading, Change, Advancing Health</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0894318412447563">IOM, 2010</xref>) called for nothing short of a sea change in how nursing is practiced and how nurses and other health professionals are educated in the United States. Four overarching themes of transformation carry through the report: (a) practicing to the full extent of our education; (b) achieving higher levels of education for more nurses; (c) making nurses “full partners, with physicians and other health professionals, in redesigning health care” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0894318412447563">IOM, 2010</xref>, p. 29); and (d) better workforce development planning and policy-making.</p>
      <p>The notion of nurses as full partners in healthcare redesign recognizes nursing’s uniquely holistic perspective, adaptive capacity, and front-line availability across the continuum of healthcare settings. Fundamental to achieving this full partnership and the other transformative goals is a normative expectation of interprofessional collaboration and coordination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0894318412447563">IOM, 2010</xref>). With the idea of the changing nature of nursing’s role and the idea of collaboration in mind, the authors of this column examine the concept and theoretical models of interprofessional collaboration before turning to the research implications of expanded and expected interprofessional collaboration.</p>
      <sec id="section1-0894318412447563">
         <title>Interprofessional Collaboration</title>
         <p>As stated previously, the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0894318412447563">IOM’s (2010)</xref> consensus report sounded the call for nurses to be full partners with physicians and other healthcare providers in healthcare provision and policy-making. This focus on greater interprofessional collaboration was also expressed in the IOM’s second recommendation to: “expand opportunities for nurses to lead and diffuse collaborative improvement efforts” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0894318412447563">IOM, 2010</xref>, p. 2). The second recommendation was further elucidated with the idea of collaboration between nurses and physicians and other health team members in conducting research, as well as in redesigning and improving health systems and practice environments.</p>
         <p>The recommendation for greater interprofessional collaboration reflects extensive research demonstrating that collaboration’s benefits include greater cost savings, improved patient outcomes, higher nursing job satisfaction and retention rates, reduced lengths of stay and costs and improved teamwork (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0894318412447563">IOM, 2010</xref>). Despite this evidence base for collaboration, the report noted that it is not the norm, and that changing the culture of healthcare toward greater collaboration will be a significant challenge.</p>

         <title>Interprofessional Collaboration in Research</title>
         <p>A desirable component of interprofessional collaboration is research collaboration. While professional nurses have often been involved in medical trials as research nurses, or have conducted independent nursing research, research in which medical and nursing professionals share primary investigator roles remains infrequent. Interprofessional research collaboration presents a challenge to historically cherished notions of disciplinary distinctiveness and research as an endeavor to develop unique bodies of knowledge within distinct disciplines. Such disciplinary research, oriented to the development of new knowledge and theory within respective disciplines, will remain an essential and valuable endeavor. It is also possible to recognize areas of intersectionality between and among disciplines that may well be amenable to collaborative research. Examples of such potential areas of research intersection may include comparative evaluation of healthcare delivery models, patient safety policies, information technology strategies, and cost-effectiveness research.</p>
         <p>In fact the recommendations of the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0894318412447563">IOM’s (2010)</xref> report for nursing research are extensive in terms of both research topics and processes. The accomplishment of much of this research is predicated upon the development and implementation of an infrastructure for collection of interprofessional healthcare workforce data. Identified research priority areas related to interprofessional collaboration include:</p>

         <p>However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0894318412447563">Ponte, Gross, Milliman-Richard, and Lacey (2010)</xref> reviewed the current state of the research evidence on interdisciplinary collaboration through an extensive literature review. Their summary demonstrated the nascent state of the science of interdisciplinary collaboration in the areas of both health professions education and organizational models and structures to support such collaboration. They also rightly acknowledged the persistent methodological challenges inherent in defining and measuring effective interdisciplinary collaboration and in demonstrating the causal relationship of such collaboration to patient care quality improvement. In their article they indicated a number of significant areas in which future research on interprofessional collaboration is needed. These include the effects of positive interdisciplinary collaboration on the provision of safer care, on clinical outcomes over time, and on the perceptions and experiences of family members of patients with chronic conditions. They also recommended that research be undertaken to investigate interdisciplinary collaboration in terms of its cost in human resources, medical management, and use of ancillary services. Lastly, they encouraged research to identify which organizational structures best foster consistent and effective interprofessional collaboration.</p>

         <title>Concept Analysis</title>
         <p>Since the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0894318412447563">IOM (2010)</xref> recommended such sweeping changes in healthcare education, practice, and research and focused on the idea of collaboration, it was felt by the authors of this column that the concept of collaboration required clarification. Therefore, a cursory review of the literature on the concept of collaboration was undertaken. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0894318412447563">Henneman, Lee, and Cohen (1995)</xref> used the concept analysis method developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0894318412447563">Walker and Avant (1988)</xref> to explore the idea of collaboration. They found the defining attributes of collaboration to be the fact that it is a joint, cooperative endeavor which includes willing participation, shared planning, and decision-making. There is a team approach, equal responsibility in non-hierarchical relationships where power is shared based on knowledge and expertise. The antecedents to collaboration that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0894318412447563">Henneman and colleagues (1995)</xref> uncovered were divided into personnel and environmental factors. Collaboration requires that personnel be ready to engage, which means that they understand their particular roles and have confidence in their own expertise. Furthermore, excellent communication skills are requisite for the process in addition to respect, sharing, and trust. As for environmental factors, the organization in which collaboration takes place must cultivate cooperation and foster interdependence while disavowing hierarchies. Furthermore, there must be “visionary leaders supportive of autonomy” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0894318412447563">Henneman et al., 1995</xref>, p. 105). Although the consequences of collaboration were only theoretical, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0894318412447563">Henneman and colleagues (1995)</xref> purported that there would be an increase in self-worth for the individual, maximum productivity for the organization, and improved patient outcomes. As for empirical referents, there should be dialogue among professionals who speak in terms of <italic>we</italic>, participate in multidisciplinary rounds, and score high on “collaborative practice scales” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0894318412447563">Henneman et al., 1995</xref>, p. 105). In the end, collaboration was considered to be a multifaceted process that is complex.</p>
         <p>The idea that collaboration is a process that is complicated was reiterated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0894318412447563">Petri (2010)</xref> in her concept analysis of interdisciplinary collaboration. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0894318412447563">Petri (2010)</xref> said that it is a problem-focused process that “represents a complex relationship between multiple disciplines” (p. 75) concerning patient care. As did <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0894318412447563">Henneman and colleagues (1995)</xref>, Petri also found that sharing is a necessary attribute for collaboration in which there is equal involvement in decision-making and a sense of identical power. The idea that accountability for the outcomes of the collaborative process is shared by the team was brought forth by both analyses. The analysis by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0894318412447563">Petri (2010)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0894318412447563">Henneman and colleagues (1995)</xref> supported each other’s antecedents of role awareness, communication, individual commitment, and organizational resolve. A notable difference between the two analyses was that Petri determined that interprofessional education was an antecedent for collaboration. The consequences of enhanced patient care, cost containment, and improved professional satisfaction were actually found in the literature by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0894318412447563">Petri (2010)</xref>.</p>
         <p>From the analysis, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0894318412447563">Petri (2010)</xref> developed a definition of interdisciplinary collaboration in the context of healthcare as being:
<disp-quote>
               <p>An interpersonal process characterized by healthcare professionals from multiple disciplines with shared objectives, decision-making, responsibility, and power working together to solve patient care problems; the process is best attained through an interprofessional education that promotes an atmosphere of mutual trust and respect, effective and open communication, and awareness and acceptance of the roles, skills, and responsibilities of the participating disciplines. (p. 80)</p>

      <sec id="section4-0894318412447563">
         <title>Theoretical Framework</title>
         <p>Both of the aforementioned analyses of the concept of collaboration are congruent with the model for interdisciplinary collaboration developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0894318412447563">Bronstein (2003)</xref>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0894318412447563">Bronstein (2003)</xref> delineated five core components of the process including: “(1) interdependence, (2) newly created professional activities, (3) flexibility, (4) collective ownership of goals, and (5) reflection on process” (p. 299). <italic>Interdependence</italic> supports the aforementioned idea that professionals join together and are dependent upon each other in order to reach a common goal. Additionally, Bronstein stated that mutual respect is requisite for collaboration and that professionals need to understand their roles and rely on each other’s expertise. In the end, the individuals involved should have a sense that there is more to gain than to lose when collaborating. The second core concept, <italic>newly created professional activities</italic>, represents the idea that a new structure arises when collaboration occurs since the focus is moved from the individual professional to the person who needs services and this becomes the basis for “new structures, policies, and service delivery systems” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0894318412447563">Bronstein, 2003</xref>, p. 300). <italic>Flexibility</italic>, the third concept, is “reaching productive compromise in the face of disagreement and the alteration of role as professionals respond creatively to what’s called for” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0894318412447563">Bronstein, 2003</xref>, p. 301). In other words, as the various professionals interact with the needs of the person in mind, roles will be blurred and each person will act as a resource. The idea of <italic>collective ownership of goals</italic> refers to the group having shared responsibility for the designation, design, and achievement of a mutually-defined goal. Compromise and negotiation are of paramount importance in this process. Of utmost importance is the idea that the person and family in need of services be considered as part of the collaborative team. Finally, Bronstein discussed the idea of <italic>reflection on process</italic>. She said that the individuals in the professional group must be “thinking and talking about their working relationship and process and incorporating feedback to strengthen collaborative relationships and effectiveness” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0894318412447563">Bronstein, 2003</xref>, p. 302). In contextualizing the model, Bronstein included a description of four influences: <italic>professional role, structural characteristics, personal characteristics</italic>, and a <italic>history of collaboration. Professional role</italic> involves the socialization of members of a particular discipline whereby values and practice norms are inculcated into the newest members. Chief among the values, which may be problematic for collaboration, is the idea of autonomy, which means that the professional can be self-directed. <italic>Structural characteristics</italic> include organizational support in terms of both time and money. Lack of administrative support becomes a barrier to effective collaboration. <italic>Personal characteristics</italic> are the ways that the members view each other outside of the roles they embody. Central to successful collaboration are the characteristics of trust, respect, and understanding by each member for other professionals. Finally, Bronstein stated that a <italic>history of collaboration</italic> influences the process because prior positive experiences of collaborative efforts tend to create future successful collaboration.</p>

      <sec id="section5-0894318412447563">
         <title>Barriers to Collaboration</title>
         <p>There are several barriers to effective collaboration many of which arise from the contextual influences described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0894318412447563">Bronstein (2003)</xref>. One, is the idea of being a professional. Professions exist because they fulfill a social mission and are valued since they perform a service that enhances all members of the society. Members of the professions are ones who have mastered knowledge related to their practice and also “support a cadre of investigators whose role it is to continuously advance its knowledge with a view to improving practices” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0894318412447563">Schlotfeldt, 2002</xref>, p. 6). Professions necessarily exist within silos and have boundaries that the members staunchly protect. Lawyers, physicians, and clergy have over time been considered members of a profession. However, in the recent past nursing has evolved into a profession and has defined itself as the “protection, promotion, and optimization of health and abilities, prevention of illness and injury, alleviation of suffering through the diagnosis and treatment of human response, and advocacy in the care of individuals, families, communities, and populations” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0894318412447563">American Nurses Association, 2004</xref>, p. 7). Thus, nurses serve in a capacity that benefits all of society. Nurses also have researchers who continuously discover new knowledge for the discipline and thus enhance the practices of the profession. The professional silos in which each discipline resides can create less than harmonious relationships as the members protect their boundaries and “ensure its members (its professionals) have common experiences, values, approaches to problem solving and language for professional tools” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0894318412447563">Hall, 2005</xref>, p. 190). Thus, sharing of knowledge in collaborative efforts may prove problematic when members consider the information to be exclusively within the domain of their profession.</p>
         <p>Another obstacle for collaboration may be the frame of reference from which a member of a profession views the world as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0894318412447563">Hall (2005)</xref>. The predominant paradigm for medicine is that of positivism and use of the scientific method in which objective data is valued as the search for a cure. The focus is more on actions and outcomes. The quality of an individual’s life and relationships do not take center stage for medicine as it does for other healthcare professionals. So, the question becomes how is a mutually-shared goal to be determined when one professional is focused on an aspect of healthcare that is diametrically opposed to the focus of another professional. Furthermore, members of the discipline of medicine are taught by their mentors to be leaders and take responsibility for decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0894318412447563">Hall, 2005</xref>). Therefore, the sharing of the design, implementation, and responsibility for outcomes may be problematic for members of the medical profession, and indeed other healthcare professionals who have been in positions of power.</p>
         <p>More problematic may be the obstacles for conducting research in a collaborative environment. One obstacle is that research has traditionally been focused on enhancing the knowledge base of a particular profession. In fact, research done using tenets of another discipline can seem to be incredulous since findings are considered to expand the knowledge base of a profession different from one’s own. For example, if nursing used a theory from psychology to guide a research endeavor, the findings from the study would support the discipline of psychology not the discipline of nursing. Another obstacle is that research can also be very competitive. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0894318412447563">McCallin (2006)</xref> brought forth this point when discussing interdisciplinary research. She said that early attempts at collaborative research projects were hampered by the competitive nature of the professionals involved and that “any variation from tradition was seriously criticized or simply regarded as unrealistic” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0894318412447563">McCallin, 2006</xref>, p. 90). An additional impediment to collaborative research is the time required to learn the frame of reference, language, and competencies of all the disciplines involved in a study. Furthermore just the logistics of conducting research lends itself to being a single-discipline venture. For example, just setting up one meeting with several professionals can be a daunting task let alone having to schedule numerous meetings over several months, which is required for a collaborative project to move along.</p>

      <sec id="section6-0894318412447563">
         <title>Possibilities for Research Collaboration</title>
         <p>Although collaborative research is laudable, we the authors want to put forth a conceptualization of collaborative research that would perhaps maintain the integrity of the healthcare disciplines including nursing and at the same time support the intent of the recommendations of the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0894318412447563">IOM (2010)</xref>. The conceptualization involves the idea of loosely coupled systems that evolved from general system theory. In general system theory, the function of a system is ultimately to achieve a goal and there are several types including both the open and closed variety. Open systems interact with the environment and are capable of adaptation. Closed systems are just the opposite. Furthermore, there are boundaries to systems, which is where each system or subsystem can be differentiated from its environment or other systems. Each system tends to its boundaries. Furthermore, information is passed from system to system using boundary objects. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0894318412447563">Weick (1982)</xref>, tightly and loosely coupled systems exist. Tightly coupled systems are those in which <italic>A</italic> affects <italic>B</italic> continuously, constantly, significantly, directly, and immediately. Conversely, in loosely coupled systems <italic>A</italic> affects <italic>B</italic> suddenly, occasionally, significantly, indirectly, and eventually (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0894318412447563">Weick, 1982</xref>). The most salient point is that in loosely coupled systems, autonomy is maintained with soft linkages between boundaries. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0894318412447563">Hedal (2010)</xref> used the idea of loosely coupled systems to explain the nature of collaboration in the healthcare arena along with problems that ensue related to boundary objects. He studied professionals who collaborated in the care of patients being treated for breast cancer in a Norwegian hospital. The professionals involved included cytologists, radiologists, and surgeons whose focus was to collaborate in the care of patients in order for them to leave the hospital in one day with a diagnosis and a treatment plan. Hedal found that the professions involved interacted <italic>occasionally</italic> rather than constantly, since each profession was represented during meetings to discuss shared workload, diagnosis, and treatment of patients, and unusual cases, but the individual member attending may not be the same each time. Members of the collaborative team also appeared at the meetings <italic>suddenly</italic> or unexpectedly. An example was that surgeons attended when time permitted and other disciplines entered into the conversation at unpredictable moments. Finally, connections occurred between professionals <italic>eventually</italic> rather than immediately as demonstrated by the fact that boundary objects (x-rays) at times caused confusion rather than clarity. Hedal concluded that multidisciplinary collaboration occurs among professionals but that boundary objects may both facilitate and impede the process.</p>
         <p>Although the aforementioned loosely coupled system as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0894318412447563">Hedal (2010)</xref> was in the practice arena, the idea is appealing for collaborative research since the disciplines involved were allowed to maintain their autonomy. Furthermore, there was no hierarchy and each profession equally shared in the decision-making process and owned the goal collectively. It is imperative that nursing tend to its boundaries and protect its fledgling profession and most of all its autonomy in the arena of collaborative research. When nursing is on equal footing with medicine and the hierarchy of past relationships is no longer of any consequence, collaborative research could occur at intersections of the disciplines without the dissolution of boundaries between them. In such an arena, each discipline could discuss the problems that arise while doing research confidently and the results would be in a shared domain. Discipline-specific research would continue and enhance the knowledge base of individual professions. Thus, boundaries would be maintained and most important of all newly gained autonomy would be protected for nursing and the fear of losing identity through blurring of roles would be attenuated.</p>
