<abstract>
<p>This article shows how journalists deploy membership categorization in managing conversational drama among ordinary individuals in live television discussion. The scripted agenda for the discussion is analyzed as an interactional project, being prosecuted by the hosting journalists. The case in focus is a Finnish discussion program broadcast six days after the 9/11 terrorist attacks in the USA in 2001. Five guests are invited to the studio and introduced to the audience. The membership categories that are activated at the beginning of each entrance are consequential to the way the interactional activities unfold in the rest of the discussion, leading from experiential entitlement to accountability and accusation. Introductory identifications are utilized in the question formulation to push moral accounts from the category members and to build an institutionally proper identity for the journalists. The collaboration in realizing the moral casting vividly illustrates the cultural power of the categorization device in action.</p>

<p>The arena of public discussion is increasingly regulated by journalistic procedures. This article examines the journalistic use of membership categorization devices in managing conversational drama in a television discussion among ordinary individuals.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1461445611433637">1</xref></sup> Live multi-party television discussions on current socio-political topics represent a long-established program format in the Finnish media. Previous research on the format has demonstrated that television discussions are carefully pre-structured by the journalists. A scripted agenda is used as a method of securing an interesting, flowing, informative discussion on the topic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1461445611433637">Nuolijärvi and Tiittula, 2000</xref>). The hosting journalists aim to elicit a lively yet ordered exchange of opinions between the participants. This task is challenging. As with any talk program, the popularity and fascination of the programs lies in the inevitable unpredictability of the progress and outcome of the conversation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1461445611433637">Clayman and Heritage, 2002</xref>). The hosting journalists have substantial control over topics, roles and turns in the discussion, and can even anticipate certain types of answer, but they can never determine the ultimate contribution of the studio guests beforehand. This article is intrigued by the question of how to handle the discrepancy between the pre-structured plotline and the openness of the guests’ talk in ongoing interaction. How is the scripted agenda actualized by the journalists? How are the guests made to play their part?</p>
<p>The article presents a case study of a Finnish discussion program called <italic>Tervo &amp; Päivärinta</italic>, in particular its episode entitled ‘To war against terrorism?’ broadcast six days after the 9/11 terrorist attacks in the USA in 2001. The program-makers have invited five guests to the studio. Guests enter the studio one at a time and each is introduced to the audience before joining the discussion, which has its ‘preliminary contours drawn in advance’ (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1461445611433637">Clayman, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1461445611433637">Nylund, 2003</xref>). I intend to investigate how guest introductions are made use of by the journalists in guiding the discussion in the intended direction. The line of questioning turns out to be challenging, yet this is realized in a way that evades transgressing the normative boundaries of a news interview (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1461445611433637">Ekström, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1461445611433637">Hutchby, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1461445611433637">Llewellyn and Butler, 2011</xref>). The research provides an illuminating example of the cultural power and applicability of membership categorization in the domain of institutional interaction. It illustrates how categorization and particularization can function as complementary institutional resources in question formulation, not only to cast the guests in the roles anticipated for them, but also to rewire binding moral identifications which guide the interactional moves throughout the discussion.</p>
<p>I will analyze the discussion using tools from conversation analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1461445611433637">Sacks et al., 1974</xref>) and membership categorization analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1461445611433637">Sacks, 1972a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1461445611433637">1972b</xref>), taking it that the sequential organization and the categorizations serve as the two sides of the same coin in accomplishing social order in interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1461445611433637">Fitzgerald and Housley, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1461445611433637">Schegloff, 2007a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1461445611433637">Silverman, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1461445611433637">Stokoe, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1461445611433637">Watson, 1997</xref>). The membership categories that are activated at the beginning of each entrance are indeed consequential to the way the interactional activities unfold in the rest of the discussion. I will approach the scripted agenda as an ‘interactional project’ which transcends the boundaries of a sequence, yet is an orderly interactional feature that shapes what goes on in interaction and is demonstrably oriented to by the participants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1461445611433637">Schegloff, 2007b</xref>: 244). The agenda is first managed by the journalists by attaching a which-type collection ‘nationality’ (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1461445611433637">Sacks, 1995</xref>, Lecture 6) to the guests, identifying them as ‘Americans’, and then by deploying this membership to push accounts from them. In the end, it is not only the moral identity of the guests but of the journalists as well that gets shaped in the process.</p>

<title>Membership categorization in broadcast political discussion</title>
<p>Some of the first examples Harvey Sacks used in introducing membership categorization as an analytic approach derived from institutional interaction. He scrutinized calls to a suicide prevention centre and adolescent therapy sessions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1461445611433637">Sacks, 1972a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1461445611433637">1979</xref>), making observations on the way the parameters of institutional roles are defined in interaction and on the cultural members’ methods of managing ingroup–outgroup relations. He also launched the concept of omnirelevant categories, referring to situated institutional roles which can effectively be activated at any point in interaction, for example, the therapist–patient pair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1461445611433637">Sacks, 1995</xref>, Lecture 14). Since the early days, membership categorization analysis has been applied to study a vast range of institutional domains, journalism and broadcast political discussions included.</p>
<p>One line of research has investigated membership categorization and the practices of normalization in newspaper articles on exceptional crimes (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1461445611433637">Eglin and Hester, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1461445611433637">Nikunen, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1461445611433637">Stetson, 1999</xref>). Journalistic descriptions draw from common- sense conceptions in articulating the moral order of categories in the news text. While the focus of this article is on situated interaction, the studies on broadcast political discussions on radio or television come closer to its interests. The scene of situated interaction allows for a better grasp of the workings of categorization and cultural conceptions as continuous negotiation in the reciprocal moves of the participants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1461445611433637">Antaki and Widdicombe, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>Studies on category work in televised discussion programs feature categorization as an active accomplishment and a strategic tool. Using the ways of describing a nation or a political enemy, the discussants produce identifications that serve to warrant their own future actions and prejudiced attitudes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1461445611433637">Leudar and Nekvapil, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1461445611433637">Leudar et al., 2004</xref>). Categorization can also function as a tool for the program-makers. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1461445611433637">Alan Bovet (2009)</xref> has studied how the setting for a televised bipolar debate is constituted through introductory categories. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1461445611433637">Stephen Hester and Richard Fitzgerald (1999)</xref> have done research on how the host makes use of guest introductions in conducting the conversation in radio phone-in programs. Introductory categories relate callers to the show’s topic, casting them as believable contributors and making them a relevant part of the program. Thus categorization is utilized in turning telephone calls into political entertainment on the radio.</p>
<p>Related to the intersection between the media, politics and public discussion, there has been a suggestion for a reconsidered paradigm for membership categorization analysis to cover the broader relevancies of democracy-in-action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1461445611433637">Housley and Fitzgerald, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1461445611433637">2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1461445611433637">2009</xref>). It is a suggestion that facilitates exploring program formats such as television discussions. The organization of interaction in Finnish socio-political discussion programs has been studied from several perspectives: pre-structure, goals, strategies, audience participation and accusations in political interviews (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1461445611433637">Berg, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1461445611433637">Kajanne, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1461445611433637">Nuolijärvi and Tiittula, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1461445611433637">Nylund, 2000</xref>). Membership categorization does not appear as an analytic tool in any of these studies. I claim, however, that membership categorization matters in conducting opinion exchange on television, providing a manageable grid of roles for the journalists who take advantage of moral orders, and cultural conventions in casting roles for the co-present participants.</p>
<p>In my study, I will take a cross-sequential look into the institutional use of categorization in a televised socio-political discussion. I investigate guest introductions as an interactional project, which is not only oriented to making guests relevant to the topic, but which is designed to carry through the whole one-hour discussion. This journalistic procedure involves a heavy dose of cultural commonsense. The cultural power of the categorization device becomes evident in the ways the journalists manipulate the identifications of respondents and use them to cast and direct the discussion according to a pre-structured plotline. To achieve the intended plotline, the sequential roles of a questioner and a respondent are layered with structurally informed morally binding cultural categories (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1461445611433637">Fitzgerald and Housley, 2002</xref>). Adding contextual details in the questioning serves as a means of control for the journalists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1461445611433637">Clayman and Heritage, 2002</xref>). By looking at the Finnish program format in terms of cultural categories, I aim to point out what membership categorization analysis can bring to explicating the organization of institutional actions in the case of television discussions.</p>

<title>Data and method</title>
<p>YLE, The Finnish Public Service Broadcasting Company, has broadcast live socio-political discussion programs on Finnish television for five decades. And the story goes on. YLE is a publicly financed media company committed to public service ideals such as supporting the democratic process and political equality, creating and developing domestic culture, securing equal nationwide access to its content, offering programming for minority groups and furthering enlightenment and education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1461445611433637">Hujanen, 2002</xref>). These inclusive, educative, democratic ideals guide the mission of a multi-party current affairs discussion. In empirical inspection, it is of course a question of whether and how the participants act out these ideals in their own orientations.</p>
<p>I will take a closer look at a Finnish discussion program called <italic>Tervo &amp; Päivärinta</italic> (1999–2002), a weekly one-hour discussion, led by two established journalists, Kari Tervo and Susanne Päivärinta. The particular episode, ‘To War against Terrorism?’, was telecast on 17 September 2001. It handles the 9/11 terrorist attacks that had taken place in the USA six days earlier. The discussion was broadcast live and uncut from the studio. There is no studio audience for the program, but for each episode the program-makers invite guests to the studio for a joint discussion and debate on a current topic. In the episode in question, there are five guests, all of whom are ordinary people; that is, no politicians, authorities or celebrities. Four of the guests have their roots in the United States and one in Afghanistan. All of them speak Finnish. The guests join the discussion one at a time and each is introduced and briefly interviewed as they come in. These introduction sequences are highly relevant in the management of the institutional task at hand.</p>
<p>Studies on institutional interaction seek to explicate the methods that are used in bringing the goal, identities and constraints of a given institutional situation to life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1461445611433637">Drew and Heritage, 1992</xref>). They lean on an ethnomethodological framework (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1461445611433637">Garfinkel, 1967</xref>) according to which social practices are accomplished collaboratively by participants in social interaction. The relevant context for action becomes apparent at the surface of the turn-by-turn unfolding talk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1461445611433637">Heritage, 1984</xref>). Accordingly, for an institution to emerge in talk, it is taken to be procedurally consequential to the way the talk gets organized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1461445611433637">Schegloff, 1991</xref>). An analyst is set out to reverse-engineer the cultural members’ techniques, methods and procedures through which any given institutional reality is reflexively constituted. This is not about revealing a unique interactional practice as such, but rather displaying its reflexive tie to the context and the institutional identities it makes relevant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1461445611433637">Arminen, 2005</xref>). One of the means of accomplishing the institutional goals in television discussions is provided by categorization.</p>
<p>Harvey Sacks, the innovator in the analysis of interaction, paid attention to the use of membership categories in talk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1461445611433637">1972a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1461445611433637">1972b</xref>). He observed the way cultural members work on recognizability, maintain social order and control social relations in describing and identifying people. Sacks’s insights on the organization and the application rules of this cultural device ground the methodology that has come to be known as membership categorization analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1461445611433637">Hester and Eglin, 1997</xref>). Sacks claimed that any competent member of the culture is capable of using the categorization device in everyday actions and understandings. Membership categorizations (such as male–female) are grouped together in collections (e.g. sex) and may form relational pairs (e.g. husband–wife) and units (such as mother–father–child, a family). In verbal actions, categories are used economically and consistently. One single category may be adequate for recognition and successive categorizations are heard as belonging to the same collection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1461445611433637">Sacks, 1972b</xref>). Thus, in the case of ambiguity, the relevance of the first categorization (e.g. baby) is further exemplified by following categorizations: for example, honey (love affair) versus toddler (stage of life) versus mother (family). The ultimate meaning of categories is only constituted in their use, actualizing culture in action here and now ‘this time through’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1461445611433637">Hester and Eglin, 1997</xref>: 20).</p>
<p>Categories are bound up with expectable activities and features, and this allows cultural members to identify actors and evaluate their performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1461445611433637">Sacks, 1972b</xref>). There are also normative expectations regulating the relations between the incumbents of a unit or a standardized pair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1461445611433637">Sacks, 1972a</xref>). Membership categorization work is always embedded in a moral order (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1461445611433637">Jayyusi, 1984</xref>). Lena <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1461445611433637">Jayyusi’s (1984)</xref> elaborations on Sacks’s findings grasp the occasioned nature of categorizations. Properties and features of a category may also be situatedly generated to serve the activity at hand. The inferences people make about what is happening is, for Sacks, the basis of the moment-by-moment produced social order (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1461445611433637">Lepper, 2000</xref>). Categorization facilitates these inferential operations. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1461445611433637">Jayyusi (1984)</xref> highlights that everyday language is impregnated with moral judgments that take the form of practical descriptions and evaluations. There are plenty of moral activities taking place in seemingly neutral institutional contexts as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1461445611433637">Bergmann, 1998</xref>). Television discussions make no exception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1461445611433637">Rautajoki, 2006</xref>). They indeed provide a platform for normative regulation of cultural identities in the public domain (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1461445611433637">Housley and Fitzgerald, 2009</xref>). In my data, the news story is covered by the journalists through the category ‘American’. Mobilizing a membership category and ascribing morally implicative features and actions to it serves to support institutional purposes, actually putting the play with categories and moral orders to institutional use quite effectively.</p>

<sec id="section3-1461445611433637">
<title>Casting the guests</title>
<p>The empirical analysis is divided into three parts: 1) staging experience; 2) gathering a unit; 3) managing accusation. Each part is illustrated by transcribed data extracts. As with any interactional project, the action of ‘following [a] scripted agenda’ does not fit neatly into a sequence, which makes the introduction of the findings a bit more complicated. In this empirical section, I will use the strategy of examining several extracts that imply the diverse lines or projects being prosecuted by some current bit of talk and constitute a kind of thread surfacing now and again as a persistent theme or project of the talk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1461445611433637">Schegloff, 2007b</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section4-1461445611433637">
<title>Staging national experience</title>
<p>The first extract is from the very beginning of the program, right after the opening line – the slot where the first guest joins in and is introduced to the audience. The translation from Finnish to English is mine. I have altered the names of the guests.</p>
<p>* DATA EXTRACT 1 - <italic>Tervo &amp; Päivärinta</italic> 17.9.2001 [0:00:15]</p>

<p>The journalist introduces the guest by his occupation, name, origin and current residence, and the guest confirms these descriptions (line 5). Following the economy rule, the introductory categories (teacher, citizen of the United States, Finnish resident) can be heard as topic-relevant. The relevance hierarchy between these categories is demonstrated by the first question formulation, which is fishing for individual experience concerning the respondent’s homeland (lines 10–15). According to the consistency rule, one can hear that this formulation elevates the relevance of the citizen category and together with it provides for the collection nationality. A citizen is pictured as an ordinary person with an ordinary occupation who is making a onetime visit to the studio and accounting for his experiences and feelings in the turmoil of a news event (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1461445611433637">Hamo, 2006</xref>). As it happens, he is answering them in Finnish from within Finland. The journalist phrases her question very provocatively (lines 6–10). The question preface creates an experiential context that invites a negative affective response to the question (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1461445611433637">Clayman and Heritage, 2002</xref>), which the answer delivers. Having first-hand knowledge of the topic is a common predicate of a lay participant in broadcast discussion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1461445611433637">Hutchby, 2001</xref>). However, besides granting entitlement to evaluate the news, mobilizing the ownership of an experience (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1461445611433637">Sacks, 1984</xref>) draws the respondent deeper into a category membership which starts to oblige him in the discursive turns of the discussion. The following question comes at the end of the interview section before the second guest comes in.</p>
<p>* DATA EXTRACT 2 - <italic>Tervo ja Päivärinta</italic> 17.9.2001 [0:02:46]</p>
<graphic id="img2-1461445611433637" position="anchor" xlink:href="10.1177_1461445611433637-img2.tif"/>
<p>The journalist formulates a question preface which suggests that the respondent has turned from feeling angry to feeling sad, and the respondent confirms this (lines 1–3). This trajectory of emotions then turns out to be an exception to a whole bunch of people, namely, the majority of his national fellow members. By this signaling-out procedure, the journalist excuses the respondent personally. The individual action is then contrasted with the rest of the category to which the respondent belongs. Using an accusatory why-question (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1461445611433637">Clayman and Heritage, 2002</xref>), the journalist puts the guest in the position of answering and accounting on behalf of the whole population (lines 4–6). Demanding an explanation for the prolonged anger marks the behavior of the Americans as morally dubious (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1461445611433637">Antaki, 1994</xref>). As a category member, the guest is taken to have access to the mentality of that national experience. Generalized accountability, which is protected against induction (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1461445611433637">Sacks, 1995</xref>, Lecture 8), demonstrates that the predicate ‘American’ is not an innocent description in the program. It activates a membership categorization device. This is further confirmed by the introduction of the second guest.</p>

<p>Basically, the second guest could be anybody related to the subject. Instead, this extract shows how the topical identity of the respondent builds on that of the first guest by placing them in the same membership category. The second guest is welcomed to the studio and introduced to the audience by her name. The journalist then describes her occupation, workplace and origin (lines 3–4). The origin is offered to the guest to confirm, which she does by repetition and confirmation token (lines 4–7). Occupational field might in fact be the thing that links the two guests together. However, the following question formulation foregrounds the relevance of origin (lines 8–12). Comparative question design parallels the respondent with the first guest, standing in the same experiential landscape as him, reflecting upon feelings aroused by events in their homeland. Guests can then be heard as belonging to the same collection, nationality, and being members of the same category, Americans.</p>
<p>The categorization device has now been mobilized. One manifestation of the device in operation is the use of the inferential term ‘we’ in the response (line 16). ‘We’ is used categorically here (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1461445611433637">Sacks, 1995</xref>, Lecture 8). It does not refer to ‘us’ talking here or ‘we’ guests in the studio, but to co-members of the category of Americans. It thus differs markedly from the formulation that the first guest made in relating his feelings to others, since he used ‘many people’ as his reference point. The later guest then again not only assigns agency to the category, but also treats the category as being under moral scrutiny, displaying her understanding of the locus of accountability in the situation.</p>

<title>Gathering a national unit</title>
<p>The two next guests are introduced to the audience in a similar way to the second one, by mentioning their origin and asking about their first thoughts and feelings, and thus bringing forth their nationality and their co-membership of the same category as the previous guests. In the next extract, the collection nationality is further elaborated by mobilizing a unit ‘nation state’ which gathers all the four guests together in relation to their leader.</p>

<p>The journalist first marks an all-inclusive question (line 1), which states that every one of the guests is responsible for answering it (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1461445611433637">Rautajoki, 2009</xref>). Answering as a group, the guests are taken to have something in common. There is a categorical use of the inferential term ‘your’ in the question formulation (line 2). The thing that the guests share is a president. The journalist makes a third-person reference to the words of ‘your president’ and then asks the guests to give their opinion on them (lines 2–9). Addressing co-members of a nationality, describing their president and obliging guests to comment on what he said activates a political unit, a nation-state. The unit consists of two relational incumbents, the president and the citizens. While journalists have typically appeared as using a third-person footing to elicit disagreement and secure journalistic neutrality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1461445611433637">Clayman, 1992</xref>), it is used quite differently here. The third person is the leader of the categorical unit which the guests belong to and the guests are expected to explain for him under the pressure of an alert and critical journalist. Asking for opinions further emphasizes the category of citizen, as formulating opinions is an action which is bound to being a citizen. The question is open, but it presupposes taking a side. Expressing thoughts and opinions is impossible without taking a stance either for or against the topic (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1461445611433637">Fitzgerald and Housley, 2002</xref>). The guests will not offer their sympathy for the president, but this does not save the rest of the category of Americans.</p>
<p>The immediate response maintains the categorical agenda. The unit is confirmed by making a joke about future elections (lines 10–12). A citizen is the one doing the voting in the elections. The joke and the aligning laughter (line 14) express the fact that citizens are indeed politically tied to their president through elections, but the speakers distance themselves morally from the words quoted. Even though the joke turns the spotlight on the ego of the power-hungry president, it presupposes that there are many people in the USA who would agree with the president and who offer him their support. Only the guests are excluded from that group. A little later in the discussion, the journalist puts this exceptionality into words.</p>

<p>A member deviating from the predicates of the category arouses a need for explanation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1461445611433637">Sacks, 1995</xref>, Lecture 11). This is what the journalists are doing here in asking whether the guests are profoundly dissimilar to their category (lines 3–4). The question is designed to favour positive acknowledgment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1461445611433637">Clayman and Heritage, 2002</xref>). After a short pause, the other journalist adds a suggestion explaining the difference: being more peace-minded because of living in Finland for so long (lines 6–7). This add-on has interesting aspects.</p>
<p>First, it entails an embedded presupposition (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1461445611433637">Clayman and Heritage, 2002</xref>) of the unexplicated American mentality, which is contrary to the Finnish peace-orientation. Thus, explanation assigns morally implicative collective attributes to the Americans (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1461445611433637">Jayyusi, 1984</xref>). Second, it conceals that the unit under moral investigation is indeed a nation. The categorical equivalent of American nationality is Finnish nationality. Third, the inference on the impact of Finnish culture provides a locus for identification for the television viewers (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1461445611433637">Housley and Fitzgerald, 2007</xref>), virtuous Finns being contrasted with dubious Americans. This might be one reason for the laughter after the question (line 9). Despite the correction from peace-minded to American-critical, the question can be heard to state dispreferred self-praise by the Finnish journalists. Moreover, it invites the guests to directly praise themselves in relation to their fellow members. The answers emphasize that there might be some difference but America is not a block of one opinion. Loyalty starts to arise.</p>

<title>Managing an outer accusation</title>
<p>When the program is two-thirds over, there is a plot twist. Someone from outside the focused category membership is invited into the studio. This fifth guest enters after a video insert criticizing the idea of potential counter strikes in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>* DATA EXTRACT 6 - <italic>Tervo ja Päivärinta</italic> 17.9.2001 [0:36:21]</p>

<p>The moral challenge of the discussion is intensified by bringing an Afghan, a party from the oppositional side of the conflict, into the discussion. It also allows the journalists to step back and leave claims-making for the parties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1461445611433637">Greatbatch, 1992</xref>). In the question preface, the journalist again mentions the origin of the guest, provokes affectivity and stresses the ordinariness of a living and feeling individual (lines 11–12), which puts him on the same level as the other guests. There is a shift in membership but not in agenda. While introducing and interviewing a non-American guest, the journalist stills puts the emphasis on the Americans and their ill-founded accusations and military plans (lines 12–14). In the next extract, the journalist manages to provoke a direct accusation from the Afghan guest.</p>
<p>* DATA EXTRACT 7 - <italic>Tervo ja Päivärinta 17.9.2001 [0:40:39]</italic></p>

<p>The Afghan guest takes the journalist’s follow-up question as a suggestion for justification, which triggers an accusation about the ruthless power politics and the avaricious arms trade of the American state. The accusation is directed at the nation as a whole, citizens included, as they are responsible for their democratic state (lines 18–19). Accusing the Americans as a whole is surely facilitated by the national unit which has been constructed in the previous discussion – only this time the signaling-out procedure is missing. The turn is then appointed to the rest of the guests.</p>
<p>* DATA EXTRACT 8 - <italic>Tervo ja Päivärinta 17.9.2001 [0:42:34]</italic></p>
<graphic id="img8-1461445611433637" position="anchor" xlink:href="10.1177_1461445611433637-img8.tif"/>
<p>By handing the turn over for the Americans to comment (lines 1–2), the journalist executes his institutional duty to secure a balance between opposing views in the discussion (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1461445611433637">Clayman and Heritage, 2002</xref>). With this discursive gesture, he also accentuates the contrast and marks the co-present Americans as the target of the accusation. Offense triggers personalized defense in the respondent. The moral challenge is dealt with by creating a persuasive two-class set (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1461445611433637">Sacks, 1995</xref>, Lecture 6), whereby the respondent reformulates the category American, splitting it into two, a good and a bad America, and positioning himself among the innocent ones (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1461445611433637">Stokoe, 2010</xref>). He first makes a summative we-list (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1461445611433637">Sacks, 1995</xref>, Lecture 11) of the co-present Americans (lines 12–13) and then identifies the felon: the military–industrial complex (lines 17–19). Besides controlling the moral status of the listed individuals, this personalized formulation puts the moral challenge that the American guests have had to face during the whole discussion out in the open: being an exception but being accused. There has been a constant contradiction between being a good (deviant) individual and a good (loyal) category member. When the question does not suggest the deviance of the co-present Americans, the respondent must pursue it himself.</p>
<p>Even though the response demonstrates resistance and criticism of the holistic way of targeting indignation in the accusation, there is a strong engagement in the established category membership. Reference to the words of a former president (line 23) pronounced with an American accent (lines 19–20) marks loyalty to the unit and also draws a line between political institutions and big corporations, as the latter fall beyond the reach and responsibility of ordinary citizens, which the accusation was about. The respondent won’t leave the defense there but sticks to the turn and identifies himself with the American civilians (lines 28–32), displaying personal commitment to the membership assigned for him by the script. Big corporations remain distant cross-members of the collection American, while the actual co-membership is attached to the innocent vulnerable civilians (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1461445611433637">Sacks, 1995</xref>, Lecture 14). This reformulation shifts the locus of attention from America the offender to America the victim (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1461445611433637">Stetson, 1999</xref>). Activity itself, defending one’s nation under external threat, underscores and ultimately redeems the collection nationality that the whole program is based on.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Unlike public figures such as politicians, experts and celebrities, an ordinary individual does not possess a presupposed public role to inform an encounter with a journalist (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1461445611433637">Rautajoki, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1461445611433637">Thornborrow, 2001</xref>). This poses a challenge for a journalist wanting to structure and manage a live discussion program on television. The cultural membership categorization device can be used as an institutional tool to cast enduring roles for discussants and to encourage a particular anticipated plotline, as in the case presented, facilitating the trajectory from identifications to accountability, collective attributions, accusation and defensive loyalty. These discursive turns form another example of ‘the experiential and the accountability interview’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1461445611433637">Montgomery, 2007</xref>) being mixed in journalistic endeavors (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1461445611433637">Thornborrow, 2010</xref>). An operative moral casting is conditioned by a clear affirmation of membership (public identification and its acceptance) at the beginning of the encounter. It is hard to resist being introduced by a seemingly innocent Pn-adequate which-type collection (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1461445611433637">Sacks, 1995</xref>, Lecture 6) such as nationality because everybody belongs to some category within that collection. Furthermore, in the aftermath of a crisis concerning the topical category, an ordinary person is easy to tempt into committing him or herself further to the membership by inviting a first-hand description of experiences related to the shattering event. The entitlement to own an experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1461445611433637">Sacks, 1984</xref>) can then be turned into category- bound obligations. Once the membership and the commitment to it are on display, they can be deployed to put pressure on and push moral accounts from the member on behalf of the population.</p>
<p>In the institutional framework of news interviews, the journalist is obliged to refrain from direct attacks on the interviewee and the interviewee is obligated to treat negative questioning with tact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1461445611433637">Clayman and Heritage, 2002</xref>). These standards also function in my data on television discussions. Journalists control the interrogation and the consent for it by a signaling-out procedure which plays the anti-inductive feature of categorization. Membership is taken to override individual actions. This allows journalists to let the respondents off the hook personally, yet oblige them to explain for the rest of the nation. Thus, category members are expected to account for their national fellow members and their president even though they themselves have acted otherwise. And they do. The willingness to stay within the category and defend it even under serious moral accusations reproduces the normative parameters of the device nation as a cultural tool. Loyalty to the population, especially under external threat, is commonly associated with national membership. The identifications and their uptake in the program work to realize the national identity in operation (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1461445611433637">Butler and Fitzgerald, 2010</xref>), invoking the ideological underpinnings of banal nationalism (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1461445611433637">Billig, 1995</xref>). In the end, the signaling-out device paradoxically serves to support building national stereotypes.</p>
<p>As the participant structure in television discussion is triangular, no action or identification can be considered one-dimensional (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1461445611433637">Rautajoki, 2009</xref>). The identity of the guests is tied to the identity of the journalists and the anticipated audience. Sacks talks about ‘categorizing the categorizer’ in referring to the fact that by uttering an identification of someone else the speaker also occasionally discloses something relevant about himself (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1461445611433637">Sacks, 1995</xref>, Lecture 6). What is achieved by the methods that the program-makers apply in this discussion?</p>
<p>The design of the program is set out to answer at least three kinds of question. How does one achieve the mission of the program format and yet differentiate it from its competitors (capturing the audience)? How does one cover an international news event happening in another country within the Finnish public sphere (addressing the audience)? How does one build a platform for being a good reporter and exercising journalistic ideals (serving the audience)? The membership categorization device allows the program-makers to achieve a current, contrastive, personal and yet morally obligating discussion on a matter of common concern. By inviting categorical representatives into the studio, the international topic is brought home to the Finnish public (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1461445611433637">Hester, 2002</xref>). The end result is entertaining (affective, authentic, contrastive), educative (perspectives, details, moral implications) and democratic (handling current affairs under alert and critical journalism). The omnipresent audience is even flattered by reconstructing a virtuous Finnish national identity on the side of the Americans. For the journalists, the device is used to build up an institutionally proper identity project. Witty categorization enables journalists to turn the discussion into an occasioned public sphere setting in which critical surveillance and public accountability can be exercised (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1461445611433637">Housley and Fitzgerald, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>At a time of crisis, the broader field of relations which journalism is interfering in and fuelling in the script is already sensitive and loaded with moral pressures and expectations. The exceptionality of the news topic may affect the intensity of public identifications and their uptake in interaction. However, the nature of the news event cannot of itself produce the binding web of interrelations and obligations which has been seen in use in the data. This is provided by the cultural power invested in the membership categorization device. A category membership is the only criteria justifying the interrogation of ordinary people in the studio. In journalistic procedures, the institutional question–answer format already grants the journalists a significant tool for interactional control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1461445611433637">Clayman and Heritage, 2002</xref>). Involving membership categorization in the question design further strengthens the initiative of the journalists. This study has evidenced how program-makers can apply this powerful cultural apparatus to script, cast and direct a seemingly unpredictable live discussion.</p>
