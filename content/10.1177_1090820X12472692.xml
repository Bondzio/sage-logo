            <p>The inner canthal orbicularis drives spontaneous blinking of the eyelids and is richly innervated by a branching network of twigs based largely on the buccal branch of the facial nerve. This segment of the orbicularis is relatively resistant to denervation from subciliary incisional approaches. Combined with proper eyelid tension, contraction of this segment of orbicularis results in the normal physiologic blink mechanism. The authors discuss how to achieve proper eyelid tension and position intraoperatively during the treatment of patients with a range of orbital morphologies.</p>

   <body>
      <p>On occasion, a stimulus for inquiry does not originate completely from academic curiosity but as a reaction to theories proposed by others that seem faulty. Such was a response to a premise promoted several years ago by some in the plastic surgery community that was advanced in peer-reviewed plastic surgery journals and at national surgical meetings. The foundation of this premise was based on cadaveric studies that demonstrated that nerve branches to the pretarsal orbicularis can be transected during a routine subciliary lower lid blepharoplasty incision. This was used as an effort to explain the occurrence of postoperative lower lid malposition following lower lid blepharoplasty. The authors then postulated that the standard blepharoplasty subciliary incision through skin and muscle likely caused damage to the motor innervation of the orbicularis muscle, which would then cause clinical harm to the patient<sup>
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1090820X12472692">1</xref>
         </sup>; the authors seemed to generalize their premise to include any surgery involving a subciliary incision.<sup>
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1090820X12472692">2</xref>
         </sup> Other studies and discussions followed, with similar conclusions based on further cadaveric dissections.<sup>
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1090820X12472692">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1090820X12472692">4</xref>
         </sup>
      </p>
      <p>This notion was contrary to the experience of ophthalmologists and oculoplastic surgeons who had been performing lower lid surgery for many decades. A number of nationally and internationally respected oculoplastic surgeons were privately consulted for their opinions on this premise and their response was one of universal rejection, based on personal communications by letter between the senior author (CDM) and George Bartley, MD, John Shore, MD, FACS, Allen Putterman, MD, SC, Richard Lisman, MD, Richard Collin, MA FRCS, Franz Josef Steinkogler, MD, Mike Patipa, MD, FACS, and Richard Anderson, MD. The authors feel that this erroneous concept needs to be addressed because of its incorrectness and, more particularly, because it affected a subspecialty of surgeons who make lower lid incisions in the course of their normal surgical practice.</p>
      <p>The occurrence of lower lid denervation caused as a result of subciliary incisions was rebutted with electromyographic (EMG) evidence: lower lid EMG results were found to be normal before and after subciliary incision combined with orbicularis dissection, as performed in cosmetic patients.<sup>
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1090820X12472692">5</xref>
         </sup> In addition, this disconnect between the plastic surgery literature and the opinions of numerous oculoplastic surgeons stimulated a review of our past clinical experience with orbicularis surgery and spurred further investigative efforts in our practice to clarify eyelid motor innervation and the mechanics of the orbicularis oculi muscle. The initial effort was a review of past surgical treatment of blepharospasm patients, in which the orbicularis muscle was selectively denervated and resected. The surgery cases for benign essential blepharospasm (BEB) were all completed in the years before botulinum toxin injections; however, all records, images, and videos of the blepharospasm patients had been retained and were used in this review.</p>

         <title>The Surgical Treatment of Blepharospasm Patients</title>
         <p>Historically, for those patients with BEB who were resistant to medical therapy, surgical intervention was performed in due course using 2 procedures. The initial procedure involved surgical denervation of the eyelids with the Reynolds technique. Subsequently, the surgical deconstruction of the eyelids was performed with a modification of Anderson’s neuromyectomy.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1090820X12472692">6</xref>
            </sup> Later, botulinum toxin type A (Botox; Allergan, Inc, Irvine, California) replaced surgical treatment in most cases; however, valuable insight into the biomechanics of eyelid movement was gained with the surgical procedures described.</p>

            <title>Reynolds Procedure</title>
            <p>From 1975 to 1980, 22 patients (44 procedures) were treated by the senior author (C.D.M.) and his colleagues for BEB using the technique described by Reynolds et al,<sup>
                  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1090820X12472692">7</xref>
               </sup> with good improvement in most.<sup>
                  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1090820X12472692">8</xref>
               </sup> An incision was made into the parotid gland, and the trunks of the facial nerve were identified and stimulated to demonstrate which nerve fibers were causing spasms in the eyelids. Only those nerve branches that created eyelid spasms were avulsed, and only the zygomatic branches of the facial nerve were involved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1090820X12472692">Figure 1</xref>). All surgeries showed reduction or elimination of spasms with good retention of eyelid closure by blinking. No lower lid ectropion was observed in the majority of these patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1090820X12472692">Figure 2A</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1090820X12472692">C</xref>). An occasional patient did show some deficiency in blinking, as well as lower lid malposition. A close inspection of the postoperative images revealed that these patients also demonstrated ipsilateral weakness in lip elevation, demonstrating loss of buccal branch function. Since only the visible zygomatic branches were avulsed, it was felt that in these patients, the loss of buccal branch activity was the result of either anastomotic variation of nerve branching or surgical error (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1090820X12472692">Figure 2D</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1090820X12472692">F</xref>). This procedure alleviated many of the patients’ spasms and allowed them to become functional in most cases, although recurrence of spasms occurred in many patients over a period of time. Due to a high incidence of facial nerve regeneration and recurrence of spasms, surgeons treating blepharospasm began to employ the addition of orbicularis myectomy to the treatment regimen.</p>

         <title>A Modified Functional Classification of the Orbicularis Oculi</title>
         <p>Observations from the surgical outcomes of the treatment of BEB with the myectomy procedure suggest a reclassification of the orbicularis muscle with regard to function. The previous description of the orbicularis muscle describes a distinction between the orbital, preseptal, and pretarsal portions of the orbicularis: the pretarsal portion subserves spontaneous blinking, the orbital portion subserves forced closure, and the preseptal portion performs a combination of each.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1090820X12472692">10</xref>
            </sup> As a result of the findings of the above myectomy procedures, it became clear that normal blinking and normal lower lid position are retained even after all extracanthal orbicularis has been excised. Extracanthal excision did eliminate the offending eyelid spasms of BEB. This suggests a more precise division of labor that recognizes the distinction between inner canthal and extracanthal orbicularis in the eyelid closure mechanism. The extracanthal orbicularis, innervated by zygomatic branches of the facial nerve, is responsible for squeezing, animation, expression, and protection from flying objects and is the cause of most symptoms of BEB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1090820X12472692">Figure 5A</xref>). As we casually watch television, we do not use the extracanthal orbicularis or its zygomatic innervation. By contrast, the inner canthal orbicularis, currently appreciated to be innervated by the buccal branches of the facial nerve, is responsible for normal blinking, passive eyelid closure, lower lid tone and position, and the tear pump movements of the eyelids. The inner canthal orbicularis itself is substantial in size, significantly thicker than the pretarsal orbicularis, with thick extensions that insert deep in the medial canthus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1090820X12472692">Figure 5B</xref>). As we sit passively in a room blinking, only the inner canthal orbicularis is contracting.</p>

         <title>Innervation</title>
         <p>The division in orbicularis function also dictates a concomitant division of innervation as well. In both the Reynolds procedure and the modified Anderson neuromyectomy, the zygomatic nerve supply to the orbicularis muscle was completely excised, leaving only the buccal branch for eyelid innervation. In 1985 (just before the advent of botulinum toxin injections), EMG studies were performed on the strips of orbicularis dissected with the neuromyectomy procedure that were still attached in the inner canthus. In these studies, the extracanthal orbicularis was completely dissected free, with the exception of its base, which was left intact at the inner canthus. The main trunk of the facial nerve was then stimulated and action potentials were observed in the orbicularis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1090820X12472692">Figure 6</xref>). These action potentials could only have originated from the intact buccal branch of the facial nerve (C. D. McCord and D. Gossman, unpublished data, 1985).</p>

The dissection was difficult, and the nerve branches were smaller than expected. In all dissections, several branches appeared to anastamose with regional sensory nerves, including the infraorbital nerve primarily, as well as the supratrochlear and infratrochlear nerves (C. D. McCord and D. Ford, unpublished data, 2003-2004). A review of the literature supports this interpretation.<sup>

            <title>Orbicularis Motor End Plates</title>
            <p>During a national plastic surgery meeting in 2005, an associate (Mark A. Codner, MD) found it necessary to refute a prominent plastic surgeon who dismissed the importance of the inner canthal orbicularis during eyelid blinking mechanics. In the dismissing surgeon’s view, the role of the inner canthal orbicularis was overstated because his own studies failed to identify significant motor end plates in histological preparations of that region of the orbicularis muscle (M. A. Codner, personal communication, 2005). In light of this statement, a study was undertaken, in conjunction with the Emory University Department of Cell Biology, which demonstrated that the orbicularis muscle was, in fact, replete with motor end plates. The motor end plates became evident after using a more specific motor end plate-specific stain, rhodamine-conjugated α-bungarotoxin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-1090820X12472692">Figure 11</xref>). At the conclusion of the study, Dr Arthur English, the collaborating cell biologist, stated that the “orbicularis motor end plate arrangement is unlike any other skeletal muscle in the body, except cardiac muscle. The eyelid muscle acts as a functional syncytium. Action potentials fired from different neurons lead to a faster impulse transmission, which is needed for the function of the eyelid.” (H. Seify and A. English, unpublished data, 2005).</p>

            <p>Coupled with our observations after the surgical treatment of blepharospasm, the fact that orbicularis innervation resembles a functional syncytium further serves to weaken the premise that a single subciliary incision can have a damaging, denervating effect on the eyelid. Under the weight of the clinical evidence, we can assert rather strongly that the engine of lid position, tone, and spontaneous lid blinking is the inner canthal orbicularis, with its buccal branch innervation. As in all systems, without adequate resistance, an engine can do no meaningful work. A more complete understanding of eyelid configuration and closure mechanics requires an appreciation of the rest of the biomechanical system, specifically canthal anchoring and the surgical modifications thereof.</p>

            <title>Eye Fissure Shape and Lateral Canthal Anchoring</title>
            <p>Before discussing surgical decision making during lateral canthal anchoring, it is important to understand the perception of the “normal” eye fissure shape, particularly as perceived by patients before and after cosmetic surgery. Intraoperative decision making during lateral canthal fixation has a direct effect on that shape. Eye fissure shape is normally defined by the 2 white triangles on either side of the cornea, the nasal triangle and the lateral triangle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-1090820X12472692">Figure 12</xref>). The nasal triangle has the least variability with surgery. It is the lateral scleral triangle that commonly varies in size and shape with the surgical positioning of the lateral canthus. Normally, the lateral scleral triangle is larger and more triangular than the nasal scleral triangle. In addition, the lateral canthus is usually positioned at a slightly higher level than the medial canthus. (The horizontal corneal diameter and corneal shape is roughly the same in all adults.)</p>

Supraplacement of canthal anchoring, many times combined with release of the inferior retinaculum, can reposition the lower lid in cases of mild prominence.

A counterpull at the lateral canthus must be present to convert the inner canthal pull to a vertical vector so that the eyelids will close with each blink. If this counterpull is lost due to canthal weakness or dehiscence (the “free-floating” canthus), the vertical vector of closure will be lost. Impaired blink excursion and blink velocity will result, leading to inadequate eyelid closure, producing a characteristic “fishmouthing” movement of the lids toward the nose during blinks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig20-1090820X12472692">Figure 20</xref>; a related video is available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.aestheticsurgeryjournal.com" xlink:type="simple">www.aestheticsurgeryjournal.com</ext-link>).</p>

            <p>Inadequacy or dehiscence of the lateral canthus can occur from the aging process (the cumulative effect on the canthal tendon from decades of 10-12 blinks per minute), inflammation, and trauma (including surgical trauma). In clinical situations where there is canthal dehiscence causing poor closure (and often anomalous eye fissure shape), reattachment of the canthal tendons with standard canthoplasty techniques can be performed when the quality of the tissue permits. With inadequacies in the eyelid tissue or periosteum, advanced techniques such as drill-hole fixation or special patching with fascia or acellular porcine cross-linked dermal collagen (ENDURAGen; Stryker, Inc, Kalamazoo, Michigan) may be used.<sup>

         <title>Conclusions</title>
         <p>This review of the biomechanics of eyelid closure and position incorporated decades of oculoplastic surgical experience, anatomical studies, and histological studies to develop a reclassification of the division of labor of the orbicularis oculi muscle, emphasizing the central importance of the inner canthal orbicularis and its buccal branch innervation, as well as its role in spontaneous blinking. Its role in supporting lower eyelid position and lower eyelid tone also continues to be significant. The presence or absence of isolated lower eyelid subciliary incisions plays no role in this model. Specific considerations should be made for canthal anchoring to ensure a desired eye fissure shape.</p>
