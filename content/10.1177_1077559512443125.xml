<abstract>
<p>This study sought to investigate whether the reason for placement was associated with the subsequent risk of arrest. The author has focused on youth entering care for reasons of maltreatment and for child behavioral problems. The author stratified the sample based on a history of juvenile delinquency. The sample was diverse and included youth between 8 and 16 years of age with at least one episode in a substitute care child welfare setting (<italic>n</italic> = 5,528). Approximately 23% of youth were placed in child welfare for reasons others than maltreatment; specifically child behavioral problems. Youth placed for behavioral problems were significantly more likely to live in congregate care facilities, experience placement instability, and more likely to experience at least one arrest. A prevailing argument is that child welfare offers a broader range of family-based services as compared with the secure settings of juvenile justice. High rates of congregate care placement reported in the current study indicate that family-based services are infrequently associated with youth placed for behavioral problems in child welfare. High rates of subsequent arrest indicate that the congregate care approach for youth with behavioral problems in child welfare is limited.</p>

<p>The primary purpose of child welfare is to respond to the needs of abused and neglected children. Although policies and procedures vary by jurisdiction, States manage their response with a specialized set of laws, funding mechanisms, and constellation of public and private agencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1077559512443125">Waldfogel, 1998</xref>). Despite the establishment of policies and procedures intended to connect maltreated children with child protection services, it is becoming increasingly apparent that child welfare systems are expected to serve youth that fall beyond the traditional scope of abuse and neglect. This is most evident in New York City where parts of the child welfare system merged with juvenile justice so that families could be strengthened through evidence based and family-oriented alternatives to detention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1077559512443125">Mattingly, 2010</xref>). The placement of youth with behavioral problems in substitute care settings and the delivery of mental health services is nothing new to child welfare (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1077559512443125">Bernstein, Snider, &amp; Meezan, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1077559512443125">McMillen, Scott, Zima, Ollie, &amp; Munson, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1077559512443125">Aarons et al., 2010</xref>). Yet, these behavioral and mental health problems are often assumed to be co-occurring with maltreatment, rather than as the sole reason for placement. Even in a recent study focused specifically on child welfare placements and adult criminality, the study authors note that child welfare services are intended to moderate the consequences of maltreatment by creating a safe environment for “abused and neglected children” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1077559512443125">DeGue &amp; Widom, 2009</xref>, p. 344). Perhaps, this stated intent represented the standard practices and limited score of child protection in the late 1960s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1077559512443125">Widom, 1989</xref>), but the modern system and associated expectations of child welfare have clearly evolved. Unfortunately, this evolution and expansion of responsibilities are not reflected in the empirical literature.</p>
<p>Studies of substitute care in child welfare primarily focus on risk of placement in foster care, the type of care entered, the instability of placement (e.g., reason for instability, outcomes associated with instability), or the long-term impact of placement itself (e.g., child well-being; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1077559512443125">Beeman, Kim, &amp; Bullerdick, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1077559512443125">Berger, Bruch, Johnson, James, &amp; Rubin, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1077559512443125">James, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1077559512443125">Ryan &amp; Testa, 2005</xref>). With the exception of one study on the physical health of young children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1077559512443125">Takayama, Wolfe, &amp; Coulter, 1998</xref>), few studies focus specifically on the reasons for placement and no studies focus on the long-term outcomes associated with youth placed in substitute care settings for reasons other than maltreatment. The current study addresses this critical gap in the literature by investigating the experiences and outcomes of youth placed for abuse, neglect, and/or child behavioral problems.</p>
<p>The estimates of youth in child welfare with emotional and behavioral problems are well documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1077559512443125">Clausen, Landsverk, Ganger, Chadwick, &amp; Litrownik, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1077559512443125">Leslie et al., 2005</xref>). Estimates from the National Survey of Child and Adolescent Well-Being indicate that 45% of youth associated with intact family cases and 54% of youth associated with a substitute care placement have at least one mental health problem (Burns et al., 2006). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1077559512443125">Barth, Wildfire, and Green (2006)</xref> estimate that approximately 19% of children enter substitute care, at least in part for mental health problems and with the hopes of receiving mental health services. These estimates vary by urbanicity but raise questions about the match between the needs of individual youth and the stated purpose and expertise of child welfare. The concerns and questions surrounding this match between individual needs and professional capacity date back at least two decades when David <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1077559512443125">Fanshel (1992)</xref> introduced the concept of a two-tiered child welfare system. Fanshel argued that one tier of the system focused primarily on permanency planning and a second tier focused on ameliorating child behavioral problems and interrupting the development of criminal careers. This idea of a two-tiered approach has yet to materialize in the field.</p>
<p>We hypothesize that youth placed in substitute care for reasons other than maltreatment follow different pathways through the child welfare system and experience significantly worse outcomes as compared with youth placed in child welfare for reasons of abuse or neglect. We focus on both intermediate experiences (e.g., placement stability and congregate care placements) and longer term outcomes (e.g., arrest). Our hypothesis emerges from the recognition that child welfare is not designed to address behavioral health or juvenile rehabilitation and child behavioral problems are often responsible for placement instability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1077559512443125">James, 2004</xref>). Moreover, there is a growing recognition that significant barriers exist (e.g., poor identification protocols) that prevent the delivery of specialized emotional and behavioral related services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1077559512443125">Leslie et al., 2005</xref>). In a study of mental health services for open cases in child welfare only 28% of children received specialty mental health services, despite more than 40% of these children scoring in the clinical range on the Child Behavior Checklist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1077559512443125">Hurlburt et al., 2004</xref>). Moreover, even when services are provided, the evidence indicates that very few children actually receive care consistent with standards proposed by the Child Welfare League of America, the American Academy of Pediatrics, or the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1077559512443125">Raghavan, Inoue, Ettner, Hamilton, &amp; Landsverk, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>In the current study, we focus on youth entering child welfare settings for reasons of maltreatment and/or child behavioral problems. Although we are primarily interested in the outcomes associated with youth placed for behavioral problems, the dependent measure of central interest is subsequent contact with the justice system and thus we identify and classify youth coming to child welfare with a history of juvenile justice involvement. We argue that as a result of a mismatch between individual needs (largely behavioral) and the service response (oriented to safety and permanency), child behavioral problems and juvenile offending behaviors maintain or deteriorate, thus increasing the risk of subsequent arrests. Justice involvement is an important outcome for child welfare systems, as the foster care population ages and state agencies are increasingly concerned with broader measures of child well-being.</p>
<p>There exists a fairly extensive literature focused on the increased risk of delinquency and crime for victims of child maltreatment. Cathy Spatz <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1077559512443125">Widom (1989)</xref> pioneered this area of inquiry with a prospective matched cohort study of children between 1967 and 1971. Early studies focused on the cycle of violence, but this literature has matured to include a wide range of critical outcomes including academic achievement, truancy, school expulsion, grade retention, substance abuse, aggression, depression, and long-term economic well-being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1077559512443125">Buist &amp; Janson, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1077559512443125">Currie &amp; Widom, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1077559512443125">Horwitz, Widom, &amp; McLaughlin, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1077559512443125">Kaplow &amp; Widom, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1077559512443125">Landsverk, Davis, &amp; Ganger, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1077559512443125">Newton, Litrownik, &amp; Landsverk, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1077559512443125">Redd, Cochran, &amp; Hair, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1077559512443125">Verrecchia, Fetzer, Lemmon, &amp; Austin, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1077559512443125">Yonezato, 1992</xref>). Specific to the study of maltreatment and justice involvement, there is a long-standing concern that a small group of adolescents in the child welfare system account for the relatively high rates of delinquency, adult criminality, and violent criminal behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1077559512443125">Widom, 1991</xref>). The inability to accurately identify the youth most likely to offend is due in part to the methodological limitations associated with previous studies. Specifically, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1077559512443125">Widom (1991)</xref> notes that aggregating placements for all youth obscures important subgroup differences and hypothesizes that a small group of likely offenders in child welfare might enter substitute care settings for behavioral problems. The current study addresses this methodological concern. Specifically, we identify and classify several unique subgroups of youth entering child welfare settings and model the risk of subsequent involvement with the justice system. Although we are interested in understanding how justice involvement may vary across all placement subgroups, we are particularly interested in youth placed for behavioral problems as compared with youth placed strictly for reasons of child abuse and neglect. Given our noted concerns regarding a potential service mismatch, we hypothesize that youth placed for behavioral problems will ultimately experience significantly higher rates of justice involvement.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>Several sources of data were made available via a unique statewide data sharing agreement. The data sharing agreement provided access to all administrative records for all youth associated with at least one official child protection investigation in the state of Washington between January 1, 2000, and December 31, 2009. The child welfare records included demographic information, allegations of maltreatment (report date, type of maltreatment, finding), and child welfare services (placement dates, placement types, reasons for placement). The reasons for substitute care placement included sexual abuse, physical abuse, neglect, parental substance abuse, child disability, inadequate housing, abandonment, and child behavioral problems.</p>
<p>The delinquency records originated with the Washington State Center for Court Research (WSCCR). The WSCCR records included all charges for all minors in the state of Washington between January 1, 2000, and June 30, 2009. The arrest records were limited to Washington State and include youth demographics, arrest date, offense type, and judicial disposition. The arrest records captured both juvenile and adult offending. The child welfare and arrest records did not share a common unique identifier and were thus linked by the State of Washington using last name, first name, birth date, race, and gender via Statistical Analysis System (SAS) probabilistic matching software. To address minor differences across records, the SAS software utilizes SOUNDEX coding to adjust the sensitivity level for matching characters based on phonetic similarities.</p>

<title>Coding Reasons for Placement</title>
<p>We were interested in understanding why youth enter care. We used the “reason for removal” variable (indicated by child welfare caseworker) and historical records of juvenile arrests to classify various referral populations. In Washington State, individual youth can enter a substitute care setting in response to a single event or to address numerous problems. For example, a child might enter foster care in response to a substantiated allegation of abuse and for child behavioral problems. It is important to classify youth entering care for multiple reasons as there exists a broad literature on the accumulation of risks and the likelihood of maladjustment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1077559512443125">Gerard &amp; Buehler, 2004</xref>). To capture these unique subpopulations, we used the reasons noted by the child welfare caseworkers to distinguish between placements as a result of child abuse and neglect from placements as a result of child behavioral problems. Because of the unique data sharing agreement with WSCCR, we were also able to identify youth coming to child welfare with a history of juvenile justice contact. Disentangling this population is important for at least two reasons. First, the maltreatment and delinquency literature focuses almost exclusively on youth starting in child welfare and then moving to juvenile justice. Our method of classifying youth as they enter care advances this literature by estimating the population of youth that come to child welfare with a history of juvenile justice involvement. Second, youth with prior arrests may represent a greater proportion of individuals entering the child welfare system for behavioral problems as compared with the individuals entering for reasons of maltreatment. As the dependent measure is subsequent arrest, and as prior arrests are a very powerful predictor of future arrests, failure to disentangle these youth might lead to overestimating the association between placement for behavioral problems and the risk of subsequent involvement with the justice system.</p>
<p>Using both the caseworker’s documented reason for placement in combination with official records from the Washington courts, we developed the following six referral groups. CAN refers to youth entering placement for reason of abuse/neglect and with no prior juvenile arrests and no stated behavioral problems; CANP refers to youth entering placement for reasons of abuse/neglect, with at least one prior juvenile arrest, but with no stated behavioral problem; BEH refers to youth entering placement for behavioral reasons only (i.e., no official reports of child abuse or neglect) and with no prior juvenile arrests; BEHP refers to youth entering placement for behavioral reasons only and with at least one prior juvenile arrest; MIX refers to youth entering placement for both behavioral reasons and as a result of abuse/neglect, but with no prior juvenile arrests and finally MIXP refers to youth entering placement for both behavioral reasons and as a result of abuse/neglect, and with at least one prior juvenile arrest. It is of course possible that the child’s behavioral problems emerged in response to an undocumented experience of maltreatment. Similarly, it is possible that a substantiated report of physical abuse occurred in response to a child’s behavioral problem (e.g., physical aggression directed toward parent). In the current study, there is no way to adjust for these possibilities. Thus, our measure of reason for placement is limited to the official caseworker’s documentation.</p>

<sec id="section3-1077559512443125">
<title>Sampling and Analytic Plan</title>
<p>We selected a sample of youth with their first episode in substitute care between 2000 and 2003. We limited our sample so that youth were at least 8 years old as of January 1, 2000. These selection criteria ensured that youth would be old enough for a delinquency petition and that each youth would be exposed to the risk period for at least 5 years. Our initial sample included 5,626 youth, but 98 (1.7%) youth were missing data and thus dropped from the analytic file. The final sample is comprised of 5,528 youth.</p>
<p>Our primary interest was modeling the risk of justice involvement, yet we also investigate differences in the types of placements utilized and compared rates of placement stability. Regarding placement type, we created a dummy variable to indicate whether or not youth enter congregate care. Congregate care was defined as group homes and larger residential facilities. Foster family care is the reference group. If child welfare systems are more family focused and actually represent an alternative to detention, congregate care will be used sparingly. Placement stability was measured by summing the total number of movements between unique facilities within this first placement spell. The distribution of placement stability was nonnormal, and thus we created a categorical variable to capture youth associated with one placement, two placements, and three or more placements. Involvement with juvenile or adult corrections was defined as any arrest subsequent to the youth’s placement in child welfare.</p>
<p>We explored the differences between the six referral groups and compared the relative risk of placement in congregate care, the relative risk of placement instability, and the rate of subsequent arrest. We used Cox regression to examine the influence of individual variables on arrest rates. We developed separate regression models based on the youth’s prior involvement with the juvenile justice system. Although we were interested in comparing the risk of subsequent justice involvement across all six referral groups, several of the referral groups were defined in part by their prior involvement with the juvenile justice system. This prior experience will undoubtedly be correlated with subsequent offending. To account for the endogeneity of prior arrests, we stratified the sample by prior justice contact and developed unique Cox models for youth with and without a history of juvenile arrests. Cox regression is similar to logistic regression in that it enables one to calculate the odds of a particular event occurring. However, Cox regression considers the differential impact between groups on the timing of this event (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1077559512443125">Land, McCall, &amp; Parker, 1994</xref>). We develop three models to understand if the effects associated with the reason for placement diminish as we consider youth and placement characteristics. The first model includes only the variables representing the reasons for placement. The reference group is youth placed only for reasons of maltreatment. The second model includes youth demographics and the third model includes placement characteristics. In the current study, youth enter and remain in the observation period (2000–2009) for different length of time. Thus, their exposure to the risk of justice involvement varies. We calculated this risk period as the number of days between the placement start date and the final day of observation (June 30, 2009). The average time at risk of arrest is 8.2 years (2,996 days).</p>

<p>Several significant differences emerged when comparing the six placement groups (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1077559512443125">Table 1</xref>). Females were overrepresented in the placements associated with child behavioral problems, χ<sup>2</sup>(5, <italic>n</italic> = 5,528) = 118.37, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01. There were no differences in placement reason by race. With regard to the experiences and pathways through the child welfare system, placement type and placement instability varied by reason for placement. Youth placed for behavioral problems and youth placed for behavioral problems and with a history of juvenile justice involvement were likely to experience at least one spell in a congregate care facility as compared with youth placed for reasons associated with maltreatment, χ<sup>2</sup>(5, <italic>n </italic>= 5,528) = 1775.07, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01. Moreover, a significantly greater proportion of youth placed for behavioral problems experienced only congregate care as compared with youth placed for reasons associated with maltreatment, χ<sup>2</sup>(5, <italic>n</italic> = 5,528) = 1601.7, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01. Regarding placement stability, less than 20% of youth experienced at least three different placement settings; yet, the risk of placement instability varied by reason for placement. Youth placed for child maltreatment experienced the greatest stability as compared with youth placed for behavioral problems or youth placed for both maltreatment and behavioral problems, χ<sup>2</sup>(10, <italic>n </italic>= 5,528) = 300.03, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01. Interestingly, prior juvenile justice involvement seemed to have no association with placement stability. Slightly more than half of all youth were associated with a subsequent arrest.</p>
<p>As to whether a small subpopulation within child welfare accounts for the majority of arrests, the descriptive statistics in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1077559512443125">Table 1</xref> provide some insight. Youth with child behavioral problems (BEH and BEHP) account for 23% of the sample, yet account for 31% of all arrests. In contrast, youth referred only for child physical abuse and neglect issues (CAN and CANP) account for 62% of the sample, yet account for only 50% of all arrests. It seems there is support for Widom’s initial hypothesis that youth placed for behavioral problems account for a disproportionate share of arrests. Yet, it is also important to note that behavioral referrals account for more than a “small” subpopulation within child welfare.</p>
<p>To provide a visual representation of the timing of arrest across all six referral groups, we developed a life table (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1077559512443125">Figure 1</xref>). Three findings are worth noting. Youth coming to child welfare with a history of delinquency appear to be at the greatest risk of offending. Within 24 months from the start of placement, the majority of youth coming to child welfare with an official history of delinquency experienced a subsequent arrest. For many, only a few months elapsed between the placement start date and the arrest. Second, youth entering placement for behavioral problems appear to be at an increased risk of arrest as compared with youth placed for abuse/neglect. These differences appear regardless of prior involvement with the juvenile justice system. Finally, youth placed for abuse/neglect (CAN) had the lowest proportion of subsequent arrests at 24 months.</p>

<p>The results from the Cox regressions are displayed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1077559512443125">Table 2</xref> (no prior arrests) and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1077559512443125">Table 3</xref> (prior arrests). A hazard ratio greater than 1 indicates a higher likelihood of arrest. If 1 is subtracted from the hazard ratio and the difference is multiplied by 100, the product is equal to the percentage change in the hazard of arrest. The results of the two regression models are fairly similar with regard to placement reason. The youth placed solely for reasons of maltreatment serve as the reference group. Youth referred to placement for child behavioral problems are significantly more likely to experience a subsequent arrest as compared with youth placed solely for reasons of child abuse and neglect. Youth placed for a mix of maltreatment and child behavioral problems experienced similar rates of arrest as compared with youth placed only for reasons of maltreatment. The size of the coefficients associated with the behavioral placement group decreases between the three models, indicating that some of the initial effects seen in Model 1 are accounted for by youth characteristics, placement type, and placement instability.</p>

<p>Regarding additional main effects, the findings indicate that males were significantly more likely to experience an arrest. This is true across both models and these findings are consistent with previous studies of delinquency in child welfare (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1077559512443125">Ryan &amp; Testa, 2005</xref>). Interestingly, African American youth were at an increased risk of arrest, but only if they had yet to come in contact with the justice system. For those with a prior juvenile arrest, no association emerged between race and subsequent arrest. Placement type and placement instability were also associated with subsequent arrest. Specifically, youth placed in congregate care facilities (reference group) are significantly more likely to experience a subsequent arrest as compared with youth in relative or nonrelative foster care settings.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1077559512443125">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>A substantial proportion of youth entered substitute care supervised by child welfare for reasons other than maltreatment. Identifying the various reasons for placement was critical in our efforts to understand the movement of youth from child welfare to juvenile justice. We report that youth with behavioral problems were more likely to become involved with the justice system as compared with youth referred for reasons of maltreatment. For many of the youth placed for behavioral problems, congregate care was the only placement utilized (as opposed to a foster family setting). These findings raise important questions about how child welfare systems respond to the complex needs of youth placed for reasons other than maltreatment and whether or not this type of service response is effective. Do child welfare systems have the adequate resources and perhaps more importantly do child protection caseworkers have the necessary skills and expertise required to resolve adolescent behavioral issues? These are questions of targeting, capacity, and service orientation.</p>
<p>Regarding targeting, clearly defined populations and well-specified treatment activities are essential components of any well-functioning service delivery system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1077559512443125">Rossi, Lipsey, &amp; Freeman, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1077559512443125">Schuerman, Rossi, &amp; Budde, 1999</xref>). Unfortunately, child welfare struggles with controlling referrals; a problem known as “overinclusion.” Child welfare systems strive to ensure child safety and facilitate permanency via protection-related activities. If one were to develop a logic model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1077559512443125">Wholey, 1979</xref>) and specify the services and clinical expertise available in child welfare systems, one might reasonably conclude that adolescents with behavioral issues (generally defined and as indicated by prior arrests) represent poor targets. Regardless of behavioral problems, child welfare systems often fail to meet the unique needs of vulnerable adolescents transitioning to adulthood. Similar in age to the youth with behavioral problems in the current study, older youth in foster care encounter major challenges in school, employment, health, family formation, and residential stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1077559512443125">Courtney &amp; Heuring, 2005</xref>). Perhaps, it should not be surprising that adolescents with behavioral issues (a population that looks more like juvenile justice clients) would be more costly (congregate care placements) and less likely to achieve desirable outcomes.</p>
<p>Regarding capacity and orientation, unfortunately child welfare remains the only resource for many vulnerable families struggling with behavioral issues. So, rather than debating whether youth with behavioral problems are best served in systems other than child welfare, we ought to engage in the more constructive task of improving services and outcomes for this particularly high-risk population. From a practice perspective, and as it relates to our focus on subsequent arrests, child welfare systems must limit the use—and in particular long-term use—of congregate care. Although such placements offer increased supervision, a service orientation dominated by congregate care is expensive and less effective. In a recent study of congregate care and family foster care in Los Angeles County, Ryan reports that youth placed in group homes supervised by child welfare were approximately 2.5 times more likely to experience a subsequent arrest as compared with similar youth served in family foster settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1077559512443125">Ryan, Marshall, Herz, &amp; Hernandez, 2008</xref>). It is important to note that females comprised more than 70% of the population of referrals for child behavioral problems. Is the child welfare system used as a first responder for female delinquency? How does placement in group homes and residential settings help address the unique needs of females? If child welfare is to represent a legitimate alternative to the detention of problematic youth, services must be reoriented from a congregate care approach to one focused on families and communities. Moreover, identifying these unique subpopulations early in the substitute care experience might help in the targeting of delinquency prevention efforts. In part, the work around targeting must consider the role of gender.</p>
<p>The findings of the current study highlight the importance of identifying the unique subpopulations that comprise child welfare. Fifty-five percent of the sample experienced an arrest subsequent to placement. Yet, when we investigate the relative risk of arrest by referral groups, we find this risk varies between 38% (for maltreatment cases) and 88% (for maltreatment cases with behavioral problems). Previous studies of child welfare and juvenile justice have often failed to consider the various reasons youth enter foster care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1077559512443125">Doyle, 2007</xref>)—thus distorting the true risk of justice involvement for victims of maltreatment. As noted in the introduction, Widom noted this concern and raised the possibility that various subgroups within child welfare might be responsible for the relatively high rates of delinquency reported in child welfare systems. The findings in the current study offer some evidence to support this concern—as only a relatively small proportion of the youth referred only for reasons of maltreatment (the population one generally thinks about in the context of child protection) experienced a subsequent arrest. This is significantly lower than reported previous studies in child welfare and reflects the importance and need to account for placement reasons. The multivariate models confirm a significantly lower risk of subsequent justice contact for maltreated youth, even after controlling for prior arrests.</p>
<p>The current study represents the first statewide analysis of child behavioral problems and the risk of arrest in child welfare. Yet, this study is not without limitation. Our method for identifying youth placed for “child behavioral problems” does not permit a thorough examination of specific types of behavioral problems or a detailed assessment of the services that were provided to individual youth. It is likely that child welfare responds to some behavioral issues better than others. It is also possible that child welfare is more receptive to accepting youth with certain types of behavioral problems, thus introducing some element of selection bias. Similarly, we have no information on the dose or frequency of behavioral problems. It is possible that behavioral problems are not predictive of subsequent justice contact until they reach a particular threshold. Future studies would benefit from additional information on the decision to place youth with behavioral problems and from a detailed description of services. A second limitation is out inability to determine whether youth entering placement with a history of delinquency are simultaneously served by juvenile justice or other behavioral health systems. It is likely that some youth have open cases in other allied systems of care and that such involvement and increased surveillance may help explain subsequent arrests. A third limitation is that our sample was limited to a single state. Child welfare systems probably vary with regard to placement rates for behavioral problems. Understanding how different states respond to this population, and if the outcomes associated with this population vary between states, would be extremely helpful for allied social and behavioral health systems.</p>
<p>In closing, the findings indicate a relatively high rate of justice involvement following placement in the child welfare system. Yet, unlike previous studies, the findings clearly indicate that the risk of justice involvement varies by the reason for placement and the youths’ history of juvenile delinquency. This is important as it helps the field more accurately estimate and disentangle the risk of arrest for the various subpopulations served by child welfare systems. Studies that estimate delinquency rates for all youth leaving the child welfare system should use caution when associating the terms maltreatment and delinquency, as many youth enter child welfare settings for behavioral problems (especially girls) and come to substitute care placement with no official records of maltreatment.</p>
