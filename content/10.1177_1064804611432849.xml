<p><bold>Council Proposal: No Texting or Handheld Cell Calls for Bicyclists.</bold> By Fran Speilman, <italic>Chicago Sun-Times</italic>, September 21, 2011. Chicago, which currently has laws against cell phone use (without a hands-free device), texting, and computer use in moving vehicles, is considering banning use of these devices by cyclists.</p>
<p><bold>NTSB Chairwoman Cites “Deadliness of Distraction” in Duck Boat Crash.</bold> By Sarah Hoye, CNN, June 21, 2011, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://articles.cnn.com/2011-06-21/us/pennsylvania.duck.boat_1_duck-boat-dora-schwendtner-szabolcs-prem?_s=PM:US" xlink:type="simple">http://articles.cnn.com/2011-06-21/us/pennsylvania.duck.boat_1_duck-boat-dora-schwendtner-szabolcs-prem?_s=PM:US</ext-link>. The National Transportation Safety Board reported on a July 2010 collision of a barge and an immobilized Philadelphia-based tour boat, which resulted in 2 fatalities and 26 injuries. Human factors/ergonomics considerations included a distracted pilot aboard the tugboat. “The tug pilot was on an outbound personal cell phone call that lasted five to six minutes at the time the duck boat operator was calling for help.” Ironically, a deckhand on the disabled duck boat also was texting, and he sent several messages after dropping anchor, including one a minute before the barge hit.</p>
<p><bold>UPDATED: NTSB Probe: Pilot Fatigue Problem in Ship Crash.</bold> By Ramit Plushnick-Masti, <italic>Associated Press</italic>, September 27, 2011, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.businessweek.com/ap/financialnews/D9Q0U6G83.htm" xlink:type="simple">http://www.businessweek.com/ap/financialnews/D9Q0U6G83.htm</ext-link>. NTSB investigators reported that pilot fatigue, improper communication, and other human factors contributed to a ship collision last year, the largest Texas oil spill in more than 20 years. “Board members were disturbed Tuesday by the investigators’ finding that the second pilot was reading a newspaper just before the collision. During the hearing in Washington, some members wondered if he could have helped prevent the accident had he not been distracted.” The collision resulted in the release of 462,000 gallons of oil into the Sabine-Neches Ship Channel, which had to be closed for 5 days, at a cost of $50 million to $250 million per day.</p>
<p><bold>Tech Distractions for Workers Add Up.</bold> By Tim Mullaney, <italic>USA TODAY</italic>, May 18, 2011. Distractions caused by social media, e-mail, and badly designed office technology may cost a 1,000-worker company more than $10 million a year.

The announcer describes incidents in which individuals using either cell phones or MP3 players were killed while jogging, by a truck backing up while sounding its alarm, and by trains. Legislative action intended to reduce the use of such devices has been proposed in Oregon and New York.</p>
<p><bold>Focal Point: “Fatal Distraction.”</bold> By Clay Johnson, WRAL News, August 26, 2011, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.wral.com/news/local/documentaries/story/8175715/" xlink:type="simple">http://www.wral.com/news/local/documentaries/story/8175715/</ext-link>. A mother holding a cell phone and her 5-year-old son were struck and killed by an Amtrak train after they “inadvertently went under the crossing gate as it was coming down.”</p>
