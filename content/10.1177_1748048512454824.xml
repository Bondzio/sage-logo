<abstract>
<p>This article investigates the production and consumption of Canadian Prime Minister Harper’s 2008 apology to the victims of residential schools. The apology used contextual elements and linguistic devices to construct a particular reality of both the government’s role in residential schools and the nature of Canadian diversity. By comparing themes from Harper’s speech to responses on the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation’s website, the article seeks to understand whether Canadians reaffirm or contest the prime minister’s message. The analysis reveals that although the majority felt the apology was appropriate and important, many contested the discourse that suggested that the attitudes that led to the schools have ‘no place’ in modern-day Canada. Instead the intercultural audience offered competing discourses of genocide and colonialism suggesting that Canada’s identity as it relates to its Aboriginal peoples is still a site of struggle.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>On 11 June 2008, Canadian Prime Minister (PM) Stephen Harper apologized to the victims of residential schools. These ‘government-funded, church-run’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1748048512454824">Chow-White and McMahon, 2012</xref>: 345) schools ran from 1867 to 1983 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1748048512454824">Claes and Clifton, 1998</xref>) and led to the removal of approximately 100,000 Aboriginal children from their families and communities to ensure they were educated in ‘civilized ways’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1748048512454824">James, 2008</xref>: 141). This article seeks to investigate how the long awaited apology was received by Aboriginal<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1748048512454824">1</xref>
</sup> and non-Aboriginal Canadians and whether the public reaction to this apology reaffirms or contests the PM’s dominant discourse on residential schools and the nature of Canada’s cultural diversity and identity.</p>
<p>For the purposes of this article I conceptualize culture not as uniform within national boundaries, but extend its definition to recognize the rich cultural diversity that exists within countries (as called for by scholars such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1748048512454824">Moon, 1996</xref>). By extension intercultural communication is broadened to include both the responses that Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Canadians had to the PM’s apology, but also the complex conversations and debates that unfolded between CBCNews.ca readers following the apology. This complex intercultural communication process happened in response to what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1748048512454824">Chow-White and McMahon (2012</xref>: 346) call a ‘<italic>cold conflict</italic>.’ Unlike conflicts that see people in clearly violent relationships, ‘cold’ conflicts are those perhaps more subtle forms of conflict such as those ‘between racialized groups in postcolonial societies’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1748048512454824">Chow-White and McMahon, 2012</xref>: 346) and many governments around the world have attempted to rectify these ‘cold’ conflicts through reconciliation efforts such as apologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1748048512454824">Chow-White and McMahon, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>It is not surprising, therefore, that there is a growing body of research into political apologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1748048512454824">Edwards, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1748048512454824">Gibney et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1748048512454824">Harris et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1748048512454824">Hastie, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1748048512454824">Hatch, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1748048512454824">Nobles, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1748048512454824">Weyeneth, 2001</xref>). However, little research has explored the discourses surrounding residential schools in Canada (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1748048512454824">Chow-White and McMahon, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1748048512454824">Edwards, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1748048512454824">Harding, 2006</xref> for exceptions) and no intercultural communication researcher has approached the subject from a critical cultural perspective. This article, therefore, has opportunity to illuminate an understudied area of intercultural communication by exploring what linguistic strategies political leaders might use to help frame dominant discourse in apologies and how the public can contest those discourses. In addition, the article responds to a recent call to critically examine this ‘latest chapter in a centuries-long struggle for aboriginal rights and self-determination vis-à-vis the state’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1748048512454824">Chow-White and McMahon, 2012</xref>: 347).</p>
<p>I start by laying out the context for the conflict, building the foundation for the apology that was to come. Then I move on to a description of the theoretical methodology, methods, and the texts chosen for analysis, and then outline the analysis of the apology and the public’s response to this attempt to ameliorate the relationship with Aboriginal peoples. Finally, I end with a discussion of the research’s implications.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1748048512454824">
<title>Historical and sociocultural context</title>
<p>Fairclough believes that it is only in mapping the ‘social matrix of discourse’ (Fairclough, 1992: 237, cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1748048512454824">Jørgensen and Phillips, 2002</xref>: 86) that one can truly understand the nature of the discourse. Therefore, by briefly describing the history of residential schools, the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples, the 1998 apology, and the recent settlement agreement for the residential school survivors<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1748048512454824">2</xref> </sup>I hope to give the reader context for the conflict that led to this apology and the ‘institutional and discoursal practices’ in which it is embedded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1748048512454824">Fairclough, 1995</xref>: 9).</p>
<p>The history of residential schools in Canada is a long, sad, and horrifying one. The original boarding schools were opened in the early 1600s, but it was not until the Indian Act of 1877 made Aboriginal peoples wards of the government that their education became a federal responsibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1748048512454824">Claes and Clifton, 1998</xref>). These schools were grounded in a belief in Aboriginal inferiority and reports that advocated for the system stated that Aboriginal education must include ‘a weaning from the habits and feelings of their ancestors’ and that this must be done when they were young (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1748048512454824">Claes and Clifton, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>Heeding this advice, the government sent close to one-third of all Aboriginal children to these schools over a century-long period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1748048512454824">James, 2008</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1748048512454824">Claes and Clifton (1998</xref>) point out ‘brutal and arbitrary punishment was a daily feature of school life; public beatings and humiliations, head-shaving, and being kept in locked closets on bread and water for days are described.’ In addition to these abuses about one-fifth of residential school students suffered sexual abuse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1748048512454824">Naumetz, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Although there was a history of complaints and allegations about the schools, the voices of residential school victims were not heard on a national level until the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples (RCAP) in the early 1990s. On 7 January 1998, the government formally responded to the RCAP’s final report with an announcement of an Aboriginal action plan and a reading of a Statement of Reconciliation by Minister Jane Stewart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1748048512454824">Nobles, 2008</xref>). Many Aboriginal Canadians, however, felt this response was inadequate: the healing fund did not include all survivors, the statement’s language was fairly general, but perhaps most importantly, the symbolism of the event indicated the government was not taking the issue as seriously enough. The apology was read by a new, junior minister at a lunchtime ceremony in a government meeting room and the PM of the time, Jean Chrétien, although in the capital, did not attend (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1748048512454824">James, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Almost a decade later, the Government of Canada, now led by PM Harper, announced the approval of the Indian Residential Schools Settlement Agreement and a total of CDN$1.9 billion in payments to former students. In addition, the Agreement promised CDN$60 million dollars for a five-year Truth and Reconciliation Commission and CDN$145 million for commemoration and healing events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1748048512454824">Residential Schools Settlement, 2008</xref>). It is within this very specific ‘cold’ conflict climate that the PM offered his apology.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1748048512454824">
<title>Theoretical framework</title>
<p>This article is grounded in both the theory and methodology of Fairclough’s approach to critical discourse analysis (CDA) and Stuart Hall’s theory of encoding/decoding. Both theories focus on the production and consumption of discourse to argue that though the consumption of discourse is not a passive act, the receiver’s agency to read texts is constrained by the fact that some discourses may be more readily accepted as they benefit from a place of privilege within society (such as is the case with the public address of heads of state). They receive substantial help in producing their discourse, both in its construction and dissemination.</p>
<p>In his essay ‘Encoding/decoding’ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1748048512454824">Hall (1980</xref>: 174) suggested that there are three hypothetical positions from which a discourse can be decoded: <italic>dominant-hegemonic</italic>, <italic>negotiated</italic>, and <italic>oppositional</italic>. From a <italic>dominant-hegemonic </italic>position the recipient decodes the message ‘in terms of the reference code in which it has been encoded.’ That is, they interpret the message as it was encoded by the producer of the dominant discourse. The <italic>negotiated</italic> position, however, does not fully support the message’s meaning and therefore it may hedge its support with exceptions and qualifiers. Finally, the <italic>oppositional</italic> position is held by those who understand both the connotation and denotation of the message, but flatly deny the framing of the message. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1748048512454824">Hall (1980</xref>: 175) explains, ‘he/she detotalizes the message in the preferred code in order to retotalize the message within some alternative framework of reference.’ In the case of the text of the PM’s apology, for example, if a person outright rejects the PM’s suggestion that Canada is a country without racism the reading is an oppositional one and one that suggests a struggle for meaning. In this article I will be using these three reading labels as a means of discussing the public’s response to the PM’s apology.</p>
<p>Fairclough’s (1995) CDA, like Hall’s encoding/decoding theory, also relates to the production and consumption of texts, but adds to this analysis a more elaborate structure and specific methods. Within CDA discursive practice is only one part of the social world; the textual-linguistic part. CDA also puts great import on the non-discursive practice of which discourse is a part such as the assembling of children to fill residential schools. Perhaps most importantly, however, Fairclough’s CDA claims that ‘discursive practices contribute to the creation and reproduction of unequal power relations between social groups’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1748048512454824">Jørgensen and Phillips, 2002</xref>: 63). This approach to CDA, then, is interested in both the discursive practices that construct or challenge a dominant discourse and also how these practices might further the interests of those in places of privilege.</p>
<p>Fairclough’s ‘three-dimensional model’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1748048512454824">Jørgensen and Phillips, 2002</xref>: 81) – and his CDA method – is based on the above assumptions and outlines each communicative event into three important and inseparable dimensions: text, discursive practice (the production and consumption of texts), and sociocultural practice (the larger context in which both the text and discursive practice are embedded) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1748048512454824">Fairclough, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1748048512454824">Jørgensen and Phillips, 2002</xref>).</p>

<title>Texts chosen</title>
<p>The purpose of this article is to investigate the production and consumption of PM Harper’s apology. The research questions which guide this article are: How did the PM construct a particular reality of the government’s role in residential schools in his address to parliament? How do Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal responses reaffirm or contest the PM’s dominant discourse of the residential school system and the nature of Canadian cultural diversity and identity? The data used for the purpose of this study are the English-language portions of PM Harper’s speech of 11 June 2008,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1748048512454824">3</xref>
</sup> and the comments of Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) online news readers left on the English-language section of the CBCNews.ca website on that day and the two days following the apology.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1748048512454824">4</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>I began my analysis of PM Harper’s speech with a thematic analysis in order to highlight the framing ideas that are privileged in the text. In this thematic analysis I drew on the ideas and processes advocated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1748048512454824">Owen (1984</xref>: 274) and used a systematic process in which I identified when ‘at least two parts of a report had the same thread of meaning’ and when wording was repeated. Then I conducted a textual analysis, carefully attending to the contextual elements of the speech’s production and the linguistic devices the PM used.</p>
<p>Once the speech was analyzed I turned to collecting and coding the sample from the Canadian public. A preliminary search of the CBCNews.ca website found 87 comments posted immediately beneath the PM’s apology from the three aforementioned days. In order to better represent the intercultural nature of this online discussion, the comments of those that self-identified as Canadian were divided into those that described themselves as Aboriginal Canadians and those that did not. Self-identification was sometimes in the form of direct self-labeling (‘As a First Nations woman’) or in the form of acknowledging a direct relationship to the issue or country in either the commentary or the member’s chosen username (‘It’s about time that our country did this’ or Canucklady73). I eliminated the postings of those who did not self-identify as Canadian, so that in the final analysis 75 postings were analyzed. These postings were written by 51 individuals: 35 non-Aboriginal and 16 Aboriginal. With this sample I was able to code the postings using Hall’s three decoding positions (dominant, negotiated, and oppositional) to understand the public’s reaction to the seven themes that emerged from the PM’s dominant discourse.</p>
<p>This study analyzes both the apology and the public response because together they paint a clearer picture of the discursive event, its consumption by Canadians, and, by extension, the implications for future attempts to remediate intercultural relationships within a ‘cold’ conflict environment. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1748048512454824">Fairclough (1995</xref>: 9) points out, ‘text analysis in isolation from audience reception has been widely criticized’ partially because analysts have tried to ‘postulate ideological effects solely on the basis of analysis of texts without considering the diverse ways in which such texts may be interpreted and responded to.’ Keeping this in mind then, this article first discusses an analysis of the speech itself and then moves on to analyze the diverse cultural interpretations Canadians had of the discursive event.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1748048512454824">
<title>Production elements</title>
<p>As the head of state of Canada, PM Stephen Harper’s apology represents the dominant discourse on the history of residential schools and, one might argue, the nature of Canadian cultural diversity. In this section, I discuss how this dominant discourse was produced, what themes emerged from the PM’s speech, and how a textual analysis of the speech offers insight into the PM’s construction of a particular version of reality.</p>
<p>There are three important contextual elements to the production of the PM’s speech that helped ensure the audience’s affirmation of a dominant discourse. First, and perhaps most importantly, Aboriginal groups like the Assembly of First Nations (AFN) had a unique opportunity to bend the ear of the PM. During a period when the PM was considering the timing of an apology, he read a letter from the AFN’s then National Chief Phil Fontaine, a survivor himself, which ‘touched a chord with the Prime Minister and was pivotal in focusing Mr. Harper’s thinking’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1748048512454824">Curry and Laghi, 2008</xref>: A4). That influence continued with letters that specified what they thought an appropriate apology might look like and a meeting with residential school victims just a week before the official apology. This direct input from those most affected by the apology helped ensure that the PM’s discourse spoke to his audience and would be accepted.</p>
<p>A second important element of this discursive practice is that it is a part of an ‘<italic>intertextual chain</italic>’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1748048512454824">Jørgensen and Phillips, 2002</xref>: 74). That is, the 2008 Conservative Party-led apology drew heavily on the discourse of the Liberal Party-led 1998 apology. For example, Minister Stewart had said ‘it is a remarkable tribute to the strength and endurance of Aboriginal people that they have maintained their historic diversity and identity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1748048512454824">Stewart, 1998</xref>). PM Harper said: ‘It is a testament to their resilience as individuals and the strength of their cultures.’ The intertextual elements continue as the PM acknowledges that Aboriginal people had ‘rich and vibrant cultures and traditions’ before the arrival of Europeans; Stewart had described them as ‘diverse, vibrant nations’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1748048512454824">Stewart, 1998</xref>). Fairclough suggests that when a researcher analyzes how ‘structure and content are transformed’ in an intertextual chain one can explore what this might say about changes to the ‘production conditions’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1748048512454824">Jørgensen and Phillips, 2002</xref>: 82). In this case the similar structure and content suggest that production conditions remained static. What was different in the 2008 address, however, was that the Harper government had the added authenticity of the substantial settlement agreement already underway.</p>
<p>The final production elements that influenced the PM’s discourse were two last-minute discursive events that increased the legitimacy of his message. The first involved the opportunity for Aboriginal leaders to respond within parliament. As late as the day before the message, the government said it would give Aboriginal leaders an opportunity to respond, but it could not be in the House of Commons in front of elected representatives; instead they would be invited to respond through a press conference. Just an hour before the apology, however, a press secretary found a creative use of a parliamentary rule that would allow Aboriginal leaders to give their response in the House (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1748048512454824">CBC Archives, 2008</xref>). As a result, immediately before his speech the PM brought forward this motion, it passed unanimously, and the public was stunned and impressed by what appeared to be a last minute change of heart by the PM. Having the leaders respond to the apology in front of all elected officials, a full visitors’ gallery, and the press added an air of authenticity to the PM’s message that Canada must forge a ‘new relationship between Aboriginal peoples and other Canadians’ and that that intercultural relationship must be based in respect.</p>
<p>The second discursive event that added legitimacy to the PM’s discourse was that he acknowledged the ‘persuasive advice’ of then New Democratic Party (NDP) leader Jack Layton. There are no two national parties in Canada more different than the Conservatives and the ultra-liberal NDP; many were shocked when the PM admitted that Layton had been persuading him of the importance of this apology for a year and a half (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1748048512454824">Curry and Laghi, 2008</xref>). The fact that the PM reached across party lines to give credit to a historic opponent lent credence to the words that followed.</p>
<p>Input from survivors, the intertexual chain of discourse, the timing of the apology with the settlement agreement, and the two last-minute discursive events, therefore, were important elements in the production of the PM’s speech. Each of these contextual elements helped ensure that Canadians might affirm the PM’s dominant discourse on, among other things, the government’s efforts to change the history of conflict with Aboriginal peoples. Before discussing the public’s consumption of this message, however, it is important to both introduce the themes that emerged from the PM’s speech and use CDA to explore the linguistic characteristics that support a particular interpretation of that speech.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1748048512454824">
<title>Thematic and textual analysis</title>
<p>Seven major themes emerge out of PM Harper’s apology to the victims of residential schools. These are: isolation and abuse, a damaging legacy, new recognition, the government and country’s burden, a new relationship, the nature of Canadian diversity, and Aboriginal cultural/national strength.</p>
<p>More than half of the PM’s speech was spent on the first theme, which described how children were ‘forcibly removed from their homes, often taken far from their communities’ in order to ‘remove and isolate children from the influence of their homes, families, traditions and cultures, and to assimilate them into the dominant culture.’ The second theme admits that ‘this policy has had a lasting and damaging impact on Aboriginal culture, heritage and language’ and in the third theme the PM suggests that the Government of Canada recently learned about this ‘sad legacy’: the PM frequently repeats the phrase that ‘the government now recognizes’ the ills of the system.</p>
<p>In the fourth theme the PM describes how the residential school burden should be lifted from the shoulders of the victims to those of the government and country. In suggesting this process he also paints a description of a new relationship (the fifth theme): ‘A relationship based on the knowledge of our shared history, a respect for each other and a desire to move forward together.’</p>
<p>The PM admits that in the past Aboriginal cultures and practices were considered inferior, but that ‘there is no place in Canada for the attitudes that inspired the Indian residential school system to ever again prevail.’ In creating this image of Canadian diversity (the sixth theme) the PM is calling on an important symbol: Canadians are proud of the idea that they are a mosaic, not a melting pot like their southern neighbors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1748048512454824">West, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>The seventh and final theme in the PM’s speech surrounds the idea of strength. He recognizes the strength of the survivors and later adds that ‘strong families, strong communities and vibrant cultures and traditions will contribute to a stronger Canada for all of us.’ However subtle, this suggestion that Canadians are stronger together is a powerful symbol in the dominant discourse of a country that has been threatened with the secession of one of its provinces regularly in recent history (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1748048512454824">West, 2002</xref>).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1748048512454824">5</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Thematic analysis, then, makes clear which themes the PM wanted Canadians to hear through his speech. A textual analysis, however, moves beyond explicit meaning and offers ‘insight into the ways in which texts… construct particular versions of reality, social identities and social relations’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1748048512454824">Jørgensen and Phillips, 2002</xref>: 83). That is, by attending to things such as how the discourse suggests connections between the speaker and the subject and levels of agency we can learn how the apology constructs a very specific understanding of both this ‘cold’ conflict and the nature of the intercultural relationship between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Canadians, its past and its future.</p>
<p>A textual analysis of the PM’s discourse reveals linguistic features that try to distance the government from its responsibility in the residential school system, particularly near the beginning of the speech. For example, on two occasions he moderated the government’s actions by explaining that they became involved in the residential school system ‘partly in order to meet its obligation to educate Aboriginal children,’ and he reminded the country that ‘Most schools were operated as “joint ventures” with Anglican, Catholic, Presbyterian or United churches.’ In another phrase he says that ‘institutions’ gave rise to neglect. By expressing ‘low affinity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1748048512454824">Jørgensen and Phillips, 2002</xref>: 84) to the acts and perpetrators the PM <italic>hedges</italic>; he does not absolve the government of its part, but he does qualify it and remind his audience that it is a shared guilt.</p>
<p>
<italic>Nominalization </italic>is also prevalent in the PM’s speech. In using nominalization a speaker uses nouns to substitute for an action therefore emphasizing consequences and minimizing agency (or in this case blame) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1748048512454824">Jørgensen and Phillips, 2002</xref>). Nominalization was prolific in the first half of PM Harper’s speech. He referred to the ‘treatment of children’ as a sad chapter in Canadian history and talked about ‘emotional, physical and sexual abuse and neglect,’ but in choosing to describe ‘abuse’ and ‘treatment’ as nouns and not verbs he is in a sense removing the act of the abuse and is avoiding naming the abuser: the abuse is presented as a condition independent of action and agent.</p>
<p>
<italic>Transitivity</italic> is another element that can help present a certain kind of reality. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1748048512454824">Jørgensen and Phillips (2002</xref>: 83) note, in looking for transitivity researchers analyze ‘how events and processes are connected (or not-connected) with subject and objects’ and what the ‘ideological consequences’ of these relationships could be. PM Harper does admit that the residential school system was ‘based on the assumption Aboriginal cultures and spiritual beliefs were inferior and unequal,’ but he blames ‘objectives’ and ‘attitudes,’ and explains that ‘institutions gave rise to abuse.’ This language distances the government from words that have a connotation of greater violence and deliberateness (colonialism, racism) and projects a faceless and ethereal villain.</p>
<p>Another discursive choice that is worthy of analysis is the PM’s decision to use the words ‘children’ and ‘powerless families and communities.’ On the one hand, describing the victims as children is accurate and highlights the vulnerability of those affected; it is also, however, an odd reminder that Aboriginal Canadians, regardless of age, were once all considered wards of the state.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1748048512454824">6</xref>
</sup> This slight air of paternalism emerges again when the PM says ‘we apologize for failing to protect you.’ The phrase simultaneously reaffirms the responsibility of government as protector, distances the government from the abuses committed, and suggests that the government did not know the abuse was happening. The reality is that over the course of the decades that residential schools existed several complaints and inquiries were made – including a Royal Commission into the flogging of 19 boys by a priest in 1934 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1748048512454824">Claes and Clifton, 1998</xref>). However, the dominant discourse of the PM refutes this, and he repeats the phrase ‘we <italic>now</italic> recognize.’ (emphasis added) when referring to the severe consequences these schools had.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, toward the end of the speech, the PM, on behalf of the government, takes direct responsibility for the wrongs committed. He admits that they built a system that forcibly removed children and took them far from their homes, that they ‘undermined the ability of many to parent their own children,’ and he repeated the phrase ‘we apologize’ in five languages, three of those Aboriginal languages.</p>
<p>Now that I have described the apology’s themes and linguistic strategies, I explore how this dominant discourse was consumed by CBCNews.ca readers attending to the intercultural nature of the readership.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1748048512454824">
<title>Analysis of reactions</title>
<p>The reaction to the dominant discourse as produced by the PM was mixed and represents a complex intercultural communication process. This section outlines how Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal CBCNews.ca readers consumed or decoded the speech. Using their words to outline the diverse responses, I address how they reacted to the seven themes that emerged from the PM’s speech and each other’s postings; revealing ongoing contestation regarding Canada’s identity as it relates to its Aboriginal peoples.</p>
<sec id="section8-1748048512454824">
<title>Overall response</title>
<p>The great majority of readers agreed that the PM’s apology was appropriate and important. As one Aboriginal woman put it, ‘For many of my relations who suffered criminal atrocities while attending residential school, there is a new chapter to the healing journey.… From the bottom of my heart: thank-you Canada.’ In fact, no Aboriginal Canadians on the site opposed the apology although there were a small number that held a negotiated position feeling primarily that the apology was too late or not strong enough.</p>
<p>A small, vocal minority of non-Aboriginal Canadians opposed the apology altogether. This group reported various reasons for rejecting the dominant discourse. Some said they felt the apology was not really about truth but land and money, and others still said the apology meant nothing in a world where the genocide of Aboriginal peoples continues.</p>
<p>The themes that emerged from the PM’s speech were no less contentious than the appropriateness of the apology itself. I start by addressing how readers responded to the theme that the PM attended to the most: the isolation and abuse of the residential schools.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1748048512454824">
<title>Isolation and abuse</title>
<p>All Aboriginal and the majority of non-Aboriginal readers agreed with the dominant discourse that the residential school system had fostered isolation and abuse. Several Aboriginal readers had family members that had been victims of the schools. There were also a couple of negotiated readings from non-Aboriginal Canadians. Both these readers said that not all the schools had been abusive and that it was unfair to paint all of them with the same brush. As one person put it, ‘It is obvious to me that residential schools were not malicious evil places… I have spoken to natives who attended them, and they described them as fun and happy places… the abuses were relatively rare.’ No commentators fully opposed the PM’s theme that the residential schools had been places of isolation and abuse.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1748048512454824">
<title>Damaging legacy</title>
<p>Not unlike the theme mentioned above, Aboriginal readers unanimously supported the dominant reading of this theme. As one Aboriginal reader put it, ‘After the students were released from the schools many were displaced and grew an anger which was brought home to their communities.’ The majority of non-Aboriginal Canadians also supported this theme, but one person had a negotiated reading and, another, an oppositional reading. The person with the oppositional reading outright rejected the suggestion that residential schools had damaging effects and argued that Aboriginal peoples have benefited from the literacy and Christianity that ‘Western civilization’ brought. The great majority of commentators, however, echoed their disdain for the damaging legacy of the residential school system.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1748048512454824">
<title>New recognition</title>
<p>Of the seven themes in the PM’s speech ‘new recognition’ was undoubtedly the most subtle. Not surprisingly then, of all the comments left on the CBCNews.ca site on the day of the apology and the two days following only one person commented on the PM’s suggestion that the government only ‘now realizes’ how wrong the residential school system was. This person stood in direct opposition to this assertion:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>… Harper repeatedly asserted that we ‘now’ know the policies were wrong. There is substantial archival evidence to demonstrate that many people pointed to the problems with such a system even while it operated… Harper ought to have acknowledged that the system was intentionally pernicious and that government officials knew it to be so at the time of its operation, and not just ‘now.’</p>
</disp-quote>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1748048512454824">
<title>The Canadian burden</title>
<p>The majority of the postings on the CBCNews.ca site did not specifically address the theme of who should carry the burden of the residential schools. In fact, of the approximately 75 postings analyzed only seven specifically addressed the theme. Of those, three had a dominant reading (one Aboriginal Canadian and two non), one negotiated reading from a non-Aboriginal reader, and three were oppositional readings from non-Aboriginal Canadians. Several other postings, however, expressed extreme regret and supported the government’s suggestion that the country should apologize. One of these readers wrote: ‘I am a white Canadian who didnt realize what a heavy load of guilt i carried on my shoulders. Mr. Harper, thank you… To our Native brothers, I also apologize on behalf of Canada.’</p>
<p>However, there were a few very vocal readers in opposition to this dominant discourse. A couple of postings pointed out that other people were wronged in Canadian history: one person referred to the internment of Japanese-Canadians during the Second World War and argued that ‘their subsequent generations did not turn into drunks, drug addicts or child abusers.… They did not demand handouts or housing from the government.’<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1748048512454824">7</xref>
</sup> This was the most overtly racist of all the postings, but a couple of others vehemently opposed the government’s suggestion that they as Canadians should take on any of the burden for residential schools. ‘I do not bear any responsibility for any residential schools scandal,’ one posting said, ‘Stephen Harper did not apologize on my behalf.’</p>
<p>These oppositional readings generated conversation themselves. One Aboriginal woman wrote:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>To all the people who continue to speak that they had nothing to do with residential schools and therefore have no need to apologize: This is not about you personally. But about a Government, that from its first conception has conducted a campaign of Genocide.You are benefitting and living off of the avails of colonialism and genocide.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In the above reading we hear both an affirmation of the dominant discourse that Canada and Canadians carry the burden of the residential school system, but also a contestation of dominant views on what caused the system. Competing discourses of genocide and colonialism emerge to push against denials of privilege.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1748048512454824">
<title>A new relationship</title>
<p>In responding to the PM’s call for a new start in the relationship between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Canadians CBCNews.ca readers were split. Most non-Aboriginal readers were confident that this apology signaled a turning point. ‘We have told the truth, and now it’s time for reconciliation.’ There was one non-Aboriginal commentator, however, who argued that this new relationship was false and that power relations were still a huge issue between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Canadians.</p>
<p>Aboriginal Canadians were even more hesitant on the theme of a new relationship, however, and were evenly split between dominant and negotiated positions. As one commentator explained, ‘I do view the apology as a positive step towards reconciliation. It provides me with hope.’ However, another questioned the authenticity of the apology: ‘Part of the problem of the 400 year relationship between our people and you colonizers is that you often leave out a sentence here and there; next thing you know the whole story changes. Be wary people.’ This reading is striking – presumably a reference to a time when the language used in treaties marginalized Aboriginal Canadians’ land ownership.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1748048512454824">
<title>Nature of Canadian diversity</title>
<p>The nature of Canadian diversity was the most contested theme in the PM’s speech. Few commentators specifically mentioned the issue, but of those that did none held a dominant reading on diversity, the great majority negotiated its meaning, and a couple were in opposition. These positions were shared evenly between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal commentators.</p>
<p>The negotiated and oppositional postings of those who did not agree with the PM’s ahistorical reading called on multiple other discourses (genocide, human rights, colonialism) to refute it. This interdiscursivity regarding the nature of Canada’s past was quite powerful: ‘Prime Minister Harper went to great lengths to describe the goal of absolute assimilation that was at the root of the system but fell short of acknowledging it for what it actually was, a systematic attempt at cultural genocide for Aboriginal Peoples.’ Several commentators also questioned the nature of Canadian diversity today and pointed out that racism still exists.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-1748048512454824">
<title>Aboriginal cultural/national strength</title>
<p>As mentioned earlier, the image that Canadians are stronger together is a powerful symbol to Canadians as it suggests national unity; a symbol that is an integral part of the dominant discourse of Canadian identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1748048512454824">West, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>This dominant reading was unanimously supported in the comments of the CBCNews.ca readers. One non-Aboriginal Canadian, for example, talked about our ‘shared history’ and said that, ‘To bear witness together is when we are at our best as Canadians.’ Another message, posted by an Aboriginal man within a couple of hours of the PM’s speech, was particularly poignant and registered more support than any other posting:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>i was moved to hear the indian drum in the house. i was moved to tears to see even if just for 1 hour, our whole country was there watching, listening, and in perfect gestalt. such displays of unity is what builds nations. today, i felt like a canadian and not just another indian.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Two hundred and seventy seven people indicated their agreement with this posting more than for any other posting.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1748048512454824">8</xref> </sup>Although it is not possible to analyze which element drew so many readers to support this position, I would argue that the writer’s adoption of a Canadian identity and his use of the symbol of unity are two dominant components in his posting.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-1748048512454824">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Canadian Prime Minister Harper’s <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1748048512454824">2008</xref> apology to the survivors of the residential schools was a significant step in the government’s attempts to rectify the country’s ‘cold’ conflict with Aboriginal Canadians. That apology, however, reveals a couple of dialectical tensions and contradictions. On the one hand the PM admits that the Government of Canada played an integral role in a system that has done much damage to Aboriginal families, communities, and cultures. On the other, his apology primarily reproduces the existing order of discourse and uses linguistic strategies such as nominalization and hedges to minimize responsibility and to distance the government from the deliberate and targeted nature of the racist policies that lead to the creation of the schools.</p>
<p>A second dialectical tension revealed in this study is regarding the nature of the ‘new relationship’ between Aboriginal Canadians and the government. Important elements in the production of the message begin to restructure the order of discourse. The PM’s consultation with residential school survivors and Aboriginal leaders suggests a subtle shift in the balance of power – or at least a willingness to approach this intercultural relationship from a more equitable and respectful stance. That said, the PM also resurrects a disturbing image of government as protector, perhaps inadvertently, reminding us that until quite recently Aboriginal Canadians were considered wards of the state. This archaic image is problematic as it undermines Aboriginal efforts to ‘come to the table’ as equal partners in matters regarding self-government, land claims, and Aboriginal education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1748048512454824">LaFever, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>The response to this apology also reveals areas of contestation. The majority of Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal CBCNews.ca readers framed the apology as appropriate and important, but a deeper exploration into the impacts of the residential schools and who might bear responsibility for them uncovers many competing discourses. Some suggest that Aboriginal Canadians should simply get over the past and they reject the PM’s statement that today’s Canadians should share the weight of past mistakes. Others want to remind the nation that until all Canadians recognize that Aboriginal Canadians have been affected by genocide, assimilation, and colonialism attempts toward real reconciliation will be both stilted and ineffectual.</p>
<p>The author hopes that this study can be of benefit to both practitioners and researchers of intercultural communication and conflict resolution. For the practitioner it offers a suggestion of the contextual elements and linguistic characteristics that could both help and hinder one’s attempts to reach out toward reconciliation across cultures. For the researcher it offers one model for how one can critically examine a discursive event within a specific historical context and, rather than trying to ‘postulate ideological effects’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1748048512454824">Fairclough, 1995</xref>: 9), detail the diverse ways in which an intercultural audience can consume important discursive events such as apologies.</p>
