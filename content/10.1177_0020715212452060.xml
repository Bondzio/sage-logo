<p>Who says dependency theory is dead?</p>
<p>In a trenchant critique of Mexico’s neoliberal experiment, Cypher and Delgado Wise belie conventional dismissals of dependency. Utilizing the finest tools of institutional economics, the authors situate the failure of neoliberalism in Mexico within broader capitalist restructuring over the past few decades. Their slim volume is packed with insights and the kind of rich data one would hope from serious regional specialists. The result is a compelling, historically grounded analysis of a Mexican economy in crisis and with little hope of breaking from its adverse institutional ‘lock-in’ with the United States.</p>
<p><italic>Dependista</italic> themes abound: the conceptualization of US–Mexico relations as asymmetrical and exploitative; the complicity of Mexico’s political elites and conglomerates in advancing the neoliberal turn (albeit with internal splits and under US state-financial pressure); the consequent shrinking of Mexico’s domestic market as it displays more features of an ‘enclave economy’; and exposure of neoclassical nostrums – from comparative advantages to ‘equilibrium’ models – as utterly inadequate to grasp the historical and structural changes of a crisis-prone capitalist system.</p>
<p>And what of the consequences of Mexico’s dependence? The authors lament the wisdom of that ‘very tired cliché’, ‘Whenever Uncle Sam sneezes, Mexico gets pneumonia.’ The severe crisis of 2009 – which would amount to a 6.5 percent reduction in GDP and 82 percent decline in net foreign direct investment from 2008 – represents the worst downturn since the Depression (pp. 1–2). And yet it is only the crowning touch of a neoliberal economic regime characterized by economic stagnation and pauperization for nearly 30 years. The authors note, for example, a dismal 0.7 percent increase in average annual per capita income from 1983–2008 – <italic>none</italic> of which went to the working class (p. 46). Moreover, Mexico’s ongoing willingness to subordinate its economy to the ‘race to the bottom’ profit-maximizing strategies of US capital is a long-term disaster. Chapters on the maquila and ‘disguised maquila’ sectors (the latter referring to high-exporting foreign firms outside the formal maquiladora regime) demonstrate their failure to transfer technological skills or develop forward and backward linkages into the wider economy. And even the flagship auto-parts industry has seen a ‘virtual collapse’ of Mexican-owned companies and relegation to low-value-added niches (pp. 122–123). Such severe problems are central to Mexico’s ‘economic dilemma’. For the country’s downward economic spiral is matched by its growing inability to even imagine alternatives.</p>
<p>If the book echoes contemporary criticisms of neoliberalism (only intensified by the global financial meltdown), the narrative stands out in a couple of ways. First, the authors provide an unusually detailed description of Mexico’s class system and economy, including a cogent reappraisal of the era of import substitution industrialization (ISI). Next, they link the ongoing ‘maquilization’ of the Mexico economy to sharp increases in emigration. They recast Mexico’s outward-oriented economy as a ‘cheap-labor export model’. In this view, an impoverished Mexican workforce provides US corporations with cheap labor in a twofold way: <italic>indirectly</italic>, in low-value-added assembly plants; and <italic>directly</italic>, through a stigmatized migrant labor force that effectively pulls wages down in the United States.</p>
<p>The authors pay considerable attention to the US in their analysis. A core aim of the book is to explain how Mexico could transform from a ‘highly functional, endogenous, <italic>social structure of accumulation’</italic> to a ‘<italic>restructured/rearticulated/subordinated</italic> economy wherein the prime motor force of accumulation is exogenous – driven by the United States’ (p. 28, emphases theirs). This part of the story is familiar. Following the peak oil years and ‘loan pushing’ of the international banks in the late 1970s, Mexico faced a severe crisis. ‘Oil price declines, bouts of inflation, and the pressures of a profound foreign debt crisis’ shifted the balance of power to Mexican business elites and the neoliberal ‘technicians’ (pp. 32–36). Lopez Portillo’s nationalization of the banks in 1982, following ‘massive capital flight’, was particularly divisive. And with a steep decline in GDP and increased borrowing, De la Madrid found himself in a ‘pincer movement’ between the US and the banks, and Mexico’s leading business organizations.</p>
<p>The Mexican <italic>grupos</italic> were not only successful in advocating the Washington Consensus, but they manufactured a new ‘common sense’ that maligned the old ISI model as ‘exhausted’. Yet the problem with ISI was that it was never deeply embedded by an active, developmental state. Referring repeatedly to the Asian ISI success stories as foils, Cypher and Delgado Wise bemoan the shallow approach taken by Mexico, based on subsidies and tariffs that often shielded sluggish companies from competition, while relying passively on foreign firms to introduce technology (p. 33). To be sure, the ISI years were ‘golden years’ of growth compared to neoliberalism. And the authors hold out hope – albeit a slim one – that the country might reclaim and deepen its past developmental sympathies into a serious national industrial regime. Such a regime of ‘deep ISI’ would require an activist state to direct development toward higher value-added production; discipline investment capital by enforcing ‘performance compliance’ around ‘strategic sectors’; harness ‘scientific cadres’ toward creative and independent technological upgrading; and expand the internal market by ‘recapturing the dynamism’ of the ISI period (pp. 33–35; pp. 170–171).</p>
<p>The authors repeat emphatically that they are not calling for a return to the past or a mimicking of polices carried out in Taiwan or South Korea. Mexico will have to forge her own path. Yet it is in the area of realizing solutions that dependency theory has faced the staunchest criticism. Cypher and Delgado Wise are not exempt. They suggest that viable solutions need to go far beyond renegotiating the NAFTA to an about-face from the passivity and relinquishing of autonomy inherent in neoliberal governance. Yet they offer little in terms of the strategic context or viable agents to advance such change.</p>
<p>Acknowledging that adoption of a new developmental course appears ‘quixotic’, they note that nothing short of mass resistance from below in tandem with transnational labor unions might frame and enforce such ‘institutional transformation initiatives’ (p. 168). It is, in any event, ‘even more unrealistic’, in their view, ‘to anticipate, as does the current economic and political power structure, that the status quo of asymmetrical accumulation and accelerated dependency can be prolonged through the strengthening of the neoliberal program’ (p. 172).</p>
