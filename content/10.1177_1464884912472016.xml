<abstract>
<p>The study examines financial factors that magnified the collapse of the US newspaper industry in the mid-2000s when advertising revenues plummeted. The study shows how goodwill, debt and leverage magnified the collapse and hastened the bankruptcy of a number of newspaper companies. The study also tests the applicability of Altman’s Z-score model for predicting bankruptcy of newspaper companies.</p>

<body>
<p>The recent business history of the newspaper industry has been tumultuous at best and downright scary at worst. A large number of newspaper companies have filed for bankruptcy; others hover very close to it. The industry’s future remains much in doubt. This is in sharp contrast to what the newspaper business had experienced until the mid-2000s.</p>
<p>For almost all of their history, newspaper companies were ‘cash cows’, generating large and steady returns to investors. Publicly traded newspaper companies were earning margins of 30 percent and higher. Some newspapers had margins of 50 percent or more. Most impressive of all, the newspaper industry was able to sustain these high rates of return year in and year out (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1464884912472016">Cranberg et al., 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>The strong and steady economic performance of these companies was not lost on investors, especially large institutional investors. These institutional investors ended up controlling very large amounts of stock in publicly traded newspaper companies. In 1999, for example, institutions owned the majority of the publicly traded shares in Gannett (79.5%), Tribune (60%), Lee Enterprises (68.3%), Journal Register (96%), McClatchy (81.1%), Knight Ridder (84.8%), Times Mirror (61.7%), Washington Post (65.7%), New York Times (62.1%) and Media General (64.8%) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1464884912472016">Cranberg et al., 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>The earning demands placed on newspaper companies by institutional investors have been the subject of study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1464884912472016">An et al., 2006</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1464884912472016">Cranberg et al. (2001)</xref> documented the problems newspaper companies encounter as a result of having such large amounts of their stock owned by institutional investors. Put simply, for institutional investors, the bottom line is the bottom line; the quality of journalism is wholly irrelevant. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1464884912472016">Cranberg et al. (2001)</xref> showed, satisfying their institutional investors became the top priority of newspaper companies.</p>
<p>While earnings pressure on newspaper companies from institutions remains today, economic survival has replaced revenue growth as the main objective of most newspaper companies. But because of the newspaper industry’s financial problems, another player has entered into the investor-management equation; a player that historically was content to sit on the sidelines. This third player has become critically important for the survival of newspaper companies and now holds many of the trump cards. This third player is the financial institutions that hold the notes of newspaper companies. These lenders dictate loan terms, default penalties and, in many cases, determine whether or not a company will survive.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1464884912472016">1</xref></sup> Return of capital has replaced return on capital as the major focus of newspaper companies.</p>
<p>Researchers have largely ignored the role lenders have played in how newspaper companies are managed. One reason is that their role historically was minimal because of the strong financial performance of newspaper companies. Historically, stock in newspaper companies traded at high price-per-earnings ratios and newspapers generated very large amounts of liquidity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1464884912472016">Cranberg et al., 2001</xref>: Appendix A). As a result, newspaper companies historically carried the highest Dun &amp; Bradstreet ratings. This is not the case today with most newspaper companies carrying D&amp;B ratings below investment grade. The purpose of this article is to explore how and why the newspaper industry ended up on its head and how and why lenders now control the fate of nearly all newspaper companies.</p>
<p>It is not the intent of this article to minimize the enormous financial problems and challenges the internet posed and continues to pose for the newspaper industry. The internet’s impact on the newspaper industry’s advertising and circulation revenues has been well documented.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1464884912472016">2</xref></sup> But what has not been well documented is why management was unable to respond effectively to the internet’s challenges. The financial damages the internet would wreak on the newspaper industry and its implications for investors had been detailed at least five years before they actually hit the industry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1464884912472016">Cranberg et al., 2001</xref>: Chapter V). Yet, both management and investors were caught off guard when newspaper revenues went into free fall.</p>
<p>This article focuses on the finances of newspaper companies at the time their revenues collapsed, how management actions magnified the economic impact of these declining revenues and how management decisions put the companies on a course that would threaten the survival of some companies and drive others into bankruptcy.</p>

<title>The crash</title>
<p>Throughout all of its modern history, newspaper advertising revenues – the lifeblood of the industry – showed steady and predictable growth. A down year was almost always followed by an up year. Between 1985 and 2005, print advertising revenues increased at an average annual rate of $1.1 billion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1464884912472016">Pew, 2012</xref>). In 2005, print advertising revenues for the daily newspaper industry topped out at a high of $47.4 billion. Then the bottom fell out (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1464884912472016">Figure 1</xref>). In 2007, print advertising revenues saw their steepest drop ever in the industry’s history, dropping 9.5 percent ($4.4 billion) in one year. And from then on, it got worse. Newspaper advertising revenues went into a free fall, dropping $26.7 billion between 2005 and 2011. Within six years, print advertising revenues dropped 56.4 percent. Few industries have experienced such a rapid and steep drop in their major source of revenue as did the newspaper industry.</p>

</fig>
<p>Exacerbating the newspaper industry’s financial crisis, circulation revenues paralleled the drop in print advertising revenues, though the decrease was not nearly as stark. Circulation revenues hit a high of $11.2 billion in 2002; by 2009, revenues had dropped 8.7 percent to $10.1 billion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1464884912472016">Pew, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>The newspaper industry was unable to find other sources of revenue to offset these losses. Online advertising has been and remains a very small part of total newspaper revenues and has not made up for the loss of print advertising revenues. In 2003, online advertising revenues were $1.2 billion and increased to $3.3 billion in 2011, an increase of 175 percent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1464884912472016">Pew, 2012</xref>). But the annual pace of growth is not replacing the annual loss of print advertising revenues. Moreover, newspapers are falling further behind the growth of other digital advertisers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1464884912472016">Pew, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>The financial collapse of the newspaper industry was not only dramatic but it also caught management and investors by surprise. Much of the finger pointing has been aimed at the newspaper industry’s failure to move aggressively into the digital age. The mantra heard from journalists, management, investors and academics is that the old business model is broken and a new model needs to be found. Yet, despite various forays into the digital world, the old business model still dominates the newspaper industry.</p>
<p>What really happened financially to the newspaper industry in the mid- to late 2000s? Certainly, sharp drops in advertising revenues bear a good deal of the blame for the industry’s financial crisis. But more was at work than a sharp drop in advertising revenues, which took a bad situation and made it much worse. And for a large number of newspaper companies, led to their quick demise.</p>
<p>This article dissects the finances of publicly traded newspaper companies to understand factors that magnified the economic collapse of the industry. At least 14 newspaper companies have gone bankrupt in recent years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1464884912472016">Anon, 2010</xref>). A few more companies hover close to bankruptcy today.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1464884912472016">3</xref></sup> The ability to be able to predict bankruptcy of a newspaper company would be a powerful analytic and investment tool. This article tests a mathematical model for predicting bankruptcy of newspaper companies one to three years before bankruptcy actually occurs.</p>

<title>Financial collapse of the newspaper business</title>
<p>To set the stage, it is necessary to understand what occurred in the newspaper industry beginning around 2000. In a short period of time, the newspaper industry underwent an unprecedented change in its ownership structure and make up.</p>
<p>Concentration of newspaper ownership by large, public corporations is a rather recent phenomenon in the history of the newspaper business. The modern newspaper chain has its roots in the mid-1970s when chains were able to raise large amounts of capital, primarily by becoming public companies. Chains used their new-found capital to buy additional newspapers, often offering such high purchase prices that even reluctant owners were forced to sell their newspapers. Because of their consistently strong economic performance, stock in publicly traded newspaper companies traded at premium prices. Growth is one important way – if not the most important – for newspaper companies to meet the financial demands of investors. Growth does not simply allow a company to increase its revenues and its profits, but it allows a company to employ its capital. High stock prices mean more capital is available to invest. And the stock prices of newspaper companies provided the capital to buy more and more newspapers.</p>
<p>By the late 1990s, the supply of newspapers available for purchase dried up. Flush with capital, the need to continue to grow to satisfy investors and a supply of newspapers near zero, the newspaper industry did what other industries had done in the past: they began to feed on each other. Chains began cannibalizing chains. Between 1993 and 2007, seven large chains were bought by other large chains at a total cost of $24 billion.</p>

<p>The number of publicly traded newspaper companies was nearly halved in less than a decade. A number of large publicly owned newspaper companies that existed in 2000 do not today: Times Mirror, Pulitzer, Knight Ridder, Hollinger, Central Newspaper, Dow Jones and E.W Scripps.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1464884912472016">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the mid-2000s, just as newspaper revenues and newspaper companies’ stock prices were reaching all-time highs, the newspaper industry had consolidated into a relatively small number of publicly traded companies that had spent lavishly to acquire competitors. This article focuses on the eight large publicly traded newspaper companies that existed at the time of the industry’s financial collapse: Gannett, Lee Enterprises, Media General, New York Times, Tribune, McClatchy, Washington Post and Journal Register.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1464884912472016">5</xref></sup> Three of these companies have declared bankruptcy: Journal Register (2007),<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1464884912472016">6</xref></sup> Tribune (2007) and Lee Enterprises (2011).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1464884912472016">7</xref></sup></p>

<p>In 2004, the combined market value of the eight newspaper companies was $48 billion. Within three years, their value dropped $19 billion (39%) to $29.8 billion. Comparing the market value of the companies from their highest value to their lowest dramatically magnifies the drop in market value. Between their best and worst years, the companies lost $43 billion in market value.</p>
<p>The drop in the market value of individual companies is very large. Between 2004 and 2011, Gannett’s market value dropped $19.4 billion or 85.5 % the New York Times lost $4.3 billion or 79.6 percent of market value; and the Washington Post lost $1.7 billion or 53.1 percent of market value. Between 2005 and 2011, Lee Enterprises lost $2.1 billion or 63.6 percent of market value; Media General lost $1.4 billion or 93.8 percent of market value; Tribune’s market value dropped $7.8 billion (69%) between 2003 and 2007; and the Journal Register’s market value dropped $629 million or 78.2 percent between 2004 and 2007.</p>
<p>For nearly all of the companies, their highest market value was in 2004. This is just before advertising revenues began their sharp drop. The correlation of the highest market values with the drop in advertising revenues indicates that the crash caught investors by surprise. If investors had anticipated the drop in advertising revenues, the market value of the newspaper companies would not have reached its apex just as the crash occurred. Within a short period of five years, newspaper companies went through both their best and worst of times.</p>
<p>Despite very large drops in market value and equally steep drops in advertising revenues, institutional investors continue to flock to these companies’ stock and institutional ownership of stock is greater today than it was in 1999 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1464884912472016">Table 2</xref>).</p>

<p>The need to satisfy these investors even in bad economic times is high, compelling companies to act in ways that seem counterintuitive. Gannett, for example, doubled its annual dividend in 2011 and put in place a $1 billion stock buy-back program, despite reporting a 3.5 percent drop in revenues.</p>
<p>To summarize, the eight newspaper companies’ market values went from their highest to their lowest levels in what to investors and management must have seemed like a blink of an eye. Large amounts of capital just disappeared. While market value is an important measure of a company’s business performance, it is not the only critical measure of a company’s worth. A company that goes bankrupt wipes out all of its stockholders’ value, i.e. market value. Lenders, on the other hand, must be concerned with more than market value. Book value – the actual worth of a company’s assets – is critical for lenders because these are the assets that can be sold if a company ends up in bankruptcy. When an industry experiences huge economic losses, as the newspaper industry did, book value becomes critically important.</p>

<title>A note on profits, operating margins and institutional investors</title>
<p>It seems counterintuitive that institutional ownership of newspaper companies’ stock would increase during the worst economic time in the industry’s history. But there is considerable hidden value in newspapers if one takes a broad view of their financial performance. Focusing just on the profitability of newspapers gives a very distorted picture of the industry’s financial strength. Even though reported net earnings are razor thin, the newspaper industry as a whole is profitable. In 2011, the industry reported an average profit margin of 5 % compared to 6 percent for the S&amp;P 500.</p>
<p>But net earnings is a skewed measure of the industry’s finances. The industry’s operating margins (EBITA) are high, hovering around 18 percent, which is higher than the operating margins for the S&amp;P 500 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1464884912472016">Lancaric, 2012</xref>). The big drain on earnings is the interest on newspaper companies’ debt. If interest could be either reduced or eliminated, newspapers would be doing well financially even considering declining revenues. Of course, the most drastic way to accomplish this is to file for bankruptcy. But with many newspaper companies in bankruptcy or having just exited it, this provides an opportunity for investors.</p>
<p>Some savvy institutional investors have figured this out. Warren Buffett has been on a newspaper-buying spree. In June 2012, he purchased all of Media General’s newspapers, except for the <italic>Tampa Tribune</italic>, for $142 million (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1464884912472016">De La Merced, 2012</xref>). Also in June 2012, he purchased 3.2 percent (1.6 million shares) of Lee Enterprises for $2.1 million. This follows his buying $85 million (65 cents on the dollar) of Lee Enterprises’ debt from Goldman Sachs in November 2011 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1464884912472016">Ro, 2012</xref>). He also bought his hometown newspaper, <italic>Omaha World-Herald</italic>, for $200 million. In just a matter of a few months, Buffett has spent around $300 million to acquire 88 newspapers.</p>
<p>Buffett is not the only institutional investor to be buying newspapers. In June 2012, 2100 Trust LLC, a private investment company, bought the <italic>Orange County Register</italic> and six other newspapers from bankrupt Freedom Communications. In January 2012, Halifax Media Holdings completed its purchase of the New York Times’ 19 regional newspapers for $143 million. In 2011, Alden Global Capital, a hedge fund specializing in distressed companies, bought the Journal Register Company and, in 2012, took control of William Dean Singleton’s bankrupt MediaNews. It also acquired stakes in Philadelphia Media Network, Tribune, Freedom Communications, A.H. Belo, Gannett, McClatchy and Media General (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1464884912472016">Langeveld, 2011</xref>). This places Alden Global Capital in the position to take control of the Tribune Company when it emerges from bankruptcy.</p>

<sec id="section5-1464884912472016">
<title>Goodwill</title>
<p>It is not possible to discuss the financial difficulties of newspaper companies without focusing on goodwill. Goodwill has been and continues to be a major financial problem for newspaper companies. It has had a significant negative effect on the finances of these companies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1464884912472016">Morton, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Goodwill is an accounting concept that reflects the difference between what a company paid for an acquisition and the actual value of that acquisition. Goodwill is carried on the asset side of a company’s balance sheet. There are many reasons why a company will pay more to acquire another company than the company is actually worth. One reason a company will overpay for an acquisition is because it has a large amount of available capital as a result of its stock trading at premium prices. To take advantage of this under-used capital, management may be willing to overpay for an acquisition, believing that the purchase will not have any significant negative financial repercussions for the company (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1464884912472016">Gu and Lev, 2005</xref>). In fact, there is a very strong incentive for management to act quickly when share prices are at or near record price levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1464884912472016">2005</xref>).</p>
<p>The implications for a company carrying large amounts of goodwill as a result of acquisitions can be very negative. Firms carrying large amounts of goodwill have experienced large layoffs, increased likelihood of insolvency and negative financial returns within two years of an acquisition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1464884912472016">Gu and Lev, 2005</xref>). Goodwill has other negative implications for a company because it is tied directly to a company’s asset value or book value. Writing off goodwill will increase a firm’s debt-to-equity ratio, which is a signal that a firm may be heading towards bankruptcy. This, in turn, will likely reduce a firm’s market value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1464884912472016">2005</xref>). One very important implication of carrying large amounts of goodwill that has to be written off is the impact it has on the firm’s ability to borrow.</p>
<p>Companies are required to assess goodwill annually for impairment and any impairment of goodwill must be recognized as a loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1464884912472016">Mercer et al., 2002</xref>). In other words, companies must annually ‘mark to the market’ goodwill and any reduction in its market value must be written off. Newspaper companies have carried and, despite significant reductions, still carry large amounts of goodwill on their balance sheets as a result of acquisitions during the newspaper industry’s flush years. The large amount of goodwill on newspaper companies’ balance sheets poses three major problems: (1) Goodwill accounts for a large amount of the companies’ book value; (2) it is not possible to predict what the value of goodwill will be in any given year; once goodwill is written off, it can never be added back even if its value increases; and (3) determining the market value of goodwill is no simple matter.</p>
<p>In addition to goodwill, newspaper companies carry on their books large amounts of other intangible assets. As with goodwill, intangible assets must also be marked to the market. Any reduction in the market value must be written off. But unlike goodwill, when an intangible asset increases in value, the increase can be added back on the balance sheet. The intangible assets owned by newspaper companies consist of such things as mastheads, circulation list, advertising lists, etc. Determining the market value of these assets can be more of an art form than a science (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1464884912472016">Ernst &amp; Young, n.d.</xref>).</p>
<p>Changes in a company’s book value can have significant negative effects. In one way or another, loans are tied to book value. When book value shrinks to a predetermined level it can trigger a mandatory change in a loan’s terms. This may force a company to come up with additional collateral or, more likely, it would result in an increase in the loan’s interest rate. This, in turn, would have a negative impact on a company’s earnings, which, in turn, would likely have a negative impact on a company’s stock price.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1464884912472016">Table 3</xref> shows the amount of goodwill and intangible assets carried by the eight newspaper companies. The table also shows the percentage of their book value accounted for by goodwill and intangible assets. The data show that: (1) the newspaper companies carry large amounts of goodwill on their books; (2) goodwill and intangibles account for the majority – in some cases upwards of three-quarters – of the companies’ total book value; and (3) beginning in 2008, companies were forced to write off very large amounts of goodwill.</p>

<p>Despite the large write downs of goodwill, it still accounts for the lion’s share of the companies’ intangible assets. In 2006, goodwill accounted for 71 percent of the eight companies’ total intangible assets. In 2011, it accounted for 68 percent of all intangible assets. Despite the large write downs of goodwill, it still accounts for a very large amount of the companies’ total book value.</p>
<p>Between 2006 and 2011, newspaper companies wrote off over $19 billion in goodwill. The largest write off of goodwill occurred in 2008 when $15.3 billion of goodwill was written off. Between 2007 and 2008, the goodwill carried by the companies declined by 68 percent. These numbers are quite large. If we assume that the Journal Register’s and the Tribune’s goodwill would have been written off at the same rate as the other companies, between 2007 and 2008 the companies’ goodwill dropped by 69.4 percent. Adjusting for the Journal Register and the Tribune, the total book value of the companies dropped by $17.6 billion in just one year (2007–2008), which accounted for over a third (37.3%) of their total book value. As a result, in just one year, the book value of the companies shrank by nearly 40 percent.</p>
<p>Focusing on the six companies that survived into 2011, the drop in their book value is extremely large and this drop occurred in a very short period of time. In just two years (2006–8), Gannett’s book value dropped $8.4 billion or 44.2 percent. Goodwill accounted for $7.2 billion or 85.7 percent of this drop. Between 2006 and 2011, Gannett’s book value went from $16.2 billion to $6.6 billion, a drop of 59.3 percent.</p>
<p>While Gannett’s drop in book value is very large, other companies saw declines that were even more dramatic. Between 2005 and 2011, Lee Enterprises lost $2.1 billion in value, a drop of 65.7 percent. Goodwill accounted for $1.3 billion or 62 percent of this loss in value. McClatchy’s book value dropped $5.1 billion or 63 percent between 2006 and 2011. Goodwill accounted for $2.6 billion (51%) of the decline. Between 2004 and 2011, Media General’s book value dropped $1.3 billion or 54.2 percent. Goodwill accounted for 40 percent of the loss in value. The New York Times’ asset value dropped $1.7 billion or 37.8 percent between 2005 and 2011. Of that amount, goodwill accounted for $900 million or 53 percent of the loss in value.</p>
<p>The only company that bucked the trend in book-value loss was the Washington Post. The primary reason being it had not acquired much goodwill through any large acquisition during the 2000s. The amount of goodwill carried on its books has remained relatively constant since 2007. Even so, the Washington Post lost $1 billion or 16.7 percent of its book value between 2007 and 2011. During this time, Washington Post’s goodwill declined by only $100 million.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1464884912472016">Table 3</xref> indicates that newspaper companies paid a considerable premium when they purchased other chains in the early half of the decade. Overpaying for the chains would not have been much of a problem if the newspaper business continued to operate as it always had. But it didn’t. The acquisitions could not have been more ill timed. They occurred just as their advertising markets went into free fall. This was the newspaper industry’s perfect storm: paying a premium price for large acquisitions just as revenues collapsed.</p>
<p>In the mid-2000s, in addition to the steep drop in advertising revenues, the newspaper business faced three major financial problems: (1) fast and large shrinkage in book value; (2) much of the hard assets were not liquid and these assets experienced very large declines in market value; and (3) the companies carried large debt loads. In such a situation, the role debt plays becomes highly magnified, especially when book value drops sharply.</p>

<sec id="section6-1464884912472016">
<title>Leverage</title>
<p>Debt, leverage and asset value of companies are tied together tightly. The relationship between the three cannot be understated. The amount of debt carried by a company is evaluated by lenders and investors using a variety of matrixes that compare debt to other financial indictors. These debt ratios are critically important in determining: (1) how much a company is leveraged; (2) the ability of the company to meet its debt obligations in both the short and long term; (3) the amount of collateral available to lenders should a company go bankrupt; and (4) the amount of lenders’ risk exposure.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1464884912472016">Dun &amp; Bradstreet (n.d.)</xref> uses six key ratios for assessing a company’s debt. Four of these measures include a company’s asset value in their calculations. Two of the debt-assessment ratios – the Debt Ratio and the Current Ratio (also called the Acid Test) – will be used in this section to evaluate the leverage of the eight newspaper companies. The Debt Ratio uses a company’s total assets in its calculation; the Current Ratio uses a company’s current assets in its calculations. Both are measures of leverage – one long term, the other short term.</p>
<p>Given their large acquisitions, it is not surprising to find that newspaper companies carry large amounts of debt and are highly leveraged. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1464884912472016">Table 4</xref> reports the amount of long-term debt carried by the eight companies. Their total amount of debt reached a high of $22.4 billion in 2007, which was equal to 67.3 percent of the total book value of the companies. The table shows that the companies added debt in a very short period of time. Between 2005 and 2007, the amount of long-term debt carried by the companies increased 77.8 percent from $12.6 billion to $22.4 billion. The companies were adding considerable amounts of debt just as the advertising market began its collapse.</p>

<p>Note: All of Lee Enterprises long-term debt became due within the year.</p>

</table-wrap-foot>
</table-wrap>
<p>To make matters worse, most of the companies’ book value was composed largely of goodwill and other intangible assets. Most of these assets have no real market value and for those that do, they would be very difficult to sell. Not only were the companies significantly increasing their debt, they were also becoming less liquid. The amount of liquidity is critically important for lenders. It is not surprising, then, that newspaper companies have focused on reducing their long-term debt.</p>
<p>Gannett has been the company most successful in reducing its long-term debt. Its debt load peaked in 2005 at $5.4 billion. By 2011, Gannett had reduced this amount to $3.6 billion or 66.7 percent. McClatchy’s debt reached $2.8 billion in 2006; by 2011, it had been reduced by 42.9 percent or by $1.2 billion. Lee Enterprises reduced its debt by $500 million or 33 percent between 2006 and 2010.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1464884912472016">8</xref></sup> Media General’s long-term debt was reduced 19.9 percent ($163 million) between 2006 and 2011. The New York Times’ long-term debt peaked in 2010 at $1.0 billion; a year later, it had reduced its debt by $300 million or 30 percent. The Washington Post’s long-term debt is the lowest of any of the companies and has remained stable over the 2000 decade at around $400 million.</p>
<p>The amount of debt, in and of itself, is a relative indicator of a company’s financial well-being. The question is not how much debt a company is carrying, but how much debt it carries in relation to other measures of its financial health. There are a number of ways to assess whether a company’s debt load is excessive. Two of these measures – Debt Ratio and the Current Ratio – are highly relevant to the newspaper industry.</p>
<p>The Debt Ratio compares a company’s debt with its assets. It is a measure of a company’s ability to pay its debts over the long term. Lenders use the Debt Ratio to assess the risk of a company defaulting. The higher the ratio, the more a company is leveraged and the more it is in danger of defaulting. The computation of the ratio is:</p>

</p>
<p>A ratio of 100 percent indicates that a company’s assets and its liabilities are equal. A ratio above 100 percent means the company is worth less than what it owes. A ratio higher than 80 percent is considered an indication that a company is in danger of defaulting and heading towards bankruptcy.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1464884912472016">Table 4</xref> provides the Debt Ratio for the eight companies. The table shows that the companies are very highly leveraged. The Washington Post is the only company that did not borrow heavily during the 2000s and remains the least leveraged company by a significant amount.</p>
<p>In a number of years for a number of the companies, the company’s liabilities exceeded the book value of the company. In effect, the companies were ‘under water’. Between 2000 and 2006, the Debt Ratio of nearly all of the companies increased annually. It topped out at the same time that the advertising market collapsed. The timing could not have been worse and it left the newspaper companies in a precarious financial situation: record levels of debt just as their markets collapsed.</p>
<p>The Debt Ratio indicates that McClatchy, the New York Times and Media General may have a very difficult time in the long term of meeting their debt obligations.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1464884912472016">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Current Ratio or Acid Test is a measure of a company’s short-term ability to pay its debts. It is a de facto measure of a company’s solvency. A ratio of 1 means the company’s current assets and current liabilities are equal. A ratio above 1 indicates that the company could generate enough cash from sale of its current assets to cover its immediate liabilities. At a ratio below 1, the company does not have enough assets to cover its liabilities. The Current Ratio is calculated:</p>

<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1464884912472016">Table 4</xref> reports the Current Ratio for the eight companies. Two trends in the table can be identified:</p>
<list id="list2-1464884912472016" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>(1) Ratios for the companies show great fluctuations. Lee Enterprises’ ratio, for example, went from 4.3 in 2001 to 0.1 in 2011, a change of 97.7 percent.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>(2) The companies’ ratios have hovered close to 1, which indicates the companies are pressed to meet their immediate loan obligations.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>For the companies as a whole, the ratios hit a low in 2007 when all but Gannett were under 1. Since then, of the six companies still viable going into 2011, only Lee Enterprises’ ratio continued to fall. In 2008, Lee Enterprises’ ratio hit an all-time low, with 2011 being just barely higher. McClatchy, New York Times, Media General and the Washington Post have all increased their liquidity since 2007. This is not surprising because most loans carried by newspaper companies require them to increase their liquidity, often setting annual target levels that must be met.</p>
<p>Together, the Debt Ratio and Current Ratio indicate: (1) the companies as a group are highly leveraged; (2) three companies’ ability to meet their debt obligations in the long term is in doubt; (3) three companies are pressed to cover their short-term debt obligations; and (4) only Gannett and the Washington Post have debt loads that they are able to manage.</p>
<p>When a business is highly leveraged, one penalty is that borrowing costs increase markedly. This is the case with these companies. Another penalty is that lenders will tie loans to specific leverage ratios. Usually, the loan covenants require a company to meet a decreasing leverage ratio over time. Failure to meet these ratios can have extreme consequences for a company, including forcing its liquidation</p>
<p>The United States has been experiencing an extended period of historic low interest rates. Companies have taken advantage of these low rates by borrowing at record levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1464884912472016">Hauser, 2012</xref>). Borrowing costs for companies with less than stellar S&amp;P ratings have been at historic lows. For example, Heinz’s five and 10-year bonds issued in February 2012 had a coupon rate of 1.5 percent. This was a record low interest rate for triple B rated bonds. Even media companies have taken advantage of low interest rates to borrow money. In February 2012, Viacom, a triple B rated company, beat out Heinz with a record low interest rate of 1.25 percent for its bonds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1464884912472016">Robinson, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>The newspaper companies have been unable to take advantage of record low interest rates. With the exception of the Washington Post, all of the companies have loans that carry double-digit interest rates. McClatchy’s largest loan has an 11.5 percent interest rate; its senior notes, a 15.75 percent interest rate. The New York Times paid off a note in 2011 that had a 14.1 percent interest rate. Lee Enterprises acquired a note from Pulitzer when it bought the company. In 2011, the note’s interest rate was 10.55 percent and the rate is adjustable annually. After filing for bankruptcy, all of Lee Enterprises’ notes carry a floating interest rate tied to the LIBOR index. Even companies in the best financial shape – Gannett and the Washington Post – carry loans with high interest rates but nowhere near as high as the other companies. Gannett’s average interest rate is 7.4 percent and the Washington Post’s largest loan carries a 7.25 percent rate.</p>
<p>The largest loans of a number of the companies are tied directly to their liquidity, with lenders stipulating specific liquidity ratios they must meet. These ratios usually decrease annually, meaning companies must steadily increase their liquidity. For example, Media General renegotiated its largest loan in March 2012. The agreement requires Media General to increase its liquidity from a ratio of 7.6 to 7.1 by December 2014.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1464884912472016">10</xref></sup> Failure to do so results in a loan default allowing the lenders to demand immediate payment in full of the entire note.</p>
<p>Newspaper companies are caught in a vicious circle: a drop in their financial performance triggers higher interest rates, which puts increased financial pressure on the companies, which leads to further declines in financial performance, which leads to higher interest rates. Liquidity is the critical measure used by lenders and it is liquidity that determines whether a company ends up filing for bankruptcy.</p>

<title>Predicting bankruptcy</title>
<p>The financial data presented so far indicate that the newspaper industry is sliding towards bankruptcy. A mathematical model that could predict whether a company will end up filing for bankruptcy with a high degree of accuracy would be a very useful tool for investors, lenders and management.</p>
<p>In 1968, Edward I. Altman published his seminal study that developed the Z-score model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1464884912472016">Altman 1968</xref>), which is widely used by investors, lenders and scholars to predict the likelihood of a company filing for bankruptcy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1464884912472016">Agarwal and Taffler, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>The Z-score model is:</p>

<p>where</p>
<p>T<sub>1</sub> = Working capital/Total assets is a measure of a company’s liquidity. Companies facing increasing operating losses will experience a comparable reduction in their liquidity.</p>
<p>T2 = Retained earnings/Total assets is a measure of company’s age. Younger companies are more likely to go bankrupt than are more mature companies which have been in business longer.</p>
<p>T3 = EBIT/Total assets is a measure of productivity, i.e. how much return is being generated by the company’s assets.</p>
<p>T4 = Market value/Long-term debt measures the difference between the company’s value and its debt. This is a ratio of leverage.</p>
<p>T5 = Revenue/Total assets measures a company’s ability to generate revenue.</p>
<p>Empirical studies have identified a range of Z-scores for predicting the likelihood of insolvency:</p>
<list id="list3-1464884912472016" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>1.8 or less: ‘Very high probability of insolvency’</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>1.8 to 2.7: ‘High probability of insolvency’</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>2.7 to 3.0: ‘Possible insolvency’</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>3.0 and above: ‘Insolvency is unlikely’</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The accuracy of Z-scores in predicting bankruptcy is very high. In the year prior to a company filing for bankruptcy, the Z-score has a 95 percent accuracy rate. Two years ahead of a company filing for bankruptcy, the model has a 72 percent accuracy rate. This drops to 48 percent in the third year prior to bankruptcy.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1464884912472016">Table 5</xref> reports the Z-scores for the eight newspaper companies using the standard (manufacturing) Z-score model. The model predicts the bankruptcy of Lee Enterprises, Journal Register and Tribune. The Z-scores for Journal Register indicate that the company was heading towards bankruptcy at least seven years before it actual filed. Its Z-score hit its lowest value the year before filing for bankruptcy. The Tribune’s Z-scores show that it began its slide toward bankruptcy in 2005. Its Z-score hit its all-time low the year before filing for bankruptcy.</p>

<p><italic>Note</italic>: Because Lee Enterprises’ long-term debt became due, it is not possible to compute the Z-score.</p>

</table-wrap-foot>
</table-wrap>
<p>The Z-scores for Lee Enterprises indicated it was heading towards bankruptcy as early as 2005. Three years later, the finances of Lee Enterprises were so bleak that its outside accounting firm, KPMG, publicly questioned whether Lee Enterprises could survive:<disp-quote>
<p>Our report dated 31 December 2008 on the consolidated financial statements, contains an explanatory paragraph that states that the Company has short-term obligations that cannot be satisfied by available funds and has incurred violations of debt covenants that subject the related principal amounts to acceleration, all of which raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1464884912472016">11</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The Z-scores of the three newspaper companies that filed for bankruptcy predicted bankruptcy three to five years ahead of their actual filing for bankruptcy. The Z-scores of all three companies hit their low the year before they filed for bankruptcy.</p>
<p>The Z-scores for McClatchy, Media General and the New York Times indicate they are in danger of insolvency and their ability to survive as viable companies is in doubt. McClatchy’s Z-score plummeted the year after buying Knight Ridder. Since 2007, McClatchy’s Z-scores have been in negative numbers.</p>
<p>Media General’s Z-scores swung up and down over the years, but the trend line is downward. In 1999, Media General paid $700 million for Park Communication. The effect of this purchase is seen in the low Z-score in 2000. In 2011, Media General’s Z-score indicated a very high probability of bankruptcy.</p>
<p>Between 2001 and 2011, the New York Times Z-scores placed the company in the ‘very high probability of insolvency’ or the ‘high probability of insolvency’ categories.</p>
<p>The Z-scores indicate that only Gannett and the Washington Post are financially stable and unlikely to file for bankruptcy. With the exception of two years (2008 and 2009), Gannett’s Z-score has placed it in ‘the insolvency not likely’ category. Even after its $2.6 billion purchase of Central Newspapers, Gannett’s Z-scores indicated the company was financially sound. The Washington Post is the newspaper company in the best financial shape and the only one to have consistently high Z-scores.</p>
<p>The data in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1464884912472016">Table 5</xref> indicate that the Z-score model was able to predict the bankruptcy of Lee Enterprises, Journal Register and the Tribune years before they actually filed. The data strongly suggest that the Z-score model can be applied to the newspaper industry to predict bankruptcy.</p>

<sec id="section8-1464884912472016">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The steep drop in advertising revenues hit the newspaper industry at the absolute worst time. The industry’s own actions greatly magnified the problems caused by the drop in revenues. Just before the crash, the newspaper industry underwent an unprecedented change in its structure and finances. Strong and steady economic returns made newspaper companies extremely attractive to institutional investors, which helped to propel their stock prices. These investors placed irresistible pressure on management to maximize returns. One way the newspaper industry had done this in the past was to continue to grow through the acquisition of more newspapers and other media. Flush with large amounts of capital as a result of high stock prices, newspaper companies began to swallow each other. If it had been business as usual, the newspaper industry would have been able to digest these purchases. But it was not business as usual; instead, it was the industry’s perfect storm.</p>
<p>Because of high prices paid for large acquisitions, seven of the eight publicly traded newspaper companies ended up having goodwill make up a very large percentage of their book value. Just as the advertising market began its collapse, the companies were forced to write off large amounts of this goodwill. As a result, the companies shrank in value to a mere shadow of what they had been just a few years before. This also meant that newspaper companies were not very liquid. Exacerbating this, the market that the companies were required to mark their intangible assets to was a market that was in free fall, which magnified the loss of book value.</p>
<p>The shrinking value of the newspaper companies had a major effect on the debt these companies carried. The amount of debt, alone, is not nearly as important as is the amount of debt when compared to book value. Key measures of leverage used by investors and lenders are tied to a company’s book value. If a company files for bankruptcy, it is these assets that go to lenders. A company that is highly leveraged with decreasing book value is a risky borrower. To offset default risks, lenders will charge highly leveraged companies well above market interest rates. This is the case for the newspaper companies examined in this article.</p>
<p>The newspaper industry’s perfect storm occurred in the mid-2000s. A number of critical factors converged on the industry at the same time: high stock prices resulting in excess capital to invest, pressure by large institutional investors to maintain high rates of return; the need to continue to grow which could only be achieved through the purchase of other chains at very high prices; large amounts of book value being composed of goodwill; and an unprecedented crash in advertising and circulation revenues brought on by the internet. The timing for the industry could not have been worse. Had the industry done what the Washington Post did and refrain from making large acquisitions, the industry would not be in the precarious financial situation in which it finds itself. The industry, itself, made a bad situation much worse.</p>
<p>With so many newspaper companies in bankruptcy and with others rapidly sliding towards it, this article sought to determine whether Altman’s Z-score model for predicating bankruptcy was applicable to the newspaper industry. Testing the model using the eight newspaper companies showed that the Z-score model did accurately predict the bankruptcy of Lee Enterprises, Tribune and Journal Register years before they actually filed. It does appear that the Z-score model of insolvency is applicable to the newspaper industry. The applicability of the model to the newspaper industry provides scholars and investors with a powerful tool to predict the future financial viability of newspaper companies.</p>
<p>There remain at least two important issues regarding the finances of the newspaper industry. First is to understand the factors that led management to act in the ways they did. While the surface answer is the need to sustain earnings in order to satisfy shareholders, most especially large institutions, this answer is far too simplistic. It seems much more likely that a complex array of factors – large cash flows, record high stock prices, management incentives to focus on short-term goals that limited ability to engage in long-term planning and the ability to borrow large amounts of capital – played as important a role as the collapse of the industry’s revenue streams in management-decision making.</p>
<p>The second issue of concern is whether the recent purchase of newspapers by institutional investors is the beginning of a trend that will mark the third major sea change in newspaper ownership in this country (from family ownership to corporate ownership to investor ownership). The ability to use bankruptcy to shed debt, force union concessions and void long-term contractual agreements makes ownership of newspapers highly attractive even in bad economic times. But such a change in ownership may not bode well for the quality of journalism practiced at these newspapers. Despite the financial problems of the existing publicly traded newspaper companies, management’s roots are in journalism. This is not the case with institutional owners.</p>

<p>The Journal Register Co. emerged from Chapter 11 in August 2009 as a privately owned company. In the late 1990s, just after the company went public, it went on a major acquisition spree. The debts incurred by these purchases ultimately led to its filing for Chapter 11 in February 2009. It refiled for Chapter 11 protection in late summer 2012. The company announced in its filing that it had a ‘stalking-horse bid’ for the company from an investment group. The company has said that it would entertain bids from other investors but if none were higher than the one offered by the ‘stalking-horse’ investor, it would sell itself to that investor. The ‘stalking-horse’ investor is an investment group affiliated with Alden Global Capital, which is the current owner of the Journal Register. In effect, the Journal Register is selling itself to itself. The reason for the current bankruptcy filing is to allow the Journal Register to shed its pension plan, to get out of long-term contracts such as leases and to reduce further its debt.</p>
