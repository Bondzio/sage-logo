<p>The fact that Library and Information Science (LIS) is a growing organism can be felt in the theme of 78th IFLA Conference namely ‘Libraries Now: Inspiring, Surprising, Empowering’. It reminds the LIS community that both libraries and librarians are increasingly shouldering heavy responsibilities: i.e. these days, libraries and their services, librarians and their activities, LIS and its aspects, and users and their demands are growing organisms. Accordingly, if libraries are truly considered as the hinge for communicating among librarians and various clients with differing expertise, values, and personal traits, the reality of ‘LIS as a compound science’ is reinforced. In this way, paying attention to a variety of issues including ‘Communication’ and its realization in theory and practice can help librarians meet their own ideals as well as their users’ demands more effectively. The publication of the book <italic>Understanding Librarians: Communication Is the Issue</italic>, which is written with the intention of improving understanding and communication between librarians and others (p. 1), is an attempt to draw librarians’ attention to the undeniable influential element ‘communication’. According to the author (p. 2), this book aims to highlight some of the factors contributing to communication problems in the library setting and suggest ways of alleviating them.</p>
<p>It consists of 17 chapters. Chapter 1, ‘Defining the problem’, states the motivation for compiling this book through considering some issues concerning failure in communication between experts (librarians, information professionals, and information providers) and laymen (users). Chapters 2, ‘What are libraries for?’, and 3, ‘Images of librarians’, deal mainly with the existing philosophy of the two main pillars of the communication process between expert and layman: libraries and librarians. As Hull indicates:<disp-quote>
<p>when a client walks through the door, is there a match between the mindset of the librarians at the desk and that of the client: what the library is for, how far and in what ways can it help him satisfy his information needs? The librarian needs to be sensitive to the possibility of a mismatch (p. 19).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>These two chapters – regardless of the deep impact of the emerging changes fuelled by the ‘Digital Revolution’ within which technologies are transforming a variety of fields – emphasize that libraries are instruments of social engineering as well as social justice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0961000612468829">Pateman and Vincent, 2010</xref>). They facilitate accessing human knowledge, and librarians as teachers (not only as custodians and organizers of information) should be aware of their place and role, value them, and confirm themselves stronger than before. As the title <italic>Understanding Librarians</italic> suggests, it is expected that such sympathetic and thoughtful librarians always redefine and redesign their service options for their patrons through thinking functionally.</p>
<p>Hence, discussing some barriers (psychological, social class and lack of education, language, lack of literacy and numeracy skills, information and communication technology (ICT), and disability) hindering optimal librarian-client interaction, the author, through Chapters 4 to 9, attempts to reinforce the understanding of understanding librarians on the hard road to realizing information utopia.</p>
<p>After articulating such barriers, Chapters 10 to 14 concentrate on libraries and librarians as important elements in developing suitable communication. Chapter 10, ‘Clarity of purpose’ puts stress on the formulation of the library strategic goals, mission statements, and operational guidelines in a manner that all staff at all levels are aware of and adhere to them. Chapter 11, ‘Evaluation and the value of systematic research’, concerns the significance and necessity of evidence-based practice using user-oriented (performance evaluation or quality assessment) studies. Chapter 12, ‘Librarians as reflective practitioners’ contains Hull’s call for reflective practice which can be traced to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0961000612468829">Alkan’s (2008</xref>, p.1) declaration:<disp-quote>
<p>The library, which has survived for centuries as the memory of mankind and a social force, librarianship, an old and influential profession, and librarians, whose professional identity enjoyed recognition, all face the challenge of opponents who claim that they are outmoded. To meet opposing views successfully, librarians must attach importance to Philosophical Thinking (PT) and produce philosophical thoughts [and reflective practice].</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Chapter 13, ‘Staff development’, emphasizes the importance of managing staff (librarians and their co-workers) in terms of their motivations, qualities, and personalities to library success. If libraries would like to have staff who are willing to help users, understand the needs of their users, deal with users in a caring fashion, are consistently courteous, are ready to respond to users’ questions, and have the needed knowledge and enough skills to answer user questions the author’s belief should be taken into consideration: ‘Our staff are, or should be, our greatest asset so let us treat them with respect, keep them updated and communicate with them. Good communications internal to the library likely to foster good communications with external colleagues and partners’ (p. 125). Chapter 14, ‘Self publicise’, generally posits that we as librarians should implement self-publicity and self-promotion programmes. These, she argues, in turn can diminish the phenomenon of ‘disintermediation’ and thus strengthen the bridge of humanistic communication even in the electronic age: that is, communication makes communication (satisfied users as ambassadors, p .133).</p>
<p>Chapters 15 and 16, are guest chapters contributed respectively by Denise Turner (Chapter 15) and Christine Oughtred and Marion Churkovich (Chapter 16). They report some case studies which have wider lessons and implications in relation to the main theme of the book. The closing chapter, Chapter 17, ‘Where are we now?’, emphasizes that if librarians are [still] expected to be leaders (like conductors of symphony orchestras to carrying all its members towards a single goal) then they need to remain flexible and versatile.</p>
<p>For me, Hull implicitly indicates that the key to survival and being effective as well as efficient in the library work is to act based on ‘Five new laws of librarianship’ by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0961000612468829">Michael Gorman (1995)</xref> – namely ‘Libraries serve humanity’, ‘Respect all forms by which knowledge is communicated’, ‘Use technology intelligently to enhance service’, ‘Protect free access to knowledge’, and ‘Honor the past and create the future’. From aforementioned notes, the content of the book, taking a humanistic and communicative approach, tells us that the divide between librarians (knowledge workers) and users (knowledge seekers) should be replaced with the dialogue between librarians and users. This would be a stride towards more communication and connectedness, increased social capital and status of LIS professionals; it would make communication easy (not problematical), and signal change or transformation in library work as the path to growth and survival. Altogether, this easy-to-read and easy-to-understand book can be treated both as a starting point for further research and as a code of conduct for librarians, library managers, and library practitioners. Reading it would benefit many in the LIS community including professors and students. Its simplicity is a strong point but it is hoped that future edition(s) will report more case studies regarding successful examples of positive communications in the library context.</p>
