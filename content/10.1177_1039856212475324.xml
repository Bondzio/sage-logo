<sec id="section1-1039856212475324">
<title>Objective:</title>
<p>Primary Mental Health Teams (PMHTs) were established in Victoria in 2002 to integrate psychiatric services into primary care. This study aimed to evaluate the characteristics of patients referred to Eastern Health PMHT, the effectiveness of management plans and referrer satisfaction.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1039856212475324">
<title>Method:</title>
<p>Retrospective case note review of referrals (116) made to the PMHT from January to August 2010 and analysis of returned satisfaction surveys (105) from referrers between January 2006 and August 2010.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1039856212475324">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>The mean age of patients was 40 years with 55% being female. The commonest primary diagnosis was depression (41%). The majority of patients (59%) had multiple psychiatric diagnoses. The response time for telephonic consultation was 1.4 days and 13.2 days for an initial patient consultation. Psychotherapy was the most frequently recommended treatment (85%). Average treatment period was 6.8 weeks and the majority of patients (93%) were discharged back to the primary referrer. Referrers were satisfied with PMHT services and average improvement of patients on the Health of the Nation Outcome Scales was 2.3.</p>

<p>Mental illness is having an increasing impact on the Australian population. The 2007 National Survey of Mental Health and Wellbeing (ANSMHW) estimated 12-month and lifetime prevalence rates for any mental disorder as 20% and 45% respectively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1039856212475324">1</xref></sup> The 2003 Burden of Disease and Injury in Australia study indicated that mental disorders are the leading cause of disability in Australia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1039856212475324">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>Despite the availability of effective treatments in Australia, greater than half those suffering from mental disorders do not receive them.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1039856212475324">3</xref></sup> Contributing factors include failure to access psychiatric treatment, and deficiencies in the provision of psychiatric treatment at the primary care level.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1039856212475324">3</xref></sup> General practitioners (GPs) manage 75–90% of patients in the community with mental illness.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1039856212475324">4</xref></sup> It has been suggested that GPs and primary care workers lack the expertise and time to manage mental health problems, and are poorly supported by specialist services.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1039856212475324">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1039856212475324">5</xref></sup> Yet, with assistance, the primary care sector has the capacity to offer rapid and affordable access to comprehensive mental health care without the stigma often associated with attending specialist psychiatric services.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1039856212475324">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1039856212475324">6</xref></sup> Furthermore, GPs have the capacity to develop unique patient–doctor relationships, enabling continuity of care, improved compliance and early detection of relapse.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1039856212475324">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>Primary Mental Health Teams (PMHTs) were established in Victoria in 2002 with a view to integrate psychiatric services effectively into primary care using the Consultation–Liaison in Primary-Care Psychiatry (CLIPP) model.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1039856212475324">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1039856212475324">8</xref></sup> Eastern Health PMHT uses this shared care and consultation-liaison model, assisting primary care providers in the assessment and treatment of high prevalence psychiatric disorders.</p>
<p>Although PMHTs are integral to the Victorian health care system, there is a dearth of published data in this area. To the best of our knowledge, no study has been undertaken to evaluate the effectiveness of PMHTs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1039856212475324">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1039856212475324">9</xref></sup> This study reviews recent data from Eastern Health PMHT patients.</p>
<p>Eastern Health has a catchment area of 2800 km<sup>2</sup>, ranging from metropolitan to rural regions. This area is in the least disadvantaged quarter of Victoria, according to the index of relative socioeconomic disadvantage.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1039856212475324">10</xref></sup> In 2009, the population was 721,476, with 85% being less than 60 years of age and 62–78% being born in Australia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1039856212475324">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>During the study period, the team comprised two psychiatric nurses (1.5 full-time equivalent (FTE)), two psychiatry registrars (1.5 FTE), social worker (1 FTE), psychologist (0.7 FTE), consultant psychiatrist (0.3 FTE) and manager (0.5 FTE). Direct care was delivered in a consultation–liaison model, with face-to-face patient contact at the premises of the referring primary care provider. The service usually involved a brief period of shared care, with 1–6 sessions with the patient. Throughout this period, dialogue was maintained with the referrer. The referrer was provided with a diagnostic assessment and recommended treatment plan. Referrals of patients who could not be managed safely in a primary care setting or did not have a high prevalence disorder were redirected to more appropriate services. Additionally, PMHTs provided professional development training and education to primary healthcare personnel and assisted in navigating mental health services.</p>
<sec id="section5-1039856212475324" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>The study assessed characteristics of patients referred to a PMHT, the management interventions recommended and implemented, and the effectiveness of these interventions. The study was approved by the Eastern Health Research and Ethics Committee.</p>
<p>All referrals to Eastern Health PMHT from 1 January 2010 to 31 August 2010 were studied retrospectively.

<p>Eastern Health PMHT routinely sent a one-page feedback questionnaire to all referrers of patients accepted for direct care. All returned feedback forms from 1 January 2006 to 31 August 2010 were included in the study. The questionnaire had been previously developed by Eastern Health and sought referrers’ views on the accessibility of PMHT services, the shared care model, the impact of PMHT involvement on professional development, and areas for improvement. Results were analyzed by collating the responses of the seven 10-point scales and identifying themes in the three free text questions.</p>
<p>Ratings on the Health of the Nation Outcome Scales (HoNOS) were made for patients at the time of assessment and discharge, and the change in scores were evaluated. The HoNOS measures a wide range of health and social domains.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1039856212475324">11</xref></sup></p>

<p>The majority of patients (<italic>n</italic>=88, 76%) were referred by GPs and the rest by community health centers. Thirteen referrals (11%) made by GPs were initiated by the psychiatry triage service.</p>
<p>Of the 116 referrals studied, 63 received direct care from the PMHT, 40 were managed by telephone liaison and 13 were referred to other services. Initially, 70 referrals were accepted for direct care, but in four instances, PMHT sessions could not be accommodated at the referrer’s clinic. Three referrals were subsequently withdrawn by the referrer. Those seven referrals were later managed by telephone liaison.</p>
<p>Sixty-four patients were female (55%), while 52 (45%) were male, and the average age of referred patients was 40 years (range 14–81 years). Referrers were requested to indicate presenting problems using a symptom check list on the referral form. The most commonly reported symptoms were low mood (67%), poor sleep (59%), irritability (53%), anxiety (37%) and lack of energy (35%).</p>
<p>The most common primary diagnosis was major depressive disorder and at least one secondary psychiatric diagnosis was recorded in 69 (59%) patients. The most common secondary psychiatric diagnosis, substance misuse, was seen in 38 (32%). A significant medical diagnosis was recorded in 55 (47%) patients.</p>
<p>Less than half the patients, 54 (47%), had prior contacts with psychiatric services. Twenty-two patients (18%) had already been referred to another mental health care professional such as a counselor or mental health nurse at the time of referral to the PMHT.</p>
<sec id="section7-1039856212475324">
<title>PMHT management</title>
<p>The average response time for a referral made by telephone was 1.4 days. The mean time that elapsed between referral and initial assessment of patients accepted for direct care was 13.2 days. The average treatment period and number of face-to-face appointments for patients who received direct care was 6.8 weeks and 3.6 times respectively.</p>
<p>Escalating risk and necessity for urgent response were the most common reasons (78%) for referrals being redirected to other services. The psychiatry triage service was the main recipient of such referrals.</p>
<p>Psychotherapy was the most common treatment recommendation (85%) followed by medication (53%) and social intervention (28%). Every patient had more than one treatment recommendation. One hundred and eight patients (93%) were discharged back to the primary referrer. Others were referred to mental health community teams, crisis team and a private psychiatrist and one was admitted for inpatient treatment.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1039856212475324">
<title>Treatment outcomes</title>
<p>Satisfaction surveys were posted to the 219 primary health care providers who made referrals to the PMHT and 105 (47.9%) were returned. Most of the respondents were GPs. Mean satisfaction ratings were as follows (0–10 scale: 0 = minimum and 10 = maximum satisfaction score): shared care model useful to client referred to PMHT, 8.6; involvement of the PMHT to improve/change the thinking or practice of the primary care provider, 8.1; effectiveness of the communication between PMHT and primary care provider, 8.7; level of comprehension regarding how the PMHT works at the beginning of the referral, 7.4; responsiveness of the PMHT, 8.5; accessibility of the PMHT, 8.6; and success of the outreach model of psychiatric care provided by the PMHT, 8.5.</p>
<p>The majority of free text comments indicated that referrers valued the PMHT’s accessibility, its destigmatizing approach and the treatment interventions. Health care providers found the service accessible, relevant and efficient and reported that shared care improved their clinical practice. The few negative comments were related to the duration of PMHT involvement being brief, lack of clarity over PMHT intake criteria, difficulty in accommodating PMHT sessions at the GP clinic and waiting time.</p>
<p>HoNOS scores at intake and discharge were recorded in 60 of 63 direct care referrals and the average improvement of HoNOS score was 2.3.</p>
</sec></sec>
<sec id="section9-1039856212475324" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The conclusions drawn from this study are limited by its size. The response rate of 47.9% for the referrer satisfaction survey raises the question of whether these results can be generalized to all referrers and whether there was a positive responder bias. Other limiting factors are the retrospective medical record review methodology and the generalizability of the study to regions with greater psychosocial disadvantage and larger migrant populations.</p>
<p>Only a small percentage of referrals were made from the psychiatry triage service, suggesting that PMHT patients were less crisis-driven. GPs most frequently sought assistance managing patients with major depressive disorder and comorbid substance use, suggesting a particular need for assistance for this subgroup of patients.</p>
<p>The age group of patients that were most frequently referred to the service was 40 to 49 years. This contrasts with ANSMHW data which identifies the 16–24 year age group as having the highest prevalence (26%) of mental disorders.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1039856212475324">1</xref></sup> Possible explanations for this discrepancy include the younger age group not presenting for assistance, care being obtained from different services or GPs being more comfortable treating the older group.</p>
<p>Forty-six percent of referrals were for the management of affective disorders, which contrasts with the ANSMHW rates of 14.4% for anxiety disorders and 6.2% for mood disorders. Our findings are consistent with the national trend of individuals with affective disorders being more likely to access services than those with anxiety disorders.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1039856212475324">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Response times were rapid compared with anecdotal experiences from the private sector.</p>
<p>Despite the low survey return rate, it was useful to examine the results for possible trends. Survey respondents reported a high level of satisfaction with the shared care model, which provided ease of access to specialized services and necessary guidance. This suggests that a major aim of the PMHT model of care may have been achieved.</p>
<p>The patients clinically improved over the course of PMHT involvement, and this was supported by the HoNOS result. Psychoeducation and counseling were the main unmet needs according to respondents of the ANSMHW. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1039856212475324">1</xref></sup> These needs were addressed by PMHT interventions.</p>
<p>A direct comparison between the findings of our study and previous research by Jespersen and McGartland on PMHTs is difficult due to methodological differences.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1039856212475324">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1039856212475324">9</xref></sup> However, striking similarities were: GPs being the main referrers, the majority of patients being females in the age range 30–60 years, and the commonest treatment recommendation being psychotherapy.</p>
<p>Demographic factors and diagnoses of patients managed by the PMHT suggest the need for broadening the scope of its services. The projected aging of the population will necessitate enhanced expertise of the PMHT in age related psychiatric conditions. Currently, the focus of PMHTs is mainly on referrals from GPs. With the development of other services, such as Psychiatry Disability and Recovery Services (PDRS), PMHTs should expand to accommodate a variety of referral sources in the future.</p>
