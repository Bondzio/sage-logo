<abstract>
<p>The current therapeutic options for acute decompensated heart failure are limited to afterload reducers and positive inotropes. The latter increases myocardial contractility through changes in myocyte calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) handling (mostly through stimulation of the β-adrenergic pathways [β-ADR]) and is associated with paradoxical effects of arrhythmias, cell death, and subsequently increased mortality. We have previously demonstrated that probenecid can increase cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels in the cardiomyocyte resulting in an improved inotropic response in vitro and in vivo without activating the β-ADR system. We hypothesize that, in contrast to other commonly used inotropes, probenecid functions through a system separate from that of β-ADR and hence will increase contractility and improve function without damaging the heart. Furthermore, our goal was to evaluate the effect of probenecid on cell death in vitro and its use in vivo as a positive inotrope in a mouse model of ischemic cardiomyopathy. Herein, we demonstrate that probenecid induced an influx of Ca<sup>2+</sup> similar to isoproterenol, but does not induce cell death in vitro. Through a series of in vivo experiments we also demonstrate that probenecid can be used at various time points and with various methods of administration in vivo in mice with myocardial ischemia, resulting in improved contractility and no significant difference in infarct size. In conclusion, we provide novel data that probenecid, through its activity on cellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels, induces an inotropic effect without causing or exacerbating injury. This discovery may be translatable if this mechanism is preserved in man.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The current management of acute decompensated heart failure is based on afterload reduction and increasing myocardial contractility.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1074248412469299">1</xref>
</sup> The therapies for the former are well established and include direct and indirect vasodilators; unfortunately, the therapeutic options available for the latter are limited to digoxin and sympathomimetics (ie, dopamine, dobutamine, and milrinone).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1074248412469299">2</xref>
</sup> The sympathomimetic drugs share the common end point of increasing cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) production in the cardiomyocyte (either directly through β-adrenergic [β-ADR] stimulation or indirectly via phosphodiesterase inhibition [PDI]) and have repeatedly been shown to be associated with poor outcomes.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1074248412469299">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1074248412469299">4</xref>
</sup> Several mechanisms have been shown to be related to the deleterious outcomes associated with these medications including arrhythmias,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1074248412469299">5</xref>
</sup> stimulation of apoptotic signaling,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1074248412469299">6</xref>
</sup> and increased myocardial energetic demand.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1074248412469299">7</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>We have recently published that probenecid has positive inotropic properties which were previously not recognized.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1074248412469299">8</xref>
</sup> Our previous experiments demonstrated that treatment with probenecid in isolated myocytes resulted in an increase in fractional shortening, while in Langendorff perfused hearts and in healthy wild-type mice in vivo, the result was an increase in contractility. However, these experiments did not use probenecid as a potential therapy for heart failure or investigate its use in ischemically damaged animals. This critically important step is needed as probenecid is an Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drug used for the treatment of gout for decades<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1074248412469299">9</xref>
</sup> and as adjuvant therapy for use with certain antibiotics<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1074248412469299">10</xref>
</sup> and antivirals.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1074248412469299">11</xref>
</sup> It also has been used safely for over 50 years with a very limited adverse effect profile.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1074248412469299">12</xref>
</sup> Several years ago, Bang et al<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1074248412469299">13</xref>
</sup> found that it is also a potent agonist of the transient receptor potential vanilloid 2 (TRPV2) channel. More recently, we have shown that TRPV2 is expressed in the murine heart and, when activated with probenecid, increases cytosolic calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) concentration which results in a positive inotropic response both in vitro and in vivo.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1074248412469299">8</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Our previous work further demonstrated that probenecid does not have significant malignant electrophysiologic properties (ie, no arrhythmias were noted) unlike other adrenergic drugs. Furthermore, as other positive inotropes are known to be cell injurious, we examined the potential cytotoxic/apoptotic properties of probenecid for its use as a positive inotrope in a mouse model of ischemic heart disease. Hence, we hypothesized that probenecid functions through a separate mechanism than conventionally used inotropes and that it will increase contractility and improve heart function after ischemia without decreasing cell survival or increasing apoptosis. We tested this in vitro using the HL-1 cardiac cell line in addition to a well-established and clinically relevant mouse model of ischemia/reperfusion (I/R)<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1074248412469299">14</xref>
</sup> and monitored cardiac function via echocardiography.<sup>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section3-1074248412469299">
<title>Imaging and Measurement of Ca<sup>2+</sup> Fluorescence</title>
<p>Briefly, the HL-1 cells were seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 1 × 10<sup>4</sup> cells/well and allowed to grow overnight in Claycomb media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 U/mL penicillin/streptomycin, and 2 mmol/L L-glutamine. Dissociated HL-1 cells were plated on glass coverslips (GG-25-polylysine #1, Neuvitro, California) placed inside each well of 6-well plates (BD Falcon; BD Falcon; Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania). Acquisition of images was done at 40 to 65 Hz using LSM 510 Meta system equipped with the inverted Axiovert 200 M BP (Carl Zeiss Microscopy, LLC, Thornwood, New York) and LSM5 Software. Image acquisition was done with Plan-Apochromat 40×/water with frame size of 512 (X) and 256 (Y). To optimize the speed of acquisition, the acquisition area was limited to a few cells. The cells were loaded with the Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator dye FLUO4-AM (Molecular Probes, Life Technologies, Carlsbad, California) diluted in Tyrode solution (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, Missouri) to a final concentration of 1 µmol/L for 20 minutes at 37°C and then washed twice for 5 minutes in Tyrode solution. Coverslips with adherent HL-1 cells preloaded with dye were placed in the recording chamber that was mounted on an inverted microscope and subsequently bathed in Tyrode solution before perfusion of probenecid. After focusing and taking baseline images, the cells were perfused with probenecid (10<sup>−8</sup>-10<sup>−4</sup> mol/L in different experiments) at a rate of 0.5 mL/15 s. For these experiments, image exposure time was 5 milliseconds with a camera on-chip multiplication gain of 500 to 600, and there were 700 cycles for each run of the different concentrations. The 488-nm line of a multiline argon laser excited FLUO-4 and an electronic shutter-controlled cell exposure to the laser. Offline image processing was performed with LSM5 software and statistical analyses on the data were done using MS Excel (Microsoft, Redmond, Washington) and SAS 9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, North Carolina).</p>
<p>Average fluorescence values for before perfusion (F<sub>0</sub>) and after perfusion (F) were determined manually after acquisition of images from the saved LSM files. Circular areas within the cytosol of each cell of the saved images over the entire duration of respective experiments were used to determine changes in fluorescence before and after the perfusion. </p>
<p>Normalized fluorescence, determined as a quotient of <italic>F</italic>/<italic>F</italic>
<sub>0</sub>, was used as a variable to compare the relative changes in fluorescence at different incremental concentrations during statistical analyses. Maximal likelihood estimates of the dependent variable (log [<italic>F</italic>/<italic>F</italic>
<sub>0</sub>]) were determined as a function of concentration of the probenecid (log [probenecid], M) dose using “proc mixed modeling” with repeated measures in SAS. A dose–response relationship was graphed using linear regression plot of the model.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1074248412469299">
<title>Cell Viability Assays</title>
<p>Cell viability was assessed using the ApoTox-Glo Triplex Assay (Promega, Madison, Wisconsin) as per the manufacturer’s instructions. The HL-1 cells were obtained as described above. In order to approximate the expected serum concentration of both probenecid (500 mg orally) and isoproterenol (10 mcg/min intravenously) at standard therapeutic doses, we treated the cells with a range of probenecid from 10<sup>−4</sup> to 10<sup>−8</sup> mol/L and of isoproterenol of 10<sup>−4</sup> and 10<sup>−5</sup> mol/L.</p>
<p>The cells were treated with indicated doses of probenecid or isoproterenol in supplemented growth media at 100 μL total volume and allowed to incubate for 4, 8, or 24 hours. The glycine phenylalanine amino-fluoro-coumarin (GF-AFC) viability reagent was then added to ApoTox-Glo Assay Buffer at a ratio of 10 μL GF-AFC to 2.0mL Assay buffer and 20 μL of this mixture was added to each well. The cells were incubated at 37°C for 30 minutes and fluorescence was measured at 400 nm (ex)/505 nm (em) and the data were normalized to untreated control cells.</p>
<p>Water soluble probenecid (Molecular Probes, Life Technologies, Grand Island, New York) was used for all of the experiments. </p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1074248412469299">
<title>Animals</title>
<p>All animal procedures were performed with the approval of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Cincinnati and in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (NIH, revised 1996). All mice (C57BL6J, Jackson laboratories, Bar Harbor, Maine) were males at 12 to 16 weeks of age.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1074248412469299">
<title>Detection of Cell Death</title>
<p>Hearts were obtained from mice which were treated with probenecid or sugar water (control) under various conditions. There were 4 groups of mice for these experiments, including control (n = 4), probenecid-treated water (n = 4), control after I/R injury (n = 4), and probenecid-treated water after I/R injury (n = 4). The hearts were removed, rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), fixed with 3.7% buffered formaldehyde (after 30 minutes the buffer was changed), and dehydrated (hearts were placed in 70% ethanol after 18-24 hours). The samples were taken to the Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Department of Pathology Research Core (Cincinnati, Ohio) where they were embedded in paraffin, sectioned into thicknesses of 6 μm, each 10 μm apart, and 2 heart sections were placed onto each slide. The slides were prepared using an in situ apoptosis detection kit (CardioTACS; Trevigen, Gaithersburg, Maryland), which stains by terminal deoxynucleotide transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick end labeling, according to the manufacturer’s instructions. After staining, the slides were placed on a microscope (Olympus 1X71: Olympus, Melville, New York) and the number of apoptotic cells was counted by 2 separate and blinded readers in 5 fields of view for each heart section. The total number of cells was also determined for the same field, and the apoptotic cells were calculated to be a percentage of the total cells. These values were then averaged for each group, probenecid and control mice.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1074248412469299">
<title>Ischemia/Reperfusion Methods</title>
<p>The I/R studies were performed as previously described.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1074248412469299">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1074248412469299">15</xref>
</sup> Briefly, mice were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital and the heart was exposed through a left thoracotomy at the level of the fourth intercostal space. The mice were intubated and placed on a miniventilator (Harvard apparatus, Holliston, Massachusetts). A loop occluder was placed around the left anterior descending artery and tightened, occluding it for either 30 minutes (small infarct) or 45 minutes (larger infarct). After surgery, the thorocotomy was sutured in layers, and the animal was allowed to recover.</p>
<p>All mice had echocardiographic measurements as described after 24 hours post-IR to determine the severity of the injury in vivo. </p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1074248412469299">
<title>Echocardiography Methods</title>
<p>All echocardiographic studies were performed as previously described.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1074248412469299">8</xref>
</sup> Briefly, mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and placed on the heated stage of the Vevo 2100. Parasternal long axis and short axis images were recorded and then analyzed on a separate work station with VevoStrain software (Vevo 2100, v1.1.1 B1455, Visualsonic, Toronto, Canada).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1074248412469299">
<title>Ischemia/Reperfusion Followed by Probenecid Bolus</title>
<p>The I/R studies were performed as described above with 45 minutes of ischemia. Echocardiography was performed at 24 hours post-I/R and weekly thereafter. There were 4 groups of mice, saline and probenecid with subgroups of mice with a post-I/R ejection fraction (EF) of 50% to 60% (n = 5 for saline and n = 6 for probenecid) or those with a post I/R EF of 40% to 50% (n = 6 for saline and n = 6 for probenecid). The probenecid mice were treated with an intraperitoneal bolus of 100 μL (100 mg/kg) while the saline groups only received 100 μL of saline intraperitoneally. The mice were imaged at 5-minute intervals for a total of 30 minutes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1074248412469299">
<title>Ischemia/Reperfusion Followed by Oral Probenecid</title>
<p>The I/R studies were performed as described above with 45 minutes of ischemia and echocardiography was performed at 24 hours post-I/R and weekly thereafter for 4 weeks. After 24 hours, the mice were randomized to probenecid-treated water or untreated water cages. The probenecid was dissolved in water containing 5% sucrose at a concentration of 0.5 μg/mL. The water was changed twice a week and the volume was measured before and after the consumption to determine the approximate dose. The mice were housed 2 to a cage for more accurate assessment of the total dose administered.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1074248412469299">
<title>Probenecid Bolus Followed by Ischemia/Reperfusion</title>
<p>Either saline or probenecid (100mg/kg) were administered intravenously 15 minutes prior to a 45-minute coronary occlusion (ie, at the time of maximal increase in contractility). At 24 hours post-I/R, echocardiography was performed and the hearts were subsequently removed for determination of infarct size via triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TCC) staining and normalized to the area at risk region.<sup>

<title>Bolus Probenecid Improves Function Acutely in Ischemically Damaged Hearts</title>
<p>After I/R injury, probenecid administered intraperitoneally caused a statistically significant increase in EF in all treated mice. Interestingly, treatment with probenecid was able to more strongly enhance function in mice that display a lower initial EF, as indicated by the strong correlation between the probenecid-induced increase in EF and initial EF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1074248412469299">Figure 3A</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We have previously demonstrated that probenecid, an FDA-approved drug, has inotropic properties which went unrecognized for decades.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1074248412469299">8</xref>
</sup> Those experiments demonstrated that probenecid increased cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels resulting in increased contractility independent of β-ADR signaling. The lack of stimulation of the β-ADR pathway initiated the research presented herein, as ADR stimulation has been previously shown to increase myocardial metabolic demand,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1074248412469299">19</xref>
</sup> stimulate apoptotic pathways,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1074248412469299">20</xref>
</sup> and cause myocyte hypertrophy.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1074248412469299">17</xref>
</sup> This has been reflected in numerous clinical trials involving traditional β1-agonists (dobutamine, dopamine)<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1074248412469299">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1074248412469299">22</xref>
</sup> as well as PDIs (ie, milrinone)<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1074248412469299">23</xref>
</sup> which have found that even as symptoms and hemodynamic parameters improve, the short- and long-term mortality of the patients exposed to these drugs increases. </p>
<p>Although theoretically interesting, we were still unsure of the potential clinical implications of these findings, as a response in vitro and in healthy mice may not correlate with the effect after ischemic event. Hence, this work addresses 2 critical issues (1) the lack of cell death associated with the improved inotropic response and (2) the positive inotropic effect of probenecid in an ischemically damaged heart. Regarding the former, we calculated the expected serum concentration of both probenecid and isoproterenol under a standard therapeutic regimen and applied the dose to isolated cells and demonstrated a lack of toxicity for probenecid and confirmed the multiple studies that have previously proven cytotoxicity for isoproterenol.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1074248412469299">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1074248412469299">7</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Regarding the latter, we initially used a clinically relevant model of ischemic heart disease in which ischemia is caused for a short period of time and subsequently the vessel is opened.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1074248412469299">15</xref>
</sup> This pathophysiology is not dissimilar to the common clinical course of an acute myocardial infarction in which revascularization is accomplished in a short period of time and the subsequent ischemic damage is minor.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1074248412469299">24</xref>
</sup> In our model, we were able to detect small decreases in systolic function due to the high-frequency probe used<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1074248412469299">25</xref>
</sup> which permitted us to dichotomously divide the mice between mild damage (EF of 50%-60%) and moderate damage (EF of 40%-50%). Our finding that probenecid not only increases contractility as previously described but also that the increase is inversely correlated with postischemic EF (the moderately damaged group, EF of 40% to 50%, showed a larger increase in EF) is a crucial finding which lends credence to the translational potential of this drug for use in patients with moderate systolic dysfunction. </p>
<p>The mechanism of action of probenecid in the undamaged/nonischemic myocyte was reported by our group previously,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1074248412469299">8</xref>
</sup> and we are currently pursuing the effect of TRPV2 channels as modulators of contractility in response to stressors (such as ischemia). There is some evidence outside of the cardiovascular system which describes the TRPV2 channels as being mostly located in the intracellular compartment of uroepithelial cells,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1074248412469299">26</xref>
</sup> pancreatic cells,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1074248412469299">27</xref>
</sup> and neuroendocrine cells.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1074248412469299">28</xref>
</sup> In these studies, they have been found to be activated and/or to translocate to the cell membrane after stretch stimulation. Although this study did not seek to address the role of TRPV2 in this process, our results demonstrate that the effect of probenecid on the heart is enhanced in the ischemically damaged myocardium. This is consistent with previous studies demonstrating that TRPV2 translocation and activation are stress mediated (ie, via stretch or increased cAMP)<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1074248412469299">29</xref>

</sup> and which may be a compensatory mechanism after injury.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1074248412469299">33</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>As a further evidence for the use of probenecid as a potential therapeutic agent in I/R, we also demonstrated that treatment with oral probenecid decreases deterioration of cardiac function (as evidenced by less ventricular dilation and improved systolic function) in comparison to sham-treated mice. The dose required (and self-administered via water) for the effect was about 200 mg/kg administered orally, clearly higher than the commonly used human dose of 500 mg orally twice daily (about 15 mg/kg for a 70 kg patient) and did not cause any noticeable adverse effects. Although this does not imply that such a high dose would be necessary in the treatment of patients with heart failure, it does suggest that very high doses do not appear to pose a substantial risk in an ischemically damaged mouse. Clearly, further studies with very careful dosing in other animal species would be required before we can propose the use of this drug in humans.</p>
<p>The second critical finding of this study was the lack of cellular damage that probenecid caused both in vivo and in vitro. This is a dramatic finding as the vast majority of the clinically available inotropes have been found to increase mortality<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1074248412469299">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1074248412469299">4</xref>
</sup> and stimulate cardiotoxic pathways<sup>

</sup> resulting in increased infarct size<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1074248412469299">34</xref>
</sup> and apoptosis.<sup>

</sup> However, even high-dose therapy did not result in significant cell death (compared to untreated water) in vivo after 2 weeks of therapy or in vitro at several different time points and at substantially higher concentrations than would be achieved when administered clinically. This finding, if confirmed in other models and species, may be potentially important, as only digoxin can be used as a positive inotrope over prolonged periods of time orally, though it requires tight monitoring as it has a very narrow therapeutic window. This is in stark contrast to probenecid that has a very positive safety profile over decades and as we have shown is safe in a murine model even when administered at very high doses.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In summary, we present the next step in a translational process that began with the interesting finding that probenecid is a positive inotropic drug. We present data that it improves function following I/R injury and does not induce an apoptotic response in vivo or in vitro. These findings, together with our previous work documenting a β-ADR-independent mechanism for probenecid and our ongoing work in larger animals, may have a future impact on how we treat heart failure in humans.</p>
