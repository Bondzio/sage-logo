<p>This case disrupts some of the prevalent myths about families from low-income and poor households held by educators. Recognizing the inherent tensions, this case demonstrates the importance of creating equitable and inclusive learning environments. We presented some of the challenges faced by Marcus, a progressive principal, as he attempts to challenge the myths about low-income and poor families held by his teaching staff to create a positive and inclusive learning environment where all students can learn.</p>

<title>Case Narrative</title>
<p>Marcus is a principal with a reputation for taking underperforming schools in poor regions of Toronto and turning them into inviting centers for community learning. This year, Marcus has been transferred to Majestic Elementary School located in another of Toronto’s low-income neighborhoods. The community is a rich blend of ethnically, racially, linguistically, and religious immigrant families. The dominant racial groups are African Canadians (mainly from the Caribbean and Somalia), Filipinos, South Asians mainly from Pakistan and India, and some Portuguese. There are many religions represented in the community (Christian, Muslim, Tagalog, Hindu, and Sikh). Well over 50 different languages are spoken in Majestic Elementary School. Although the majority of students are born in Canada, many present as ESL (English as a Second Language) students because at home, they primarily speak in their first language as their parents often lack the skills necessary to support the development of their children’s English literacy skills. Sixty percent of the parents have not graduated from high school. The average income in the community is Can$17,000 per year. The community center and the school are important places in the community. The community center provides information for newcomers to the neighborhood, and many services that the families access such as job postings and child care services. It is also a place where many conversations take place about things that are happening in the community. The parents see the school as important, particularly for “socializing” their children into Canadian Society and learning English. Parents participate in events at the school and the community to the best of their ability. In fact, a group of parents prior to Marcus’s arrival had approached the school about ways that they might be more involved in the life of the school, such as lunch, classroom, and library volunteers, and had offered to start a “culture club” in which the teachers could learn more about the rich histories and cultures of the students. The parents were never taken up on their offers by the previous administration. A few teachers came forward, but with lack of support from the main office, nothing happened. The lack of communication between the school and the parents was expressed by the same members of the community at the last meeting at the community center.</p>
<p>During Marcus’s interview for the position, he was informed that the school was not seen as a desirable place to teach, and teachers working at the school could be seen feverishly scanning the transfer forms each year to find work in another school as a way out. There were only three teachers who had been at the school for 5 years or more; of the three, one had been at the school for 15 years. Most of the teachers had been at the school for 3 years or less. As he prepared for his first staff meeting, he thought about the visits he had made to the neighborhood during the summer to get a firsthand look at the community. Walking through the school, he took note of any signs of community activities. He wanted to get some kind of understanding about his students and community. He knew from previous experience that he needed to understand the local community to support the teaching staff.</p>
<p>As the teachers came in for the first staff meeting, they all looked expectantly at Marcus. He welcomed them back and said a few things about working together to build a strong and supportive community in the school. He told the teachers he wanted to hear their ideas about their professional learning community. The teachers were not verbally responsive, but exchanged telling glances from time to time. The silence was palpable. As the teachers did not respond, Marcus continued,
<disp-quote>
<p>We need to do an equity audit. We need to look at all of our practices from top to bottom in the school, particularly around the economic and social issues affecting our students. We need to identify practices that support our students and community and look for practices that we think are not supportive. The School Improvement Team made up of the vice principal, teachers, and myself will do this. We’ll look at our relationship with parents and students, and how the office functions in dealing with the community as a whole. We will also look at the way that we do school improvement planning, the way that we deal with issues of difference, the way that we deal with communication between the school and home, and how the School Council functions. Everything we look at will be considered from an equity and inclusion perspective.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>At this point, Jack, the teacher who had been at the school for 15 years, spoke up,
<disp-quote>
<p>Ah, Marcus, there are just a few problems with your plan. First, the parents aren’t interested in schooling. We don’t really have a school council and the reason we don’t is that the parents aren’t interested in coming to the meetings. So I guess the next problem is that we don’t really have a lot of dealings with parents. And I don’t know about anyone else but I really don’t have the time or energy to do much more than teach my class. I do not have time to chase disinterested parents.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Marcus replied,
<disp-quote>
<p>I appreciate your input, Jack, and I think this is a good place to start in terms of thinking about our audit plan, but keep in mind that because parents are from a low-income community, it does not mean they are disinterested in their child’s education. As a school community, it is our responsibility to change the way we operate and make it more inviting for parents and students. Maybe we need to think about how we can create a structure that would work for the parents in our community. As we discuss how we can get the parents involved at Majestic Elementary School we should consider ways that we can be flexible as many parents have multiple jobs, work evenings, and take public transportation, which makes it difficult for them to attend parents’ night as it is presently structured. As much as we are inclined to buy into stereotypes about low-income and poor families, the research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1555458913487031">Calabrese Barton, Drake, Gustavo Perez, St. Louis, &amp; George, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1555458913487031">Lawson, 2003</xref>] points to the fact that they have positive attitudes about the education of their children and are no less interested than parents who are from wealthy families. I am hoping we can work collaboratively to remove some of the barriers to their involvement.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Now it was Cora’s turn to speak. Before coming to the school 3 years ago, Cora was a special education resource teacher (SERT) for 5 years at another school within the same board. “Marcus, I think you’re not really getting Jack’s message.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean, Cora?”</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Look, Marcus, we all know you came from another school in a low-income neighborhood and you think that this school is similar to your previous school but face it—this place is different. I didn’t believe it either when I first got here but you will figure it out after the fifth note you send home asking parents to come to parent–teacher meetings. They’re just not that into us.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>“No, look, I just meant to say we need to think about what we have done in the past and think about what worked and what didn’t work and think about the kind of school we want.”</p>
<p>Finally, Joan who has been at the school for 7 years and who was the school union steward spoke,
<disp-quote>
<p>I thought our job was to teach the curriculum and make sure our kids do well on the tests. After all, that seems to be the only thing the Board really cares about. I mean last year, the team they sent here to help us with our instructional planning was here because we didn’t do so well on the provincial tests. And it does make sense, after all, because we are in the business of education. I mean we’re not social workers.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Marcus responded,
<disp-quote>
<p>Right, Joan, we need to be concerned about what our students are learning. But there’s lots of research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1555458913487031">Fielding, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1555458913487031">McMahon &amp; Portelli, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1555458913487031">Yazzie-Mintz, 2007</xref>] available to show that kids do better in school when they are engaged, when they feel they are valued and we need to show students at Majestic Elementary we value them and their families.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>“I think Jack’s right,” Vera, the English teacher, chimed in. “We’ve already got so much to do. I don’t think I’ve got time for all this extra stuff.”</p>
<p>Marcus replied,
<disp-quote>
<p>I appreciate all of your concerns and I am listening. I want you to know that my intention is not to “add” anything to your work but rather to reflect on what it is that you do and perhaps do it in a different way. For now I’d just like to invite anyone who wants to be part of the School Improvement Team to get in touch with either me or Elaine, the vice principal.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Five weeks after the start of school, Marcus and Elaine, the vice principal, met to talk about the School Improvement Team. Only one teacher had volunteered to participate, and they were already facing a major issue. A number of the children in the Grade 4 class had labeled one of the boys “gay” because he was wearing “girl’s shoes.” It turned out that the family did not have much money and the boy was indeed wearing hand-me-downs from his sister. Vera, the Grade 4 teacher, decided to handle the situation as a case of bullying, but never addressed the homophobic and classist comments. At that week’s staff meeting, Marcus decided to use this as a learning opportunity. He opened the discussion by asking the question, “What else might we have done as a school community to address the underlying issues?”</p>
<p>Conversation turned to the fact that the student came from a poor family, and the teachers assumed that the parents did not care what kind of clothes the student wore and that it was inappropriate to send their son to school in girl’s shoes; the parents were setting their son up to be bullied. Marcus tried very hard to point the conversation in other directions, but the comments were generally about the need to educate poor families about Canadian values such as working hard, not being lazy, and getting a job so that their children can wear “appropriate” clothing. One of the teachers suggested that Marcus should contact local social services to tell them about what had happened at the school and ask them to intervene with the family or at least inform the family that they could receive clothing from the Good Will or Salvation Army.</p>
<p>Marcus was becoming more and more concerned. How was he going to address issues of poverty, equity, and inclusion in this school where the teachers seemed to be oblivious to the issues and harbored unexamined biases and prejudices? Part of Marcus’s success in his previous school could be attributed to having at least a handful of teachers who were open to changing how the school operated and were willing to explore different kinds of inclusive practices. Now to top it off, he had just received the memo from the Board informing all principals that they needed to be implementing the provincial equity policy and that the superintendent responsible for equity would be in touch with the school soon to discuss the school plans. Marcus was committed to doing equity work, but how was he going to make this happen in the environment he had inherited? And how was he going to raise the teachers’ level of consciousness around equity and inclusion?</p>

<title>Teaching Notes</title>
<p>This case study can be used as a teaching tool in a number of ways. Those delivering the case study can use the case to (a) motivate participants to consider their own values and beliefs about people who live in poverty; (b) examine existing assumptions and stereotypes that act as barriers for an equitable and inclusive education for some; (c) review current literature and academic research on poverty, and inclusive education and inherent tensions; (d) structure further investigation by considering practical exercises that involve school improvement from an equity perspective; and (e) tease out what is meant by inclusive and equity education.</p>
<p>As a tool, the case can be utilized for class discussion, group work, and various role-playing scenarios for those preparing for leadership, particularly in diverse contexts, and to guide school improvement discussions in an effort to challenge current myths about poverty and to work toward more equitable and inclusive schooling.</p>

<title>Staff Meeting Enactment</title>
<p>Role-playing is a very effective teaching method. It allows individuals to take on roles that they might otherwise not encounter in their personal lives. By taking on “out of character” roles, the individual is provided with an opportunity to more authentically experience and consider the issue being enacted. This particular case study offers a great opportunity for role-playing. For example, students in a class can reenact the first staff meeting, and can be assigned the various main roles (below) with the remaining students acting as other teachers in the meeting or as observers to the enactment.</p>
<list id="list3-1555458913487031" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>Marcus, the principal</p></list-item>

<list-item><p>Cora, SERT</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Ana, librarian</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Joan, teacher and union steward</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Vera, English teacher</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Elaine, the vice principal</p></list-item></list>
<p>Note: In these roles, students might become uncomfortable, so we suggest discussing ahead of time that the issues raised might be emotionally charged and possibly lay out some ground rules for maintaining a safe space in the classroom such as,</p>
<list id="list4-1555458913487031" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Speak only your truth.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Stick to the issue, don’t become personal.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Be respectful in disagreeing.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Be attentive and be good listeners.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>People have the right to pass.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Draw on research where possible to support arguments and avoid generalizations of groups.</p></list-item></list>
<p>Once the role-playing has ceased, actors can be asked how they felt about the role they played. The role-play can then take the form of forum theater<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1555458913487031">1</xref></sup> where the staff meeting is reenacted again with others in the audience stopping the acting at critical points and making suggestions to the actors on how they might react differently in a situation to change the conversation, build awareness, and raise critical consciousness around issues of poverty, equity, and inclusion. This is a great way to demonstrate negotiating in conversation or demonstrating who has power and how to handle difficult situations.</p>
<p>An alternative role-play scenario might be the staff meeting where Marcus discussed the incident where the male student came to school wearing girl’s shoes or how Marcus might approach the next staff meeting (and subsequently, how the teaching staff might react).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1555458913487031">
<title>Creating a School Improvement Plan</title>
<p>Almost all schools and school districts have some formal process for creating a school improvement plan and a board improvement plan. Students can be asked to bring their schools’ or districts’ improvement plans (more likely it will be the school’s improvement plan as most teachers and school leaders are more aware of their school’s improvement plan) and the necessary guidelines (rules, regulations, policies, forms, manual, etc.,) used in the creation of their school’s improvement plan, and consider how issues at Majestic Elementary School might inform that discussion. During class time, students can work in groups of four to five to create a school improvement plan that has equity and inclusive education at the forefront.</p>
