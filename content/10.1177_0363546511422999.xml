<abstract>
<p><bold>Background</bold>: Most people have not returned to their preinjury level of sports participation at 12 months after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction surgery. Twelve months’ follow-up may be too early to assess return-to-sport outcomes accurately.</p>
<p><bold>Purpose</bold>: This study was undertaken to evaluate the medium-term return-to-sport outcomes after ACL reconstruction surgery.</p>
<p><bold>Study Design</bold>: Case series; Level of evidence, 3.</p>
<p><bold>Methods</bold>: A self-report questionnaire was used to collect data at 2 to 7 years after ACL reconstruction surgery regarding preinjury sports participation, postoperative sports participation, and subjective knee function. The main inclusion criteria were participation in regular sports activity before injury and the attendance at routine surgical follow-up appointments.</p>
<p><bold>Results</bold>: A total of 314 participants (mean age, 32.5 ± 10.2 years) were included at a mean 39.6 ± 13.8 months after ACL reconstruction surgery. At follow-up, 45% were playing sport at their preinjury level and 29% were playing competitive sport. Ninety-three percent of the study sample had attempted sport at some time after their ACL reconstruction surgery. Those who had not attempted their preinjury level of sport by 12 months after surgery were just as likely to have returned to preinjury level by 39 months after surgery as those who had played sport by 12 months (risk ratio, 1.1; 95% confidence interval, 0.76-1.6).</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion</bold>: Less than 50% of the study sample had returned to playing sport at their preinjury level or returned to participating in competitive sport when surveyed at 2 to 7 years after ACL reconstruction surgery. Return to the preinjury level of sport at 12 months after surgery was not predictive of participation at the preinjury level in the medium term, which suggests that people who return to sport within 12 months may not maintain their sports participation.</p>

<body>
<p>The desire to return to the preinjury level of sports participation, particularly in sports involving cutting, pivoting, and jumping maneuvers, is a major indication for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction surgery in athletes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0363546511422999">25</xref></sup> Thus, information regarding the return-to-sport outcomes after ACL reconstruction surgery is important. Previously it has been argued that the rate of return to the preinjury (as opposed to presurgery) level of sports participation should be used as a measure of the success of ACL reconstruction surgery in terms of return-to-sport outcome.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546511422999">11</xref></sup> Of even greater relevance to an athletic population may be the rate of return to competitive-level sports participation.</p>
<p>Previous work by Ardern et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546511422999">4</xref></sup> has shown the rate of return to competitive sport in a cohort of 503 patients at 12 months after ACL reconstruction was 33%. Other studies have reported a rate of return to competitive sport after ACL reconstruction of between 49% and 92%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546511422999">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546511422999">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546511422999">18</xref></sup> at a mean 13 months after surgery. It is possible that differences in the operational definition of return to competitive sport may account for the discrepancy in return-to-sport rate. In the study by Ardern et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546511422999">4</xref></sup> return to competitive sport was defined as returning to the same level of the same sport played before injury. It is unclear whether this definition was used in other studies reporting on return to competitive sport. Therefore, given the differences in operational definition of return-to-sport outcomes, and the variation in return-to-sport rates reported in previous literature, the relatively low rate of return to competitive sport suggests it is possible that 12 months after surgery may be too early to assess return-to-sport outcomes accurately.</p>
<p>The reasons why patients do not return to their preinjury level of sports participation postoperatively are not well understood. It is recognized that there are factors other than physical function implicated in successful return to sport.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546511422999">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546511422999">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546511422999">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0363546511422999">26</xref></sup> Evaluating return-to-sport outcomes at a later follow-up time provides an opportunity to examine some of the reasons why sports participation after surgery may be reduced or even ceased.</p>
<p>Previous research has shown somewhat contradictory results regarding gender differences in return-to-sport outcomes after ACL reconstruction surgery. Some studies have reported that male patients returned to sport earlier than females after surgery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546511422999">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546511422999">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0363546511422999">24</xref></sup> However, 1 study has shown similar mean activity levels between male and female athletes at up to 5 years after ACL reconstruction surgery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0363546511422999">23</xref></sup> Therefore, it remains unclear whether female athletes return to sport in equal numbers as their male counterparts in the medium term after surgery.</p>
<p>Therefore, the primary aim of this study was to determine the medium-term return-to-sport outcomes after ACL reconstruction surgery. Specifically, the rate of return to the preinjury level of participation in the main preinjury sport was evaluated, and the data were examined for gender differences in return-to-sport outcomes. The secondary aim of this study was to explore the reasons why sports participation was altered or ceased after ACL reconstruction surgery and rehabilitation.</p>

<title>Research Design</title>
<p>This study received ethical approval before commencement. A cross-sectional study design was used to examine the medium-term return-to-sport outcomes after ACL reconstruction surgery.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0363546511422999">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>To be eligible for inclusion in this study, patients must have undergone primary ACL reconstruction surgery with a hamstring graft at least 2 years before participating in the study, received clearance from the treating orthopaedic surgeon to return to sport postoperatively, attended a routine clinical follow-up appointment with the surgeon at approximately 12 months after surgery, been participating in sport at least twice per week before their ACL reconstruction surgery, and been able to complete a written survey in English. All participants had a single-incision, arthroscopically assisted hamstring ACL reconstruction. All surgical procedures were performed by the same orthopaedic surgeon between May 2003 and July 2008. During this time, the surgeon performed 1201 primary autologous hamstring ACL reconstructions. From the initial group of 1201 patients, there were 684 patients identified who met the inclusion criterion of regular preinjury sports participation (666 of these patients could be contacted). Further, there were 533 (of the 666 who met the first inclusion criterion) who met the second inclusion criterion of attending a routine surgical review at 12 months after ACL reconstruction surgery and who could be contacted. At this review, baseline data regarding preoperative and postoperative sports participation as well as clinical data regarding knee function were collected by a physical therapist with extensive experience in orthopaedic outcome evaluation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0363546511422999">
<title>Postoperative Rehabilitation Protocol</title>
<p>Patients were permitted to bear weight from the first postoperative day. Closed kinetic chain quadriceps strengthening exercises were permitted for the first 3 postoperative months in addition to exercises emphasizing the recovery of full knee range of motion, in particular extension. Straight-line jogging was permitted at 12 weeks after surgery, progressing to sport-specific drills at 16 weeks. Return to full competitive sports participation was usually permitted at 9 months as long as a full postoperative rehabilitation program had been completed, and the patient had achieved full knee range of motion, adequate knee stability, and functional quadriceps control, and there was no effusion. All patients were referred by the surgeon to postoperative private physical therapy. Supervised postoperative rehabilitation was conducted by the physical therapist according to the surgeon’s guidelines for exercise progression.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0363546511422999">
<title>Procedures</title>
<p>All potential participants were initially contacted via a mobile phone short-message service that directed them to the Web site of our institution and a link to the electronic version of the survey. The electronic survey was constructed and administered using the software program Survey Manager (Australian Survey Research Group, Melbourne, Australia). People who did not respond were contacted by the mobile short-message service and follow-up letters. All participants who received mail contact were sent paper copies of the electronic survey and a reply-paid return envelope.</p>

<sec id="section6-0363546511422999">
<title>Outcome Measures</title>
<sec id="section7-0363546511422999">
<title>Sports Participation</title>
<p>All participants were asked whether they had attempted to play any form of sport since their surgery, whether they had attempted to play their preinjury sport, and whether they had attempted to play competitive sport. All participants were asked about their sports participation at any time since their surgery, and at the time of completing the survey. Participants who had not attempted to play any sport since surgery were asked whether they intended to return to sport in the future. If participants indicated they had changed their level of sports participation (had only attempted practice, played at a lower level than preinjury, or attempted a different sport) or ceased sports participation, they were asked whether this change in participation was because of the function of their operated knee or other reasons.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0363546511422999">
<title>Knee Symptoms and Subjective Knee Function</title>
<p>Participants were asked 7 questions regarding their knee symptoms with responses scored on a 5-point Likert scale.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0363546511422999">21</xref></sup> In addition, item 9 from the International Knee Documentation Committee subjective knee evaluation form (IKDC form) was used to record information regarding knee function in activities of daily living. Participants were also asked to rate their overall knee function on an 11-point scale, with a higher score representing higher function.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0363546511422999">
<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>Descriptive statistics were calculated for all demographic, subjective outcome, and sports participation data. Return-to-sport outcomes were analyzed in 2 ways: sports participation at any time after ACL reconstruction surgery, and sports participation at the time of completing the survey. The rate of return to any sport, the rate of return to the preinjury level of sports participation, and the rate of return to competitive sport were calculated and presented as percentages (with 95% confidence intervals [CIs]). Risk ratios and 95% CIs were calculated to examine the data for gender differences in return-to-sport outcomes. The risk ratio was also calculated for the return-to-sport intention data. Return-to-sport outcomes collected at 12 months after surgery were available for all participants included in this study. These data were compared with the return-to-sport outcomes from the current survey to see if there was an association between playing sport at 12 months after surgery and playing at the medium-term follow-up. All data were analyzed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences version 17 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, Illinois).</p>
<p>An analysis of return-to-sport outcomes by age was also performed. This was to determine whether the return-to-sport rate differed according to age. Age was used as a surrogate indicator of potential lifestyle factors that may influence the likelihood of returning to the preinjury level of sports participation. The hypothesis was that the rate of return to the preinjury level of sports participation would be higher in younger participants as they were likely to have more exposure to opportunities for participation in sport (ie, teams linked to educational institutions). Older participants may have had more limited opportunity to return to their preinjury level of sport because of family, work, or other lifestyle commitments. Four age groups were established for analysis: less than 18 years, 18-25 years, 25-32 years, and older than 32 years. A χ<sup>2</sup> analysis was performed to determine whether age influenced the return-to-sport outcomes.</p>
<p>To determine if there were differences between the group that completed the follow-up survey and the group that did not complete the survey, routine clinical follow-up and return-to-sport outcome data collected by a physical therapist as part of routine surgical follow-up at 12 months after surgery were analyzed. Demographic and clinical outcomes were analyzed using <italic>t</italic> tests and χ<sup>2</sup> tests as appropriate.</p>

<title>Demographic Data</title>
<p>A total of 314 individuals participated in this study—a response rate of 59%. There were 183 male (58%) and 131 female (42%) participants who were a mean 39.6 ± 13.8 months after ACL reconstruction surgery. The mean age was 32.5 ± 10.2 years. The most common sports participants played before their ACL injury were Australian football (26%), netball (21%), basketball (14%), and soccer (12%). Sixty-three percent of participants played competitive sport before their injury, 18% were recreational athletes, 12% played in social competitions, and the remaining 7% were training but not competing in their sport before injury. The median preinjury weekly sports participation (training and/or game) was 6 to 10 hours per week. A summary of the demographic and clinical data obtained at 12 months postoperatively is presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0363546511422999">Table 1</xref>. The group that did not respond to the survey had similar subjective and objective knee function and return-to-sport outcomes at 12 months postoperatively as the group that did respond to the survey. The only differences between the groups were that there were more male patients (<italic>P</italic> = .001) and more patients with knee function classified as IKDC category A (<italic>P</italic> = .01) in the group that did not respond to the follow-up survey.</p>

<p>At the time of follow-up, 208 individuals (66% of 314; 95% CI, 62%-71%) were actively participating in sport (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0363546511422999">Figure 1</xref>). There were 140 individuals (45% of 314; 95% CI, 39%-50%) participating at their preinjury level and 91 individuals (29% of 314; 95% CI, 24%-34%) participating in competitive sport. Of the 196 individuals who played competitive sport before injury, 91 (46% of 196; 95% CI, 40%-53%) had returned to competitive sport. Men were no more likely than women to be playing sport at the time of follow-up (risk ratio, 1.1; 95% CI, 0.8-1.5), or to have returned to their preinjury level of sports participation (risk ratio, 1.0; 95% CI, 0.7-1.3). Participants who were not playing sport at their preinjury level at 12 months were just as likely to be playing sport at an average of 39 months after surgery as participants who were playing sport at their preinjury level at 12 months after surgery (risk ratio, 1.1; 95% CI, 0.76-1.6) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0363546511422999">Table 4</xref>). At the time of follow-up, 64 participants who were playing sport at 12 months after surgery were still playing sport. There were 137 participants who were playing sport at follow-up who were not playing by 12 months after surgery. Conversely, 30 participants who were playing sport at 12 months were not playing at final follow-up, and 73 who were not playing at 12 months after surgery were also not playing sport at final follow-up. The subgroup analysis of return-to-preinjury-level-sport outcomes are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0363546511422999">Table 5</xref>. The rate of return to the preinjury level of sport at final follow-up was significantly influenced by age (χ<sup>2</sup> (3) = 11.2; <italic>P</italic> = .01).

<title>Postoperative Sports Participation Attempt at Any Time After Surgery</title>
<p>A total of 292 individuals (93% of 314; 95% CI, 90%-96%) had attempted some form of sports participation after their ACL reconstruction surgery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0363546511422999">Figure 2</xref>). There were 192 individuals (61% of 314; 95% CI, 56%-66%) who had attempted their preinjury level of sport. For 130 of these participants (41% of 314; 95% CI, 36%-47%), this was at a competitive rather than a recreational level. One hundred individuals (32% of 314; 95% CI, 27%-37%) had either returned to their main sport at a lower level than preinjury, changed sports, or only attempted practice after surgery. Men were no more likely than women to have attempted any form of sport postoperatively (risk ratio, 1.5; 95% CI, 0.9-2.4).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study showed that 93% of individuals had attempted some form of sports participation in the medium term from 2 to 7 years after ACL reconstruction surgery. Most individuals reported good recovery of function, few knee symptoms, and an attempt at some form of sports participation after ACL reconstruction surgery. However, only 41% had attempted competitive sport at some time after surgery. Sixty-one percent had attempted sport at their preinjury level. There remains a discrepancy between recovery of function and the rate of return to the preinjury or competitive level of sports participation. This is similar to previous findings that showed individuals with good postoperative knee function were no more likely than individuals with poor postoperative knee function to have returned to competitive sport at 12 months after ACL reconstruction surgery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546511422999">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>All participants in the current study were active in sport before their ACL injury, and most were participating at a competitive level. At the time of follow-up, only 29% of the whole study cohort (and 46% of people who played competitive sport before injury) were actively playing competitive-level sport. Previous studies have reported a rate of return to competitive sport ranging from 18% to 100%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546511422999">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546511422999">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546511422999">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546511422999">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546511422999">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0363546511422999">22</xref></sup> A recent meta-analysis of these studies demonstrated a pooled rate of return to competitive sport of 44% at a mean of 37 months after ACL reconstruction surgery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546511422999">3</xref></sup> Participants in the current study were followed up at a mean 39 months after surgery. Therefore, the results of this study would appear to be comparable with a synthesis of previous research for both follow-up time and the overall return-to-sport outcomes of those playing competitive sport preinjury.</p>
<p>When compared with the return-to-competitive-sport outcomes at 12 months after ACL reconstruction surgery,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546511422999">4</xref></sup> it would appear that return to competitive sport increases with increasing time after surgery. At 12 months after surgery, 33% of patients had returned to competitive sport, while in the current study, the return-to-competitive-sport rate was 46% at 39 months’ follow-up. This seems to support the notion that 12 months’ follow-up may be too early to accurately evaluate the return-to-sport outcomes after ACL reconstruction. However, of concern to the clinician is the persistence of a relatively low rate of return to competitive sport (&lt;50%), particularly as an athlete’s intention to return to competitive sport is typically a major indication for the athlete undergoing the surgery.</p>
<p>In the current study, those who had not returned to their preinjury level of sports participation at 12 months after surgery were equally as likely to be playing sport at follow-up (mean 39 months) when compared with those who had attempted sport at 12 months. This suggests that for some athletes, sports participation at 12 months is not maintained and that other athletes may still return to sport despite not participating at 12 months.</p>
<p>From the clinician’s perspective, the current study demonstrates that overall, the return-to-sport rate in the medium-term follow-up appears to remain relatively low (&lt;50%) and only somewhat better than the level achieved at 12 months after surgery. Further, an individual patient’s participation at 12 months is not predictive of whether that individual will be participating in the medium term after surgery. This means 12 months is too early to judge the success of ACL reconstruction surgery for an individual patient. It is also worth noting that in this cohort, the younger participants were more likely to have played sport at their preinjury level. One explanation for this may be that younger people have more opportunities to participate in sport via teams linked to educational institutions. However, in the Australian context, where these data were collected, this is less likely as sports participation tends not to be related to educational institutions and the opportunity to participate in sport continues beyond the completion of undergraduate study. Another explanation may be that older participants have more competing interests for their time, and lifestyle factors, employment, and family commitments are a salient influence on the decision to continue playing sport at their preinjury level after surgery.</p>
<p>The reasons why individuals do not return to sport or maintain sports participation after ACL reconstruction surgery have not been well researched. While it was beyond the scope of the current study to comprehensively evaluate the reasons for not returning to sport, participants were asked whether they altered or ceased sports participation because of the function of their operated knee. The current study provided evidence that more than half of the individuals who did not return to their preinjury level of sports participation did so because of the function of their operated knee. Other factors such as lifestyle change or occupational demands may also play a significant role in determining whether an individual continues to participate in sport in the longer term after surgery.</p>
<p>In the current study, we did not find any gender differences in medium-term return-to-sport outcomes for those who were playing sport at the time of follow-up. However, we have recently shown, in the same patient cohort as the current study, that men were significantly more likely than women to have returned to sport by 12 months after ACL reconstruction surgery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546511422999">4</xref></sup> The results of the current study may support Thing’s<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0363546511422999">24</xref></sup> suggestion that female athletes may take longer than males to return to sport, as the gender differences that were apparent at 12 months were not present at the later follow-up.</p>
<p>This study also examined the intentions to return to sport of those participants who had not attempted sport postoperatively. Sixty-two percent of people who had not attempted sport indicated that they were planning to return in the future, and there were no gender differences in return-to-sport intentions. However, it is perhaps less likely that this cohort will return to sport given the increasing time between surgery and follow-up.</p>
<p>The strengths of this study are its focus on medium-term return to competitive sport as a primary outcome in a large cohort, and the preliminary investigation of the reasons why participants had ceased or reduced sports participation postoperatively. A limitation of this study was the response rate of 59%, and it is possible that the participants who completed the survey may have had a different return-to-sport rate than those who did complete the survey. However, this response rate is comparable with other previously published cross-sectional survey studies within the medical literature,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546511422999">5</xref></sup> on knee function and return to sport after surgical intervention or sports injury,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546511422999">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546511422999">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546511422999">14</xref></sup> and above the 50% minimum required to minimize bias effects.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546511422999">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546511422999">20</xref></sup> We also presented extensive clinical data (collected at 12 months postoperatively) comparing the group that did complete the survey with the eligible patients who did not complete the survey. The 12-month data demonstrated that there were minimal demographic, subjective, and clinical differences between the cohort that completed the follow-up survey for the present study, and the group that did not complete the survey. The main difference was that there were a greater proportion of males and patients with knee function classified as IKDC category A who did not complete the survey. Since gender and knee function are not associated with return to sport after reconstructive surgery, these differences between the responder and nonresponder groups may not have contributed to bias in our estimates of return to sport. Overall, the results of the current study are comparable with those of previously published work in this area. Additionally, as the outcome measurement for this study was primarily reliant on self-report, there is the potential that the data presented may be subject to recall bias. However, the outcome measured (principally return to sport) was a discrete event that is subject to limited report bias as participants are aware of when they complete this distinct and typically highly anticipated event. Also, a major part of the current study focused on the measurement of current sports participation, which would be unlikely to be subject to recall bias.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This study demonstrated that 41% of participants had attempted to play competitive sport and 61% had attempted to return to their preinjury level of sports participation after ACL reconstruction surgery. Younger participants were more likely to have returned to their preinjury sports participation than older participants, which may reflect lifestyle factors. At the time of participation in this study, only 29% of the entire study cohort was actively involved in competitive sport, and 45% of people were playing their main preinjury sport at their preinjury level. In addition, most patients reported good postoperative knee function. Individuals who had not attempted competitive sport by 12 months after surgery were just as likely to have returned to competition by 39 months after surgery as those who returned to play by 12 months postoperatively. This suggests that athletes who return to competitive sport by 12 months do not necessarily maintain participation in sport.</p>
