<p>The author, a Calcutta-based independent writer, director and cultural critic, weaves together an elegant study of pan-Asianism, nationalism, cosmopolitanism and friendship, drawn out through the 1902 meeting in Calcutta of two luminaries of Asia: the Bengali poet Rabindranath Tagore and the Japanese art historian and curator Okakura Tenshin. Drawing on intersections from the late Meiji period in Japan and the Swadeshi movement in Bengal, the book does not attempt to deepen the existing hagiography of the iconic, if idealised, friendship between the two figures; its purpose is to outline an intellectual history of their affinities to Asia.</p>
<p>The insightful section on nationalism provides analyses of the characters and contexts in Tagore’s novels; it addresses the Saïdian legacy of <italic>Orientalism</italic> (1978), and traces the origins of <italic>Sahitye Aitihasikata</italic> (<italic>Historicality in Literature</italic>, 1941), the relatively unknown but recorded conversation between Tagore and Bengali writer Buddhadev Bose. The analysis is formative, and the general presentation evokes that quality of <italic>adbhuta rasa</italic>, or wonder, which the author hopes will resonate with the narrative.</p>
<p>Bharucha avoids the simplicity of a ‘compare-and-contrast’ method, as he has intended, and instead allows ideas to shape the narrative with broad strokes, without feeling the necessity to make constant rearrangements ‘in the interests of equally-balanced reportage’ (p. xxii). The reader encounters long spells where Okakura takes the spotlight, and then Tagore, long-waiting in the wings of the book, makes his entrance. The author draws a metaphor from composition in Indian classical music to explain his structural form, where, towards the book’s end, there is <italic>jugalbandhi</italic>, a ‘playful contest of skills’ (p. xxii).</p>
<p>The book compels reflection on Asia ‘through the filter of shattered ideals’ (p. xxii), particularly its conflicting modernities at the opening of the 20th century, turning later to the devastation of Hiroshima and the Second World War. Underlying these apparently uncomplicated affinities are ‘unspoken dissonances and tensions relating to war and xenophobia, cultural superiority and racism, one Asia over another’ (p. xxiii). As the book’s very title suggests, <italic>Another Asia</italic> will always conceal an other to itself: ‘the idea of Asia’ is full with paradoxes, ‘both in its conflicting epistemologies and in its actual articulations of cultural theory and practice’ (p. xx), the various subtler ‘Orientalist tropes that continue to haunt readings of Asia today’ (p. 13).</p>
<p>Japanese imperialism, the competing Asian nationalisms of the late 19th century and the repercussions of the Sino–Japanese War of 1894–5 are referred to, with Okakura himself branded an ultra-nationalist by the late 1930s, condoning Japan’s annexation of Korea. Bharucha reads threads of ‘national exclusiveness’ and ‘cultural schizophrenia’ into Okakura’s <italic>The Ideals of the East</italic> (1903), as also into his <italic>The Awakening of the East</italic>, which appeared posthumously in 1938. He queries Okakura’s depth in understanding of Advaita philosophy, used to flaunt his axiomatic truth that ‘Asia is one’.</p>
<p>While Tagore is well known for his denunciation of nationalism and is celebrated for returning his knighthood following the Jallianwala Bagh massacre in Amritsar, Okakura was to clothe in subtle poetical language his denigration of Indian and Chinese art, making categorical statements to the effect that Japanese art stands alone in the world. But while Tagore sought to distance himself from the ideology of swadeshi, his songs cannot be separated from their nationalist content, with Gandhi in ‘typically forthright manner’ hailing Tagore an ‘ardent nationalist’ (p. 82). Though quite the opposite from Okakura’s strong taste for alcohol and his ‘flamboyant samurai-scholar persona’ (p. 150), Tagore saw something unique in him, something that could not be substituted by another Asian expert from Japan. Okakura was ‘one of his intimate friends’ (p. 174).</p>
<p>Upon Tagore’s departure from their second and final meeting in Boston in February 1913, Okakura, then based at the city’s Museum of Fine Arts, felt himself left with a sense of sudden loneliness. Bharucha evokes Thiruvalluvar in the Tamil classic <italic>Tirukkur.al.</italic> to the effect that neither familiarity nor frequent association makes friendship between two persons, rather it is a silent intellectual understanding. In Tagore’s greatest novels also—in <italic>Gora, Chaturanga, Ghaire Baire</italic>—‘friends are contrapuntal foils for each other’, different in themselves and yet complementary (p. 161). This friendship appears to respond to the ‘magisterial Forsterian position’ in <italic>A Passage to India</italic>, when it seems Aziz and Fielding find themselves most intimately linked when compelled to stay apart (p. 163), the world not yet ready. In such a crisis, ‘it was assumed by pacifist liberals like E.M. Forster, that one should have the courage to betray nationalist sentiments in favour of sustaining the ideals of a particular friendship’ (p. 52). This is perhaps one reason why Okakura was never mentioned in Tagore’s public lectures in Japan in 1916, ‘which does seem to be a strange omission given the idealisation of their friendship’ (p. 52). In his Japan lectures against nationalism, Tagore consolidated his universal humanist position with ‘all the ambivalence and metaphoric richness of a poet’ (p. 67).</p>
<p>While both in their fame led cosmopolitan lives, Okakura’s ‘half-way house’ between East and West was at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. Tagore’s sense of ‘home’ in relation to ‘the world’ was revealed in his motto for Visva-Bharati—<italic>yatra visva bhabati ekanidam</italic>—‘where the world finds its home in one nest’ (p. 126). Today, among members of Bengal’s upper-class <italic>bhadralok</italic> community, Okakura is principally remembered for his contribution to principles of art practice linked to the Bengal and Santiniketan schools of painting (p. 44). Even as Tagore and Okakura are much valued as national figures, their friendship beckons a worldwide universality. In the epilogue, Bharucha bemoans the fact that Tagore ‘remains the least known and shared of universal thinkers in the world. This continues to be the dominant reality of his legacy; an incomplete translation of staggering proportions given the scale of his multi-genre oeuvre’ (p. 179).</p>
