<abstract>
<p>The lexical and structural characteristics of the maternal input addressed to 24-month-old children with Down syndrome were compared to the input addressed to two groups of typically developing children; matched for chronological age (CA Group) and lexical skills (Vocabulary Group), respectively. The aim of the study was to verify whether the characteristics of the language addressed to children with Down syndrome are oversimplified, as found in previous studies, or if they are appropriate for the children’s developmental level. Data analyses show that the lexicon directed towards these children is simpler than that addressed to both of the comparison groups in terms of vocabulary composition (fewer function words and more onomatopoeic words/routines) and simpler than that addressed to the CA Group in terms of lexical variability. However, in terms of syntactic complexity, the input is mid-way between the two comparison groups. In addition, the analysis of maternal imitative utterances shows that the children with Down syndrome receive a lower proportion of imitative utterances than could be expected based on their age.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>According to the social-interactionist view of language development, linguistic abilities develop within a social context as children continue to gain experience in conversational interactions. A number of studies, which focus on verifying the specific role of social components in language acquisition, have analysed the way in which adults, especially mothers, talk to children. Studies from the 1970s onwards found that parents usually alter their communication style, using so-called child directed speech (CDS), when addressing a child (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0142723711410780">Snow &amp; Ferguson, 1977</xref>). Numerous characteristics are exclusive to this particular kind of communication, including the use of short and syntactically simplified utterances, the production of frequent repetitions and the use of exaggerated intonational contours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0142723711410780">Phillips, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0142723711410780">Snow, 1972</xref>).</p>
<p>A review of studies on maternal input was carried out by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0142723711410780">Hoff and Naigles (2002)</xref>. According to these authors, there are two types of CDS studies: those which investigate the social-pragmatic functions of maternal input (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0142723711410780">D’Odorico, Salerni, Cassibba, &amp; Jacob, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0142723711410780">Tamis-LeMonda, Bornstein, Baumwell, &amp; Melstein Damast, 1996</xref>); and those which aim to analyse the data-providing features of CDS (i.e., frequency, structure and lexicon) (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0142723711410780">Huttenlocher, Vasilyeva, Cymerman, &amp; Levine, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0142723711410780">Huttenlocher, Vasilyeva, Waterfall, Vevea, &amp; Hedges, 2007</xref>). In both approaches, studies confirm that parents adapt their communicative style as a function of the child’s increasing age and development, both in the use of social-pragmatic communicative functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0142723711410780">Bornstein et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0142723711410780">Longobardi, 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0142723711410780">1995</xref>) and in the structural aspects of speech such as lexical variety and syntactic complexity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0142723711410780">Henning, Striano, &amp; Lieven, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0142723711410780">Hoff-Ginsberg, 1986</xref>). This hypothesis, which holds that a child could use his/her own characteristics to influence and modify the input addressed to him/her, is related to the so-called <italic>transactional model of development</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0142723711410780">Cicchetti &amp; Beeghly, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0142723711410780">Sameroff, 1975</xref>), which underlines the existence of a mutual influence between the child and the environment.</p>
<p>In the case of a child with difficulties in language or cognitive development, one might predict that the process by which the mother modifies her communicative style to suit her child’s skills could have two different outcomes: exposure to a simplified input could help the child during the first stages of language acquisition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0142723711410780">Girolametto, Weitzman, Wiigs, &amp; Pearce, 1999</xref>); or the modifications induced by maternal awareness of the child’s linguistic or cognitive problems, along with his/her diminished capacities, could contribute to a less than optimal language-learning environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0142723711410780">Fischer, 1987</xref>). Although various studies on maternal input to children with language delays argue that their linguistic environment is similar to that of typically developing age-matched peers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0142723711410780">Rescorla &amp; Fechnay, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0142723711410780">Salerni, Suttora, &amp; D’Odorico, 2007</xref>), there are also studies that hypothesize the existence of an ‘idiosyncratic feedback cycle’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0142723711410780">Girolametto et al., 2002</xref>) in which the children’s expressive language delay elicits non-optimal maternal input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0142723711410780">D’Odorico &amp; Jacob, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0142723711410780">Tannock &amp; Girolametto, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0142723711410780">Vigil, Hodges, &amp; Klee, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0142723711410780">Whitehurst et al., 1988</xref>).</p>
<p>The majority of studies on verbal input directed to infants with mental retardation have been conducted on children with Down syndrome because, despite their obvious individual variability, these children can be considered a homogeneous group due to their common genetic aetiology and similar neuropsychological outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0142723711410780">Fischer, 1987</xref>). Unfortunately, the majority of studies on maternal input to this population date back to the 1970s and early 1980s and do not reflect recent changes in ways of coping with the syndrome. Today, parents usually receive much clearer communication about the diagnosis and its possible outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0142723711410780">Skoto, 2005</xref>). They can obtain useful information from a range of different sources, including psychologists and rehabilitation therapists. The high level of information and the recent trend of placing children with developmental disorders in rehabilitation programmes (i.e., physiotherapy and psychomotor therapy) at a very young age should have a positive influence on parents’ communicative behaviour towards their children. In support of this, studies have shown that parental beliefs and behaviours can be influenced by more realistic expectations of a child’s ability to achieve important developmental goals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0142723711410780">Van Beek, Genta, Costabile, &amp; Sansavini, 2006</xref>). Moreover, the majority of studies on maternal input to children with Down syndrome focused on a limited number of participants. In many cases, they only focused on a few children of widely varying chronological ages who differed greatly in their cognitive and linguistic skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0142723711410780">Cardoso-Martins &amp; Mervis, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0142723711410780">Iverson, Longobardi, Spampinato, &amp; Caselli, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0142723711410780">Longobardi, Caselli, &amp; Colombini, 1998</xref>). The limited number of participants is a drawback because of the pronounced individual variability that characterizes language development in children with Down syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0142723711410780">Fabbretti, Pizzuto, Vicari, &amp; Volterra, 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>Various analyses have been conducted on maternal input to children with Down syndrome. These have mainly used the comparative approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0142723711410780">Berger, 1990</xref>), where the input directed to children with atypical development is compared to that addressed to typically developing children at the same chronological age (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0142723711410780">Buium, Rynders, &amp; Turnure, 1974</xref>) or developmental stage (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0142723711410780">Rondal, 1988</xref>). Using the distinction proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0142723711410780">Hoff and Naigles (2002)</xref>, the results of research in this field can be divided into two areas: studies that consider the overall mother–child interaction, analysing both the mother’s use of social-pragmatic communicative functions and the child’s behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0142723711410780">Buium et al., 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0142723711410780">Jones, 1977</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0142723711410780">1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0142723711410780">Longobardi et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0142723711410780">Marfo, 1990</xref>); and studies that investigate data-providing features (in terms of utterance frequency and lexical or morphosyntactic complexity) of the input addressed to children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0142723711410780">Buium et al., 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0142723711410780">Cardoso-Martins &amp; Mervis, 1985</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0142723711410780">1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0142723711410780">Mahoney, 1988</xref>).</p>
<p>With regard to the social-pragmatic aspects of communication, initial studies emphasized how the style of interaction adopted by mothers of children with Down syndrome was more directive than that adopted by the mothers of typically developing children of the same chronological age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0142723711410780">Buium et al., 1974</xref>). This style was also characterized by a higher number of utterances with a control function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0142723711410780">Marfo, 1990</xref>). This directive style of communication has been linked with a possible maternal perception of a higher level of passivity in children with Down syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0142723711410780">Cardoso-Martins &amp; Mervis, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0142723711410780">Sabbadini &amp; Ossella, 1994</xref>). In consequence, these mothers may be more motivated to both direct their children’s behaviour and reorient their attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0142723711410780">Jones, 1977</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0142723711410780">1980</xref>). Conversely, in a more recent study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0142723711410780">Longobardi et al. (1998)</xref> found that maternal input to children with Down syndrome was not characterized by a control style. These authors investigate the use of five communicative functions (<italic>tutorial</italic>, <italic>didactic</italic>, <italic>conversational</italic>, <italic>control</italic> and <italic>asynchronous</italic>). In comparing a group of five mothers of children with Down syndrome with a control group of five mothers of typically developing children at the same linguistic level, they found no significant differences in the proportion of communicative functions used by the two groups. Although there were a reduced number of utterances directed to children with Down syndrome, all of the mothers showed a prevalence of the <italic>conversational</italic> function and a very low frequency of the <italic>asynchronous</italic> function.</p>
<p>With regard to the data-providing aspects of speech addressed to children with Down syndrome, mothers use utterances with a reduced syntactic complexity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0142723711410780">Buium et al., 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0142723711410780">Mahoney, 1988</xref>). However, when compared by developmental index (i.e., mental or linguistic age) rather than chronological age, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0142723711410780">Rondal (1988)</xref> found that some data-providing characteristics of maternal speech (mean length of utterance and lexical variety) were similar to those addressed to typically developing children. Moreover, studies examining object labelling in spontaneous conversation did not find any significant differences for the proportion of nouns or verbal deixis (i.e., utterances that explicitly refer to an object and cite it by name) between mothers of children with Down syndrome and those of typically developing children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0142723711410780">Cardoso-Martins &amp; Mervis, 1990</xref>). However, in a more recent study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0142723711410780">Iverson et al. (2006)</xref> analysed the total amount of utterances produced by five mothers of children with Down syndrome during a 30-minute free-play session. They found that these mothers produced significantly fewer utterances (approximately 50% fewer) than the mothers of younger typically developing children with comparable expressive language skills. These results were interpreted by the authors as a maternal simplification strategy to prevent the child from being overloaded with verbal information. Therefore, some data-providing features of language addressed to children with Down syndrome appear to be simpler than the input directed to both chronological age-matched children and typically developing children at the same developmental level.</p>
<p>The specific aim of the present study was to compare the data-providing features of the input addressed to 24-month-old children with Down syndrome with the input addressed to two groups of typically developing children, one matched for chronological age and the other for lexical skills. Age-matched children were considered to examine if maternal input directed to children with Down syndrome was too complex for their linguistic or developmental abilities. This comparison has been introduced to control for the child’s level of experience, given that both groups have been exposed to language for two years. The strategy of comparing children with Down syndrome with a control group based on chronological age has been previously used in a study on gestural and vocal production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0142723711410780">Zampini, 2008</xref>). The input addressed to younger, typically developing children with the same vocabulary size was also examined for the possible presence of oversimplified maternal input. This latter case could be related to lower maternal expectations caused by an awareness of the child’s developmental delays, leading to a perception of the child as younger than his/her chronological age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0142723711410780">Fidler, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>One further structural aspect of the input considered here was the use of particular strategies, such as the repetition or expansion of children’s utterances. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0142723711410780">Yoder, Hooshyar, Klee, and Schaffer (1996)</xref> showed that mothers of children with Down syndrome were more likely to expand partially intelligible utterances than fully intelligible ones, whereas mothers of children with language impairment did the opposite. In addition, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0142723711410780">Velleman, Mangipudi, and Locke (1989)</xref> showed that mothers of children with Down syndrome were less phonetically contingent (i.e., maternal responses which reproduce segmental and/or prosodic characteristics of the child’s production) to their children during the early stages of language development than mothers of younger, typically developing children. We build on this work by focusing on the mothers’ propensity to imitate the lexical content of their children’s language.</p>

<p>The children with Down syndrome were selected from a sample of toddlers participating in a monitoring programme on language development in this population. All of the participants had free trisomy 21, as shown by karyotype analysis, and one child was affected by congenital cardiopathy. All of the children had adequate auditory and visual skills, with vision corrected to normal where necessary. The children’s developmental age was evaluated by the use of the Brunet–Lézine Scale of Psychomotor Development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0142723711410780">Brunet &amp; Lézine, 1967</xref>) and averaged about 15 months (range [months.days] = 10.24–18.18) at the time of the study. All of the children had been receiving physiotherapy treatment and psychomotor or occupational therapy since a few months after birth, but none of them were receiving specific speech or language therapy at the time of this evaluation.</p>
<p>The typically developing children selected for this study were a subset of the children who had previously participated in several epidemiological longitudinal studies on language acquisition in Italian children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0142723711410780">D’Odorico &amp; Fasolo, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0142723711410780">Salerni, Assanelli, D’Odorico, &amp; Rossi, 2007</xref>). The children and their families were all residents of northern Italy and were recruited from local birth records to participate in longitudinal studies conducted at the University of Milan-Bicocca and at the University of Padua. None of these children showed any impairment in hearing or cognitive skills (as assessed by the administration of Bayley Scales of Infant Development when they were 19 months old).</p>
<p>With regard to parity, three children with Down syndrome were first-born, seven were second-born and four were third-born or more; eight children from the Vocabulary Group were first-born and six were second-born; seven children from the CA Group were first-born and seven were second-born. With regard to maternal education, five mothers from the Down Syndrome Group, six from the Vocabulary Group and eight from the CA Group had a graduate school degree (18 years of education); six mothers from each group had a high school diploma (13 years of education); three mothers from the Down Syndrome Group and two from the Vocabulary Group attended elementary and junior school (8 years of education). It has been found that mothers with a higher level of education speak more to their infants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0142723711410780">Bornstein, Hahn, Suwalsky, &amp; Haynes, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0142723711410780">Hart &amp; Risley, 1995</xref>). Hence, maternal education was controlled for here by using it as a covariate in analyses.</p>

<title>Procedure</title>
<p>The procedure was exactly the same for each group of children (i.e., Down Syndrome, CA and Vocabulary Group). Vocabulary development was evaluated by administering the Italian version of the MacArthur Communicative Development Inventories (Il Primo Vocabolario del Bambino – PVB; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0142723711410780">Caselli &amp; Casadio, 1995</xref>). The specific validity of the PVB to assess vocabulary skills in children with Down syndrome has been demonstrated by previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0142723711410780">Zampini &amp; D’Odorico, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0142723711410780">Zampini &amp; D’Odorico, submitted</xref>). The PVB consists of two different forms: Gestures and Words, which includes a vocabulary list of 408 words, for assessing both comprehension and production, and a section which evaluates gesture production; and Words and Sentences, which includes a vocabulary production checklist of 670 words and a section that examines morphological and syntactic skills. For the present study, we only considered word production by noting the number of words marked on the inventory by mothers.</p>
<p>The spontaneous maternal utterances analysed in this study were collected from 20-minute mother–child free-play sessions recorded on video. Approximately half of the sessions of each group were carried out in the children’s home, while the others took place in the Infant Observation Laboratories of the Universities of Padua and Milan-Bicocca. The two settings were similar: the Infant Observation Laboratories were organized as play rooms and the children were allowed to familiarize themselves with this setting for at least half an hour before the video-recording of the mother–child play session, while home settings were arranged in order to prevent the use of objects and toys not included in the standardized set. In either case, the procedure used to collect language samples was exactly the same. Five different sets of toys were used to stimulate an extensive vocabulary sample: a farm set; a telephone; a nurturing set (a doll with a feeding bottle and a bed with a mattress and pillow); a food set (plastic fruits and vegetables with dishes and cutlery); and some illustrated books. The mothers were encouraged to play with their children as they normally would, trying to draw their attention to each set of toys. Subsequently, an observer used the CHAT (Codes for the Human Analysis of Transcripts; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0142723711410780">MacWhinney, 2000</xref>) format to transcribe the production of each mother and child.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0142723711410780">
<title>Coding and measures</title>
<p>The total amount of language addressed to each child was computed using the number of utterances per minute produced by the mothers during the free-play session. The unit of analysis corresponds to a mother’s utterance, within a single dialogic turn, produced within a unitary intonational pattern and separated from other utterances by a pause of more than 1 second (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0142723711410780">D’Odorico &amp; Jacob, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>With regard to the lexical characteristics of maternal input, the percentage of different word classes over the total number of words was computed in order to evaluate the vocabulary composition. Words uttered were classified as:</p>
<list id="list1-0142723711410780" list-type="alpha-lower">
<list-item><p>Nouns, which were split into Common nouns and Proper names.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Verbs, which were divided into Principal verbs, Auxiliary verbs and Modality verbs (i.e., verbs that modify or specify the activity denoted by the main verb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0142723711410780">Diessel, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0142723711410780">Givòn, 1979</xref>). This category includes modal verbs and aspectual verbs, such as <italic>start</italic>, <italic>continue</italic> and <italic>stop</italic>).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Adjectives.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Adverbs.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Function words, which included articles, prepositions, conjunctions and pronouns.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Routines, which included onomatopoeic words and routines (e.g., <italic>hello</italic>, <italic>bye-bye</italic> and <italic>thank you</italic>).</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>In addition, type-token ratios, for both nouns and verbs, were calculated to assess lexical variability. These indices were computed by dividing the number of different noun types uttered (roots) by noun tokens (TTR nouns) and the number of different verb types produced (roots) by verb tokens (TTR verbs). The choice of considering nouns and verbs separately was driven by the greater level of complexity of acquiring terms referring to actions rather than words labelling objects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0142723711410780">Gentner &amp; Boroditsky, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>A number of measures were computed for the syntactic characteristics of maternal input:</p>
<list id="list2-0142723711410780" list-type="alpha-lower">
<list-item><p>Mean length of utterances (MLU). This was computed by considering the mean number of words per utterance. Counting the number of words uttered and not the number of morphemes is common practice in Italian, which has a relatively complex system of inflectional morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0142723711410780">Devescovi et al., 2005</xref>).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Proportion of single-word utterances compared to the total number of utterances produced. Single-word utterances also included those composed of a content word associated with an article, a preposition or a conjunction.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Level of syntactic complexity. This was computed using the percentage of three different kinds of utterances out of the total number of multi-word utterances produced (i.e., utterances composed of more than a single word).</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Multi-word utterances were coded with a hierarchical coding scheme, including the following categories:</p>
<list id="list3-0142723711410780" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Utterances without verbs.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Simple utterances, including only one verb (or an auxiliary or a modality verb preceding the main verb).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Complex utterances (i.e., utterances with two or more main verbs).</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Maternal complex utterances were divided into three different subcategories based on their proportion of the following:</p>
<list id="list4-0142723711410780" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Coordinate clauses, i.e., two clauses integrated into a single utterance by a conjunction (e.g., <italic>Prendine uno e vieni qui</italic> [Take one of those and come here]).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Attention getters, i.e., complement clauses in which the main verb has the pragmatic function of attracting the child’s attention (e.g., <italic>Guarda che c’è il cane</italic> [Look (that) there’s the dog]).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Subordinate clauses, i.e., utterances including a matrix clause and a subordinate clause (e.g., <italic>Prendi il bimbo che sta dormendo</italic> [Take the baby who’s sleeping]; <italic>Se vai di là lei ti sgrida</italic> [If you go there, she’ll scold you]).</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Finally, the propensity of the mothers to elaborate their children’s utterances was evaluated by taking into account the effect of maternal imitative utterances on their children’s productions (i.e., the proportion of maternal responses to children’s utterances which included an imitation of at least one word uttered by the child). This analysis was carried out using the CHIP programme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0142723711410780">Sokolov &amp; MacWhinney, 1990</xref>). The percentage of imitative utterances (i.e., the proportion of maternal imitative responses to the total number of maternal responses) was computed, and these utterances were further divided into the following subcategories:</p>
<list id="list5-0142723711410780" list-type="alpha-lower">
<list-item><p>Simple imitations, i.e., an exact repetition of the child’s utterance (e.g., Child: <italic>ciao</italic> [hello]. Mother: <italic>ciao</italic> [hello]).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Expansions, i.e., a repetition of the child’s utterance with some additions (e.g., Child: <italic>cane</italic> [dog]. Mother: <italic>il cane abbaia</italic> [the dog is barking]).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Reductions, i.e., a repetition of the child’s utterance with some omissions (e.g., Child: <italic>pappa buona</italic> [baby-food good]. Mother: <italic>buona!</italic> [good!]).</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The children’s utterances produced during the free-play session were analysed by computing the total number of utterances per minute and computing the frequency of preverbal (i.e., communicative grunts, vocalizations, babbling) and verbal utterances (i.e., utterances containing at least a word) separately.</p>

<p>The three groups were compared using analysis of variance, controlling for maternal education as a covariate (ANCOVA). The analysis of variance showed a significant difference among the groups for maternal utterances (<italic>F</italic>(3, 38) = 4.40; <italic>p</italic> = .009) and child utterances, taking both the total number of utterances produced (<italic>F</italic>(2, 39) = 4.94; <italic>p</italic> = .012) and the preverbal (<italic>F</italic>(2, 39) = 10.70; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) and verbal utterances (<italic>F</italic>(2, 39) = 38.96; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) separately. Bonferroni post-hoc test showed that the number of utterances produced by the CA Group mothers was significantly lower than that produced by the Down Syndrome Group mothers (<italic>p</italic> = .003), while child utterances showed the opposite pattern. The CA Group children produced a significantly higher number of utterances than the Down Syndrome Group children (<italic>p</italic> = .017). In particular, the frequency of verbal utterances per minute in the CA Group was significantly higher than in the Down Syndrome Group (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001).

<p>Different communicative styles were identified among the three groups for vocabulary composition. As noted by the analysis of variance shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0142723711410780">Table 3</xref>, there were significant differences in the proportional frequency of Nouns, Function words and Routines. Bonferroni post-hoc tests showed that the proportion of Nouns produced by the Down Syndrome Group mothers was higher than that of the CA Group mothers; however, the proportional frequency of Function words uttered by the mothers of the Down Syndrome Group was significantly lower. It is worth noting that the proportion of the simplest category of words (Routines) was significantly higher in the Down Syndrome Group than in either of the control groups. Moreover, considering the typology of verbs uttered, the mothers of the Down Syndrome Group produced a significantly lower proportion of Auxiliary verbs than the mothers of the CA Group. On the whole, the vocabulary composition of the mothers of children with Down syndrome was similar to that used in the input addressed to chronologically younger children with the same level of lexical skills (Vocabulary Group). Moreover, the vocabulary composition of both groups was less complex (fewer Function words and more onomatopoeic words/routines) than that addressed to the CA Group children. However, considering the proportion of simple words (included in the Routines category), the lexical production of the mothers of children with Down syndrome was even simpler than that used with the Vocabulary Group children.</p>

There were no significant differences in MLU among the three groups (<italic>F</italic>(3, 38) = 0.50; <italic>p</italic> = .686).</p>
<p>Considering the mean production of single-word utterances, the proportional frequency of utterances consisting of a single term directed to children with Down syndrome was 0.20 (SD = 0.05), and the proportional frequency of single-word utterances addressed to the Vocabulary and CA Group children was 0.29 (SD = 0.07) and 0.29 (SD = 0.09), respectively. There was a significant difference between the three groups (<italic>F</italic>(3, 38) = 5.49; <italic>p</italic> = .003).

<p>At the level of syntactic complexity, for each group approximately 15% of the maternal productions were utterances without verbs (Down Syndrome Group: <italic>M</italic> = 0.16, SD = 0.05; Vocabulary Group: <italic>M</italic> = 0.14, SD = 0.03; CA Group: <italic>M</italic> = 0.14, SD = 0.05), whereas 6% were complex utterances (Down Syndrome Group: <italic>M</italic> = 0.06, SD = 0.03; Vocabulary Group: <italic>M</italic> = 0.06, SD = 0.02; CA Group: M = 0.06, SD = 0.03) and the remaining part were simple utterances (Down Syndrome Group: M = 0.77, SD = 0.04; Vocabulary Group: M = 0.80, SD = 0.02; CA Group: <italic>M</italic> = 0.80, SD = 0.05).

<p>However, considering the production of complex utterances (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0142723711410780">Figure 1</xref>) in detail, it is interesting to note that the Down Syndrome Group maternal utterances had a lower level of complexity (i.e., a higher proportional frequency of attention getter clauses and a lower proportion of subordinate clauses) compared to the CA Group mothers, but a higher level of complexity, with an opposite pattern (i.e., a lower proportional frequency of attention getter clauses and a higher proportion of subordinate clauses), compared to the Vocabulary Group mothers. Therefore, it would appear that the degree of complexity of maternal utterances of the Down Syndrome Group lies between the control groups. However, the Bonferroni post-hoc tests did not show the existence of any significant differences between the Down Syndrome Group and the control groups even though the analysis of variance revealed an overall significant difference for the attention getters (<italic>F</italic>(3, 38) = 4.14; <italic>p</italic> = .012) and the subordinate clauses (<italic>F</italic>(3, 38) = 3.81; <italic>p</italic> = .017).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The present study was designed to evaluate the structural and lexical characteristics of maternal input addressed to 24-month-old children with Down syndrome, compared with typically developing groups of chronological age- and vocabulary size-matched children.</p>
<p>With regard to the general quantitative characteristics of maternal input, it was found that mothers of children with Down syndrome produced a similar number of utterances per minute to mothers of children at the same level of linguistic skill, but significantly more than mothers addressing typically developing children of the same chronological age. This result contradicts a study conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0142723711410780">Iverson et al. (2006)</xref>, which found that the input addressed to five children with Down syndrome was less rich, in terms of the total number of utterances, than that directed to children at the same linguistic level. In fact, the present study shows how the frequency of maternal utterances was influenced by the children’s linguistic skills. Mothers tend to talk more when their children’s communicative ability is limited, stimulating conversation and filling pauses, and they gradually reduce their utterance frequency as the child’s ability to interact increases.</p>
<p>Considering the lexical and structural characteristics of maternal input in greater detail, the present study shows that there were greater differences in the lexicons addressed to both groups, suggesting that mothers adjust their lexicon more than their syntax during interactions with their children in the first stages of language acquisition. This could be due to a higher maternal awareness of vocabulary than syntax. In fact, from the point of view of the vocabulary composition of maternal input, the present study shows how the lexicon directed to children with Down syndrome was simpler than that addressed to the control groups. In comparison to the Vocabulary Group, the mothers of children with Down syndrome used a higher proportion of simple terms (i.e., routines and onomatopoeic words). Moreover, in comparison to the CA Group, this higher proportion of simple words was combined with a significantly lower proportion of function words, which reduced the lexical complexity even further. The significantly lower percentage of auxiliary verbs is also worth noting because it underlines the limited presence of complex verb constructions in the input addressed to children with Down syndrome, in favour of simpler verbal forms.</p>
<p>It is interesting to note how the vocabulary composition identified in the mothers of children with Down syndrome followed the same pattern found in their children. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0142723711410780">Zampini and D’Odorico (2011)</xref> found that the vocabulary composition of a group of 12 children with Down syndrome, with a mean lexical size of 450 words, was simpler (i.e., more routines and proper nouns and fewer adverbs and function words) than that of a control group of typically developing children with the same vocabulary size and developmental age.</p>
<p>Although the maternal vocabulary composition seems relatively simple for the children with Down syndrome, some input characteristics appear to be appropriate for their linguistic level, but not for their chronological age. For instance, it was observed that while vocabulary variability (both for nouns and for verbs) was not significantly different from that of the Vocabulary Group, vocabulary variability for nouns was lower than that of the CA Group mothers. These results seem to confirm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0142723711410780">Rondal’s (1993)</xref> analyses, whereby lexical variety was similar to that found in maternal speech directed to typically developing children at the same linguistic or cognitive level.</p>
<p>Our findings suggest that the input for children with Down syndrome is less complex than it need be. It is possible that the lower degree of lexical complexity of the Down syndrome maternal input could be due to the mothers’ perception of their children as having limited communicative ability. Accordingly, the lexical features of the speech addressed to the children may be more influenced by their individual variability in comprehension skills than in their vocabulary production.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, relatively few significant differences were found between the Down Syndrome Group and the control groups regarding the syntactic characteristics of maternal input. Maternal MLU was not significantly different among the three groups, confirming <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0142723711410780">Rondal’s (1988)</xref> finding regarding the similarity between MLU addressed to children with Down syndrome and that directed to typically developing children at the same linguistic level. It is possible that the contrasting results in the study conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0142723711410780">Buium et al. (1974)</xref> might derive from differences in the data collection methodologies. The present study aimed at evaluating maternal input in a spontaneous situation (a free-play session), while <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0142723711410780">Buium et al. (1974)</xref> identified a limited maternal MLU (in comparison to an age-matched group) during a structured problem-solving context in which the mothers were told to teach their children how to set a table.</p>
<p>Mothers of children with Down syndrome produce fewer single-word utterances in comparison with the mothers of both the CA Group and the Vocabulary Group. This could be explained as an attempt to provide their children with a larger amount of verbal input in order to be more explicative and better understood. However, it has to be pointed out that there is no consensus in the literature regarding the hypothetical benefit derived from exposure to single-word utterances. Some authors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0142723711410780">Fernald &amp; Hurtado, 2006</xref>) have claimed that exposure to a high number of single-word utterances results in a disadvantage in producing syntactically complex utterances. In addition, the use of terms in a wider phrasal context could help the child in word recognition. At the same time, some authors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0142723711410780">Brent &amp; Siskind, 2001</xref>) claim that exposure to words in isolation in the earliest stage of language acquisition could help children in the word segmentation process and could provide a predictive index for their subsequent lexical development (i.e., hearing a specific word in isolation is a significant predictor of the later production of that particular term).</p>
<p>Turning to multi-word utterances, no significant differences were found among the three groups in the level of syntactic complexity shown by mothers. Complexity was operationally defined in terms of the number of verbs per utterance (i.e., no verbs, one verb or more than one verb). Therefore, the language addressed to the children with Down syndrome did not appear to be syntactically simpler than that directed to typically developing children of the same age, contrary to what has previously been documented in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0142723711410780">Buium et al., 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0142723711410780">Mahoney, 1988</xref>). However, an in-depth analysis of the types of complex utterances produced by the mothers revealed that the language addressed to the children with Down syndrome is mid-way, in terms of complexity, between the other two groups. In fact, the complex utterances produced by the mothers of the children with Down syndrome had a lower level of complexity compared to those addressed to the CA Group children, but a higher level of complexity than those directed to the Vocabulary Group children. This finding is apparent from the proportion of subordinate clauses (i.e., the highest level of complex utterances). Altogether, the results regarding syntactic complexity of maternal input show that the structures used by the mothers of children with Down syndrome are simpler than those used by the mothers of their typically developing peers. However, they are more complex than those directed to children who have the same level of linguistic abilities but are younger in terms of chronological age.</p>
<p>Finally, taking into consideration maternal imitative utterances, the mothers of children with Down syndrome produced a similar proportion of imitative utterances when compared with mothers of the Vocabulary Group children, but significantly fewer when compared with mothers of the CA Group children. The difference between the input to the Down Syndrome Group and the CA Group is evident even when the different categories of imitative utterances are considered separately. Not only do the mothers of the CA Group children tend to repeat their children’s utterances (simple imitations) more frequently, but they also use more expansions (which can be considered as a strategy to improve children’s morphosyntactic skills) and reductions (which could help children to focus on a particular lexical item). The more extensive use of imitative utterances by the mothers of the CA Group children could be due to differences in the children’s linguistic skills. It is possible that the more structured utterances produced by more competent communicative partners (i.e., the children in the CA Group) are easier to imitate or partially repeat. However, if children with Down syndrome are exposed to a lower proportion of imitative utterances than could be expected based on their age, it could reduce their chances of noticing the differences between their utterances and maternal utterances, which can be underlined by the temporal proximity during the production of imitative utterances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0142723711410780">Yoder et al., 1996</xref>). It is also important to note the scarce use of expansions in addressing the Down Syndrome Group in comparison with those used in addressing their typically developing peers because this strategy of elaboration, with some additions, would help these children to develop and lengthen their productions.</p>
<p>In conclusion, maternal input addressed to children with Down syndrome appears to be characterized by a lexicon simpler than that directed towards both chronological age-matched children and vocabulary size-matched children, and by a syntax that is mid-way between the control groups in terms of complexity. Moreover, maternal input directed towards children with Down syndrome appears to be characterized by a proportion of imitative utterances lower than could be expected based on their chronological age.</p>

<title>Practical implications</title>
<p>Given the recognized importance of the role that maternal input plays in language development in children, the results of the present study could support the development of specific intervention programmes for language addressed to children with Down syndrome. For instance, it could be helpful to increase the awareness of mothers of children with Down syndrome of their children’s vocabulary skills so that they might use a more varied and complex lexicon to enhance the vocabulary development of their children. Maternal awareness could be refined by periodic compilation of the MacArthur CDI, thus increasing the mothers’ focus on their children’s skills in comprehending and producing words.</p>
<p>Another intervention in maternal input could occur through the enhancement of the imitative strategy. Increasing the total amount of imitations and expansions of their children’s utterances could improve both the lexical and the syntactic aspects of the children’s language. This would assist the children in reformulating their verbal productions correctly because maternal reformulation can be used as a linguistic model to compare with their previous productions.</p>
