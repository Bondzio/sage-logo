<title>Reading Daniel as a Whole</title>
<p>Jordan M. Scheetz, <italic>The Concept of Canonical Intertextuality and the Book of Daniel</italic> (Cambridge: James Clarke &amp; Co., 2012. £18.00. pp. 184. ISBN: 978-0-227-90065-9).</p>
<p>The two chapters at the centre of this study comprise an examination of the exegetical interrelationships within chapters 1-6 and within chapters 7-12 of the book of Daniel, and of the exegetical interrelationship between these two parts of the book. Dr Scheetz (who teaches at Tyndale Theological Seminary in the Netherlands) shows how the book is not a haphazard assemblage of separate elements in which (for instance) the chronological notes that open each section (overlapping between the two parts) lack any great significance. Rather, the chapters ‘exegete one another through their ordering and overall placement together’ (p. 129). It is here that their ‘canonical intertextuality’ lies. Scheetz thus highlights the way in which, in particular, ‘the material from the vision in chapter 2 becomes the springboard for the rest of the book’ (in particular for chapters 7-12), ‘but for a different purpose than was found in chapter 2 and the complex as a whole’ (p. 84). Thus, to use Harold Bloom’s phrase, one might think of Daniel 7-12 as a ‘strong rereading’ of Daniel 1-6.</p>
<p>Before he comes to his study of Daniel itself, Scheetz reviews the history of the development of the notions of intertextuality and canonical criticism in order to expound his own concept of canonical intertextuality which he sees his interpretation of Daniel as exemplifying. The usual suspects appear here (Saussure, Derrida, Kristeva, Bakhtin, Fishbane, Sanders, Childs, Lindbeck, and so on), but Scheetz is distinctively appreciative of a work by Georg Steins on <italic>kanonisch-intextuallen Lektüre</italic>. I confess I found this opening chapter hard to follow, and not only because the notions themselves are inherently opaque. The reader should also be prepared for the presence of quite a bit of untranslated German here and elsewhere in the book.</p>
<p>The list of works on Daniel with which Scheetz interacts is rather selective, and this is unfortunate when works he does not mention overlap with or provide alternatives to his approach. I think (for instance) of Lenglet’s widely-regarded thesis that chapters 2-7 form a chiasm, and of works that have taken up that thesis. Further, although Scheetz starts from the development of post-structuralism, he does not discuss Danna Nolan Fewell’s deconstructionist study of the stories in Daniel with their stress on God’s sovereignty but also on the significance of human decision-making (Scheetz sees chapters 1-6 as serving the purpose of illustrating how the four young men distinguished themselves in the reigns of three emperors, which seems to underplay the importance of the chapters’ stress on God’s sovereignty).</p>
<p>The last two chapters look interestingly at Daniel’s relationship with some other Old Testament texts (and make some reference to whether Daniel really belongs in the Prophets or in the Writings) and consider the quotations from Daniel in the New Testament.</p>
