<p>Embolization of bone and soft tissue tumors has a broad range of indications, from curative treatment to palliation. The main purpose of embolization is to occlude as much of the tumor blood supply as possible. The outcome ranges from complete tumor devascularization and necrosis to degrees of ischemia and hypovascularity. Thus, the tumor will shrink, bleeding will be reduced, borders between the tumor and surrounding tissue will become clear, and resection will be easier. The purpose of this study was to correlate the effectiveness of preoperative embolization with the blood loss and transfusion requirement during surgery for bone or soft tissue tumors.</p>

<body>
<p>The use of selective arterial embolization for treating bone tumors was first described by Feldman et al in 1975.<sup>

</sup> Embolization of primary or metastatic bone and soft tissue tumors has a broad range of indications, from curative treatment to palliation. The main purpose of embolization is to occlude as much of the tumor supply as possible avoiding adjacent normal tissues. The outcome ranges from complete tumor devascularization and necrosis to degrees of ischemia and hypovascularity.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0003319711436075">2</xref>
</sup> Thus, the tumor will shrink, bleeding will be reduced, borders between the tumor and surrounding tissue will become clear, and resection will be easier. Reduced bleeding is particularly advantageous for patients with rare blood groups or those prone to transfusion reactions.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0003319711436075">3</xref>
</sup> This is particularly important considering that the resulting high transfusion requirements in tumor surgery are frequently complicated by depletion of clotting factors and coagulopathy that cause further variable intraoperative bleeding, while blood salvage techniques are contraindicated because of the risk of further dissemination of tumor cells.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0003319711436075">4</xref>
</sup> In addition, in large and unresectable tumors, reducing the amount of live tissue, destroying the tumor tissue, or at least inhibiting tumor growth will diminish the treatment dose for radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0003319711436075">5</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>The usual contraindications to intravascular procedures apply with attention to the presence of coagulopathy, thrombocytopenia, or anemia. The preoperative embolization of solitary bone metastases from kidney or thyroid tumors without extraskeletal metastases would lead to marked hyperemia and hypervascularity in areas surrounding the tumor, which may lead to heavy bleeding during surgery.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0003319711436075">6</xref>
</sup> On the other hand, embolization may be a therapeutic alternative to surgery in cases in which surgery is inappropriate or associated with high risk.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0003319711436075">7</xref>
</sup> The purpose of this study was to correlate the effectiveness of preoperative embolization with the blood loss and transfusion requirement during surgery for bone or soft tissue tumors.</p>

<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<p>Diagnostic angiography was performed on 18 patients (11 females, 61.1%; 7 males, 38.9%) between the ages of 9 and 52 years (mean 25.7 years) with tumors located at their extremities (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0003319711436075">Table 1</xref>). Diagnosis included aneurysmal bone cyst (ABC; n = 1), hemangioma (n = 2), arteriovenous malformation (AVM; n = 3), osteosarcoma (n = 6), chondrosarcoma (n = 2), giant cell tumor (GCT; n = 2), and soft tissue sarcoma (STS; n = 2). Patients were evaluated between December 2009 and January 2011 in our interventional unit upon referral from the orthopedics, vascular surgery, and oncology clinics. No interventional procedure was scheduled for patients without sufficient arterial blood flow. In all, 18 patients were considered as suitable for embolization and were included in the study.</p>

<p>Pre-embolization planning with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), and ultrasound was done on all cases, allowing identification of arterial blood supply, venous drainage, extent into adjacent tissues, and proximity of vital structures sharing potential blood supply. Computed tomography angiography is particularly used in complex lesions with multiple possible routes of arterial supply. Curative, selective–superselective digital subtraction angiography (DSA)-guided intra-arterial embolization was performed on the lesions of 3 patients with hemangioma and 4 with AVM. Preoperative intra-arterial embolization, with the purpose of bleeding control, was performed on 11 cases: 1 ABC, 2 GCT, 3 STS, and 5 osteosarcomas. Diagnostic angiography was performed on the same session before embolization.</p>
<p>Based on the tumor dynamics during angiography and embolization, images were obtained at the rate of 2 to 3 frames/s. Nonionic contrast agents (UltravistR [iopromid] 370 IU/100 mL, Schering-Germany; and Omnipaque R [iohexol] 350 IU 100/mL, Nycomed, Ireland) were administered using an Angiomat 6000 (Liebel-Flarsheim Company, Cincinnati, OH, USA) automatic injector. After administration of deep conscious sedation or general anesthesia, a 5F or 6F introducer was placed in the femoral artery with a modified Seldinger method using a single wall needle. Bentson (Boston Scientific, Cedex, France) or Glide Wire (Kimal, Middlesex, England) guide wires were used. Diagnostic angiography was performed using a standard vascular angiography catheter based on lesion location. Vascularity of the tumor, number and localization of feeding arteries, relationships to neighboring vascular formations, and the existence of an arteriovenous fistula (AVF) inside were angiographically evaluated. These tumor specifications determined the catheter system and the type and quantity of embolizing agent to be used.</p>
<p>We used coaxial superselective catheterization with microcatheters for all cases which offer several advantages. The embolic agent can be delivered further from the parent vessel and potentially reduce the chance of nontarget embolization. The feeding vessels to these tumors are often hypertrophied unnamed vessels and catheterization with the larger catheters may be more difficult. Arterial spasm with larger-caliber catheters may lead to false end points for embolization and reduce the efficacy of these procedures.</p>
<p>Embolization was carried out following selective or coaxial superselective catheterization. After distal catheterization was achieved using a diagnostic catheter, superselective catheterization was performed with microcatheter (Rebar by Micro Therapeutics, Inc, ev3, California). Embolization of all AVMs and 1 case of hemangioma were performed with nonadhesive liquid embolic agent (Onyx 34, by Micro Therapeutics, Inc, ev3, California). Regarding preoperative embolization, for controlling bleeding polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) particles (embolizing agent; Polyvinyl Alcohol Embolization Particles, TRUFILL 150-1000 μm; Cordis Endovascular Systems, Miami, Florida) 150 to 900 μm in size were used as 1 or 2 flacons, according to the type and size of the lesion. A mixture of PVA particles and contrast agent was administered carefully and slowly with hand injection under fluoroscopic control, avoiding any back flow. During each step, control angiograms were taken and tumor enhancement was evaluated in order to monitor the sufficiency and reliability of the occlusion; embolization was completed by deployment of 0.018 micro coils (Fibered Platinum Coils, Boston Scientific Cork Ltd, Cork, Ireland). For all cases, we saved as many arteries as possible that feed normal bone tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0003319711436075">Figure 1</xref>), the main feeding arterial branches of the tumor that could be catheterized were embolized separately.</p>

</fig>
<p>Additional angiography after completion of the procedure was performed for all cases to evaluate the technical success of embolization. We considered embolization technically complete when there was stasis of intravascular contrast material and either complete elimination of tumor hypervascular staining, or &gt;80% elimination of the tumor pathological vasculature compared with the initial diagnostic angiogram.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0003319711436075">8</xref>
</sup> Any feeders seen at postembolization angiography was occluded again catheterized and embolized. Devascularization rates were assessed, at postembolization angiography by evaluating the feeding vessels and tumor absences or reduction of tumor blush. In addition, the time interval between embolization and surgery was considered. Bleeding grade was estimated subjectively by the surgical team and objectively by bleeding records obtained intraoperatively. In patients that underwent preoperative embolization and subsequent surgery within 3 days, embolization was considered clinically successful if intraoperative blood loss was ≤1500 and ≤3000 mL if surgery was after 3 days.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0003319711436075">9</xref>
</sup> Most patients experienced some exacerbation of local tumor site pain during and immediately after embolization. This required symptomatic treatment (oral morphine sulfate or transdermal fentanyl) in 8 patients. Pain was significantly alleviated 24 to 36 hours after the intervention therapy in all 18 patients compared with that before interventional treatment. Twelve patients complained of local skin redness and swelling accompanied by a burning sensation. One patient developed a blister-like change in the skin, which was relieved 12 to 36 hours after symptomatic treatment. No major complications were encountered. In none of the study patients did the presence of postembolization syndrome interfere with or delay the scheduled surgical procedure. The follow-up of each case that underwent curative embolization was evaluated based on subjective symptoms and clinical findings, in addition to X-ray, CT, and MRI.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Diagnoses, findings, and results of all cases are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0003319711436075">Table 1</xref>. Of the malignant bone lesions osteosarcoma (n = 6), chondrosarcoma (n = 2), and STS (n = 2), 9 were located at the lower extremities and 1 was at the upper extremity, involving the scapula; of the 2 cases with GCT, 1 was at the radius and the other was at the tibia; of the 3 AVMs, 2 lesions were located at lower limbs and one at the right elbow; 2 cases of hemangioma were located at the lower limb and the ABC lesion was located at the right iliac bone.</p>
<p>For all osteosarcoma and STS (n = 10), diagnostic angiography performed prior to preoperative embolization revealed that the tumors located at the lower extremities were fed by the common, superficial, and deep femoral arteries, popliteal anterior tibial and the internal iliac artery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0003319711436075">Figure 2</xref>). Those located at the upper extremities were fed by the subclavian and radial artery. Accessible feeding branches were embolized with superselective catheterization. Mean devascularization rate in follow-up angiographies after embolization was 90% (range 70%-100%). Only 1 pediatric patient was operated on the same day of embolization and he had intraoperative blood loss of 350 mL. The other 10 cases had surgery between 1 and 6 days (mean 2.5 days) after embolization and had blood loss of 1100 to 2600 mL (mean, 1400 mL), intraoperatively and early postoperatively; tumor devascularization rates were also histopathologically evaluated at postoperative excision biopsy which show 60% to 100% necrosis (mean 81%).</p>

The left leg AVM had multiple feeding branches originating from the popliteal, geniculate, and anterior tibial artery. Superselective catheterization and embolization were performed on popliteal, geniculate, and most of feeder branches which originated from anterior tibial with Onyx. Ninety percent devascularization was obtained in the leg lesion; however, that patient had another lesion at the ipsilateral foot with multiple feeders through the anterior and posterior tibial arteries, another session of embolization was carried out targeting the foot lesion; 2 main feeders were embolized with occlusion of AVM nidus.</p>

The mass was near totally embolized (90%) with good occlusion of AVM nidus. No operation was done to any AVM patients; follow-up MRI carried out at 3-month intervals revealed good response that corresponded with clinical improvement.</p>
<p>One patient with GCT at the right tibia had surgery 2 years back at our hospital, but the tumor recurred. With the help of superselective embolization performed preoperatively, blood flow to the mass was reduced by 90%. Acceptable bleeding (1400 mL) occurred during the surgery that was performed 2 days after the embolization.</p>
<p>Two patients with hemangiomas who showed increase in mass size and pain underwent embolization. First patient was 36-year-old female with left leg hemangioma. Two sessions of embolization were done at 3 months’ intervals; the first session was with PVA and the second with Onyx embolizing material. Significant clinical improvement was detected after the second session.</p>
<p>The second patient was a 9-year-old female with diffuse hemangioma involving the right leg, thigh, groin, and right labia. She had only one session of embolization with PVA. Three-month follow-up showed reduction in mass size with clinical improvement. No further embolization was needed.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The management of patients with bone tumors is often complex; multiple specialties including interventional and diagnostic radiology, orthopedic surgery, neurosurgery and general surgery, and oncology and radiotherapy may be involved. Arterial embolization of hypervascular tumors has been used as an adjunct to surgical resection and, in some cases, has been used as the sole treatment for a tumor that is located in the spine or pelvis. When used in a preoperative setting, the embolization of feeder vessels to tumors such as metastatic renal cell or thyroid carcinoma, giant cell tumor, multiple myeloma, or ABC can result in a lower operative blood loss and a decreased need for intraoperative transfusions. This is particularly important in cases of large tumors that are located in sites where tourniquet control is not possible. The embolization procedure itself is often complex with significant risk to adjacent structures and is usually part of a wider treatment strategy. It is therefore vital to clearly establish the goals of treatment, potential side effects, and complications, as well as the treatment calendar, prior to embarking on a treatment regimen.</p>
<p>Embolization of tumors has been widely practiced in medicine and particularly interventional radiology for many years. Initially, this involved the treatment of hemorrhage and trauma with rapid implementation in the treatment of organ-based tumors.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0003319711436075">10</xref>
</sup> Refinements in technique led to its use in preoperative embolization of metastatic tumors to bone using gelfoam.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0003319711436075">11</xref>
</sup> Since those early days, indications have widened to include both benign and malignant bone tumors in palliative and potentially curative situations. There are now many options of embolic agent, techniques, and end points, but all aim to devascularize the tumor either as a primary treatment or as an adjunct to surgery. The addition of chemotherapy and sclerosants has also gained favor in some areas. There is also a role for direct intralesional embolization in some types of tumor where the transarterial embolization (TAE) route is not feasible. For example, cementoplasty has produced some promising results used either alone or in conjunction with radiofrequency ablation in the treatment of symptomatic extra-spinal metastatic lesions.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0003319711436075">12</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>The main purpose of embolization is to achieve thrombus formation and occlusion by administrating embolizing materials through a selective catheter placed in an arterial or venous vessel. Embolizing agents must be nontoxic, sterile, radiopaque, and easy to prepare or obtain.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0003319711436075">13</xref>
</sup> Currently, embolizing agents of primary use are gelfoam, PVA particles, metallic coils, pure alcohol, microfibrillar collagen, sodium tetradenia sulfate, and tissue glues.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0003319711436075">14</xref>
</sup> Embolization aims to maintain ischemia and necrosis in the center of the tumor, by occluding small distal branches inside the tumor. Thus, a tumor will shrink, borders between the tumor and the surrounding tissue will become clear, and operational excision and manipulation will be easier. Moreover, devascularization of a tumor improves bleeding control.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0003319711436075">15</xref>
</sup> In large and unresectable tumors, reducing the amount of live tissue, destroying the tumor tissue, or at least inhibiting tumor growth will diminish the treatment dose for radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy. Embolization can be used to support treatment in these situations.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0003319711436075">6</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Preprocedural planning with MRI, CT, and ultrasound is essential, particularly in complex lesions to identify arterial blood supply, venous drainage, extent into adjacent tissues, and proximity of vital structures potentially sharing arterial supply. Computed tomography angiography is particularly useful in large and complex lesions with multiple arterial feeders where multiple treatments are planned. Vascular mapping of and the hemodynamic status of the tumor, as well as the anatomic region must be determined using selective angiography before embolization. Feeding arteries of the tumor and collaterals, the tumor’s relationship with adjacent vascular processes, and possible AVFs inside the tumor must be carefully evaluated. Arteries feeding the tumor must be catheterized superselectively and the procedure must be undertaken with the most suitable embolizing agent, so as to protect the hemodynamics of normal bone tissues as much as possible.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0003319711436075">16</xref>
</sup> Prerequisite tests to safe angiography include prothrombin time (international normalized ratio) or partial thromboplastin time in patients on heparin, platelet count, and hemoglobin. Abnormal coagulation should be corrected where possible as many of the particulate embolic agents—embolization coils and injectable thrombogenic agents—require a functioning intrinsic clotting cascade. This is particularly relevant in a patient with active hemorrhage or after multiple transfusions where the coagulation profile should be corrected prior to treatment. In some cases, the tumor may be associated with derangement of coagulation as in the case of Kasabach-Merritt phenomenon.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0003319711436075">17</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Sun and Lang’s experiences with 16 patients reveal that when tumor enhancement is reduced &gt;70% according to postembolization follow-up angiographies, the expected bleeding reduces significantly.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0003319711436075">18</xref>
</sup> According to Barton et al, preoperative embolization is considered successful if tumor enhancement falls below 25% in the follow-up angiographies, 1500 mL blood loss occurs in cases undergoing surgery within 3 days, and ≤3000 mL blood loss in cases operated 3 days after embolization. Ideally, surgery must be performed within 3 days of embolization in order to avoid revascularization.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0003319711436075">6</xref>
</sup> There was no significant difference in blood loss between patients whose time intervals between embolization (with PVA) and surgery were 24 and 36 hours in the series of Sun and Lang. Sun and Lang prolonged this period up to 96 hours.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0003319711436075">18</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Surgery remains the standard treatment for osteosarcomas with adjunctive systemic chemotherapy. As osteosarcomas have a rich blood supply, intraoperative hemorrhage is likely, which often blurs the visual field of operation and interferes with complete resection of tumor and surrounding tissue. Sufficient embolization can also occlude vessels supplying blood to the tumor and reduce intraoperative hemorrhage effectively. Preoperative TAE of hypervascular bone tumors has been used to facilitate surgical excision by reducing the amount of intraoperative blood loss and by decreasing tumor volume. Giant cell tumor is a local aggressive lesion of bone and a highly vascularized tumor. Surgery is the preferred treatment method; however, local recurrence can be seen after curettage and grafting. Severe bleeding may occur during surgery, as it is a highly vascularized tumor. Radiotherapy is contraindicated because of its potential for malignant transformation.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0003319711436075">19</xref>
</sup> It is often located in the distal femur, proximal tibia, and distal radius. Spinal involvement is rare and the most common spinal presentation is on the sacrum. Total excision of such localized tumors is difficult and the risk of local recurrence is high. Embolization is an alternative treatment method for nonresectable tumors.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0003319711436075">20</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>In conclusion, preoperative and palliative embolization of primary or metastatic bone tumors, which have suitable hemodynamics, is an effective method because it reduces blood loss intraoperatively, thus facilitating surgical manipulation and tumor excision. Moreover, aided by embolization, inoperable lesions can also be included in the surgical treatment criteria, so more patients can have a surgical option. To determine which cases are suitable for embolization, vascular mapping and the hemodynamic status of the tumor must be determined, along with the anatomic region, using selective angiography before the procedure. Arteries feeding the tumor, risky vessels, and collaterals must be evaluated carefully. For a sufficient result, feeding arteries must be catheterized superselectively and the procedure must be undertaken with the most appropriate embolizing agent, protecting the hemodynamics of normal bone tissues as much as possible. Curative embolization improves the hemodynamics of primary bone tumors.</p>
