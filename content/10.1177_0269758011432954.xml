<abstract>
<p>Since the mid- to late 1980s a number of Western countries have granted victims a participatory role in the sentencing process by means of written and oral victim statements. These statements have been introduced with a view to increasing victim satisfaction with the criminal justice system. Evaluation research on the use of these statements, however, points towards victims’ numerous concerns when deciding whether to submit a statement. These concerns indicate that some victims may feel insecure and uncomfortable about submitting a statement. Focusing on the specific case of victim statements, this article will serve to explore how victim reforms that are designed to protect victims from exclusion by the criminal justice system and to enhance perceptions of justice risk causing some victims to feel endangered by participation.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>A number of decades ago, in his renowned <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269758011432954">1977</xref> paper ‘Conflicts as property’, Nils Christie charged criminology with being accomplice to the stealing of conflicts from their rightful owners by the criminal justice system. Criminology, in his opinion, amplified the process through which the conflict was taken from the ‘penal couple’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0269758011432954">Mendelsohn, 1956</xref>: 99) and converted into ‘the business of strangers’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0269758011432954">Kelly, 1983</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0269758011432954">1984</xref>: 15). Through a process that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0269758011432954">Edwards (2002</xref>: 691) calls a materialization of the ‘displacement function’ of criminal law, the parties to a conflict lost their right to participate in the handling of their conflict, under the pretext of ascertaining impartial and rational justice.</p>
<p>Today, however, victimology, a component part of the criminological science that Christie vilified so earnestly,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0269758011432954">1</xref>
</sup> functions as a catalyst for a diversity of victim-oriented amendments to laws and regulations worldwide. Victimization studies have even been praised for being the empirical motor of the criminological research of the 1980s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0269758011432954">Young, 1986</xref>). Meanwhile, a shift occurred from a ‘victimology of the act’ to a ‘victimology of the action’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0269758011432954">Fattah, 1992</xref>: 10). The translation of theoretical victimology into a ‘victimagogy’ that focuses on improvements to the status and service rights of victims of crime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269758011432954">Aertsen, 2004</xref>) has brought the ‘early, victim-free phase of criminology’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0269758011432954">Rock, 2002</xref>: 3) to a definite end.</p>
<p>One of the most highly debated steps in the expansion of victims’ rights is the taking into account of victim input about the harm suffered as a result of the offence when deciding on the appropriate sentence for an offender (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269758011432954">Dubber, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0269758011432954">Erez, 2004</xref>). The debate relates to the distinction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269758011432954">Ashworth (1993a</xref>) has made between service rights for victims and procedural rights of victims. The provision of service rights to victims, including practical support, respectful treatment by authorities and being kept informed on the case’s progress by now is well-accepted. The provision of procedural rights such as the right to file a victim statement or to participate in prosecution or parole decisions, to the contrary, has given rise to much criticism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0269758011432954">Roberts, 2009</xref>). Yet since the 1980s, a number of Western countries have granted victims a role in sentencing by means of victim statements. To the best of my knowledge, victim statements are currently in use in the United States (since 1982)<sup>2</sup> England and Wales (since 2001)<sup>3</sup>, Ireland (since 1993)<sup>4</sup>, Australia (since 1988)<sup>5</sup>, New Zealand (since 1987)<sup>6</sup>, Canada (since 1988)<sup>7</sup> and the Netherlands (since 2004)<sup>8</sup>. Some debate about the introduction of victim statements has been going on in South Africa,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0269758011432954">9</xref>
</sup> whereas Scotland experimented with victim statements in pilot projects running from 2003 to 2005 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269758011432954">Chalmers et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0269758011432954">Leverick et al., 2007</xref>). As of 2006, England and Wales is conducting experiments with Family Impact Statements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0269758011432954">Sweeting et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0269758011432954">Rock, 2009</xref>). South Australia and, in the United States, Rhode Island and Minnesota made provisions for so-called Community Impact Statements to be brought to court;<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0269758011432954">10</xref>
</sup> debate about such statements is going on in other jurisdictions such as the District of Columbia.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0269758011432954">11</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Though victim statements were received with varying degrees of enthusiasm, today they are more or less accepted, at least in principle – actual practice is more hesitant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0269758011432954">Henley et al., 1994</xref>). In the past, the statements have been charged with leading to more severe punishment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0269758011432954">O’Hara, 2005</xref>), longer and more rigid judicial procedures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0269758011432954">Joutsen, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269758011432954">Doak, 2005</xref>) and disparity in sentencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269758011432954">Ashworth, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0269758011432954">Edwards, 2002</xref>). Victimological research has taken the edge off most of these arguments (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269758011432954">Davis et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0269758011432954">Erez and Roeger, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0269758011432954">Erez and Rogers, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0269758011432954">Posner, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0269758011432954">Leferink and Vos, 2008</xref>). However, proponents of the statements are still fighting fierce headwind. For instance, it has been argued that unfounded and excessive victim demands and allegations can be made ‘from the relative security of a VIS<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0269758011432954">12</xref>
</sup>’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269758011432954">Ashworth, 1993b</xref>: 507). It is unclear what exactly Ashworth means by this phrase; however, it seems to suggest that victim statements lead to ‘easy’ participation, i.e. participation without responsibility. It seems to imply that victims can hide behind a victim statement while making demands and overthrowing the criminal justice system’s internal logic. Granted, victims who wish to file a victim statement often need not do more than fill in a standard document or talk to a counsellor or a victim support worker, who then fills in the document for them. There is no obligation for victims to speak up in court nor to meet their offender, while this ‘undemanding’ and ‘effortlessness’ mode of participation does, according to the critics, risk influencing the offender’s sentence and eroding the rights of defendants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269758011432954">Ashworth, 1993b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269758011432954">2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0269758011432954">Joutsen, 1994</xref>) and some fundamental values of the criminal justice system and the administration of justice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0269758011432954">Fenwick, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269758011432954">Arrigo and Williams, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Ashworth’s remark leads me in this article to pose the more general question whether victims indeed feel comfortable about using victim statements. In fact, evaluation research on these statements has raised some issues relating to victims’ concerns about using victim statements. For example, the fact that the statement will be seen by the defendant or used in court causes considerable concern to victims. Misunderstandings as to the purpose of these statements lead some victims to submit a statement when, with a more accurate understanding, they would not have done so. Other, similar examples have been reported. In this article victims’ concerns about using victim statements will be reviewed systematically.</p>
<p>The article does not present an empirical study; it draws on earlier evidence-based studies about the use of victim statements. I offer an overview of the reservations that victims participating in these studies have made about the use of these statements. I will first introduce the reader to the practice of victim statements; this will be brief since the readers of the <italic>International Review of Victimology</italic> are highly likely to be familiar with these statements. In the second part of the article, I go through a number of results of research on victim statements that indicate that victims do have a number of worries when using these statements. In the concluding pages of this article I take a broader view and consider whether there exist ways to remedy the risk that victims might feel endangered when exercising the rights that were in fact introduced with an intention to <italic>help</italic> them.</p>

<title>A short introduction to victim statements</title>
<p>Victim statements were designed in the mid-1970s in the United States to allow for victim participation in the sentencing process. A victim statement allows the victim of crime to explain how the crime has affected him/her so that the judge can take this information into account in sentencing. Victim statements have been labelled ‘testaments of harm’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0269758011432954">Graham et al., 2004</xref>: 33) for in these statements victims can describe the emotional/psychological impact of the crime (shock, anger, fear, anxiety, worries about safety, worries about the future behaviour of the perpetrator, depression, frustration, impact on self-identity), the social impact of the victimization experience (impact on daily routines, fear of leaving the house, increased security measures), the physical impact, the financial impact (loss of wages, having to take time off, things stolen during the offence, money to install security measures) and the impact on family members and relationships with significant others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0269758011432954">Graham et al., 2004</xref>). This is the general picture; since victim statement legislation is highly variable across jurisdictions one should ask the question whether victims in all these jurisdictions are allowed to include information on every single one of these categories of harm in their victim statement. Yet legislation about victim statements typically remains rather silent about the exact content of the statement. Usually, a general sentence such as ‘the impact of that injury, loss or damage on the person and his or her family’<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0269758011432954">13</xref>
</sup> or ‘describing the harm done to, or loss suffered by, the victim’<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0269758011432954">14</xref>
</sup> is used. The New Zealand Victims’ Rights Act 1992 in section 17 states that the victim statement may contain information about physical and emotional harm and any losses sustained, and ‘any other effects’. It is not common for legislators to put restrictions on the kind of harm that can be addressed in a victim statement – rather to the contrary. The Western Australian Sentencing Act 1995 points out that a victim statement may be accompanied by a report ‘by any person who has treated the victim in connection with the effects on the victim of the commission of the offence’ (this is also the case in Victoria and Queensland<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0269758011432954">15</xref>
</sup>). In England and Wales, the victim statement has been expanded such that the victim can indicate whether he or she believes assistance or additional support will be required, whether there is an intention to claim compensation, whether he or she is afraid of the offender or of being a witness, whether they are worried about the offender being given bail and if they feel that the crime was racially motivated (Home Office Circular 35/2001; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0269758011432954">Office for Criminal Justice Reform, 2009</xref>). In Colorado and Delaware, among other jurisdictions, victims are endowed with the opportunity to indicate in their statement if they require psychological services.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0269758011432954">16</xref>
</sup> A victim statement, for that matter, does not need to be restricted to a written form: New Zealand, New South Wales and Queensland allow for photographs, drawings, images, transcripts and recordings to be used as victim statement information.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0269758011432954">17</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Clearly, victim statements give victims an opportunity to describe the human costs of crime; the information that can be provided is wider than is usual in evidential statements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0269758011432954">Morgan and Sanders, 1999</xref>). Though critics like to state that the information provided in victim statements is more often than not redundant, nearly 50 percent of the judges participating in a Canadian study and two-thirds of the judges participating in an Australian study agreed that victim statements often contain additional information relevant to sentencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0269758011432954">Roberts and Edgar, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0269758011432954">Victims Support Agency Victoria, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Victim statements have different names.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0269758011432954">18</xref>
</sup> This is the result of considerable debate about what exactly victim statements are meant to achieve. The term Victim Impact Statement is the most widely known. This is the name the victim statements were given in the United States when they were first introduced in 1982.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0269758011432954">19</xref>
</sup> Most countries that implemented a victim statement scheme afterwards adopted this name. In England and Wales, however, though a victim statement scheme rather similar to the American one was introduced, policy-makers refused to adopt the name Victim Impact Statement. A debate about the function of these statements underlay the discussion about the name to be given to the statements. The British were discontented about the suggestion inherent in the term Victim Impact Statement, with its stress on ‘Impact’, that victim statements were to be an instrument for victims to influence the sentence. The British rationale behind the introduction of victim statements was not to allow victims to influence sentencing (Home Office Circular 35/2001)<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0269758011432954">20</xref>
</sup> but to allow victims a degree of involvement in the criminal justice system in order to enhance their well-being and reduce the sense of alienation that the victims’ movement had been denouncing for such a long time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0269758011432954">Morgan and Sanders, 1999</xref>). Proceeding from the theory of procedural justice, this rationale is wholly reasonable: procedural justice research has drawn attention to the importance that parties to a dispute attach to becoming involved in the criminal justice system, to have a say and voice their opinion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0269758011432954">Thibaut and Walker, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0269758011432954">1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0269758011432954">Lind and Tyler, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0269758011432954">Tyler and Lind, 1992</xref>). Offering victims possibilities for participation through, for example, victim statements should, then, enhance perceptions of fairness and justice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269758011432954">Cassell, 2009</xref>) and promote victims’ welfare (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0269758011432954">Erez, 2004</xref>). In order to dissociate themselves from the American point of view, the British replaced the word ‘Impact’ by ‘Personal’. In England and Wales, a Victim Personal Statement scheme is now available to crime victims.</p>
<p>Victim statements from the British point of view clearly are to serve a communicative or expressive goal. The rationale is that by means of a victim statement the victim informs not only the judicial authorities about the consequences of the crime but also the offender and the general public (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0269758011432954">Szmania and Gracyalny, 2006</xref>). By means of victim statements victims become involved in the dialogue that traditionally only involved the offender and the judicial authorities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0269758011432954">Joutsen, 1994</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0269758011432954">Roberts and Erez (2004</xref>: 230) write that ‘by permitting a victim to submit a statement of impact, the sentencing process opens up another avenue of communication; between the victim and the offender’: for the offender to hear about the impact of the crime from the victim involves a different ‘communicative dynamic’ than for him/her to find out via the prosecutor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0269758011432954">Roberts, 2009</xref>: 356).</p>
<p>In addition to Victim Impact Statements and Victim Personal Statements, Victim Statements of Opinion<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0269758011432954">21</xref>
</sup> exist, in which victims not only explain the harmful consequences of the crime but also voice their opinion as to the sentence the offender should receive. In practice, the dividing line between Victim Impact Statements and Victim Statements of Opinion is blurred. Though in theory only a Victim Statement of Opinion allows victims to voice their opinion on the sentence to be given to the offender, in practice some Victim Impact Statement forms also allow for victims to express their opinion on sentencing. Examples may illustrate this. The Australian Northern Territory Sentencing Act 1995 in its section 106B (5A) states the following: ‘A victim impact statement or victim report may contain a statement as to the victim's wishes in respect of the order that the court may make in relation to the offence referred to in the statement or the report’. In other words, notwithstanding the fact that the statements in Northern Territory are officially called ‘Victim Impact Statement’, the statements do allow for the inclusion of the victim’s opinion on sentencing. South Australia presents a similar situation. The South Australian Criminal Law (Sentencing) Act 1998 was amended in 2009 to allow for victims’ opinions on sentencing to be included in their victim impact statement.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0269758011432954">22</xref>
</sup> Section 7C of the Criminal Law (Sentencing) Act 1998 now reads: ‘Nothing prevents a statement to be furnished to a court under section 7A or 7B [which relate to the victim impact statement and the community impact statement] from containing recommendations relating to the sentence to be determined by the court’. In the United States all states have their own specific legislation on victim statements, which makes it hard to disentangle which states use Victim Impact Statements and which states allow for Victim Statements of Opinion. Yet here too one finds that though the name ‘Victim Impact Statement’ is the most commonly used, some Victim Impact Statement forms such as the one from Colorado and Oregon state: ‘Add your thoughts about what you would like the judge to consider at sentencing’ (Colorado) or ‘If you have any thoughts or suggestions on the sentence that the court should impose for this crime, please describe’ (Oregon). Among others, the Minnesota, Michigan, Massachusetts and New York legislation on victim statements speak of victim impact statements yet allow victims to voice their opinion on the sentence.</p>
<p>Victim statements can be brought to the judge both written and orally; in recent years it has become possible in some jurisdictions to present them visually. The written statement may be completed immediately after the victim’s witness statement is taken (e.g. in England and Wales) or at a later time (e.g. in Canada). In the Scottish pilots on victim statements, victims were only offered the opportunity to make a victim statement after the public prosecution had taken a decision on prosecution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0269758011432954">Leverick et al., 2007</xref>); in Canada victims can submit a statement at any time before sentencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0269758011432954">Victims Support Agency Victoria, 2009</xref>). The statements are then added to the judicial file. On their written statements, victims can indicate whether they would like to read their statement aloud in court themselves or would prefer it to be read by somebody else.</p>
<p>Much as filing a written statement is an option, presenting the statement orally in court is an option. If a victim prefers not to read it out him- or herself, they cannot be obliged to do so. Most jurisdictions in such cases provide for the possibility that the statement is presented to the court ‘in any other manner that the court considers appropriate’.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0269758011432954">23</xref>
</sup> Sometimes the prosecutor is explicitly appointed to read the statement in case the victim does not wish to read it, or is even <italic>obliged</italic> to do so at the victim’s request.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0269758011432954">24</xref>
</sup> The New South Wales and Michigan legislation allows for a family member or other representative of the victim to read out the victim’s statement in court.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0269758011432954">25</xref>
</sup> As said, some jurisdictions, including New South Wales, South Australia and Arizona, provide for the opportunity for an audio or audiovisual record of the person reading the statement to be played in court.<sup>

<title>Victims’ reservations about victim statements</title>
<p>To <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0269758011432954">Roberts and Erez (2004)</xref>, the fact that victim statements permit victims who do not want to meet their offender to communicate with him/her is an undisputable advantage of these statements. However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269758011432954">Ashworth (1993b</xref>) has written that victim statements are secure instruments. Ashworth did not sufficiently elaborate on this point for us to understand exactly what he meant, but it leads me to ask the general question of whether victims feel comfortable about making a victim statement. I will argue that victims may in fact feel somewhat vulnerable when participating in the criminal proceedings through a victim statement, and that participating in criminal justice through a victim statement is demanding for some if not all victims. Below I present some research material from which I have deduced at least four main examples of situations that make victims feel rather vulnerable and insecure when using victim statements, and thereby diminish the potential of these statements to lead to feelings of (procedural) justice.</p>
<p>The reader should keep in mind, first, that as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0269758011432954">Roberts (2009)</xref> remarked, no cross-jurisdictional research has yet been conducted on victim input at sentencing. The studies referred to below have been conducted in one single jurisdiction or present results of one single experiment, whereas the implementation of victim statement schemes is highly variable. Second, the aim of this article is not to compare the different regimes; this article offers an evidence-based reflection on the notion of victim statements. Third, victims are a highly heterogeneous group – one could say that the only thing uniting them is their experience of victimization. Victims differ greatly in terms of age, ethnic background, psychological and physical well-being, religion, social class, previous experiences with the criminal justice system as a victim or an offender, support needs, moral intuitions about crime and punishment, understanding of the criminal justice system, etc. All these factors may influence the extent to which the four arguments I make below apply to a particular victim. Also, one should bear in mind that the fact that victims may feel insecure about participating in criminal justice by means of a victim statement does not automatically imply that they will abandon the plan of participating or will not feel empowered afterwards. The article does not deny the promising results reported by evaluation studies on victim statement schemes (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269758011432954">Chalmers et al., 2007</xref>); it merely wishes to reflect on Ashworth's remark and, more generally, on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269758011432954">Dubber’s (2002</xref>: 336) warning that ‘not every opportunity for participation translates into an opportunity for self-assertion’. I point out that victim statements may cause victims some inconveniences – that they are not the easy instruments some may take them for.</p>

<title>Preparation of the victim statement</title>
<p>With respect to the preparation of the victim statement, two caveats are in order with a view to victim safety. First, perhaps contrary to expectations, not all victims write their victim statement themselves. In New Zealand,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0269758011432954">27</xref>
</sup> the Netherlands<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0269758011432954">28</xref>
</sup> and some American states (e.g. Colorado,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0269758011432954">29</xref>
</sup> New York,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0269758011432954">30</xref>
</sup> Ohio<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0269758011432954">31</xref>
</sup> and Connecticut<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0269758011432954">32</xref>
</sup>), for example, the statement is drafted by the police or judicial authorities or a victim support worker after a conversation with the victim. Second, in many jurisdictions in the United States,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0269758011432954">33</xref>
</sup> Australia<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0269758011432954">34</xref>
</sup> and Canada<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0269758011432954">35</xref>
</sup> victims are asked to fill in a standard document. This document constitutes their victim statement.</p>
<p>First, in relation to the use of standard documents, the document states the categories of harm on which the victim can provide information. The use of such standard documents is convenient for the judicial authorities. The statement, once finished by the police or judicial authorities, is ready for ‘legal consumption’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0269758011432954">Erez, 1999</xref>: 550) without further ado. However, the use of these forms seriously limits the victim’s autonomy in deciding which information to include in the statement. First of all, the form may not allow them to provide information about all the categories of harm they have suffered. Second, the space provided to the victim in such a form is often limited. Research on the pilot projects on victim statements conducted in 1997–98 in England and Wales demonstrated that most victim statements are rather short, or that victims only complete some sections of the form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0269758011432954">Hoyle et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0269758011432954">Morgan and Sanders, 1999</xref>). Therefore the argument may not be applicable to all victims, but space limitations may be highly disappointing to some victims. Though most statements indicate that extra sheets can be attached to the statement if the space provided is insufficient, the space limitation may give victims the message that what they have to say is not all that important (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269758011432954">Clarke, 2003</xref>). Victims participating in a South Australian study indicated that they would have appreciated more space on the victim statement form and more flexibility in the layout and structure of the form; some also had difficulties with the language (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0269758011432954">Victims Support Agency Victoria, 2009</xref>). A third issue is that asking victims to fill in a form may cause the victim to perceive this opportunity to complete a statement as a bureaucratic procedure. It is yet another form to fill in, adding to all the other administration that overburdens victims (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0269758011432954">Edwards, 2001</xref>). It may seem to them that they are helping out the criminal justice system instead of having the feeling that the system is helping them: it is ‘one more thing of the system that [the victim] need[s] to do’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0269758011432954">DuMont et al., 2007</xref>: 19). Indeed it has been argued that this mere fact may constitute a drawback in victim empowerment. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0269758011432954">Sanders et al. (2001</xref>: 453), for instance, assert that ‘instead of being asked to make one statement, victims are asked to make two statements. There is nothing empowering about that’. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0269758011432954">Sanders and Jones (2007</xref>: 296) write: ‘The complaint used to be that victims were used by the system: their witness statements were taken and then they were ignored. And now under the VPS scheme? Two statements are taken (witness and personal), and then both are ignored’. In this respect, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269758011432954">Ashworth’s (1993b</xref>: 509) contention that the right to submit a victim statement may be ‘high in profile but low in improving genuine respect for victims’, seems legitimate.</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0269758011432954">Roberts and Erez (2004)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0269758011432954">Erez (2004)</xref> have asserted that the form in which victim impact information is placed before the court may affect the ‘victim voice’. Indeed it may enhance or diminish the communicative potential of the victim statement. The use of standard documents undeniably <italic>diminishes</italic> the communicative potential of the victim statement, particularly when written by the police, the judicial authorities or others. This argument also applies to reading the statement in court: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0269758011432954">Meredith and Paquette (2001)</xref> found that a number of victims declined to read their victim statement aloud in court because of the restrictions on the contents of the statement.</p>
<p>The second caveat concerns the preparation of victim statements by professionals. In this respect four observations should be made. First, the completion of a victim statement by a counsellor or other professional is preceded by a conversation with the professional on the impact of the crime. Though this may at first sight seem an easy solution for victims as they do not need to make the effort of writing the statement themselves, it is not. Talking about the harm sustained by the crime could be to the victim a painful experience as details about the offence must be discussed and as such relived.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0269758011432954">36</xref>
</sup> A second observation relates to the information contained in the statement. Admittedly statements authored by victims themselves are highly likely to contain irrelevant information, while professionals do know exactly what information the judicial authorities will need in the sentencing stage. However, by the same token these professionals select from the information that victims give them during the conversation preceding the preparation of the statement. Only a statement prepared by the victim him/herself explains the consequences of the crime in the exact words of the victim (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0269758011432954">Erez, 2004</xref>). Research by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0269758011432954">Graham et al. (2004)</xref> in England and Wales points out that satisfaction about making a victim statement is highest among victims who self-completed their statement. Further evidence is provided by a Dutch study. Only one-third of the victims surveyed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0269758011432954">Kool et al. (2002)</xref> thought the content of the victim statement properly reflected the story they told the officer who wrote the statement. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0269758011432954">Sanders et al. (2001)</xref> have observed a recurrent mismatch between what is sought by the system and what is thought important by the victim. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0269758011432954">Herman (2005</xref>: 574) considers the two as ‘diametrically opposed’.</p>
<p>Third, I would add that when victim statements are written by other persons than the victim, the victim is promised involvement yet is immediately reduced to an object of justice again: control over the content of the statement is in other people’s hands and victim involvement is reduced to passively waiting for other people to write the statement. One can, indeed, wonder whether victim statements will contribute to victim empowerment if the power to write the statement is not in victims’ own hands.</p>
<p>A last finding worth mentioning concerns <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0269758011432954">Leverick et al.’s (2007)</xref> findings on whether victims feel upset after making a victim statement. Whereas 39 percent of respondents indeed found it an upsetting experience, 61 percent reported feeling better after making a victim statement. With respect to those finding it a difficult experience, the authors warn, first, that they did not necessarily perceive making a victim statement a <italic>negative</italic> experience; in fact, of the 34 respondents who found it upsetting, 20 reported feeling better afterwards. Second, those who found it stressful to make a victim statement had more often been the victim of serious offences. Leverick and colleagues’ findings thus are not too worrying, yet one must keep in mind that victims when writing a victim statement are forced to relive the victimization experience, which is something that they have to do at several points of the criminal justice process and which might for this reason very well be upsetting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0269758011432954">DuMont et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0269758011432954">
<title>Defendant access to the victim statement</title>
<p>As the victim statement is part of the judicial file, the offender will be able to read the statement. The rules on defendant access vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction in the sense that in some jurisdictions, e.g. in New Zealand<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-0269758011432954">37</xref>
</sup> and New South Wales,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-0269758011432954">38</xref>
</sup> the offender can read the victim statement but cannot keep a copy. In other jurisdictions, e.g. Canada,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-0269758011432954">39</xref>
</sup> Victoria,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-0269758011432954">40</xref>
</sup> Northern Territory<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-0269758011432954">41</xref>
</sup> and Virginia,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-0269758011432954">42</xref>
</sup> the offender does receive a copy of the victim statement.</p>
<p>From their view on victim statements as instruments bearing a strong communicative potential, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0269758011432954">Roberts and Erez (2004)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0269758011432954">Roberts (2009)</xref> claim that in order to prevent victims from being disappointed about the (typically small) impact of their victim statement, it is highly recommended to stress that the statement is as much addressed to the offender as it is to the court. Increased awareness of this communicative aspect of victim statements should lessen their expectations about the statement’s instrumental influence on sentencing. However, the knowledge that the statement will most likely be read by the offender appears to be one major reason for victims <italic>not</italic> to make a statement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0269758011432954">Hoyle et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269758011432954">Chalmers et al., 2007</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0269758011432954">Graham et al. (2004)</xref> find that some British victims who decided to make a victim statement reported that with hindsight they would not have done so with full understanding of the defendant’s access to the statement. Indeed, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0269758011432954">Graham et al. (2004</xref>: 17) write, ‘the defence team’s access to the VPS is a complex and important factor’; it seems to be an inhibiting factor more than it is a reason to make a statement. This is somewhat contradicted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0269758011432954">Leverick et al. (2007)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0269758011432954">Meredith and Paquette (2001)</xref>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0269758011432954">Leverick et al. (2007)</xref> found that to half of the victims surveyed, in Scotland, the knowledge that the offender would read the statement did not influence their decision on whether to file a victim statement. The other half of the sample was almost equally divided into those to whom defendant access to the statement was an encouraging element (23%) and those to whom it was a discouraging factor (21%). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0269758011432954">Meredith and Paquette (2001)</xref>, in sharp contrast to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0269758011432954">Graham et al. (2004)</xref>, found victims who did not know about the defendant’s access to the victim statement at the time of making their statement, reporting with hindsight that they would not have been deterred by this knowledge. One must, of course, keep in mind that this is what respondents retrospectively say they<italic> would have done</italic>, which we know is in the end not always what they would <italic>actually</italic> do. Also, as this result was obtained through focus group discussions, it is not certain whether victims with a dissenting opinion felt free to speak their mind in the group and to testify that they would have chosen not to file a statement.</p>
<p>The scholarly literature has listed three reasons for victims’ unease about defendant access to their victim statement. First, some victim statement forms list victims’ personal details (name, address, telephone number). Unsurprisingly, it is rather startling to victims that the offender might become familiar with these details. Yet legislators have taken measures in order to prevent offenders from becoming acquainted with this information. For example, section 25 of the New Zealand Victims’ Rights Act 2002 provides that a judicial officer may order that an offender or an offender’s lawyer is not given or shown part of the statement if withholding that part is necessary to protect the victim’s physical safety. Other victims have reported the concern that if the offender were to find out the details about the harm they sustained, ‘this would simply provide the offender with information that he could use in the future against the victim’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0269758011432954">Meredith and Paquette, 2001</xref>: 6). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0269758011432954">Herman (2005)</xref> reports that, to victims, the first and foremost priority after victimization is safety, for themselves and for others. The awareness that their offender may come to know their personal details, then, increases their fear of retaliation by the perpetrator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269758011432954">Chalmers et al., 2007</xref>). Eight percent of the victims surveyed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0269758011432954">Hoyle et al. (1998)</xref> in England and Wales declined to file a statement because they feared revenge. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269758011432954">Chalmers et al.’s (2007)</xref> evaluation of the pilot victim statement scheme in Scotland showed that fear of the accused was the second most common reason for not making a victim statement.</p>
<p>The same rationale – fear of revenge – underlies the second reason for victims’ concern about the defendant’s access to the statement. Research has abundantly shown that victims expect their victim statement to influence the judge’s decision. To 71 percent of those surveyed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0269758011432954">Erez et al. (1997)</xref> in South Australia this was the main reason to make a statement; 55 percent of the participants in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0269758011432954">Erez and Tontodonato’s (1992)</xref> United States study expected their statement to influence sentencing. Others, however, avoid making a statement out of, again, a fear of retaliation. Indeed the (false) sense that their statement may contribute to the offender’s conviction may make some victims contented, but increase fear of retaliation in other victims. Involving victims in the process that will lead to a verdict on their offenders’ culpability furthermore risks the use of coercion by the offender in order to keep his/her victim from filing a statement or to force the victim to revise the statement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0269758011432954">Ellison, 2002</xref>). The burden of co-deciding on another person’s future is quite intense in itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0269758011432954">Erez, 2000</xref>); it gets all the more intense if it also implies a risk of retaliation.</p>
<p>A third reason for victims’ unwillingness to make a statement because of offender access is that some victims above all do not want the defendant to know how the crime has affected them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0269758011432954">Graham et al., 2004</xref>), for example because they suspect the offender will take satisfaction from this knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0269758011432954">Meredith and Paquette, 2001</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0269758011432954">Pemberton (2005)</xref>, contrary to these arguments, declares that to victims it is of utmost importance that their message reaches the other parties to the conflict. He believes the uncertainty surrounding the defendant’s appraisal of the statement is a negative aspect of victim statements. The research reported above, conversely, demonstrates that to some victims it would rather be a relief to know that their offender will not see their statement.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0269758011432954">
<title>Presentation of the victim statement in court</title>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0269758011432954">Roberts and Erez (2004)</xref> observe that, after having completed a victim statement, the victim again assumes the role of passive onlooker. One way a victim can remedy this situation is by orally presenting the victim statement in court. In all jurisdictions discussed except England and Wales, the victim is allowed a few minutes to read the statement to those present in the courtroom. This right serves the expressive function of victim statements discussed above, and possibly enhances victims’ well-being by getting things off their chest. However, Dutch and Canadian studies demonstrate that few victims exert the right to speak in court (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0269758011432954">Kool et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0269758011432954">Roberts and Edgar, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0269758011432954">Leferink and Vos, 2008</xref>). Indeed, for the following three reasons, reading the victim statement in court may <italic>exacerbate</italic> victim distress.</p>
<p>First, the ‘formal, procedurally strict and often intimidating atmosphere of the courtroom’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0269758011432954">Wright, 2002</xref>: 663) is not a suitable setting for the expression of victim emotions. The courtroom is marked by ceremony, formality and etiquette, rituals, display of judicial power, enforced communication, a specific physical organization and a focus on efficiency and speediness that limit the space that can be provided to the individual, the subjective and the personal (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269758011432954">Bal and Ippel, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269758011432954">Beyens, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0269758011432954">Shapland, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269758011432954">Arrigo and Williams, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269758011432954">Dignan, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0269758011432954">Willemsens, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269758011432954">Aertsen, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0269758011432954">Kool and Moerings, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269758011432954">Aertsen and Beyens, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269758011432954">Beyens, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0269758011432954">Hol, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0269758011432954">Roach, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0269758011432954">Leest, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0269758011432954">Mulcahy, 2007</xref>). The feeling of being tolerated but not being particularly welcome may upset the victim, who came to court with the intention to take some time to tell his or her story during the trial.</p>
<p>Second, it has been argued that the right to read the victim statement in court should imply that the statement is open to challenge and cross-examination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269758011432954">Ashworth, 1993b</xref>). Indeed in nearly all countries where victim statements are in use, the defence has the right to cross-examine the victim about its contents. In England and Wales and in South Australia, cross-examination is the only way for the victim to directly address the court on the contents of the statement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0269758011432954">Roberts and Erez, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0269758011432954">Victims Support Agency Victoria, 2009</xref>). However, cross-examination is a difficult experience for victims (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0269758011432954">Erez, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0269758011432954">Roberts and Erez, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0269758011432954">Victims Support Agency Victoria, 2009</xref>), and many victims are alarmed after receiving information on what speaking in court actually entails. Research by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0269758011432954">Kool et al. (2006)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0269758011432954">Leferink and Vos (2008)</xref> in the Netherlands confirms that after receiving information about the right to speak in court, a substantial number of victims abandon their plan to speak in court. Indeed the victim suddenly stands on trial and finds him/herself listening to a legal professional summarizing his or her experience ‘in a way that may strip the account of its significance or uniqueness’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0269758011432954">Roberts and Erez, 2004</xref>: 234). For the victim, to hear that the hurt he or she has suffered is questioned or belittled is a very difficult and possibly traumatizing experience. This argument is not restricted to cross-examination by the defence counsel. The victim statement concerns private pain and grief that, if read aloud in court, is heard by the general public too and is then subject to public judgment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0269758011432954">Sarat, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0269758011432954">Meredith and Paquette, 2001</xref>). This too may worry victims and prevent them from reading a statement.</p>
<p>One comfort to victims may be that defence attorneys do not often exercise the right to challenge the victim statement because they risk antagonizing the court and thereby risk a negative effect on the sentence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0269758011432954">Henley et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0269758011432954">Erez and Rogers, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0269758011432954">Morgan and Sanders, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269758011432954">Chalmers et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0269758011432954">Victims Support Agency Victoria, 2009</xref>). Still the matter of cross-examination is not settled. For instance, research has shown that victims feel validated when receiving feedback on their statement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0269758011432954">Erez and Tontodonato, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0269758011432954">Sanders et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0269758011432954">Meredith and Paquette, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0269758011432954">Victims Support Agency Victoria, 2009</xref>), for example when the judge cites their own phrases (from the victim statement) in his/her sentencing comments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0269758011432954">Erez and Rogers, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0269758011432954">Erez, 1999</xref>). Hearing the judge acknowledging the victim’s harm as described in the victim statement has a strong empowering and therapeutic effect on victims (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0269758011432954">Victims Support Agency Victoria, 2009</xref>). Yet the fact that they wish the judge to comment on their statement seems to automatically imply that they should be prepared to also tolerate the defence’s comment on the statement.</p>
<p>The fact that the burden of speaking in court may well be too high is evinced by research in Australia in which victims who made a victim statement were asked open-ended questions about how the system could be improved. Only 2 out of 847 victims suggested allowing victims to speak in court (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0269758011432954">Erez et al., 1997</xref>). Yet, somewhat surprisingly in relation to the above, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0269758011432954">Leverick et al. (2007)</xref> found that for two-thirds of respondents the fact that they would be questioned about their victim statement in court did not influence their decision on whether to cooperate in the victim statement scheme. To the majority of the remainder of the sample, being questioned in court was an encouraging rather than an inhibiting factor.</p>
<p>Thirdly, it should be mentioned that support for prosecutors reading the victim statement in court is relatively low among proponents of victim statements. Though authors such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0269758011432954">Sumner (1987)</xref> feel that victim impact information should be provided in an objective, factual manner, preferably through the prosecutor, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0269758011432954">Roberts and Erez (2004)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0269758011432954">Erez (2004)</xref> deem the defendant less attentive to the statement and less likely to attach credibility to the contents when it is read by the prosecutor instead of the victim. The defendant may assume that the statement is just a continuation of the evidence brought against him or her. Also, hearing about the impact of the crime from the victim is more likely to encourage the offender to take responsibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0269758011432954">Erez, 2004</xref>) and assist in offender rehabilitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0269758011432954">Erez, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269758011432954">Cassell, 2009</xref>). From another angle, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269758011432954">Davis et al. (1984</xref>: 504) believe it is far more effective to present victims’ interests directly to the judge rather than rely on prosecutors bringing forward this information because prosecutors ‘are particularly likely to resist consideration of the victim’s point of view because it is prosecutor’s control that would be most eroded if the victim were given a greater voice’. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0269758011432954">Erez (2004</xref>: 494) worries that prosecutors may strip the statements of their meaning, ‘sanitizing’ the information, withholding information and presenting the statement in ‘clinical’ and generic terms.</p>

<title>Misunderstandings as to the purpose and use of victim statements</title>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0269758011432954">Edwards (2001</xref>: 39; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0269758011432954">2002</xref>) has observed that a lack of clarity surrounds victim statements. Questions about the rationale behind the statements’ introduction, the exact role of the victim and ‘the underlying reasons why it might be desirable to enable, encourage or even require participation’ puzzle governments. But these questions also operate on an individual level. It appears that victims are not sufficiently (made) aware of the possible uses to which their victim statements will be put and that the level of victim understanding about the purpose of victim statements is varying and sometimes low (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0269758011432954">Larson Sawin and Zehr, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0269758011432954">Victims Support Agency Victoria, 2009</xref>). Forty-three percent of respondents in the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0269758011432954">Leverick et al. (2007)</xref> Scottish study were not aware that the defendant would have access to their statement in case they decided to make one. Thirty-nine percent were not aware that they could be cross-examined in court, only 24 percent knew that it was possible to update their statement and only 16 percent of those who initially decided not to make a statement were aware that they could change their mind and still make a statement at a later stage. Studies furthermore show that where the victim statement is taken from the victim at the time of reporting the crime, victims often confuse their witness statement with the victim statement or do not even recall having made a victim statement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0269758011432954">Erez et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0269758011432954">Graham et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0269758011432954">Victims Support Agency Victoria, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0269758011432954">Roberts (2009</xref>: 358) observed that victim statement provisions are often ambiguous and imprecise: they ‘do little to promote a clear and consensual understanding of the purpose of impact statements. They are also likely to confuse victims and criminal justice professionals alike’. This is worrying because victims’ ignorance of the purposes of victim statements leads them to make statements for the wrong reason, leaving them dissatisfied about their participation because their expectations are dashed. For example, victims are not always aware that the decision to participate in a victim statement scheme is entirely theirs to make. Some victims believe that if there is an offer to make a victim statement, they are obliged to do so, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0269758011432954">Graham et al. (2004)</xref> found in England and Wales and the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0269758011432954">Victorian Victims Support Agency (2009)</xref> found in Victoria, Australia. However, this argument seems not to apply to all jurisdictions; results of the Scottish pilot study showed that more than 90 percent of the sample understood that the offer was not compulsory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0269758011432954">Leverick et al., 2007</xref>). Victims’ insufficient understanding about the purpose of victim statements is further evinced by the reasons for victims to make a statement that were listed by Graham et al. in a British study (2004). These include ‘the feeling that participation was compulsory’, ‘(mis)information about the scheme’ and ‘participating to assist the police’. Clearly, these are not the reasons that were foreseen by the victim statement scheme. Another often-mentioned motivation for victims to make a victim statement is the prospect that their victim statement will have an impact on the sentence. Fifty-five percent of the respondents in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0269758011432954">Erez and Tontodonato’s (1992)</xref> study in the United States expected their statement to have an impact on the sentence. Seventy-one percent of those surveyed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0269758011432954">Erez et al. in South Australia (1997)</xref> and one-quarter of the respondents in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0269758011432954">Leverick et al.’s Scottish study (2007)</xref> indicated that the prospect that the statement would influence the sentence was their main motivation to make a statement. With respect to the latter study, to the question of what they hoped the result of making an impact statement would be, 25 percent answered ‘a conviction’. Fifteen percent hoped for ‘a longer sentence’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0269758011432954">Leverick et al., 2007</xref>: 42). In the studies by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0269758011432954">Erez et al. (1997)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0269758011432954">Erez and Tontodonato (1992)</xref>, respondents whose expectation that there would be an impact on sentencing was not fulfilled were <italic>more</italic> dissatisfied with the sentence than victims who did not expect to have an impact on the sentence. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0269758011432954">Meredith and Paquette (2001)</xref>, asking victims which types of information they would have liked to give in their victim statement but were not allowed to, found that they would have valued the opportunity to make sentence recommendations. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0269758011432954">Meredith and Paquette (2001)</xref> furthermore report that victims who expected their statement to have an impact on sentencing yet whose expectations were dashed were those victims declaring that they would not participate in a victim statement scheme again in the future. Finally, judges surveyed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0269758011432954">Roberts and Edgar (2006)</xref> reported that notwithstanding the prohibition under Canadian law to include sentencing recommendations in a victim statement, 12 to 50 percent of the victim statements examined did contain such recommendations. The authors recommend that victims are better informed about the purpose of victim statements and the kinds of information that can and cannot be included in a victim statement. In the light of the research results reported here, this seems necessary indeed in order to prevent dissatisfaction with the victim statement scheme among victims. Yet the main challenge is to convey this message clearly to victims; as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0269758011432954">Roberts (2009)</xref> indicates, it is confusing and counterintuitive to victims to be told that it is important for them to make a victim statement (for communicative reasons), but that they cannot indicate their sentencing preferences on this statement. It may communicate a message that was well described by a social worker guiding Canadian victims of sexual assault in making a victim statement: ‘that you’re supposed to be … I don’t know – nice, good victims’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0269758011432954">DuMont et al., 2007</xref>: 11).</p>

<title>Conclusion and further reflection</title>
<p>Verrijn Stuart argues in a <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0269758011432954">1994</xref> essay that victims in present-day society are spoilt and unnecessarily pampered. Verrijn Stuart argues that point in response to the social trend that has been called ‘victimism’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0269758011432954">Garkawe, 2001</xref>: 93; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0269758011432954">Pollefeyt, 2000</xref>), ‘the victimalization of morality’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269758011432954">Boutellier, 1993</xref>: 28; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269758011432954">2000</xref>: 16), ‘the victims’ rights phenomenon’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0269758011432954">Hall, 1991</xref>: 233) and ‘the victim industry’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269758011432954">Best, 1999</xref>: 119). These and other terms express what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0269758011432954">Elias (1986</xref>: 3) noted, i.e. that ‘we anticipate victimization even more than we experience it’. Indeed, it is commonly agreed upon that in postmodern ‘high crime societies’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0269758011432954">Garland, 2000</xref>) victimization has become the common point of reference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269758011432954">Boutellier, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269758011432954">2000</xref>), which seems to have opened up inexhaustible credit for individuals who claim victim status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0269758011432954">Pollefeyt, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>The epitome of the spoilt victim, overindulged by society and the criminal justice system, stands in sharp contrast to the tenor of this article. This article has demonstrated that victims may not feel comfortable about all the opportunities for participation that the criminal justice system offers them today. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0269758011432954">Leest (2007</xref>: 91) in her doctoral dissertation drew attention to so-called lost victims (<italic>‘</italic>verdwaalde slachtoffers’), pointing to victims who get lost when they come across the set of rights and opportunities that were created to cater for their needs. Leest herself reported on victims to whom the offer to participate in victim offender mediation was as unclear as all the other paperwork and official bodies they encountered. Victim statements in my opinion provide another example of instruments that risk producing lost victims.</p>
<p>In this article I have listed four aspects of the use of victim statements that may confuse victims who are considering whether to participate in a victim statement scheme. These concern (1) the preparation of the victim statement, (2) defendant access to the victim statement, (3) the presentation of the victim statement in court and (4) misunderstandings as to the purpose and use of victim statements. These are (at least) four perilous aspects of victim statements that may generate lost victims and that should prevent victimologists from bluntly promoting victim statements. Though these four aspects do not apply to all victims in the same way, I do believe these aspects should prompt victimologists to reconsider the extent to which the statements provide for an appropriate ‘avenue of communication’, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0269758011432954">Roberts and Erez (2004</xref>: 230) put it.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-0269758011432954">43</xref>
</sup> I do not deny the communicative potential of victim statements, but propose that in order to fully realize this communicative potential, more security must be offered to victims who consider making a victim statement. A secure climate, then, should be fostered at two levels. First, victims who prepare a victim statement should be able to do so in an open and safe environment in which all their doubts and concerns can be discussed. Second, measures should be considered to make victims who enter a court of law feel more comfortable.</p>
<p>In order to realize security at the first, rather general level, I suggest that good preparation practices are indispensable. It has been shown that the meticulous preparation of victims who participate in victim offender mediation or conferencing is an important reason for victims’ satisfaction with these schemes and their general success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0269758011432954">Flaten, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0269758011432954">Strang, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0269758011432954">Shapland et al., 2006</xref>). Therefore I suggest involving victim support organizations in victim statement schemes. When preparing a victim statement, a victim should be able to talk to a victim support worker. Such a conversation allows the victim to safely utter his or her concerns and is at the same time the most appropriate place to convey information about the scheme to the victim. In the Netherlands, it is common practice for victim support workers to assist victims who prepare a victim statement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0269758011432954">Slachtofferhulp Nederland, 2008</xref>). I argue that this type of support should be encouraged, because it has shown such good results with respect to victim offender mediation and conferencing. The fact that potential concerns about victim statements – resulting from a lack of preparation of the statement, the awareness of the defendant’s access to the statement or misunderstanding as to the purpose of the statements –are discussed in an open atmosphere should prevent these concerns from becoming sources of dissatisfaction after participation in the scheme. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0269758011432954">Erez (2004</xref>: 493) writes, ‘erroneous assumptions (…) can be prevented with proper directions’. Proper preparation can prevent much disappointment about using victim statements.</p>
<p>Note that involving victim support workers in the preparation phase of the victim statement scheme is one additional way to realize the communicative potential of victim statements. The possibility of (partly) realizing the communicative potential of victim statements <italic>outside</italic> the courtroom has not previously been discussed. Indeed, generally only two relations are considered: the victim–offender relation and the victim–judge relation. It is supposed that if any communication is to originate from victim statements, it is bound to take place in court. I suggest adding a third relation, i.e. the victim–victim support worker relation. Indeed, I believe that the assistance of a victim support worker in preparing the victim statement can realize part of its communicative potential. The ‘avenue of communication’ that results from victim statements, I argue, goes beyond the courtroom.</p>
<p>Secondly, I would like to consider possibilities to offer safety to victims in the courtroom so as to serve the goal of communication in the presence of a conflict party, in a climate that impedes power-free, equal communication (see above) and is potentially threatening. As above, I suggest consulting the literature on mediation. Looking at best practices concerning victim–offender mediation allows us to understand the importance of, as said, thorough preparation of victims, but also of very practical conditions. One such practical condition relates to seating arrangements. Both the victims participating in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0269758011432954">Leest’s (2007)</xref> doctoral research and Mark <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0269758011432954">Umbreit (2001)</xref>, one of the academic fathers of mediation, stressed the importance of seating arrangements in mediation:<disp-quote>
<p>To ensure the safety of the victim, the mediation should be conducted in a location that feels safe to the victim, and the victim should be encouraged to bring along a support person or two if so desired. … In addition, victims may find it reassuring to have input on the arrangement of the room and the seating of the parties. … Victims should be encouraged to consider the advantages and disadvantages of particular settings. The final decision, however, should be the victim’s. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0269758011432954">Umbreit, 2001</xref>: 21-23)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Currently, the court setting is highly formalistic and fixed. The use of the space in the courtroom is fixed: every chair, every desk, every seat is designated for one specific participant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0269758011432954">Rock, 1993</xref>). It led <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0269758011432954">Rock (1993</xref>: 261) to describe the courtroom as ‘a great engine of social control’, with the court’s physical structure being a transcription of its social structure. Perhaps for this very reason, great resistance exists among magistrates to adaptations to these ‘spatial relations’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0269758011432954">Rock, 1993</xref>: 237).</p>
<p>Yet I suggest that such an adaptation may be desirable when it comes to the spatial relation between the disputants. Disputants in court typically stand next to each other facing the judge, which obstructs natural eye contact – <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0269758011432954">Rock (1993</xref>: 235) talks about the presence or absence of ‘lines of sight’. Communication, therefore, remains limited to a question-and-answer format: the judge asks questions that the parties answer; those parties never enter into a direct communication, not even nonverbally. Would it, within the framework of the law, not be possible to adjust the current court setting so as to create a setting where the disputants, if they wish so, sit across from each other, face-to-face, the judge leaves his bench and sits on one table with the disputants? Such a setting, which greatly facilitates communication during victim–offender mediation, would resemble everyday situations, whereas the courtroom is a context which is particularly ‘dissimilar to and removed from their daily lives’, the novelty of which ‘creates uncertainty about the appropriate way to behave’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269758011432954">AFG, 1975</xref>: 1275).</p>
<p>Indeed, I propose that, given the fact that the architectural design of the courtroom can greatly affect the quality of the substantive exchange, appropriate courtroom design is a necessary precondition for such qualitative exchanges to occur, if our conceptualization of ‘communication’ implies more than mere cross-examination. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0269758011432954">Weijers (2004</xref>: 26) argues that communication in the courtroom ‘comprises more than words. It is also about how things are said, the whole staging of the dialogue between the offender, the magistrates, the prosecutor and the lawyer, and the rituals in court. It is about the roles and attitudes of all the people concerned’. The courtroom design impinges on several of these aspects. It affects spatial relations, i.e. the physical position that people take in court and how they relate to each other. It also depicts power relations, and affects who is in visual proximity (in ‘line of sight’) and whether the disputants can perceive each other’s nonverbal, subtle behaviour and gesticulations. It may minimize or maximize opportunities for unintended or intended influence, etc. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269758011432954">AFG, 1975</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0269758011432954">Rock (1993</xref>: 197) too noted that ‘the very arrangement of physical space in the [court] confirms identities, segregates groups, and manages relations’.</p>
<p>I realize that others of Umbreit’s recommendations concerning mediation, for example stating that ‘victims should have the opportunity to choose whether they speak first during the initial narrative portion of the mediation session or whether they speak last’ (2001: 24), are harder to organize within the legal setting. But a mere reorganization of the courtroom setting may provide for a more appropriate atmosphere to realize communication, using, for instance, a victim statement.</p>
<p>By way of general conclusion, I repeat that victim statements were designed to increase victims’ sense of involvement in the criminal justice system and thereby enhance their perceptions that justice is done, but that it is to be feared that the above-mentioned concerns, if not dealt with, may hamper this process.</p>
