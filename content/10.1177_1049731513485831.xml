<bold>
<italic>Research on Social Work Practice</italic>
</bold> is a disciplinary journal devoted to the publication of empirical research concerning the assessment methods and outcomes of social work practice. Social work practice is broadly interpreted to refer to the application of intentionally designed social work intervention programs to problems of societal and/or interpersonal importance. Interventions include behavior analysis and therapy, psychotherapy or counseling with individuals, case management/care coordination, education, supervision, practice involving couples, families, or small groups, advocacy, community practice, organizational management, and the evaluation of social policies. At least one author of a submitted article must be a professional social worker, and/or the interventions evaluated must have been provided by professional social workers.</p>
<p>The journal will primarily serve as an outlet for the publication of:</p>
<list list-type="order">
<list-item>
<p>Original reports of empirically-based evaluation studies on the outcomes of social work practice; </p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Original reports of empirical studies on the development and validation of assessment methods useful in social work research or practice; and </p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Original systematic reviews or meta-analyses of the practice-research literature that convey direct applications (not simply implications) to social work practice. The websites of the Cochrane and Campbell Collaborations provide exemplary guidelines for the design and conduct of systematic reviews, and authors contemplating submitting such studies are urged to follow these standards. The two types of systematic reviews considered for publication are:<list list-type="alpha-upper">
<list-item>
<p>Systematic reviews of the evidence-based status of a particular psychosocial intervention or assessment method, or </p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Systematic reviews of different psychosocial interventions applicable to clients with a particular psychosocial problem.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>The journal welcomes empirical research appropriately derived from a variety of etiological and interventive theories, as well as studies which focus on evaluation and assessment issues not based upon formal theoretical frameworks. Studies using diverse methodologies, such as group or single-system research designs, and/or quantitative and qualitative approaches, are invited, as are interdisciplinary works. Replication studies <italic>are</italic> welcome, as are well-designed studies with negative findings or reports of treatment failures. Authors are encouraged to submit <italic>only</italic> articles of the highest quality for editorial review and possible publication. The submission of seriously flawed or marginal studies is discouraged. Reports of inferential statistics involving significant differences <italic>must</italic> be accompanied by suitable measures (and a discussion of their clinical importance) of effect sizes and/or proportions of variance potentially accounted for by an intervention.</p>
<p>
<bold>Manuscripts which do not fit into one of the above categories should not be submitted</bold>, and if received will be returned to the author un-reviewed. Occasionally other types of submissions apart from those listed above are published in the journal (guest editorials, research center descriptions), but these are usually invited and accepted at the discretion of the Editor. </p>
<p>
<bold>Inappropriate Submissions: </bold>The journal <bold>does not</bold> usually publish surveys, program descriptions, theoretical, philosophical or conceptual works, correlational investigations, retrospective predictor studies, purely methodological articles, descriptive studies, or needs assessments. Authors are urged to submit such studies to the many other social work journals which do not have the intervention-research focus of <italic>Research on Social Work Practice</italic>. </p>
<p>The journal does publish book reviews, and the authors of newly published books who believe that their book’s subject matter is congruent with the focus of the journal are encouraged to contact the Editor with respect to arranging a review, as are individuals who themselves wish to author a book review of a newly published book. The submission of unsolicited book reviews is welcome, providing the work relates to research on social work practice. Book reviews should be formatted in strict APA-style, and submitted as an email attachment in MicroSoft Word, to the Editor, at Bthyer@fsu.edu. A copy of <italic>RSWP</italic> <italic>Guidelines for Book Reviews</italic> is also available from the Editor, upon request.</p>
<p>The journal publishes occasional special issues devoted to a particular topic and readers with an interest in proposing a topic for such a special issue and to serve as a Guest Editor for that issue are welcome to contact the Editor.</p>
<p>
<bold>How to submit a manuscript: </bold>The journal requires authors to use the MANUSCRIPT CENTRAL web-based portal to submit their manuscripts. The submission portal is available via the link below:</p>
<p>
<bold>Visit <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rswp">http://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rswp</ext-link></bold> </p>
<p>Submissions are required to be prepared using the formatting standards found in the 6th Edition (2010) of the APA Publication Manual. Authors are specifically asked to adhere to the relevant Journal Article Reporting Standards (JARS) found on pp. 245– 252 of the APA Manual. Reports of quasi-experiments or randomized controlled trials must also include a participant flowchart (see page 253 of the APA Manual). The Editor is available to consult with you about any questions you may have regarding complying with these standards. They have been adopted to help promote consistency in research reporting, to try and further elevate the standards of work appearing in <italic>Research on Social Work Practice</italic>, and to ultimately improve the credibility of research findings available to the profession and the public. The abstracts of research articles must include the following headings: Objective:, Methods:, Results:, Conclusions:.</p>
<p>All manuscripts should include an abstract on a separate page that contains no more than 150 words, and also a separate title page (designated as Title Page) which includes: 1) title of the article; 2) corresponding author's full name, current position, affiliation, institutional and email address, telephone and fax numbers; 3) co-author(s)' full name(s) and affiliation(s); 4) up to five key words as they should appear if they were to be published. Manuscripts will not be considered for submission if they do not include these elements. Tables and/or Figures are to be included when necessary to depict the results. There is no specific limit on the total number of pages, table or figures. </p>
<p>Authors submitting manuscripts are protected by common law against the unauthorized use of their unpublished work. Specifically, an unpublished manuscript is considered to be a confidential or privileged paper. Reviewers will be asked to destroy or return the manuscript after their review is completed; in addition, reviewers will be asked not to circulate, quote, cite, or refer to the unpublished work in any way unless specific permission is granted by the author.</p>

<title>Artwork Submissions</title>
<p>High-resolution figures should be uploaded as separate electronic files, with callouts for each in the text. Figure legends should include full explanations of the figures and be typewritten double-spaced with numbers corresponding to those on the figure files themselves. All figures must be specifically referred to in the text and numbered in order of appearance in the text. Acceptable file formats for figures include TIFF, EPS, and JPEG, and PDF Microsoft Application Files are acceptable for vector art (line art). Permission for use of the copyrighted material is the responsibility of the author. All artwork must be camera ready. </p>
<sec id="section2-1049731513485831">
<title>Tables</title>
<p>Tables should be numbered consecutively corresponding to in-text citation. Each table should be prepared on a separate page at the end of the text document and preferably should be no larger than a single page. Include a brief descriptive title of the table and a footnote with explanation of any abbreviations. All tables must be specifically referred to in the text and numbered in order of appearance in the text. Elements in tables should be separated by tabs, not cells or lines. </p>

<title>Publish Ahead of Print With Onlinefirst</title>
<p>Onlinefirst is a feature in which completed articles are published online prior to their inclusion in a print issue, offering authors the advantage of making their research accessible to the public in a more timely manner. Only online subscribers can view these PDFs, but abstracts are available to the public to view for free. Each Onlinefirst manuscript is citable by the publication date of the manuscript’s first online posting and the Digital Object Identifier (DOI), providing a persistent, permanent way to identify manuscripts published in the online environment. You can cite Onlinefirst articles as follows: </p>
<p>Author’s last name, first initials. Article title. Journal title. Prepublished month day, year; DOI: 10.1177/0123456789123456 </p>
<p>Once your article has completed the production process and before it is published in a print issue, it will be posted online. You can access RSWP Onlinefirst articles on the Web at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://rswp.sagepub.com/pap.dtl">http://rswp.sagepub.com/pap.dtl</ext-link>. Once posted online, articles may not be retracted or edited. If your article is not completed prior to its publication date, it will not go on Onlinefirst but will be posted online with the issue in which it is published.</p>
<p>The journal uses a blind peer review system to evaluate manuscripts, and the expertise of the Editorial Board members is augmented by the extensive use of Guest Reviewers. Most authors receive an initial editorial decision within two months of submission, accompanied by constructive peer commentary. Most articles eventually accepted for publication undergo extensive author-completed revisions, based on peer-review commentary, prior to acceptance. The journal has a modest backlog of accepted manuscripts, thus the authors of accepted manuscripts can expect a lag of about 6 months or less from final acceptance to print publication. However the journal has a publish-ahead-of-print service in that the final, corrected and accepted version of their paper will be published electronically on the journal’s website, with a DOI. This will permit its ready access to the community of scholars, students, and practitioners months ahead of print publication. These articles will be both citable and downloadable. Articles are published in the general order of their acceptance. </p>
<p>An invitation to join the journal’s Editorial Board is published in the journal every three years, prior to the appointment of a new board. All readers possessing suitable backgrounds in social work practice and research are welcome to nominate themselves to the Editorial Board. In addition, individuals such as experienced MSWs or doctoral students who wish to serve as occasional <italic>Guest Reviewers</italic> are welcome to contact the Editor about their interest. </p>
