<title>Russell N. Baird</title>
<p>Russell N. Baird, a retired Ohio University journalism professor, died March 29, 2012, in New Marshfield, Ohio. He was eighty-nine.</p>
<p>Baird was born in Joffre, Pennsylvania, the son of Robert and Anna Baird, and earned his bachelor’s degree at Kent State University and attended a special program at Ohio State University before earning his master’s degree in 1947 at the University of Wisconsin. He began his journalistic career in high school, reporting for the <italic>Parma Citizen</italic>. At Kent State, Baird was a Kent Bureau reporter for the <italic>Akron Beacon Journal</italic> and also worked in the sports publicity office at the university.</p>
<p>While in the U.S. Army during WWII, he worked for <italic>Stars and Stripes</italic> as a combat correspondent. A participant in the Battle of the Bulge, Baird was awarded a Bronze Star for covering news under fire.</p>
<p>He taught at Bowling Green State University for five years before moving to Ohio University, where Baird taught journalism history, typography/graphics, and magazine production. Baird wrote four books and numerous articles, monographs, and abstracts. His first book was <italic>Industrial and Business Journalism</italic> (1961). Most widely used among Baird’s textbooks were <italic>Graphics of Communication</italic> (with long-time office mate A. T. Turnbull) and <italic>Magazine Editing and Production</italic> (with J. W. Click) — each published in six editions. His academic study, <italic>The Penal Press</italic>, funded by a Baker Research grant to study prison newspapers, attracted the attention of both state and national corrections officials, resulting in his being invited to take part in relevant commissions. Baird also was executive secretary of the Ohio College Newspaper Association for ten years. He retired from teaching in 1981, then focusing on enlarging the family’s Christmas tree farm near New Marshfield.</p>
<p>Kent State named Baird as Alumnus of the Year in 1964, the Society for Professional Journalists’ gave him its Distinguished Teaching in Journalism Award in 1982, and Ohio University’s E. W. Scripps School of Journalism named its graphics lab for him in 1985.</p>
<p>He is survived by his wife, Cecelia (Tate) Spencer Baird; five children, Mary Ellen Shaw of Falls Church, Virginia; Russell J. Baird of Houston; Margaret Goodwin of Athens, Ohio; Michael Baird of Pickerington, Ohio; and Jane Baird of Mankato, Minnesota; six grandchildren, and eight great-grandchildren; and other relatives.</p>

<title>Stanley L. Harrison</title>
<p>Stanley L. Harrison, professor of communication at the University of Miami (Florida), died April 5, 2012. He was eighty-one.</p>
<p>[By his University of Miami colleague Dr. Thomas M. Steinfatt:] Obituaries typically claim that the person in question was a kind and gentle soul, beloved by everyone. Professor Harrison was not such an individual. Those who took the time to know him learned of his depth of thought and scholarship, of his dry sense of humor, and of his caring. But he spoke his mind exactly as he believed, and pulled no punches with anyone. More than a few people did not like him, and he could [not] have cared less. It is rare to find an individual who truly achieves a goal most of us express, of being true to oneself to the very end. It was refreshing to be with him because he was so unique, refusing to copy or kowtow to the beliefs of others, a characteristic of many of those who truly influence positive change in society. His strong sense of humor and insight into the motives of others were just a few of the reasons that I both liked and respected him greatly, and spoke with him often. He did not take time to greet many of the people he passed in the hall, and if he thought an idea, proposal, or person was not worth the time of day, he expressed that feeling through unmistakable nonverbals if not outright contempt. Students in his classes knew he would never let an error slide or tolerate anything but the best, and respected him for the directness and honesty that honed their skills. An expert on Mencken, Stan worked as a copy boy at the <italic>Baltimore Sun</italic> during the last days of Mencken’s career, later becoming the leading collector, analyzer, and interpreter of Mencken’s work, and the editor of the principal Mencken journal. Commenting on Stan’s book, <italic>Mencken Revisited</italic>, a reviewer remarked: “Often as acerbic and opinionated as Mencken himself, Harrison demonstrates his exasperation with modern modes of ‘politically correct’ writing and disdain for the continuing inept journalism education that Mencken castigated.” And like Mencken, Stan recently suffered a stroke that left him fully conscious but unable to speak. If you did not know Stan, you missed knowing an American original, in the best sense, and one of the great teachers of our time. I will miss him dearly.</p>

<title>Barnetta Davis Lange</title>
<p>Barnetta Davis Lange, a retired Point Park University journalism professor, died March 30, 2012, in West Aliquippa, Pennsylvania, after suffering a stroke. She was ninety-five.</p>

After graduation, she continued her studies with two of Pittsburgh’s preeminent piano teachers, Arthur Schnobel and Ferguson Webster.

She herself performed publicly almost until her death.</p>
<p>She married Arnold Lange in 1943. He died in 1983.</p>
<p>Lange was for many years a staff writer at Pittsburgh’s <italic>Jewish Criterion</italic> (now <italic>Jewish Chronicle</italic>), which led to teaching at Point Park University and earning a PhD at the University of Pittsburgh.</p>

<title>Peter Lord</title>
<p>Peter Lord, a University of Rhode Island journalism professor, died April 4, 2012, from cancer, in Newport, Rhode Island. He was sixty.</p>
<p>He graduated from the University of Connecticut in 1973 and worked for <italic>The Day</italic> newspaper in New London, Connecticut. Starting in 1979, Lord developed a national reputation as an environmental reporter for the <italic>Providence Journal</italic>, covering everything from oil spills to global warming, from the United States to the Arctic Circle.</p>
<p>He spent one year teaching journalism full-time in 1988–89, and taught as an adjunct in the journalism department for about twelve years total while also working as journalism director for the Metcalf Institute for Marine and Environmental Journalism. About five years ago, Lord earned a master’s degree in marine affairs at URI. He taught courses including environmental reporting, media writing, public affairs reporting, and magazine article and feature writing.</p>

<title>Ben Silver</title>

<title>George E. Stevens</title>
<p>George E. Stevens, a retired Purdue University journalism professor, died April 5, 2012, of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. He was seventy-five.</p>
<p>Stevens was born on July 12, 1936, in Vancouver, Washington, and in 1958 earned his bachelor’s degree from Pacific University. He then covered local news for two years for a weekly newspaper in Ellensburg, Washington. In 1962, Stevens earned his MA from the University of Minnesota, followed by his PhD there in 1968. He first taught at the University of Cincinnati before moving to Purdue in 1969. On December 20, 1969, Stevens married Laura J. Stoner, a research associate in Purdue’s Department of Nutrition Science.</p>
<p>Soon after joining Purdue, he liked to say, he was “traded” to the Department of Communication “for a desk and three chairs” when the journalism curriculum was moved from English to Communication. Stevens even often quipped, “English got the better of the deal,” at communication department events.</p>
<p>He wrote more than seventy academic journal articles, as well as two books, <italic>The Student Journalist and Public Opinion Polling</italic>, and <italic>Law and the Student Press</italic> (the latter with John Webster). A 1993 University of Miami study put Stevens in the top 3 percent of active communication researchers, <italic>Communication Monographs</italic> in 1999 listed him sixty-ninth among all communication scholars during 1915–95, and a 1988 <italic>Journalism Quarterly</italic> article listed him fourth in productivity for the period 1980–85.</p>
<p>He taught various First Amendment–related courses, plus magazine journalism, journalistic writing, and mass media history.</p>
<p>In addition to his wife, Stevens is survived by their two sons, John H. and Jeffrey G.</p>
