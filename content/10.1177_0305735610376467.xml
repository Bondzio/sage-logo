<abstract>
<p>The purpose of this study was to determine whether preferences for recorded piano versus harpsichord renditions of the same music, controlled for tempo and pitch level, would be affected by style, tempo, and musical experience. Two hundred and eighty undergraduate music majors and non-majors heard 12 pairs of excerpts. Each pair consisted of a recording performed on piano and a recording performed on harpsichord. Participants chose the version they preferred, or chose no preference. Results showed that musical experience affected preferences: preference for piano was significantly stronger for non-majors than for majors, and for participants who never learned to play a musical instrument than for participants who had at least one year of applied musical experience. Preference for harpsichord was stronger for performers than non-performers, and approached significance in the major–non-major comparison. Both majors and non-majors chose harpsichord versions more frequently when excerpts were fast rather than slow, and when they were of Renaissance music than when they were of Baroque music. Harpsichord was preferred over piano in only 2 of the 12 trials, and both were of fast Renaissance music.</p>

<body>
<p>Imagine two performances of the same music, differing only in timbre. Why should a listener prefer one over the other?</p>
<p>Perhaps the most obvious reason resides in differences between physical sound characteristics of the instruments. Listeners may simply prefer the sound of a given instrument to the sound of another. The determination of preferences for instrumental timbre has been of concern in music education, and in fact has led to the creation of a standardized preference test for timbre (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0305735610376467">Gordon, 1986</xref>) and to subsequent research stemming from it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0305735610376467">Gordon, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0305735610376467">Gordon, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0305735610376467">Williams, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>Factors other than tone quality, but which are inseparable characteristics of instruments, may play a role as well. For example, the harpsichord differs from the piano in that it has a more limited dynamic range, its notes decay faster, and it is incapable of making subtle dynamic gradations.</p>
<p>Additional variables may be more obviously based on previous experience. For example, instrument preference may be related to familiarity. Much research has shown that musical characteristics familiar to the listener are often preferred to less unfamiliar characteristics. This has been shown to be the case for arrangements of world music (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0305735610376467">Demorest &amp; Schultz, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0305735610376467">Fung, 1996</xref>), musical styles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0305735610376467">Boyle, Hosterman, &amp; Ramsey, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0305735610376467">LeBlanc, Sims, Siivola, &amp; Obert, 1996</xref>), instrument selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0305735610376467">Abeles &amp; Porter, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0305735610376467">Delzell &amp; Leppla, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0305735610376467">Fortney, Boyle, &amp; DeCarbo, 1993</xref>), and musical interpretation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0305735610376467">LeBlanc &amp; Sherrill, 1986</xref>). One might therefore suppose that the piano’s greater popularity as compared to the harpsichord is a result of its ubiquitous nature. Pianos are heard everywhere, whereas harpsichord music is almost never heard, other than in performances of Baroque music and in the odd horror movie.</p>
<p>Preference for the familiar, however, does not explain why instrumental preference changes over centuries. For some time after the piano’s invention, harpsichords were more familiar to musicians than were pianos. Despite this fact, the piano eventually superseded the harpsichord to such an extent that by the beginning of the 20th century the harpsichord was virtually an endangered musical species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0305735610376467">Donington, 1963</xref>). Perhaps the most important reason for this change was that the piano, with its greater range, power and sustaining ability, became an instrument of choice for composers of the late 18th, 19th and 20th centuries.</p>
<p>It is also possible that instrument preference may be related to musical style. One may prefer the piano when listening to 19th-century music, for example, and the harpsichord for Scarlatti or Bach. Such preferences of course might arise as a function of familiarity, in which case it is not unreasonable to predict that the more musicians employ historically informed practices in their concerts and recordings, the greater will be their listeners’ preferences for such practices. On the other hand, this prediction would not be expected to hold for listeners who are not exposed to informed performances. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0305735610376467">Gotlieb and Konecˇni (1985)</xref> examined the preferences of university students for recorded performances of Bach’s ‘Goldberg’ Variations. These students were not music majors, and in fact data from the study revealed that they were somewhat unfamiliar with Baroque music. Gotlieb and Konecˇni found that preference was not strongly related to whether or not the music was played on harpsichord or piano. Of 15 bipolar scales examined, only two revealed differences between the piano and harpsichord versions: the piano versions were rated as more pleasing and more beautiful (or less ugly) than the harpsichord versions.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0305735610376467">Schubert and Fabian (2005)</xref> asked 98 advanced undergraduate music students to assign from one to three adjectives to 22 harpsichord and 12 piano performances of a variation from the ‘Goldberg’ Variations. On the basis of students’ adjective selection, the researchers were able to cluster the performances into five distinct groups. Of interest is the fact that three of the five clusters included no piano performances (‘restless/agitated’, ‘bright/happy’ and ‘majestic/serious’), whereas the ‘delicate/graceful’ cluster encompassed 8 of the 12 piano performances. In general, the harpsichord performances were rated as being both more negative and more arousing than the piano versions. It thus appears that the relatively sophisticated listeners in this study assigned different emotional meanings to piano and harpsichord performances.</p>
<p>Proponents both for and against the performance of Bach on the piano have based their arguments on suitability of the instrument for the music at hand, rather than on the notion that the piano is inherently superior to the harpsichord. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0305735610376467">Hewitt (2005)</xref> refers to the nature of the music as a determining factor to justify her preference for the piano over the harpsichord:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>On the harpsichord, you can’t imitate the human voice by tapering a phrase – it must have disappointed people in Bach’s time and I’m sure that Bach would have been thrilled to have had a keyboard instrument that could do this. The invention of the piano enabled this, and also produced a more powerful sound. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0305735610376467">Hewitt, 2005</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Proponents of historically informed performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0305735610376467">Kenyon, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0305735610376467">Kivy, 1995</xref>) also argue that instrumental preference cannot be divorced from consideration of the music to be performed. However, they arrive at a conclusion very different from that reached by proponents of piano performance. They claim that the harpsichord is more suitable than the modern grand piano for Renaissance, Baroque and early Classical keyboard music not only because composers wrote for the harpsichord rather than the piano, but because the harpsichord’s thinner tone, quicker decay and lack of incremental dynamic change makes it a better choice for the presentation of contrapuntal music and terraced dynamics consistent with early musical styles. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0305735610376467">Dolmetsch (1958)</xref> made a powerful case for the harpsichord on the basis of its registrational abilities:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The true orchestral grandeur of Bach’s Italian Concerto, for instance, can only be revealed by performance on a full-sized double-manual harpsichord with 8-ft. unisons, 16-ft. and 4-ft. stops. By employing these divers tone-colours separately or combined, solo and tutti effects can be produced which are mechanically unobtainable on the modern piano with its one sound per key. The slow movement of this Concerto, so uninspiring at the hands of most pianists, springs to life when contrasting registrations are introduced. (p. 605)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Others have argued that although the harpsichord is a more appropriate vehicle for Baroque keyboard music than is the piano, the conditions under which the harpsichord can demonstrate its superiority often have been difficult to attain. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0305735610376467">Fabian (2004</xref>, pp. 55–56), for example, reviewed literature from the second half of the 20th century in which issues such as poor or misguided instrument construction, deficient harpsichord technique and misuse of the instrument have prevented a fair comparison between the best of piano and harpsichord performances. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0305735610376467">Hubbard (1965)</xref> noted that it was not uncommon for performers to overuse the 16-foot stop: ‘Seeking nobility and definition of line, they find only an inflated and muttering obscurity’ (p. 184).</p>
<p>In the present study, we investigated preferences for piano and harpsichord versions of Renaissance and Baroque keyboard music. Specifically, we were interested in whether preferences for these instruments would be affected by musical style, musical experience of listeners and excerpt tempo. We hypothesized that although the piano was likely to be more preferred overall than the harpsichord, participants with greater musical knowledge and experience would show more of a preference for the harpsichord than more musically naive listeners. We also hypothesized that keyboard music from the Renaissance would yield a higher preference for the harpsichord over the piano than would Baroque keyboard music, as piano versions of Renaissance keyboard music are far less familiar than are piano versions of Baroque keyboard music. Finally, we expected tempo of musical excerpts to affect instrument preference as well. Specifically, we surmised that the quick decay of harpsichord tones would make it less preferred for slow excerpts than for fast excerpts.</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>Two hundred and eighty participants took part in the experiment. All were undergraduate majors attending a large North American university. One hundred and thirty-four were music majors and 146 were non-music majors. Two hundred and nine participants (75%) studied at least one musical instrument or had vocal training for a minimum of one year. This group included 52 pianists but no harpsichordists. Playing experience varied from 1 to 27 years, and averaged 6.5 years. Henceforth we refer to this variable as applied musical experience, with participants labeled as either players (having studied for a minimum of a year) or non-players (having studied for less than a year).</p>

<sec id="section3-0305735610376467">
<title>Preparation of experimental materials</title>
<p>Recorded excerpts were taken from commercial compact discs. Twenty-four excerpts were created. These excerpts varied from 35 to 45 seconds and consisted of one harpsichord and one piano version each for 12 different pieces. A software program (Peak, manufacturer: Berkley Integrated Audio Software) was used to modify trial excerpt pairs so that they were exactly the same in duration and in pitch level. The duration of each harpsichord–piano pair was set at the mean duration of the two excerpts combined. Pitch level was similarly adjusted: the harpsichord excerpt was adjusted upwards the same number of cents that the piano excerpt was adjusted downwards. Using Peak, overall loudness of harpsichord–piano pairs was modified so that they were similar. This was done by lowering the dB level of the louder excerpt of the pair and increasing the dB level of the softer excerpt so that as judged by the investigators, the loudness of the two excerpts appeared to be equivalent.</p>
<p>Of the 12 excerpt pairs, 6 were of late Renaissance music (Byrd and Gibbons) and 6 were of Baroque music (Bach, Couperin, Daquin, Rameau and Scarlatti). Within each of the two styles, three excerpts were of a fast tempo and three were of a slow tempo, as corroborated by three experienced musicians (two graduate students and one university music faculty member). In addition, metronome indications were derived for each of the 12 pieces. They ranged from 42 to 72 beats per minute for slow excerpts, and from 96 to 207 beats per minute for fast excerpts.</p>
<p>Two experimental compact discs were made from these excerpts. Each presented the 12 trials in the order shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0305735610376467">Table 1</xref>, though they differed from each other concerning excerpt order within trials. This was determined randomly for one compact disc, with the restriction that harpsichord excerpts were presented first on 6 of the 12 trials. Harpsichord–piano pair orders were then reversed on the second compact disc.</p>

<title>Procedure</title>
<p>Participants were run in large groups. Two of the groups consisted of undergraduate students taking a music appreciation or music materials course that music majors were not eligible for. The music major groups came from an introductory history survey course and from a second-year theory course. No student took part in the experiment more than once.</p>
<p>Participants answered questions on a cover sheet that dealt with their musical backgrounds:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Do you play a musical instrument?</p>
<p>If yes, which one and for how long?</p>
<p>Are you a music major?</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The following instructions were then read to all participants:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>You are going to hear 12 trials, each consisting of two excerpts of the same music. One performance will be performed on the harpsichord and the other will be performed on the piano. Sometimes the harpsichord version will be played first, and sometimes the piano version will come first. Your task is simply to choose the performance you prefer by circling one of three options: the first performance, the second performance, or both performances equally.</p>
<p>The performances may differ in ways other than instruments they are played on. Thus in addition to asking you to choose the performance you prefer, we ask you to say why you chose it: whether it was the instrument, the differences in tempo (that is, the speed of the performance), the expressiveness of the performance, or the technical abilities of the performers. Please do so by circling the choices underneath your overall preference choice, and you may circle more than one option.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Participants thus not only were asked to make a decision concerning the excerpt on each trial that they preferred. They also were asked to give up to four reasons for their decisions. Total time of the experiment was approximately 20 minutes.</p>

<title>Harpsichord and piano preference as a function of style and tempo: descriptive data</title>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0305735610376467">Table 2</xref> reveals overall preference percentages for harpsichord and piano as a function of both musical style and tempo. Across all participants and musical excerpts piano was preferred by almost a two-to-one margin (56.9% for piano, 30.1% for harpsichord). However, the combination of tempo with style differentially affected preference. For three of the four combinations (slow Renaissance and both slow and fast Baroque excerpts), the preference for piano over harpsichord approximated a 2.5 to 1 ratio. For fast Renaissance excerpts, however, the harpsichord was preferred to the piano, 48.2% to 40.6%: a ratio of 1.18 to 1.

<p>There was little change in preference on the first six trials compared to the remaining six trials. Overall preference for piano and harpsichord for trials 1–6 was 58.8% and 30.1% respectively; for trials 7–12 it was 53.7% and 31.6% respectively. It thus appears that increased familiarity with the harpsichord over the limited duration of the experiment was not a factor.</p>

<sec id="section7-0305735610376467">
<title>Preference for piano as a function of musical style, tempo and musical experience</title>
<p>A four-way mixed design analysis of variance (ANOVA) was conducted to determine preference for piano. Between-subjects variables were major (music versus non-music) and applied musical experience (players versus non-players). Within-subjects variables were style (Renaissance versus Baroque) and tempo (slow versus fast). In order to create a dependent variable, preference responses were recoded so that a preference selection for piano on a given trial was given a numerical value of 1, and preferences for harpsichord or no-preference choices were recoded as 0. Preference values for each of the four combinations of style and tempo thus could range from 0 to 3, as each combination (Renaissance-slow, for example) contained three trials.</p>
<p>The ANOVA yielded significant main effects for tempo (<italic>F</italic> = 4.52, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .04), major (<italic>F</italic> = 4.31, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .04) and applied musical experience (<italic>F</italic> = 18.22, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). It also yielded significant interactions for tempo-applied experience (<italic>F</italic> = 4.80, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .03), tempo-style (<italic>F</italic> = 15.68, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) and all four variables combined (<italic>F</italic> = 5.92, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .02). Participants preferred piano excerpts significantly more for slow excerpts (mean = 2.01, SD = .096) than they did for fast ones (mean = 1.77, SD = .99). Non-majors preferred piano excerpts significantly more than did music majors (means = 2.06 for non-majors and 1.73 for music majors; corresponding standard deviations are .04 and .15), and non-players also preferred the piano excerpts much more than did players (means = 2.23 for non-performers and 1.55 for performers; corresponding standard deviations are .16 and .04).</p>
<p>With regard to the tempo-applied experience interaction, piano preferences were high for non-players regardless of excerpt tempo (mean = 2.23 for both slow and fast excerpts; standard deviations were .187 and .193 respectively). However, among players preference for piano was significantly higher for slow excerpts than for fast excerpts.</p>
<p>The significant style–tempo interaction reflects the data shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0305735610376467">Table 2</xref>, namely that the piano was least preferred for fast Renaissance music (mean = 1.46). This mean was well below the other three means of 2.15 (slow Renaissance), 1.87 (slow Baroque), and 2.08 (fast Baroque). Standard deviations for these four conditions ranged from .12 to .13.</p>
<p>Another four-way mixed design ANOVA was conducted, this time to determine preference for harpsichord. Between- and within-subjects variables were the same as for the previous ANOVA. The dependent variable was created by recoding preference responses so that a preference selection for harpsichord on a given trial was given a numerical value of 1, and preferences for harpsichord or no-preference choices were recoded as 0. Preference values for each of the four combinations of style and tempo thus could again range from 0 to 3.</p>
<p>This ANOVA revealed significant main effects for style (<italic>F</italic> = 4.62, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .04), major (<italic>F</italic> = 9.03, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .004), and applied musical experience (<italic>F</italic> = 12.04, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), as well as a significant interaction for tempo–style (<italic>F</italic> = 13.26, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). Participants preferred harpsichord excerpts significantly more for Renaissance excerpts (mean = 0.87, SD = .10) than for Baroque excerpts (mean = 0.63, SD = .09). Non-majors preferred harpsichord excerpts significantly less than did music majors (means = 0.61 for non-majors and 0.89 for music majors; corresponding standard deviations are .04 and .15), and non-players also preferred the harpsichord excerpts significantly less than did players (means = 0.48 for non-players and 1.01 for players; corresponding standard deviations are .15 and .04).</p>
<p>With regard to the tempo–style interaction, harpsichord preferences peaked for fast Renaissance excerpts (mean = 1.22), and ranged between 0.51 and 0.65 for the other tempo–style combinations. Standard deviations for the four conditions ranged from .12 to .13.</p>

<title>Analysis of rationales for preference choices</title>
<p>On each trial, participants were free to circle any or any combination of four rationales for their preference choice: instrument, interpretation, tempo and technique. They could also circle none of the four rationales, which meant that there were 15 possible rationale outcome combinations. An examination of the data revealed that only four of the possibilities occurred with regularity: no preference, interpretation, instrument, and instrument and interpretation. The other 11 possibilities each occurred less than 10% of the time, and consequently were eliminated from further analysis.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0305735610376467">Table 3</xref> shows preference rationale percentages as a function of style and tempo. Rationales appear to be fairly consistent for the four combinations of style and tempo. Preferences made on the basis on instrument alone accounted for approximately one-third of the total, and preferences made on the basis of interpretation alone accounted for about one-twelfth of the total. The interpretation–instrument combination rationale was more common than the interpretation only rationale. Not including the other rationale combination responses, instrument appeared to play a role in almost half of all rationales and interpretation played a role in approximately a quarter of all rationales. These results are presented graphically in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0305735610376467">Figure 2</xref>.</p>

<title>Harpsichord and piano preference rationales as a function of musical experience, musical style and excerpt tempo</title>
<p>We examined rationales given for harpsichord and piano preferences to determine if they might differ systematically from each other. It is conceivable, for example, that rationales for piano preferences might be based more on instrument than would be rationales for harpsichord preferences, or that rationales for harpsichord preferences might be based more on interpretation than rationales for piano preferences. We looked at three comparisons: music majors versus non-majors, players versus non-players, and pianists versus non-pianist musicians. Results from these comparisons are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0305735610376467">Tables 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0305735610376467">5</xref>, and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0305735610376467">6</xref> respectively. Only three rationales were examined: interpretation, instrument, and interpretation–instrument. The data are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0305735610376467">Tables 4</xref>–6 as if these three rationales comprise their own closed universes: their combined percentages always total 100 for each instrument preference under each of the four style–tempo combinations.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0305735610376467">Table 4</xref> reveals some differences between music majors and non-majors. When choosing the harpsichord over the piano, the non-majors were over three times more likely to give the interpretation rationale than were the majors (mean = 38.4 for non-majors and 12.1 for non-majors). The instrument rationale was about equally selected for both majors and non-majors (with the exception of fast Baroque music, for which the majors chose instrument more frequently than non-majors). Consequently, the combination interpretation–instrument rationale was chosen more often by the music majors than was chosen by the non-majors, particularly for Renaissance excerpts (means = 33.2 for majors and 16.2 for non-majors).</p>
<p>These patterns did not hold for piano preferences. Whereas majors justified their choices more frequently than non-majors for both interpretation and interpretation–instrument, non-majors chose the instrument-only rationale more frequently than did majors (mean = 46.8 for majors and 72.7 for non-majors).</p>
<p>These same patterns of responding were found for players of a musical instrument versus non-players (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0305735610376467">Table 5</xref>). This is not surprising, as there was considerable overlap between majors–non-majors and players–non-players – all but two of the music majors were players of musical instruments or vocalists, whereas a little over half of the non-majors had applied musical experience of a year or more.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0305735610376467">Table 6</xref> presents data from pianists versus non-pianist musicians. There appear to be no striking differences between these groups in the rationales they chose to justify their piano and harpsichord preferences.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>It is not surprising that, overall, preference for piano excerpts was greater than it was for harpsichord excerpts, given the piano’s ubiquity in western society. In addition, 52 piano majors took part in the study, as opposed to no harpsichord majors, which may well have biased results in favor of the piano for participants who were players of a musical instrument.</p>
<p>Relative preference for the piano over the harpsichord differed, however, depending on tempo, musical style and musical experience. With regard to tempo, participants’ greater aversion to the harpsichord for slow excerpts than for fast ones may have been because of differences between the two instruments’ decay rates. Melodies may not have been sustainable at slow tempos as easily on the harpsichord as on the piano. It is interesting that more experienced participants showed a greater preference for the piano on slow excerpts as opposed to fast ones, but that less experienced participants preferred the piano across the board. It is thus conceivable that non-players and non-majors made their preference choices on the basis of timbre alone, whereas players and majors considered other factors as well – namely the capacities of each instrument to render musical content in a satisfactory way. Indeed, analyses of preference rationales support this interpretation: non-majors selected instrument as the rationale for their piano preferences much more frequently than did majors.</p>
<p>An interesting finding from this study was that the harpsichord was preferred over the piano for fast Renaissance music, but for no other combination of style and tempo. However, no plausible explanation, in terms of physical characteristics, can explain this result. The three fast Renaissance excerpts did not appear to differ from the three fast Baroque excerpts in terms of tempo, use of counterpoint, or other differences in musical texture. Nevertheless, participants appeared capable of distinguishing between the two styles, and choosing their instrumental preferences based upon these differences. Further investigation involving more than three excerpts for each style–tempo combination is warranted to examine this issue in greater detail.</p>
<p>It was discovered from analyses of preference rationales that the less musically experienced listeners (non-players and non-majors) based their piano preferences on instrument, but based their harpsichord preferences on interpretation alone (not interpretation–instrument). For both piano and harpsichord preference choices, however, the more experienced listeners chose the interpretation–instrument combination more often than did the less experienced listeners. It might be inferred from these data that the less experienced listeners were consistent in their preference for the sound of the piano, and that when they chose harpsichord over piano it was for some other reason. More experienced listeners, however, appeared to consider the appropriateness of an instrument for the style and tempo of the music.</p>
<p>As the harpsichord and piano versions of excerpts used in this study were performed by different musicians, one might wonder if varying interpretations contributed to differences in preference ratings. It is difficult to compare musicians across instruments. Indeed, statements such as ‘Horowitz was a better pianist than Landowska was a harpsichordist’ seem outlandish. Nevertheless, it is possible that pianists and harpsichordists differed systematically from each other concerning their interpretations. Harpsichordists may have been more willing to perform embellishments, for example. We could have controlled for this factor by having listeners rate identical harpsichord and piano performances created on a digital piano such as a Yamaha Disklavier. Instead we chose commercial recordings from which the excerpts we selected were all performed by experienced and well-respected performers. It seems reasonable to compare performances by excellent harpsichordists with performances by excellent pianists, regardless of interpretative group differences.</p>
<p>It should be borne in mind, however, that performer excellence is not the only factor that needs to be ‘equated’. Any study purporting to compare relative preferences of instruments should employ recordings of instruments that allow for the highest possible level of attainment to be realized. For the piano, this is usually not an issue. Inferior performances and instruments are easily recognized and thus can be avoided. But for harpsichord performances, factors such as misuse of stops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0305735610376467">Hubbard, 1965</xref>), unidiomatic performance, and the utilization of inauthentic or inferior instruments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0305735610376467">Fabian, 2004</xref>) are somewhat more difficult to identify.</p>
<p>Given that both versions of any given excerpt were modified with regard to tempo, pitch level and loudness, one might wonder whether these modifications could have given rise to artifactual noises or other distortions that might have affected some excerpts more than others. We doubt that this was the case, for several reasons. First, the software that we used, Peak, is very sophisticated in reducing noise artifacts. Second, modifications made to the excerpts were small: tempos of harpsichord and piano versions were all within 20% of each other, pitch levels were within one tone at the most and differences in loudness were not great as well. Third, slight modifications were made to both excerpts within a pair so that one would not seem more ‘natural’ than the other.</p>
<p>Finally, it should be remembered that this study is different from an examination of preference for music in its original version versus music transcribed for a different medium. Transcription usually involves significant changes on many different dimensions. Although in this study there were occasional differences between harpsichord and piano renditions of the same excerpt in terms of ornamentation, piano and harpsichord performances were essentially of the same music, played in the same key and with the same overall texture.</p>
