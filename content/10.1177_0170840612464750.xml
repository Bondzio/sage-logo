<p>Would organizations function better if managers did not use buzzwords? This paper traces a history of buzzwords and highlights three ways they help managers. First, managers use buzzwords to claim authority. Second, managers use buzzwords to facilitate action. Third, managers use buzzwords to displace responsibility for hard decisions. The paper concludes that there are benefits to using buzzwords and managers should be conscious of them.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Many people think buzzwords are bad. Even though they are used regularly in organizations involved in advertising, art, politics, policing, medicine, psychiatry, international development and education, they are seen as tools for obfuscation, mendacity and mastery rather than genuine communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0170840612464750">Bauman, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0170840612464750">Cornwall and Brock, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0170840612464750">Lutz, 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0170840612464750">1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0170840612464750">1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0170840612464750">Miles, 1969</xref>). As a result, a diverse group made up of organization theorists, linguists and philosophers, not to mention the 12,000 people who have signed up to the Plain English Campaign on a ‘dogged quest for perfect legibility’, argue that the world would work better without buzzwords (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0170840612464750">Jay, 2004</xref>, p. 55).</p>
<p>The use of buzzwords in organizations is most closely associated with managers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0170840612464750">Arnaud, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0170840612464750">Collins, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0170840612464750">Gabriel, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0170840612464750">Glaser, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0170840612464750">Mueller, 1974</xref>). Buzzwords have become the vocabulary of <italic>management speak</italic>. The result is that when managers use potentially precise terms people often hear nothing but meaningless buzzwords (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0170840612464750">Prasad, Prasad &amp; Mir, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0170840612464750">Feek, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0170840612464750">Reading, 1996</xref>). Indeed, this association between managers and buzzwords is so strong that when we see managers in cultural texts, it makes perfect sense for them to use buzzwords (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0170840612464750">Svendsen, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0170840612464750">Knights &amp; Willmott, 1999</xref>). The hope for a world free from buzzwords is, therefore, also a hope for organizations in which managers do not use buzzwords.</p>
<p>But do buzzwords serve an organizational function for managers that critics are missing? Are they a necessary evil in organizational life? Certainly language use is an important but ambivalent part of management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0170840612464750">Ellis &amp; Ybema, 2010</xref>). Managers use story-telling techniques to make sense of their experiences and to inspire action but they also use these same techniques to stroke their egos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0170840612464750">Alvesson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0170840612464750">Brown &amp; Lewis, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0170840612464750">Garud, Dunbar &amp; Bartel, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0170840612464750">Humphreys &amp; Brown, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0170840612464750">Keenoy, Oswick &amp; Grant, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0170840612464750">Oswick, Keenoy &amp; Grant, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0170840612464750">Shaw, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0170840612464750">Sveningsson &amp; Alvesson, 2003</xref>). Managers use technical jargon as they adopt the latest administrative tools but they also fall victim to management consultants who package commonsense ideas under seductive new names (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0170840612464750">Collins, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0170840612464750">Collinson, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0170840612464750">Harney, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0170840612464750">Lilley, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0170840612464750">Røvik, 2011</xref>). When it comes to buzzwords, though, we often recognize the negatives but not the positives.</p>
<p>Identifying the benefits of management buzzwords is not a straightforward task. Studies looking at the use of buzzwords in organized settings point out the difficulty of categorizing certain terms as buzzwords as, more often than not, we can find instances where the same terms represent a more precise use of language (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0170840612464750">Atkins, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0170840612464750">Cornwall, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0170840612464750">Godin, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0170840612464750">Hunter &amp; Barker, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0170840612464750">Lee, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0170840612464750">Nicklin, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0170840612464750">Simberloff, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0170840612464750">Thomas, 1996</xref>). Without accepted examples, management buzzwords have been looked at as an issue of fashion rather than as a particular type of language use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0170840612464750">Collins, 2000</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0170840612464750">Austin’s (1975)</xref> work is instructive here. Austin constructs ideal types to show how we do different things with words. He tells us that this approach is not designed to identify robust distinctions between particular terms but to help us to recognize general differences in the ways language is used.</p>
<p>So, after providing a definition of buzzwords and exploring the history of the term, this paper adopts Austin’s perspective to set out three ways managers use buzzwords. As we will see, managers use buzzwords to claim authority in their organizations, to facilitate action within their organizations and to deal with the anxieties of making decisions that may damage their societies, economies and environments. The paper concludes that management buzzwords are not just meaningless clichés, mumbo-jumbo or business school bullshit. They also solve specific organizational problems for managers – problems that would not disappear if we eradicated buzzwords from organizational life.</p>

<sec id="section2-0170840612464750">
<title>A Short History of Management Buzzwords</title>
<p>It has proven difficult to define buzzwords. Evans observes that attempts to do so leave us thinking that the term itself should be ‘considered a buzzword’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0170840612464750">1977</xref>, p. 140). The fundamental problem is that many terms that are interpreted as buzzwords in one context appear indistinct from other forms of language use in others. Management buzzwords, for example, can seem indistinct from management fads, jargon or slang (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0170840612464750">Collins, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>But while researchers struggle to find a consistent definition, people in organizations seem to know a buzzword when they hear one. A participant, in Prasad et al.’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0170840612464750">2011</xref>, p. 714) recent study of diversity management, for instance, reports that they interpret ‘the diversity thing’ as ‘a big buzzword’. Buzzwords are, therefore, best approached through the Saussurian concept of <italic>parole</italic>. They are a distinct form of language because of the way they are used. In the case discussed by Prasad et al., for example, the participant observed that managers were using <italic>diversity</italic> as a buzzword because it framed a set of decisions in a way that protected those managers from potential criticism.</p>
<p>We can define buzzwords in the first instance, then, as terms used to protect a person using them from criticism. In so doing, we can start to think about who uses buzzwords and, from an organizational perspective, what contexts encourage them to use buzzwords. We find initial answers to these questions in an early description of the use of buzzwords by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0170840612464750">Hallgren and Weiss (1946)</xref>. They explain how business students studying at Harvard University learned to identify a distinct type of language use that helped them succeed in their studies. The students collated examples of such language and labelled them <italic>buzz words</italic>. Hallgren and Weiss’s article is so short it can be quoted in full:<disp-quote>
<p>Students at the Graduate School of Business Administration at Harvard University use a specialized vocabulary known as ‘buzz words’ to describe the key to any particular course or situation. To ask for the answer or solution for any given case one merely asks, ‘What’s the word?’</p>
<p>To find the underlying factors in a labor case a student searches for the ‘logic of the context’ and is on the alert for any ‘residual sentiments of hostility.’ He also looks for appropriate times to ‘ceremonialize’ and knows the ‘value of using a crisis situation for teaching.’</p>
<p>In another course the student knows that he must ‘marshal his evidence’ and that his ‘recommendations must meet the conditions of the analysis.’ The first question he asks in considering recommendations is ‘what the company must do to be a success in the industry.’ If his analysis does not highlight the most important problems he has ‘poor focus,’ and if he fails to emphasize important recommendations he will be accused of ‘tinkering.’ If the sequence for the ‘implementation’ of the recommendations is not good it is a matter of ‘poor timing.’</p>
<p>To succeed, the student must ‘get on top of the problem.’ He must ‘hit the problem’ and not ‘shadow box.’ If he cannot do these things he might just as well ‘turn in his suit.’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0170840612464750">Hallgren &amp; Weiss, 1946</xref>, p. 263)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>From Hallgren and Weiss we learn that business students identified a particular type of language use as buzzwords. These terms helped them to frame their answers in a way that satisfied their examiners that they had found <italic>the key</italic> to a question, case or situation. Using buzzwords, business students could speak with apparent authority. Indeed, using the correct buzzword seems to have been more important than the answer the students provided. Demonstrating what Bourdieu calls ‘the primacy of the saying over the thing said’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0170840612464750">1983/1993</xref>, p. 117), the first question these students learned to ask was <italic>what’s the word?</italic> not <italic>what’s the answer?</italic>.</p>
<p>Organizational scholars have noted that management education decisively shapes the practice of management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0170840612464750">Harney, 2007</xref>). It does much more than offer training in the tools of administration. Specifically, management education ‘provides’ business students ‘with a single axis along which to optimize and to reduce the bewildering complexity of troubling management issues’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0170840612464750">Scully, 2002</xref>, p. 396). It is no surprise, then, that as business students graduated and took on management roles in organizations, they knew how to use buzzwords whenever they needed to protect themselves from criticism.</p>
<p>In 1968 <italic>Newsweek</italic> reported that the increasing use of buzzwords in public administration had led a frustrated worker to publish a ‘buzzword generator’. The author of this generator, Phillip Broughton, designed it to demonstrate the vacuity of buzzwords. He laid out three columns of ten words and claimed that by randomly combining a word from each column, the buzzword generator would allow its user to create an impressive but meaningless buzzword. The buzzwords the generator produced could then be used in everyday organizational life. In particular, they could help the user of the generator to win at the game of wordsmanship. ‘No one will have the slightest idea of what you’re talking about,’ Broughton explained, ‘but the important thing is that they’re not about to admit it’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0170840612464750">Bouchillon, 1976</xref>, p. 229). Broughton’s three columns are set out as <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0170840612464750">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<p>Broughton’s buzzword generator shows us that ‘the key to successful exposition is the well-chosen complex phrase’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0170840612464750">Zisk, 1970</xref>, p. 55). Indeed, using Broughton’s generator we can produce terms that still sound like they should mean something such as <italic>integrated management concept, parallel digital hardware</italic> and <italic>balanced incremental contingency</italic>. But, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0170840612464750">Zisk (1970)</xref> emphasizes, there is a skill to producing buzzwords beyond their complexity that Broughton missed. Buzzwords cannot be completely meaningless. A buzzword must have what Evans calls ‘limited currency’ so that someone can be ‘unaware of its meaning and therefore potentially dazzled by it’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0170840612464750">1977</xref>, p. 141). For this to happen, a buzzword must mean something to someone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0170840612464750">Cornwall, 2007</xref>, p. 473). This is why many expressions identified as buzzwords are borrowed from other contexts where their meanings were more clearly understood. For example, terms including <italic>diversity, equality, empowerment</italic> and <italic>creativity</italic> have been taken from ‘the counter-cultural slogans of the 1960s and 1970s’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0170840612464750">Svendsen, 2008</xref>, p. 81). In their former contexts, these terms had specific meanings relating to particular practices and political ideas. In the context of management, though, the terms are ambiguous and so function effectively as buzzwords (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0170840612464750">Collins, 2000</xref>). As a result, Zisk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0170840612464750">1970</xref>, p. 55) argues that we need to remodel Broughton’s buzzword generator for particular audiences and offers a generator designed specifically for political scientists as an illustration (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0170840612464750">Table 2</xref>).</p>

<p>Buzzwords generators demonstrate that the use of buzzwords is not limited to business students. Rather, they show that buzzwords have long been used in other organizations and academic disciplines. This is not to say that the same buzzwords were used in each context. In fact, none of the examples of buzzwords cited by Hallgren and Weiss were included in the buzzword generators developed by Broughton and Zisk. In each case, though, the use of buzzwords represented a similar use of language. In each instance, buzzwords offered the speaker a form of protection from potential criticism. By using buzzwords, business students could sound authoritative even when they lacked expert knowledge, managers could dazzle people in their organizations and political scientists could be assured ‘of public and scholarly acclaim’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0170840612464750">Zisk, 1970</xref>, p. 55).</p>

<title>Analysing Buzzwords</title>
<p>Many things we say help us to do things. In this sense, if buzzwords help to protect us they are not unique. Yet, for critics, the managerial use of buzzwords is an especially problematic use of language. Buzzwords not only help managers win the game of wordsmanship. They also help them dazzle people in their organizations and, in so doing, exert control over them. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0170840612464750">Bakan (1965)</xref> put it, by creating mystery they allow mastery.</p>
<p>But is this all that buzzwords do for managers and organizations? Are they only mendacious tools for control? Different words buzz at different times and in different contexts. While this makes it difficult to analyse buzzwords empirically, it does suggest that management buzzwords may be used for other purposes than control.</p>
<p>Austin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0170840612464750">1975</xref>, p. 8) analyses the different ‘circumstances’ in which language is used to do things. He distinguishes between language used to pass verdict, exercise power, commit to action and conduct social behaviours. By doing so, Austin encourages us to demonstrate what language can do by constructing ideal types. Bauman (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0170840612464750">2007</xref>, p. 23) explains that such an approach, where we pay less attention to producing ‘snapshots or likenesses of social reality’ than capturing ‘its essential elements’, helps us to ‘render intelligible the otherwise chaotic and scattered evidence of experience’. Indeed, Austin notes that while the ‘distinctions’ he creates ‘are so loose that the cases [he analyses] are not necessarily easily distinguishable’, it is only by drawing initial crude divisions that can we improve our understanding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0170840612464750">1975</xref>, p. 41). He explains: ‘There is no short cut to expounding simply the full complexity of the situation which does not exactly fit any common classification’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0170840612464750">1975</xref>, p. 38).</p>
<p>Following this approach, we can identify three functions that buzzwords fulfil for managers. First, buzzwords allow managers to signal their authority in spite of organizational realities that undermine it. Skilfully deploying an appropriate buzzword helps managers show they are management material – not because buzzwords indicate that a manager possesses expert knowledge but because they help them survive without it. Second, the use of buzzwords lets managers speak euphemistically about potentially sensitive topics in their organizations. In this sense, the use of buzzwords facilitates discussion and, ultimately, action within organizations. Third, the use of buzzwords allows managers to displace responsibility for their actions on to other actors. This helps managers make difficult decisions as they can shift responsibility for the consequences of their decisions onto others.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0170840612464750">
<title>Using Buzzwords to Claim Authority</title>
<p>We have seen that buzzwords allowed business students studying at Harvard University to frame their answers in a way that helped them appear authoritative. Of course, it is no bad thing when learning an academic discipline to learn the specialized terminology used by experts. The point at which the use of buzzwords becomes a problem, for critics committed to clear speech at least, is the point at which knowing the correct buzzword becomes more important than knowing the correct answer. The publication of buzzword generators indicates that such a shift had occurred. While buzzwords collated by business students helped them to frame their answers in a purposeful way, buzzwords generators were designed to help people win at wordsmanship through empty complexity.</p>
<p>Literary critic <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0170840612464750">Richards (1929/1991)</xref> tells us that even the use of seemingly vacuous language allows us to demonstrate that we have mastered a key social skill. Richards observes that during childhood our ability to understand language provides us access to a widening social world – as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0170840612464750">Cluley (2011)</xref> has demonstrated with regard to Santa Claus, it is our ability to use language correctly rather than our claims to knowledge that allows us as children into adult conversations. But, as we develop our ability to use language to access new social groups, we also develop the ability to produce ‘more or less appropriate language’ with which we can ‘disguise’ the errors that previously led to our exclusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0170840612464750">Richards, 1929/1991</xref>, p. 324). In short, even if we do not know the true meaning of the words we say, we learn how to use appropriate-sounding language to signal that we belong in a particular social situation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0170840612464750">Richards, 1929/1991</xref>, p. 325).</p>
<p>Managers often need to use language in this way. People are regularly elevated into management positions on the basis of seniority rather than skill. Once in a management position, they may lack ‘the time, interest, or awareness’ needed to effectively fulfil their new role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0170840612464750">Huczynski, 1993</xref>, p. 452). Yet, the manager, as a decision-maker and a leader, is, to paraphrase Lacan, the one who is supposed to know (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0170840612464750">Arnaud, 2003</xref>). They are supposed to be best-placed to make decisions relative to both their subordinates and superiors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0170840612464750">Shaw, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0170840612464750">Sveningsson and Larsson, 2006</xref>). Recognizing a gap between their own limitations and the expectations of others ‘is not a comfortable situation’ for managers and means that ‘any opportunity to obtain relief, even if temporarily, is welcome and will be grasped’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0170840612464750">Huczynski, 1993</xref>, p. 457).</p>
<p>One solution is to use management buzzwords. Thanks to the efforts of an entire industry of consultants, business gurus and management educators, buzzwords often sound right (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0170840612464750">Collins, 2004</xref>). In fact, we might go as far as to say that many management buzzwords are useful because they do not have immediately obvious, precise meanings. Glaser (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0170840612464750">1997</xref>, p. 655), for instance, argues that when we push many management buzzwords we find that they are essentially ‘claptrap’.</p>
<p>Buzzwords are useful to managers, then, because when they use them they can sound like a manager is supposed to sound. Managers signal their organizational authority in this way precisely because in many cases they are painfully aware that they lack genuine authority. As such, management buzzwords allow managers to sound authoritative and, as a result, give them an appearance of authority. Buzzwords that do not have precise meanings are especially useful here as managers can use them to signal their authority and others will struggle to prove them wrong.</p>

<title>Using Buzzwords to Facilitate Action</title>
<p>What is meaningful and what is meaningless ultimately depends on context, so we cannot categorically describe all management buzzwords as claptrap even if some are. We have seen that for terms to work as buzzwords there must be a possibility that they mean something. If they were completely vacuous they would not dazzle their audience but would simply confuse them. This suggests that buzzwords can also be used to communicate a message. In fact, Evans argues that buzzwords allow ‘efficient intra-group communication’ because they are ‘short and direct’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0170840612464750">1977</xref>, p. 140).</p>
<p>In this regard, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0170840612464750">Glaser (1997)</xref> tells us that buzzwords allow managers to express new concepts and discuss existing concepts in new ways. Moreover, he argues that there is often an organizational need to do the latter. He observes that <italic>benchmarking</italic> ‘encourages an organization to get data about its performance’, <italic>360 degree feedback</italic> means ‘people talking to each other’ and <italic>empowerment</italic> means ‘asking people to do things’ – all of which can be beneficial for organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0170840612464750">1997</xref>, pp. 654–5). On the surface, these buzzwords express ‘warmly persuasive’ banalities that ‘evoke Good Things that no-one could possibly disagree’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0170840612464750">Cornwall, 2007</xref>, p. 472). Yet, by presenting <italic>people talking to each other</italic>, for example, as a new development through the term <italic>360 degree feedback</italic>, managers can overcome the implication that in the past they may not have encouraged organization members to talk to each other. As Glaser puts it, when ‘there is a new way of describing something we may think that the new description reflects a new phenomenon’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0170840612464750">1997</xref>, p. 653).</p>
<p>In these examples buzzwords act as mitigating speech (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0170840612464750">Carli, 1999</xref>). They help managers to sugar-coat what they are saying. In so doing, they refocus attention away from a feature of an organization’s operations or a manager’s performance that might otherwise be ignored to save face. In this way, buzzwords are effective tools for communication as they bring up organizational issues that those in a situation already know about, but to do so in a new way.</p>
<p>An analogous example comes from medical practice. Writing in <italic>Journal of the Royal College of General Practitioners</italic>, Miles tells us that ‘there are occasions when vogue words have perforce to be used’ to protect medical practitioners and their patients ‘from hard or unpalatable facts’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0170840612464750">1969</xref>, p. 283). To illustrate this Miles explains that when medical practitioners discuss the ‘treatment’ of terminal diseases they really mean their ‘management’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0170840612464750">1969</xref>, p. 283). If, however, medical practitioners spoke in a direct way about the management of such diseases they and their patients would be faced with the ‘main deficiencies’ of medical science (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0170840612464750">1969</xref>, p. 283). While it might be more truthful to speak in this way it would not necessarily be more productive. For Miles, the use of vogue words makes patients and doctors more confident and this can actually increase the effectiveness of treatment.</p>
<p>Managers also use buzzwords to acknowledge, explore and accept facts that they do not want to admit to directly. They help them to discuss issues with others in ways that help both parties save face. In the process, new possibilities for action and new solutions to organizational problems can emerge and everyday organizational activities can continue. When managers use buzzwords as mitigating speech, though, they achieve something that is different from the authority they claimed in other examples. As we saw in the previous section, buzzwords can be used as neon signs to draw attention to their own authority but, as we see in this section, they also provide a spoonful of sugar to help the medicine go down.</p>

<sec id="section6-0170840612464750">
<title>Using Buzzwords to Displace Responsibility</title>
<p>Buzzwords not only help managers to rationalize their actions when communicating with other people. They can also help managers act in the first place. Managers often feel a need to give away their authority before they act because they have to balance responsibilities to a variety of stakeholders, knowing they can rarely satisfy all at the same time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0170840612464750">Watson, 2008</xref>). Decisions that benefit their organization, for example, may damage their staff, career, community, society or environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0170840612464750">Parker, 2002</xref>). Considering all of the consequences of their decisions to all of these stakeholders can be both daunting and, ultimately, disabling for managers. It can make them unable to make decisions – unable, in short, to manage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0170840612464750">Collins, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Here, buzzwords are useful when they allow managers to describe their decisions as if they are actually not <italic>their</italic> decisions. Managers cannot be held responsible, for example, when someone is ‘“kaizen-ed” out of a job … reengineered on to welfare … or “empowered” to work nights and weekends’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0170840612464750">de Burgundy, 1996</xref>, p. 34). Whether or not these terms actually stop the people who have been <italic>kaizen-ed</italic> out of a job or <italic>empowered</italic> to work nights from blaming their managers, the use of the terms allows managers to frame their decisions in a way that writes their responsibility out of the story. In this sense, buzzwords act as a ‘language that avoids responsibility’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0170840612464750">Lutz, 1999</xref>, p. xi) or a ‘language of evasion’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0170840612464750">Cornwall, 2007</xref>, p. 472). This is one reason why managers turn to management consultants to provide them with new buzzwords that ‘excuse or explain away failure as due to the dynamism of the environment, the obstructiveness of unions or some other such factor which management could not hope to control’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0170840612464750">de Burgundy, 1996</xref>, p. 32). Indeed, when they help managers to shift responsibility for their decisions on to privileged others with expert powers such as management consultants, buzzwords can also provide managers with some legitimacy for their decisions.</p>
<p>So, managers can use buzzwords to protect themselves from the anxieties, insecurities and contradictions that might arise if they accepted their decisions as <italic>their decisions</italic>. They help managers to make tough decisions because they help them to act without explaining what they are doing or what is really happening. Management buzzwords, therefore, not only help managers to signal their authority and to sugar-coat what they are saying to other members of their organizations. Management buzzwords also allow managers to displace responsibility.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0170840612464750">
<title>Discussion: Buzzwords and Organization Studies</title>
<p>We started with the proposition that the world might be better without buzzwords and that organizations, in particular, might function better if managers did not use them. Buzzwords are terms that can protect a person using them from criticism. Of course, people who use buzzwords acknowledge, to some extent, that they are subject to criticism. This is why many critics are suspicious of buzzwords – especially those used by managers in organizations. Rather than deal with the grounds for the criticism, buzzwords misdirect people who could offer criticism. Buzzwords are, thus, a way to master through mystery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0170840612464750">Bakan, 1965</xref>).</p>
<p>Yet, buzzwords can solve specific organizational problems for managers. Managers are supposed to be authoritative yet they may lack the training, time and capabilities to be so. Here management buzzwords help managers sound like managers and to signal their authority. Similarly in seeking to improve performance, managers may adopt new administrative techniques that can expose their past failings. Here management buzzwords help managers to mitigate their actions and refocus attention away from unpalatable facts and sensitive topics. They can help managers get a message across in a productive way. Finally, organizations often require managers to make tough decisions that they may, at least in part, disagree with. Here, buzzwords help managers to speak about these decisions as if they were not actually their decisions at all. As such, management buzzwords are effective tools that help managers to manage with the realities of organizational life.</p>
<p>We might think, therefore, that calls for managers to stop using buzzwords are dealing with symptoms of organizational problems rather than their causes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0170840612464750">Harney, 2005</xref>). To acknowledge the causes, we might even encourage managers to use buzzwords. In this regard, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0170840612464750">Jay (2004)</xref> criticizes wider calls for plain language in his investigation of mendacity in politics. Imprecise rhetoric is often seen as the enemy of informed political engagement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0170840612464750">Orwell, 1949/1987</xref>). As a result there is an ongoing and wide-ranging project ‘to strip political language of its irrational, emotive and ornamental excrescences and find a way to express ideas, arguments and motivations with full clarity and univocal meaning’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0170840612464750">Jay, 2004</xref>, p. 55). By reviewing the work of leading social theorists, however, Jay highlights potential benefits of imprecise language. Drawing on Adorno, he suggests that complex language is one of the few tools at our disposal that can defeat ‘the effortless absorption of prepackaged ideas’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0170840612464750">2004</xref>, p. 59). Reviewing Arendt’s work, he tells us that lying is not only a useful way for politicians to manoeuvre their way through the corridors of power. Mendacious language helps them to construct alternatives to the status quo. So mendacity seems to be ingrained in the practice of politics. To have politics without it requires the construction of a new politics. We cannot simply change the language. As Jay summarizes, the language of politics ‘necessarily defeats any attempt to be utterly transparent and univocal’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0170840612464750">2004</xref>, p. 64). Of course, it is well known that particular forms of language use are also ingrained in management practice (Rhodes, 2001). Management buzzwords are an intriguing tool in this regard as they help managers overcome the messiness and insecurity of the management position in organizational life.</p>
<p>Future research needs to investigate whether different organizational structures and cultures encourage managers to use buzzwords to a greater or lesser extent. Future research also needs to further explore management buzzwords in use. Such research could demonstrate how managers use buzzwords to signal their authority, open discussions and to give away their responsibilities in particular organizational contexts. Research is also needed to demonstrate how subordinates and superordinates perceive and react to management buzzwords. Clearly, a term that a manager uses as a buzzword might not be heard as a buzzword by others. The details of these relations are yet to be established. For the moment, though, we can conclude that while buzzwords might frustrate some people in organizations, they help managers to manage and open up possibilities for action. They are a useful part of organizational life.</p>
