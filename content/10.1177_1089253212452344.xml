<abstract>
<p>Since its introduction in the early part of the last century, fresh whole blood (FWB) has been used by the US military as a battlefield expedient resuscitation method, even after the development of component therapy in the 1960s. In the recent conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan, FWB was used once more, often collected in the setting of a walking blood bank (WBB). Considerable research and opinion from military circles has cited these experiences and sparked renewed interest in FWB as an effective resuscitation tool in the setting of trauma. Despite efforts by the US military to improve the effectiveness and safety of FWB through a series of widely published guidelines, transfusion transmitted infections (TTI) remain a vexing challenge. These experiences in Iraq and Afghanistan will help inform a larger discussion regarding the reintroduction of FWB in civilian trauma resuscitation.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>According to the Armed Services Blood Program, in the recent military conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1089253212452344">*</xref> more than 28,000 wounded personnel were transfused nearly 300,000 blood products, over 9000 of which were whole blood units.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1089253212452344">1</xref></sup> The purpose of this article is to explore the US military’s policies and recent experience with whole blood transfusion during these conflicts. For the purposes of this article, whole blood is blood collected from a donor that is transfused without undergoing any fractionation; fresh whole blood (FWB) is whole blood that is less than 24 hours old and kept at room temperature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1089253212452344">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1089253212452344">3</xref></sup>; and massive <italic>transfusion</italic> (MT) is transfusion the 10 or more units of blood to a single casualty within 24 hours.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1089253212452344">4</xref></sup></p>

<title>US Military’s History With Whole Blood Transfusion</title>
<p>The first known human blood transfusion took place on June 15, 1667, when Dr Jean-Baptiste Denis (sometimes spelled “Denys”) transfused several ounces of lamb’s blood to a feverish young man who had been previously bled with leeches. The patient survived, but Denis’s other transfusion experiments eventually led to a patient death. Denis was charged with murder but later exonerated when it was discovered that the patient may have been poisoned by his own wife. Nonetheless, the event led the French Parliament to ban all human blood transfusions, and similar actions followed throughout much of Europe.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1089253212452344">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1089253212452344">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>With these bans in place, little progress was made on human blood transfusion over the next few centuries. However, a series of events in the early part of the 20th century moved transfusion science forward significantly with the discovery of the 3 principal blood types by Dr Karl Lansteiner in 1901, the first blood transfusion using blood typing and cross-matching by Dr Reuben Ottenberg in 1907, and the development of long-term anticoagulants such as sodium citrate in 1914.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1089253212452344">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>The first military blood banking and transfusion occurred in 1917 during World War I by Lieutenant Oswald Robertson, a graduate student at the Rockefeller Foundation, recently commissioned in the US Medical Officer Reserve Corps. During the battle of Cambrai, Robertson stored 22 units of blood in a makeshift blood bank/ice chest crafted from 2 ammunition cans. Robertson used his device to successfully transfuse 20 severely wounded Canadian soldiers judged too deep in shock to risk surgery. Nine of his patients survived, and Robertson’s transfusion methods became widespread among the British Expeditionary Force.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1089253212452344">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>Despite its popularity among British military surgeons, whole blood transfusion was not embraced in US military medical circles. At the start of World War II, US military medical authorities deemed whole blood transfusion too difficult and dangerous to perform in a combat theater, and “blood substitutes,” such as plasma and later albumin, were used as the primary resuscitation fluid for hemorrhagic shock. In northern Africa, however, American physicians observed their British counterparts using whole blood to resuscitate badly wounded soldiers, and the practice began to take hold in US military circles.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1089253212452344">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>As the scale of US military involvement in the wars in Europe and the Pacific expanded, so too did its need for blood, exhausting donor supplies available in theater. Eventually, a plan was put in place to collect whole blood from Red Cross Donor Centers in the United States and airlift units to military hospitals in Europe and the Pacific. By the war’s end, the Red Cross had provided more than 13 million pints of blood for use in the war effort as whole blood, as well as for the production of albumin and freeze-dried plasma.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1089253212452344">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the 5 intervening years between the end of World War II and the start of the Korean War, the military’s blood program stagnated. As a consequence, the United States entered the Korean War without a formal blood program and did not ship any blood for the first 70 days of the conflict.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1089253212452344">10</xref></sup> But during the 1960s, several important innovations moved transfusion science away from whole blood and closer to the component therapy (CT) used in today’s modern operating room. In the early to mid-1960s, plasmapheresis was introduced as a method for collecting plasma for transfusion, and shortly thereafter packed red blood cells (pRBC) replaced whole blood as a primary means to supplement lost oxygen-carrying capacity. In 1969, S. Murphy and F. Gardner demonstrated the feasibility of storing platelets at room temperature, thus revolutionizing platelet transfusion therapy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1089253212452344">7</xref></sup> Blood storage methods were also further refined, in part to facilitate the safe shipment of blood products to US military hospitals in far-off Vietnam. Small amounts of whole blood were still collected in US military facilities in Vietnam to keep a ready supply of fresh platelets.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1089253212452344">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>In recent years, although generally replaced by component therapy, whole blood transfusion remained a “field expedient” resuscitation method for trauma in the US military. In the conflicts in Somalia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1089253212452344">11</xref></sup> and Kosovo,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1089253212452344">12</xref></sup> military physicians turned once more to FWB transfusion when CT was not readily available.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1089253212452344">
<title>Whole Blood: The Ideal Resuscitation Fluid?</title>
<p>The move to CT in the setting of trauma, as outlined above, was not because CT was believed to be more efficacious than whole blood resuscitation. Rather, CT first took hold in elective surgeries on euvolemic patients, where it allowed for better storage and screening, and more judicious use of individual blood components. Once in place, whole blood simply became less and less available, leaving CT as the only option for trauma resuscitation. Thus, the transition to CT in the setting of hemorrhagic shock took place without any demonstration of its effectiveness as a resuscitation fluid over whole blood.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1089253212452344">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>Whole blood has great appeal in the setting of trauma, particularly in the setting of MT, as it “replaces what is bled.” Indeed, if one were to administer blood components in ratios similar to whole blood (pRBC:FFP:PLT as 1:1:1; FFP stands for fresh frozen plasma and PLT stands for platelets), one is left with an anemic, cold, thrombocytopenic, diluted solution. Such a solution would be roughly 660 to 680 mL (roughly 280 mL of which is anticoagulants and additives), have a hematocrit of less than 30% with coagulation factors diluted to 60% of their usual concentration, and 80,000 platelets per microliter (only two thirds of which would be viable).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1089253212452344">14</xref></sup> In contrast, a 500-mL unit of FWB has a hematocrit of roughly 33% to 43% with 86% activity of clotting factors, 130,000 to 350,000 platelets per microliter,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1089253212452344">15</xref></sup> and contains only 60 to 70 mL of anticoagulants and additives.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1089253212452344">16</xref></sup> Recent research indicates that while the pH and levels of 2,3-DPG (2,3-diphosphoglycerate) of whole blood diminish after 3 days at room temperature, plasma coagulation and PLT function are largely preserved.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1089253212452344">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>Another principal advantage of whole blood over CT is the avoidance of “storage lesion,” or the degradation of stored blood with time, which is associated with a host of clinically significant adverse outcomes ranging from decreased red blood cell aggregation and 2,3-DPG activity, to an increased incidence of infection, multi-organ failure, and death.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1089253212452344">17</xref></sup> Given the logistical challenges of far-off military campaigns, it is not surprising that storage lesion has been a vexing problem in Afghanistan and Iraq, where, early in the war, the average age of blood transfused at one combat support hospital was 33 days.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1089253212452344">18</xref></sup></p>

<title>Whole Blood Use in the Wars in Iraq and Afghanistan</title>
<p>In the earliest stages of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, surgical support for the troops engaged in combat was highly mobile and flexible, much like the conflict itself. Transfusion requirements were met with blood products collected outside of theater and rapidly transported to US military medical facilities in the combat zone. As the conflict evolved, medical support and operating rooms became more stationary, and medical staff began to look internally to meet transfusion needs.</p>
<p>In the US military, care for the wounded is organized into 5 escalating levels, with level I care administered by the combat medic and at the austere “Battalion Aid Station,” to level V care administered at large stateside military hospitals. Blood is first available in limited supply at level II, which is composed of Forward Surgical Teams (FSTs) and “Charlie Med” units, the latter of which may carry as much as 50 units of pRBCs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1089253212452344">19</xref></sup> Full transfusion capabilities of all blood components are available at level III care, or the Combat Support Hospitals (CSH). As these components run short, as is often the case with highly perishable platelets (5 days at room temperature),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1089253212452344">20</xref></sup> these institutions sometimes turn to FWB.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1089253212452344">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>The third edition of <italic>Emergency War Surgery</italic>, a standard and revered text among military physicians, was published in the early stages of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Within its highly readable and outlined text it describes the need for the “Walking Blood Bank” (WBB) contingency when blood and blood components are not readily available. A WBB uses FWB drawn from personnel (usually service members) in the vicinity for immediate transfusion. The chapter describes the steps involved in such a process and reminds the reader that “dog tags,” on which is stamped a service member’s blood type, are inaccurate 2% to 11% of the time and should only be used as a last resort. Several options for the conduct of a WBB are described depending on the austerity of the setting, from a CSH that has exhausted its supply of blood components, to medical personnel in very remote settings with limited medical supplies. In the latter setting, the manual describes the “white tile method” of cross-matching, using drops of blood from donor and recipient, waiting 4 minutes and examining the mixture with a hand lens to ensure there is no agglutinization.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1089253212452344">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>The whole blood transfusions that took place in Iraq and Afghanistan were not usually under such austere conditions, but were conducted at formal medical facilities and usually as a part of a larger resuscitation in which blood components, especially platelets, were in short supply. Massive transfusions are especially taxing on forward deployed military medical facilities with limited resources. The very busy CSH in Baghdad, Iraq (Ibn Sina) acquired the means to collect apharesis platelets (aPLTs) on-site in November of 2004.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1089253212452344">21</xref></sup> Prior to this date, FWB remained an important source for platelets during massive transfusions.</p>
<p>The military’s experience in the early years of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan led to considerable research evaluating advantages and risks associated with FWB transfusion as well as high platelet/plasma to RBC ratio CT. Often retrospective, this research focused on casualties from the early to mid-portion of the conflicts (November 2003 to October 2007), often treated at the CSH in Baghdad (Ibn Sina). The conclusions drawn from these studies challenged conventional notions of trauma resuscitation, which had long called for crystalloid fluid and pRBCs upfront, and components such as plasma and platelets only when a set number of pRBCs had been transfused or when lab values demonstrated their need. The source of much of this research was the United States Army Institute of Surgical Research (USAISR) at Fort Sam Houston, Texas, an institution dedicated to providing requirements-driven combat casualty care medical solutions and products for injured soldiers, from self-aid through definitive care across the full spectrum of military operations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1089253212452344">22</xref></sup> At USAISR’s disposal was the Joint Theater Trauma Registry (JTTR), an enormous and well-maintained repository of all Department of Defense trauma-related data.</p>
<p>One of the first of this series of studies was from Borgman et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1089253212452344">23</xref></sup> and looked at blood product ratios in 246 combat casualties who received massive transfusions at a CSH in Iraq. Borgman et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1089253212452344">23</xref></sup> demonstrated that a 1:1.4 ratio of plasma to RBCs was associated with improved overall mortality, as well as mortality from hemorrhage, when compared with casualties who receive plasma and RBCs in ratios of 1:2.5 and 1:8 (overall mortality rates were 65%, 34%, and 19%, respectively, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001; and hemorrhage mortality rates were 92.5%, 78%, and 37%, respectively, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001).</p>
<p>In a retrospective analysis of 708 combat casualties transfused at least one unit of blood product at a CSH in Iraq, Spinella et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1089253212452344">24</xref></sup> demonstrated that each transfused FFP unit was independently associated with increased survival (odds ratio = 1.17; 95% confidence interval = 1.06-1.29; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .002); whereas each transfused pRBC unit was independently associated with decreased survival (odds ratio = 0.86; 95% confidence interval = 0.8-0.92; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001). In another retrospective analysis of 354 combat casualties who received either FWB, RBCs, plasma but not aPLTs versus casualties who received aPLTs, RBC, plasma but not FWB, Spinella et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1089253212452344">13</xref></sup> (a different research group than that referenced above) found improved 24-hour and 30-day survival with the FWB group (96% vs 88% <italic>P</italic> = .018; 95% vs 82%, <italic>P</italic> = .002). The authors posed several possible explanations for this benefit, to include the fact that FWB is more concentrated, and lacks both the anticoagulant additives and the storage lesions of reconstituted CT.</p>
<p>Perkins et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1089253212452344">25</xref></sup> undertook 2 retrospective analyses looking at the use of platelets in combat casualty resuscitations. The first study looked at the relationship between aPLT:RBC ratio and survival in 694 massive transfusions that included aPLT, but not FWB. At 24 hours, patients receiving a high ratio of aPLT:RBC (&lt;1:8) had better survival (95%) compared with patients receiving a medium ratio (1:16 to 1:8; survival = 87%) and patients receiving the lowest ratio of platelets (&lt;1:16; survival = 64%; <italic>P</italic> = .04 and <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001, respectively). The survival benefit for the high and medium ratio groups remained at 30 days as compared with those receiving the lowest ratio of platelets (75% and 60% vs 43%, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001 for both comparisons).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1089253212452344">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>In a separate study (with a slightly different research group), Perkins et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1089253212452344">21</xref></sup> looked at the source of platelets (aPLT vs FWB) in 369 massive transfusions of combat casualties. Unadjusted survival between the 2 groups was similar at 24 hours (84% vs 81%, respectively; <italic>P</italic> = .52) and at 30 days (60% vs 57%, respectively; <italic>P</italic> = .72). Multivariate regression failed to identify differences in survival between patients receiving PLT transfusions either as FWB or as aPLT at 24 hours or at 30 days. The authors, in addition to calling for prospective studies to evaluate the efficacy of FWB in civilian populations, concluded that FWB is a reasonable alternative to aPLTs in austere environments where standard component therapy is not available.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1089253212452344">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>In addition to these studies, several review articles and editorials published at about the same time cited the widespread and successful use of FWB in the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. These articles cite the long history the US military has had using FWB in the setting of combat trauma, even after the development of component therapy. Underscoring the unique experience and limitations in resources of the military setting, these authors argue that, particularly in the setting of massive transfusion and resistant coagulopathy, FWB has been and should remain one of the tools available to clinicians treating combat casualties.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1089253212452344">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1089253212452344">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1089253212452344">27</xref></sup></p>

<title>The Safety of Whole Blood Transfusion</title>
<p>In the US military, the screening for transfusion transmitted infections (TTIs) of FWB has varied depending on the acuity of the situation in which it is used. In 1993, the 46th CSH performed 56 surgical procedures in 48 hours on the combat casualties of the Battle of the Black Sea in Mogadishu, Somalia. Eighty units of whole blood were transfused solely using dog tags to determine blood type, with no rapid screening tests for TTIs. Remarkably, this group reported no transfusion reactions, and, according to survivor screening once returning to the United States, no TTIs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1089253212452344">11</xref></sup> In <italic>Emergency War Surgery</italic>, third edition, the chapter on Shock and Resuscitation suggests that the safety of whole blood transfusion may be improved through planning, that is, developing a roster of donors prescreened for TTIs, with known blood and Rh types. In a mass casualty situation (when the number of casualties threaten to outstrip a medical facility’s resources), the authors suggest reducing the confusion in the handling of blood by drawing only “O” type blood.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1089253212452344">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>As all US whole blood donors in Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) and Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) were US Department of Defense (DoD) personnel, mandatory DoD vaccination and screening policies contributed considerably to the safety of FWB transfusion. All active duty US service members are screened for HIV every 2 years, and reserve component soldiers every 5 years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1089253212452344">28</xref></sup> Not long after the start of the OIF and OEF, USCENTCOM (US Central Command—the Unified Combatant Command over US Armed Forces in Central Asia, to include both OIF and OEF) mandated HIV rescreening of all deploying personnel 120 days prior to entering either theater of operation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1089253212452344">29</xref></sup> About the same time, the DoD mandated compulsory HBV immunization series for all new recruits into the armed forces.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1089253212452344">30</xref></sup> Any service member with HIV, hepatitis C virus (HCV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), or human T-lymphotropic virus (HTLV) is barred from deployment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1089253212452344">29</xref></sup></p>
<p>The safety of the FWB was further enhanced by a screening questionnaire. Since 1993, the Army used DD FORM 572 (version February 93) “BLOOD DONATION RECORD” as the screening tool for blood donors, which contained 32 questions addressing high-risk history and behavior. A modified version of this form (DD FORM 572 (WB)) was used for FWB donation, with 9 less questions (many of the nonapplicable questions, such as recent travel outside the United States, were removed) and extra wording at the bottom of the form reminding the donor that his or her donated blood would not be tested for viral disease prior to transfusion. Just prior to donation, donors were then tested for anemia using a copper sulfate test.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1089253212452344">27</xref></sup></p>
<p>Despite the final wording of DD FORM 572 (WB), efforts were in fact made during OIF and OEF to rapidly prescreen recently collected FWB for TTIs just prior to transfusion, although these efforts evolved over the course of the conflicts. Up until 2006, CSH laboratories had no standard TTI rapid screening test for FWB. Thus, in an effort to empirically improve the safety of FWB transfusion, from April to December 2004 the CSH in Baghdad used rapid immunochromatographic test kits purchased from Spain and shipped directly to the hospital. Because of limited availability of these kits, not all FWB could be screened.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1089253212452344">18</xref></sup> Moreover, the sensitivity and specificity of the test kits, reported by the manufacturer to be between 98% and 99% for each test, was challenged by an independent analysis by O’Connell at the US Army Walter Reed Institute of Research.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1089253212452344">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1089253212452344">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1089253212452344">32</xref></sup> The test kits have since been replaced with more reliable test kits.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1089253212452344">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>In addition to these immediate prescreening efforts samples were also collected from FWB donors and transported back to the United States to undergo formal testing and tracking for HBV, HCV, rapid precipitation reaction (RPR), HTLV I/II, HIV by ELISA/Western blot, and nucleic acid testing for HIV and HCV.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1089253212452344">27</xref></sup> All US recipients of FWB are required to undergo screening for TTIs initially and at 3, 6, and 12 months following transfusion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1089253212452344">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>Repine et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1089253212452344">27</xref></sup> report that while the 31st CSH manned the hospital at Ibn Sina in Baghdad, Iraq, FWB collected in this manner could be delivered to the operating room within 1 hour of being requested. During periods when high numbers of casualties were anticipated, such as during the second battle of Fallujah (Operation Phantom Fury<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1089253212452344">33</xref></sup>) in November and December 2004, whole blood was collected in advance and stored at room temperature for up to 8 hours, after which most of it was in fact transfused. After 8 hours, the unused units were placed in cold storage (4°C) and marked as non-FWB, considered equivalent to one unit of pRBCs and one unit of FFP (no platelet activity).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1089253212452344">27</xref></sup></p>
<p>Several authors argue that although this method of collecting and transfusing whole blood does carry certain risks, it does in fact limit recipient exposure to donors. Mathematically, a recipient who is transfused a unit of PRBCs, a unit of FFP, and a unit of aPLTs has several fold greater donor exposure than does a recipient who receives a single unit of whole blood.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1089253212452344">27</xref></sup></p>
<p>In September 2007, an epidemiologic consultation team from the US Army Public Health Command conducted an investigation to determine the risk of TTIs among recipients of FWB and PLTs in OEF and OIF. Using stored pre- and posttransfusion sera, the consultation team tested for HCV, HIV, and HBV among some 470 US Service Members who received emergency transfusion products. Selected regions of viral genomes from epidemiologically linked infected recipients and their donors were sequenced and compared.</p>
<p>The team discovered a single case of transfusion transmitted HCV infection (incidence rate of 2.1/1000). Perhaps more alarming was the discovery of 4 cases of HCV and 2 cases of chronic HBV (no cases of HIV) among the pretransfusion sera of recipients. As these recipients were themselves members of the potential emergency donor population, this study seemed to better characterize the safety of FWB. Among the authors’ conclusions was a call for rigorous application of existing in-theater countermeasures for screening emergency blood prior to transfusion, and, as an additional countermeasure, predeployment screening programs for HCV and HBV, like the ones already in place for HIV.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1089253212452344">34</xref></sup></p>
<p>Another risk associated with FWB transfusion is transfusion-associated microchimerism (TA-MC). Chimerism is the presence of more than one genetically distinct cell line in an organism that originated from one zygote, and microchimerism describes the phenomena when the allogenic cell population is small (&lt;5%). TA-MC is chimerism when the new cell line originates from a blood donor in a blood recipient. Developments in polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques have contributed considerably to TA-MC studies and indicate that the phenomenon is more common in transfusion recipients who suffer severe traumatic injuries and massive hemorrhage, and receive relatively fresh blood products.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1089253212452344">35</xref></sup> In a 2007 study undertaken by Utter et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1089253212452344">36</xref></sup> TA-MC cell lines were found to persist in combat injured veterans from World War II and the Korean and Vietnam wars, in some cases 60 years after transfusion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1089253212452344">36</xref></sup></p>
<p>In a study by Dunne et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1089253212452344">37</xref></sup> prospective posttransfusion data were collected at &gt;14 days on 26 severely injured combat casualties between December 2006 and March 2007. Among these patients, 4 were not transfused any blood products, and all 4 tested negative for microchimerism. However, TA-MC was present in 45% (10 of 22) patients who were transfused at least 1 unit of blood. The prevalence of TA-MC trended toward a higher risk among those who were transfused FWB or aPLTs: 50% (3 of 6) in FWB recipients, 50% (4 of 8) in recipients of platelets and only 38% (3 of 8) in those who only received pRBCs. However, the difference in the rate of TA-MC between the pRBC group and the FWB and aPLT groups did not reach clinical significance (<italic>P</italic> = .60 and <italic>P</italic> = .38, respectively). The authors advocate larger studies to tease out this trend, as well as to ascertain possible clinical consequences such as graft-versus-host disease or autoimmune disease syndromes, among patients with TA-MC.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1089253212452344">37</xref></sup></p>

<title>The Current State of Affairs: The Clinical Practice Guidelines</title>
<p>Among much of the valuable literature published by the USAISR are the “CENTCOM JTTS CPGs” (Central Command/Joint Theater Trauma System Clinical Practice Guidelines). These generally evidence-based guidelines represent the current thinking by the US military on a host of medical issues, to include the use of FWB. The CPG for FWB transfusion was first released in 2006 and has since undergone regular review, most recently in February 2011. The FWB CPG recommends reserving the use of FWB for casualties requiring massive transfusion, with clinically significant shock or coagulopathy (eg, bleeding with associated metabolic acidosis, thrombocytopenia or international normalized ratio &gt;1.5), when optimal component therapy is unavailable or resuscitation with stored CT is not adequate (most likely at level I and II facilities), and there is an immediate threat of loss of life, limb, or eyesight. In facilities where full CT is available (eg, level III facilities), the CPG clearly states, given infectious concerns, that “the risk:benefit ratio does not justify the routine use of FWB over banked blood products in non life- threatening severe trauma.” However, when platelets and FFP inventories are depleted or exhausted, such as mass casualty situations, “the use of FWB remains an appropriate life-saving option.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1089253212452344">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>The FWB CPG describes the precautions involved in the use of FWB, much of which is achieved with the establishment of a prescreened pool of potential donors. Even with such a pool of donors in place, the CPG highly recommends the use of on-site rapid screening immunoassays for infectious disease (HIV, HBV, HCV) before FWB is transfused. In the appendix of this CPG, the precise steps of collecting FWB are described, to include performing “HIV, HCV, HBsAg, RPR, and as required, Malaria test, in accordance with the manufacturer’s insert or standard operating procedure.” In this same appendix, in the “Equipment and Materials” section for FWB collection and transfusion are listed the Oraquick ADVANCE Rapid HIV-1/2 Antibody Test, the Oraquick®HCV Rapid Antibody Test kit, and the OnSite HBsAg Rapid Test-Dip Strip (Serum/Plasma). The package insert for the OnSite HBsAg Rapid Test-Dip Strip lists a relative sensitivity of 96% and a relative specificity of 100%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1089253212452344">38</xref></sup> The literature contained in the OraQuick HCV Rapid Antibody Test and the Oraquick ADVANCE Rapid HIV-1/2 Antibody Test suggest sensitivities and sensitivities &gt;96% in a high-risk population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1089253212452344">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1089253212452344">40</xref></sup></p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Although the use of FWB waned with the advent of CT, it has remained a valuable tool in the repertory of battlefield physicians since its introduction in World War I. FWB was used once more by the US military in the austere operating rooms of Iraq and Afghanistan, where it again proved its effectiveness in resuscitation and correcting coagulopathy, particularly in the setting of massive transfusions. But like all instruments and strategies, FWB carries certain risks, such as the increased possibility of TTIs. These risks, however, must be considered in the context in which they were undertaken: the resource-limited massive resuscitation of a rapidly exsanguinating combat casualty. Those who have been party to such an effort can appreciate just how welcome FWB is, even with its risks, particularly when no other alternative is available.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the risk of TTI with FWB has been mitigated by a series of measures put in place by the US military, to include the rapid prescreening of freshly collected whole blood. Such improvements in safety may aid in the reintroduction of FWB in civilian trauma resuscitation, where resources may be less restricted, but where a product that offers all that FWB does would be no less welcome.</p>
