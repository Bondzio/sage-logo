<abstract>
<p>The present article addresses sociolinguistic issues in a literary context, namely regional variation in James Joyce’s <italic>A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man</italic>, a relevant, though not fully analysed, aspect of this novel. By the end of the 19th century most of Ireland was predominantly English speaking, but taking on a foreign language meant for the Irish a form of exile from their own identity, place and history. Revivalist writers responded to such a tension by using Hiberno-English, until it eventually became established as a literary medium. As is clear from my analysis, dialectal usage powerfully contributes to the vivid realization of most characters in Joyce’s novel, reflecting their regional provenance and social background. The representation of the linguistic situation thus offered is realistic and extensive, but also innovative in the context of the Irish Literary Revival. More importantly, it illustrates the protagonist’s views on national identity, and his struggles to find his own voice in the midst of the polyphony prevalent in turn-of-the-century Dublin. As this article argues, the dialogical tension between hybrid Irish English and standard English is truly essential to a comprehensive reading of <italic>A</italic> (colonial) <italic>Portrait</italic>.</p>

<title>1 Introduction: The languages of colonial Ireland<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0963947012469750">1</xref></sup></title>
<p>Cut off from the riches of the Irish language tradition, 19th-century Irish writers were deprived of voice. As Thomas Kinsella puts it, they ‘could never be properly “at home” in the English tradition … The result was a perceived sense of loss and discontinuity, the “divided mind” of a dual heritage and allegiance’ (cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0963947012469750">Corcoran, 1997</xref>: 12). For this reason, the Irish Literary Revival raised questions of national and cultural identity, including linguistic issues concerning Hiberno-English, and James Joyce contributed to this debate both in his creative and in his critical work (see, for instance, ‘The Day of the Rabblement’, ‘The Soul of Ireland’, or ‘Ireland at the Bar’ – <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0963947012469750">Joyce, 2000</xref>). The present article deals with the interconnections between language, power and identity in the Irish context as reflected by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0963947012469750">Joyce in <italic>A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man</italic> (1916)</xref>. As will be clear from my analysis, dialectal usage on Joyce’s part decisively contributes to shaping the idiolects spoken by most characters; consequently this novel offers a realistic representation of the linguistic situation in Dublin from a sociolinguistic point of view at a pivotal moment in the linguistic history of Ireland. Such linguistic conflict also illustrates the main character’s struggles to find his own voice in the middle of the confusing polyphony prevalent in turn-of-the-century Dublin; struggles which take place within the broader context of national identity construction by revivalist movements.</p>
<p>The linguistic history of Ireland is inextricably linked to the British colonial expansion in the island and the long-standing contact between Irish and English. Although most of Ireland had become predominantly English speaking by the end of the 19th century, it also witnessed the emergence of important linguistic and literary revivalist movements. Together with the attempt to revive Irish and the Gaelic culture, there was an extraordinary explosion of literary creation in English that sought inspiration from Irish mythology, folklore and popular culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0963947012469750">Lloyd, 1993</xref>: 45; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0963947012469750">Nolan, 1995</xref>: 24). Linguistic issues were central to questions of national and cultural identity raised by the Anglo-Irish writers of the Literary Revival, and focused mainly on the hybrid speech of the Irish, who had appropriated the English spoken in colonial Ireland and transformed it into a distinctive variety, Hiberno-English.</p>
<p>The long literary history of Irish English goes back to medieval times, when writers employed their own dialects of English. Nevertheless, with the establishment of a standard variety in the modern period, the use of a single standard language for literature became widespread, and the use of an artificial dialectal brogue was confined to the stereotypical Irish character or ‘stage Irishman’ – a sort of buffoon figure dating from the 17th century – easily identified by his comic contradictory and inconsistent statements or Irish bulls. Such patronizing attempts to represent the accent and ‘faulty’ English of the Irish were politically motivated: their inability to speak English ‘properly’ evidenced that they were a wild, primitive and uncivilized race incapable of self-government, and, therefore, in need of the hegemonic control of the British (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0963947012469750">Cheng, 1995</xref>: 32). Interestingly, ‘publishers tolerated and encouraged brogue-write, but often resisted Hiberno-English unless it were misspelled, as if correct spelling could only be the perfect reflection of some received, but undefined British English’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0963947012469750">Croghan, 1986</xref>: 262). Anglo-Irish writers resisted cultural erosion and subordination through their attempt to dignify the use of Hiberno-English as a national literary language, a move that began almost accidentally with Douglas Hyde’s literal translations into English of folk-tales and poems originally written in Irish Gaelic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0963947012469750">Mercier, 1996</xref>: 367). However, William Butler Yeats’s efforts for an official recognition of the dialect were not backed by nationalist leaders such as David Patrick Moran, who ‘dubbed the dialect a “hopeless half-way house,” neither good Irish nor good English, but a sort of bastard lingo which grew in the no-man’s land between two authentic cultures’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0963947012469750">Kiberd, 1993</xref>: xvi).</p>
<p>James Joyce believed that Irish was ‘no longer a feasible literary medium’ because it was alien to most (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0963947012469750">Kiberd, 1996</xref>: 31). Standard English, on the other hand, had to be acquired through education, as in other regions with their own distinctive geographic variety, and ‘did not provide a comprehensive expressive medium for Irish people either’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0963947012469750">Kiberd, 1996</xref>: 31). Although Joyce was aware that Irish writers who aspired to reach a wider audience had to confine themselves to using standard English, that also meant being placed within the limits of its literary tradition, which was a form of cultural exile in an imposed language (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0963947012469750">Rabaté, 1991</xref>: 123). The employment of Hiberno-English was Joyce’s response to the tension provoked by being an Irish writer who did not write in Irish. Even if Joyce viewed his dialect as an incompletely established literary medium and did not wish to be identified with revivalist writers and their overuse of dialectalisms (see, for instance, his satirical broadsides ‘The Holy Office’ and ‘Gas from a Burner’ – <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0963947012469750">Joyce, 1991</xref>), his depiction of Dublin life demanded a realistic approach to its actual speech practices. Joyce was aware of the inseparability of language, cultural identity and relationship to place, and, in this sense, Hiberno-English was a true living vernacular. According to Wales, his sharp ear for the different varieties of Irish English, particularly his sensitivity to Dublin street-talk, can ‘be compared with the dramatic language of the Dublin-set plays of his contemporary Sean O’Casey and later Brendan Behan’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0963947012469750">Wales, 1993</xref>: 13). The fact that Hiberno-English features more prominently in <italic>Ulysses</italic> (1922) and <italic>Finnegans Wake</italic> (1939) than in his earlier texts, attests to Joyce’s increasing interest in his own hybrid tongue.</p>

<sec id="section2-0963947012469750">
<title>2 Hiberno-English and idiolectal specificity in <italic>A Portrait</italic></title>
<p>Characterization through idiolectal specificity is central to <italic>A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man</italic>, and a close examination of the novel shows that the idiolects spoken by most characters and the narrator are shaped to a greater or lesser extent by dialectal usage (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0963947012469750">Wales, 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0963947012469750">1993</xref>). In fact, the principal characters in <italic>A Portrait</italic> together with their birthplaces are often based on real people Joyce knew personally. These biographical parallels are normally confirmed by internal evidence, such as commentaries on the characters’ accents and varieties they speak, and explicit allusions to their origins. The prevalent linguistic variety in this text is the educated urban Southern Hiberno-English spoken by the Dublin Catholic petite bourgeoisie, primarily represented by its protagonist, Stephen Dedalus. However, Joyce’s accurate use of non-standard speech reflects the regional provenance of the different characters, as well as their social background. As will be seen, Joyce succeeds in capturing not only the richness of Hiberno-English vocabulary and grammar, but also the cadences and rhythms of the speech patterns of the Irish, an essential aspect in his poetic prose. The aim of the present section is to examine the most typical Irish English features as employed by Joyce in <italic>A Portrait</italic>. For the sake of clarity, the relevant idiolects are grouped together according to the following categories: urban variation in Southern Hiberno-English (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0963947012469750">Table 1</xref>), rural variation in Southern Hiberno-English (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0963947012469750">Table 2</xref>), education in Southern Hiberno-English (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0963947012469750">Table 3</xref>), and Northern Hiberno-English (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0963947012469750">Table 4</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0963947012469750">2</xref></sup>. The sociolinguistic analysis of the various idiolects in <italic>A Portrait</italic> includes not only regional and social variables, but also occasional references to situational varieties dependant on the addressees and the communication contexts, and to specialized jargons determined by the topic of the conversation. The perspective, however, is mainly dialectal because the focus of this study is the description and interpretation of the pervasive use of Irish English in James Joyce’s novel.</p>

<p>Present-day Irish English can be broadly divided into Southern Hiberno-English (south of the line from Sligo to Drogheda) and Northern Hiberno-English (north of the line from Bundoran to Dundalk), with a zone of transition in between. Within Southern Hiberno-English, urban and rural varieties can be further distinguished, but the fact is that there is a good deal of homogeneity, and differences at the grammatical level are better described in terms of quantity, rather than quality. The reason, argues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0963947012469750">Bliss (1977</xref>: 18–19), is to be found in transfer from the Irish language. In <italic>A Portrait</italic>, Dublin speech is best illustrated by Stephen Dedalus (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0963947012469750">Table 1</xref>). A close look at his idiolect reveals a recurrence of some Irish English features, namely, the dialectal use of <italic>will</italic> (1), past tense form with a perfective meaning (2), and vernacular vocabulary, such as <italic>bring</italic> (‘take’) (3), <italic>come-all-yous</italic> (‘old country song’) (4) and <italic>strong</italic> (‘rich, well-to-do’) (5). His language is representative of the Dublin Hiberno-English spoken by the middle class, a variety that has not escaped Irish influence. Moreover, as the son of a Munster man, Stephen’s speech has ‘traces of a Cork accent’ (90: 18–19): he belongs to a large proportion of the Dublin population which either originated from outside of it, or was the first generation of Dubliners born to migrants settled in the capital.</p>
<p>By contrast, the urban speech of Cork, mainly conveyed through the voices of Simon Dedalus (the protagonist’s father) and his friend Johnny Cashman, is particularly rich in Hibernicisms. Although Simon Dedalus is ‘a small landlord’ (208: 16) with superior education, and in spite of his alleged efforts ‘for thirty years to get rid of his Cork accent up in Dublin’ (90: 6–8), his speech is prolific in constructions and expressions that are common in Ireland. Some of these are the use of the imperative <italic>do be + -ing</italic> (6) and of the personal pronoun <italic>you</italic> in place of the reflexive <italic>yourself</italic> (7). The employment of the simple past with a perfective meaning (8) and the omission of the relative pronoun in subject position (9) are non-standard features representative of Simon’s idiolect. The character’s origins are similarly disclosed by his choice of words – <italic>ay</italic> (‘yes’) (10), <italic>maneen</italic> (‘conceited or precocious boy’) (11) or <italic>show</italic> (‘give, hand’) (12) among others – and by his Munster pronunciation of <italic>tuck you</italic> as ‘tuckoo’ (13) and of <italic>endured</italic> as ‘<italic>injured</italic>’ (14). Also, the presence of many oral features of a markedly popular nature – over-use of polysyndeton and emphatic devices, as well as profusion of idioms, hyperboles and similes – further contribute to the rhythms of Simon’s speech patterns, and to the vigour and verisimilitude of his carefully recreated Munster speech. As for Johnny Cashman, he resorts in his limited contributions to fronting (15) and to the modal response to <italic>yes/no</italic> questions (16), both characteristic of colloquial Hiberno-English. He also employs expletives, such as the Irish <italic>yerra</italic> (17) and <italic>bedad</italic>, both meaning ‘by God’ (18).</p>
<p>On the other hand, social class and education are two of the most significant determinants of linguistic variation, with regional differences, generally speaking, more apparent at the lowest socio-economic level. In an Irish context, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0963947012469750">Filppula (1999</xref>: 12) associates the speech of members of the urban working class having little formal education with vernacular varieties, on the grounds that they clearly display grammatical peculiarities that deviate from the norms and usages of standard English grammar. Social variables play an important role in the idiolectal specificity in <italic>A Portrait</italic>: even if only anecdotally, they increase the range of voices that can be heard in the novel, thus broadening the social spectrum portrayed by Joyce. In this sense, interesting Hibernicisms are displayed in the speech of three Dubliners belonging to the lower class: the girl coming out of Jacob’s biscuit factory, a flower-girl, and the urchin in Moynihan’s imitation. In fact, it is quite significant that their four short sentences contain several dialectal features, namely the past form <italic>seen</italic> (19), the demonstrative use of <italic>them</italic> (20), progressive aspect with a perfective meaning (21), and the noun <italic>handsel</italic> (‘the first sale in the day’) (22).</p>
<p>With regard to rural variation, the most representative idiolects in Joyce’s novel are those of Davin (‘the peasant student’ (158: 16) at University College Dublin), and, to a lesser degree, John Casey, who is a friend of Simon Dedalus’s, and Temple, another university student (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0963947012469750">Table 2</xref>). Along with a fairly standard form of English, Davin speaks a markedly rural vernacular. Thus, he resorts to the simple past to express hypothetical meaning (23) and to the use of reflexive pronouns with no antecedent (24). Another typical Hibernicism present in Davin’s idiolect is embedded inversion of indirect speech and thought (25). At a lexical level, Davin’s vocabulary is rich and expressive, including vernacular <italic>disremember</italic> (‘forget’) (26), <italic>leastways</italic> (‘at any rate, at all events’) (27), <italic>noise</italic> (‘quarrel, row’) (27), <italic>aim’s ace</italic> (‘small amount or distance’) (28), and the sport terms <italic>camaun</italic> (‘crooked-shaped stick used in hurley’) (28) or <italic>mind cool</italic> (‘stand at the goal of one’s hurley team’) (29). Rural speech in Ireland is further illustrated by John Casey’s historic present (30), and by Temple’s consuetudinal aspect (31) and lexicon, such as <italic>cod</italic> (‘humbug’) (32).</p>
<p>Rural low-status speech, on the other hand, is embodied in <italic>A Portrait</italic> by the ‘old harridan’ (43: 37) from Co. Wicklow, the peasant woman of Davin’s story, and the old man in a mountain cabin from the west. Although too short to be truly representative, their utterances contain several Irishisms, such as the past participle <italic>drownded</italic> (33), the intensive filler <italic>entirely</italic> (34), the phrase <italic>in it</italic> (‘there, present’) (35), the noun <italic>call</italic> (‘need, occasion’) (36) and the expression <italic>latter end</italic> (‘end’) (37).</p>
<p>Allied to regional considerations and of particular relevance to this sociolinguistic study is education, a social variable that deserves a closer analysis in the context of Joyce’s <italic>Bildungsroman</italic>. Quirk and Greenbaum explain that ‘There is an important polarity of uneducated and educated speech in which the former can be identified with the regional dialect most completely and the latter moves away from dialectal usage to a form of English that cuts across dialectal boundaries’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0963947012469750">Quirk and Greenbaum, 1973</xref>: 3), that is, standard English. Such is the case with the Jesuits in <italic>A Portrait</italic>, who speak a fairly standard form of English, both grammatically and lexically, despite the fact that they are from different parts of Ireland. Élite Irish colleges were in fact modelled on English public schools. The private education system in England – based on boarding schools insulated from the area where they were located – traditionally transmitted the standard variety of English and its associated pronunciation, RP English, both identified with the prestige of its socially privileged speakers. In Ireland, Moran’s ‘crusade against respectability’ targeted educated Catholics on linguistic grounds. He claimed that socially ambitious Irish people, nationalists included, ‘had learned to speak in the “accents of the Imperial Saxon”’ and favoured the acquisition of ‘superior accents’ by the ‘teaching of phonetics’ in Irish colleges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0963947012469750">Pašeta, 1999</xref>: 134).</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the speech of students in <italic>A Portrait</italic> attests to the relative success of these linguistic aims, at least in regard to its morphosyntactic features (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0963947012469750">Table 3</xref>). The idiolects of younger schoolboys at Clongowes are generally richer in informal vernacular structures and expressions, such as the presence of the plural <italic>us</italic> (38), non-standard uses of the definite article (39), and colloquial expressions – <italic>let on</italic> (‘divulge, confess’) (40), <italic>able for</italic> (‘fit to cope with’) (41), <italic>stinking</italic> (‘bad, abominable’) (42). Irish English is on occasion the true protagonist of the novel, as when Thunder explains that five boys in the higher line have run away from school ‘Because they had fecked cash out of the rector’s room’ (47: 10–11). It is clear from the context that Hiberno-English <italic>feck</italic> means ‘steal’ (43), and this is later on confirmed by Stephen’s musing. Wells gives a different reason: the five students have ‘scut’ (47: 16) after drinking the altar wine. The sense of dialectal <italic>scut</italic> (‘run away without being seen’) is once again obvious from the topic of conversation and from a previous reference to their ‘run[ning] away’ (47: 9) (44). A third explanation is finally offered by another student, Athy: they have escaped because they were caught ‘Smugging’ (49: 4) ‘in the square one night’ (48: 37–38) (45). The listeners remain silent and Stephen does not dare ask for the meaning of the vernacular verb <italic>smug</italic> (‘toy amorously in secret’), so that the reader remains ignorant of what is perceived to be the true motive. In another pivotal moment in the novel, Stephen approaches some Belvedere schoolmates who are bathing at the Bull Wall. The colloquial language of Ennis, Shuley, Dwyer and Connolly is noticeably non-standard, including, among other peculiarities, a Hibernicized use of the preposition <italic>for</italic> (46) and the verb <italic>guzzle</italic> (‘take by the throat’) (47).</p>
<p>Unlike the younger students at Clongowes and Belvedere, the university students are able to switch between different varieties, as illustrated by Cranly: he speaks in an extremely colloquial register marked by alliterative cursing and slang, a favourite tag of his – ‘do you know’ – and dialectal usage. Some such features are the employment of the preposition <italic>of</italic> before a personal pronoun (48) and of adverbials of place without the required preposition (49), emphasis through cleft sentences (50), and Hiberno-English words like <italic>sugan</italic> (‘straw or hay rope’) (51). Yet, he shifts to a more standardized English in his religious discussions with Stephen.</p>
<p>Finally, the Northern Hiberno-English distinctive accent is summarily represented in Joyce’s novel by MacAlister, a university student, and by the unnamed Director and Rector at Belvedere (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0963947012469750">Table 4</xref>). MacAlister asks with his ‘sharp Ulster voice … Are we likely to be asked questions on applied science?’ (169: 1–2), pronouncing ‘the word <italic>science</italic> as a monosyllable’ (169: 22), that is, omitting or absorbing the schwa in the triphthong (52). Stephen’s predisposition against Northern Irish people is made explicit (169: 9–10) and he ignores the Ulsterman’s opinion when, after the lecture, he recognizes ‘the harsh tone of MacAlister’s voice’ (173: 38). On the other hand, the Director and Rector at Belvedere utters the French word ‘<italic>jupes</italic>’ (138: 19) in such a way that ‘The vowel was so modified as to be indistinct’ (138: 21), probably articulating the standard back long /u:/ of <italic>jupes</italic> as a fronted shorter /u/, a phonological characteristic of Northern Hiberno-English (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0963947012469750">Harris, 1984</xref>: 118) (53). The Director’s geographical background is not only revealed by his accent, but also by some sporadic dialectalisms, such as the use of future <italic>will</italic> with first person pronouns (54), and of <italic>let you</italic> imperative (55). Though based on English and Lowland Scots, the impact of the Irish language on Northern Hiberno-English is noticeable too.</p>
<p>As we can see, not only is Joyce’s use of Irish English in <italic>A Portrait</italic> realistic and accurate; it is also extensive, including a wide range of regional, social, situational and communicative variables in all domains of linguistic organization, from discourse and turn of phrase through to pronunciation and grammar. It is innovative too in the context of the Irish Literary Revival, particularly when contrasted to the highly marked varieties of the rural west of Ireland that were represented in texts by writers like John M Synge or Lady Gregory. Joyce’s use of vernacular speech is interesting both at a sociolinguistic and at a literary level. However, in addition to contributing powerfully to the vivid realization of characters and, therefore, to the identification of the Irish audience with them, the dialectal dimension of Joyce’s work also reveals a clear cultural and political stance on his part that cannot be ignored and that will be the focus of the next section.</p>

<title>3 Hiberno-English and identity in <italic>A Portrait</italic></title>
<p><italic>A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man</italic> is also a portrait of Ireland as a British colony. In this <italic>Bildungsroman</italic> Stephen Dedalus’s formative years take place in a colonial environment over a period of 11 years, from Charles Stewart Parnell’s death (1891) to the Celtic revival around the turn of the century. And yet, despite the numerous political, cultural and historical allusions in the novel, it is Stephen’s fascination with language – naturally enough also permeated with political overtones – that is its major concern. A prominent aspect of <italic>A Portrait</italic> is Stephen’s ambivalent attitude towards Irish English, in spite of his middle-class Dublin accent. His linguistic dilemma is exposed in his conversation with the Dean of Studies, an Englishman, at University College Dublin. Communication between the two characters is deficient at a conceptual and linguistic level, and when the Dean authoritatively explains how to fill an oil lamp, there is some misunderstanding about the word ‘funnel’ or ‘tundish’ in Ireland (165: 6–16). Their embarrassing conversation is interrupted by the narrator in order to include the protagonist’s reaction and his often-quoted considerations on English and Hiberno-English: ‘The language in which we are speaking is his before it is mine. How different are the words <italic>home, Christ, ale, master</italic> on his lips and on mine! I cannot speak or write these words without unrest of spirit. His language, so familiar and so foreign, will always be for me an acquired speech’ (166: 5–9). Burgess argues that when Stephen thinks of the words <italic>home, Christ, ale</italic> and <italic>master</italic>, he has in mind their different pronunciation by English and Irish people. Irish subjection is further represented by the etymology of these four words: <italic>home</italic> and <italic>ale</italic> come from Old English; <italic>Christ</italic>, from Greek; and <italic>master</italic>, from Latin. They are also meaningful at a semantic level, since <italic>home</italic> and <italic>master</italic> allude to the subjugation of Stephen’s country deprived of Home Rule under the imperial master; <italic>Christ</italic>, to the religious subordination suffered by Catholics; and <italic>ale</italic> is immediately associated to English customs and culture. This highly condensed episode thus shows that Stephen ‘feels the weight of three kinds of authority in the Dean’s speech – the ruling class, the Imperial power, the international Church. His own accent is not merely provincial, it is also that of a subject people’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0963947012469750">Burgess, 1973</xref>: 28).</p>
<p>Stephen’s ‘unrest of spirit’ turns into embarrassment and abuse at the end of the novel when he learns that <italic>tundish</italic> ‘is English and good old blunt English too. Damn the dean of studies and his funnel! What did he come here for to teach us his own language or to learn it from us?’ (217: 11–13). Stephen finally realizes that the dialectal term is<disp-quote>
<p>the more venerable English, since it, rather than ‘funnel,’ is the language of the Elizabethans and has significant literary sanction. ‘Tundish’ figures in Shakespeare’s <italic>Measure for Measure</italic>, and is first recorded in the fourteenth century, whereas ‘funnel’ is a fifteenth-century French derivation. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0963947012469750">Corcoran, 1997</xref>: 2)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In fact, Stephen’s occasional prejudice towards the most marked varieties of Hiberno-English – the rural and lower-class speeches – reveals his shame for what he perceives as the plebeian and ignoble variety of the poor and backward Irish. The sharp contrast between Stephen and Davin, who is the character who most clearly embodies and voices the agenda of the revivalist movement in the novel, is prominently represented in terms of their languages. Despite the fact that Davin speaks both a fairly standard form of English and a markedly rural vernacular, Stephen only responds to the latter, which he snobbishly associates with the speech of simple-minded and rustic country peasants, and mocks Davin’s dialectalisms omitting – as is common in Ireland – the preposition required by <italic>happen</italic> in ‘that’s not the strange thing that happened you?’ (160: 4; in accordance to the manuscript and earlier printed versions of the novel, the preposition <italic>to</italic>, included in Anderson’s edition, is omitted). Another relevant passage in the novel commented on by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0963947012469750">Deane (1998</xref>: 376) is the following:<disp-quote>
<p>Tea was nearly over and only the last of the second watered tea remained in the bottoms of the small glass jars and jampots which did service for teacups … Little wells of tea lay here and there on the board and a knife with a broken ivory handle was stuck through the pith of a ravaged turnover. (144: 41–145: 6)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The Dedalus family is not having an afternoon tea. What they are having is their main evening meal, which consists of just ‘watered tea’ and a ‘turnover’. The full understanding of the excerpt depends on three dialectal terms: <italic>tea</italic> (‘evening meal’), <italic>pith</italic> (‘the crumb of a loaf’) and <italic>turnover</italic> (‘loaf of bread shaped like a boot’). They seem to suggest the socio-economic decline of Stephen’s family, aligned in linguistic terms too with the lower class.</p>
<p>In spite of being Stephen’s own vernacular, Hiberno-English is also the language of the surrounding squalid and distressful reality from which he persistently tries to escape by means of ‘words and images of a prior age’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0963947012469750">Spoo, 1994</xref>: 53). One such escapist outlet is provided by evocations of the Elizabethan age (201: 28–36). The archaic and distinguished resonance of the words <italic>chambering, mantled, ambered, pavan, gentlewomen, wooing, poxfouled, wenches, taverns, ravishers</italic> and <italic>clipped</italic> grant Stephen access to a distant and remote past. His linguistic escapism is, however, ironic, since one of these words, the verb <italic>clip</italic>, is also a Hibernicism of Old-English origin meaning ‘embrace’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0963947012469750">Ó Muirithe, 1996</xref>: 111). As we can see, although Stephen is aware of the multicultural sources of Hiberno-English, he uses vernacular <italic>tundish</italic> oblivious of its Elizabethan origin and is annoyed when he learns of it, whereas he delights in old <italic>clipped</italic> ignoring that it is alive in his dialect. His love for Elizabethan language takes him back in a curious and ironic turn to the reality of his own hybrid speech.</p>
<p>Seeking like many contemporary intellectuals to define the cultural identity of the Irish and to achieve the spiritual liberation of his country, young Stephen aims at defining first his identity as a writer. In other words, he aims at finding his own personal voice amid the complex interplay of voices around him that includes not only the different languages, dialects, sociolects, jargons, registers and idiolects, but also the various social and ideological discourses. Paradoxically Stephen tries to find his own voice both through the appropriation of the language of others and through his distance from Irish English. He wishes to speak a more formal English that is closer to standard, because he is aware that standardized accents are generally rated higher and considered more prestigious, which befits the cultured artist and sophisticated intellectual he wishes to project; his ‘formal way of speaking is, as he himself tells us, a carefully acquired habit, an attempt to disentangle himself from his environment and the “nets” which have been flung at him’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0963947012469750">Naremore, 1976</xref>: 128–129). The fact is, however, that standard English language is another ‘authoritative word’ in <italic>A Portrait</italic> closely associated with cultural hegemony and political coercion; and the fact is that young Stephen is not ready yet to assume the subversive or appropriating nature of the hybrid dialect of the Irish. Under a snobbish feeling of superiority, he aims at speaking a prestigious standardized English and is occasionally prejudiced against his regional variety. At the same time, he realizes that the ties between language and socio-geographical milieu are not so easily severed, and is painfully made aware of the inescapability of his roots, a tangle of ‘nets’ he cannot ‘fly by’ (177: 31). The immature writer-to-be has not fully understood that, just as identity and location go hand in hand, art cannot be dissociated from the reality, including the linguistic reality, that inspires it. Davin could not tell the story of his encounter with the peasant woman in standard English, because there is an essential connection between soil and language: it is precisely Davin’s use of the dialect that enables the reader to glimpse a different culture in a different place.</p>

<title>4 Conclusion</title>
<p>Stephen’s linguistic insecurity and his youth complexes echo the lingusitic struggles of the Irish and their search for an unbroken collective identity. The Irish revival limited the debate on national identity to the choice of nationalism over cosmopolitanism. Exploring the hybridity of popular forms in colonial Ireland, Lloyd shows the unrepresentativeness of nationalist literature: ‘The antagonism to the urban is … an antagonism to the inauthenticity legible in its cultural forms. Cork and Dublin, along with Belfast, represent in mid-nineteenth-century Ireland … sites of cultural hybridization as well as centres of imperial authority and capital domination’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0963947012469750">Lloyd, 1993</xref>: 93). Revivalist literature favoured the idealization of a pre-industrial rural society, and the Irish Catholic middle class welcomed this romanticized national mythology about rural Ireland as the authentic Ireland. Irish nationalism also sought to supersede the multiplicity of contending social voices – the ‘heteroglossia’ characteristic of the novel – in the form of a unified national identity.</p>
<p>James Joyce, however, did not submit to Celtic ethnocentrism and refused to be involved in the Gaelic revival or in nationalist public activities. In ‘The Day of the Rabblement’ he voiced his opinion that the Literary Revival had given in to the caricatured popular version of a Celtic pseudo-Irishness, criticized it for parochially rejecting Europeanization in its dealing solely with Irish themes and folklore, and accused the Irish Literary Theatre of being ‘the property of the rabblement of the most belated race in Europe’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0963947012469750">Joyce, 2000</xref>: 50). Aware of the artistic and intellectual limitations of the movement, Joyce advocated cosmopolitanism over what he saw as culturally regressive provincialism. In contrast to the aversion felt by revivalists for the modern, urban society, Joyce had as the subject matter of his books the petit bourgeois Dublin life. In <italic>A Portrait</italic>, and to a greater extent in <italic>Ulysses</italic> and <italic>Finnegans Wake</italic>, he is concerned both thematically and stylistically with the hybridization of the Irish culture and the ‘adulteration’ of the Irish race, and dutifully represents the symphony of voices and discourses prevalent in turn-of-the-century Dublin. Aiming at a broader European context, Joyce questions and lays bare the manipulative discourses of both nationalism and colonialism. He tries to define the ‘uncreated conscience’ (218: 15–16) of his race, one that is free from the prejudices and myths of both nationalist tradition and British imperialism, but inclusive of both cultures, traditions and languages as his own. As this article argues, an important reason for Joyce’s use of Hiberno-English as a literary medium is his interest in its subversive and decolonizing powers. The dialogical tension between hybrid Hiberno-English and standard English is therefore central in the development of the novel’s main character and truly essential to a comprehensive reading of <italic>A</italic> (colonial) <italic>Portrait</italic>.</p>
