<abstract>
<p>We present a case report of a nine-year-old asymptomatic girl with a large cystic lesion of the left hemithorax, occupying almost 80% of the left hemithorax, first believed to be a parasitic cyst that was operated and proved to be of parietal pericardial origin. Mediastinal cysts and pericardial cysts in particular are mostly discovered accidentally and so was the case with our patient. The diagnosis included not only clinical examination but also the utilization of computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. The only treatment for pericardial cysts is surgical excision and patients recover fully with no complication.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>We present a case of a nine-year-old girl with no previous medical history that was referred to our unit with a large cystic lesion on the left hemithorax. Mediastinal cysts and pericardial cysts in particular are rare in the young population and the overall incidence of pericardial cyst is 1:1,000,000 in all age groups and very few cases below the age of 18 years.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2150135112471351">1</xref>
</sup> These constitute only 6% of all mediastinal masses and up to 11% of all mediastinal cysts.<sup>

</sup> In most of the cases, these cysts are asymptomatic and are found incidentally during routine chest radiography or echocardiography.</p>

<title>Case Report</title>
<p>The patient is a nine-year-old girl with no past medical history and normal development. She was first seen by a pediatrician, because of a viral infection, without accompanying chest pain or shortness of breath. The examination revealed decreased breath sounds over the left chest. The chest x-ray and chest and abdominal computed tomography (CT) revealed a large 12 × 7 cm, fluid to viscous filled cyst, on the left hemithorax (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-2150135112471351">Figure 1A</xref> and B), with no clear point of origin. There was evidence of various compartments within the cyst but no signs of any parasitic organisms. The patient was tested for possible Hydatid infection and although the first set of tests were just above the normal values the second consecutive set of tests were within normal limits. The full blood count revealed no eosinophilia and both C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were only mildly elevated. To complete the diagnosis an magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-2150135112471351">Figure 1C</xref>) which was in accordance with the findings of the CT. Echocardiogram, although routinely done in all patients in our department, was not used in this case as the MRI and CT were sufficient to support the decision to proceed with surgery and investigate the cyst by direct vision.</p>

<p>She was transferred to our unit and after discussing the treatment options with her parents she was prepared for surgery. A left anterolateral thoracotomy was performed, through the 6th intercostal space. We chose open thoracotomy to video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS), taking into account the unclear point of origin and the possibility that the cyst could have been a parasitic hydatid cyst with possible contamination of the thoracic cavity if wrongly manipulated. Upon entering the left hemithorax, a large mass filled with dark fluid was apparent with no visible point of origin, occupying almost 80% of the left hemithorax. Due to the size, and the indefinable borders to the left lung, which was compressed and atelectatic, we were unable to safely manipulate the lesion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-2150135112471351">Figure 2A</xref>). We then proceeded to aspirate and evacuate the cyst, so as to facilitate excision. As much as, 540 mL of bloody chocolate-colored viscous fluid were aspirated, with no spill of contents in the hemithorax and was sent to the laboratory for further investigations, including Gram stain and cytology. The lesion was now easier to manipulate and we were able to identify some attachments to the diaphragm, posterior mediastinum, and proceeded with dissection. The point of origin was in fact the parietal pericardium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-2150135112471351">Figure 2B</xref>). The cyst appeared to be lined with a thick capsule and there was no indication of a parasitic infection. The phrenic nerve was also trapped within the cyst and we were able to mobilize and conserve it (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-2150135112471351">Figure 2C</xref>). We then proceeded in ligating the point of origin in the pericardium. Subsequently, the left lung expanded fully. The excised cyst was send for further tests. The histology report identified the cyst as a pericardial cyst with areas of inflammation and calcification, with no signs of malignancy.</p>

<p>The girl was transferred to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) and was extubated two hours after the end of the procedure. She was transferred to the normal ward the following day and was discharged on the 5th postoperative day following a satisfactory echocardiogram and chest x-ray. She had a follow-up, with chest x-rays at 30 days, 6 months, and 12 months, and an echocardiogram at 6 months, with no findings.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Mediastinal cystic lesions can have their origin anywhere in the thoracic cavity. They vary in size, age of presentation, and type, and can either be benign or be malignant and their presenting symptoms can be specific or nonspecific. In the anterior and superior mediastinum the presented cysts include, thymic cysts, thyroid, and parathyroid, in the middle pericardial cysts, bronchogenic cysts, parathyroid cysts, parasitic or of infective origin, and finally in the posterior mediastinum meningocele, esophageal cysts, thoracic duct cysts, and cystic hygroma. Finally, it is essential to include tumors, including, Hodgkin disease, germ cell tumors, mediastinal carcinomas, metastases to lymph nodes, among other types that are prone to undergo cystic degeneration, but are rare in the pediatric population.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2150135112471351">4</xref>
</sup> Regarding pericardial cysts, they are not common and are usually detected by chance. They are usually silent; nevertheless, symptoms and serious complications may occur including bleeding and hemorrhagic shock or tamponade,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2150135112471351">5</xref>
</sup> unspecific symptoms such as syncope or collapse due to compression of the heart chambers,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2150135112471351">5</xref>
</sup> respiratory distress,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2150135112471351">6</xref>
</sup> and chest pain. Echocardiography<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2150135112471351">7</xref>
</sup> is the imaging modality most often used for the initial evaluation of pericardial disease, especially in patients suspected of having pericardial effusion or tamponade. Both CT and MRI offer distinct advantages in the imaging of the thoracic cavity. Both modalities provide a larger field of view than echocardiography, thus allowing the examination of the entire chest and detection of associated abnormalities in the mediastinum and lungs as well as providing excellent anatomic delineation and enable precise localization of the lesion in question. It is widely accepted that surgical exploration and treatment is the method of choice for these lesions once they grow in significant size or cause symptoms, although both conservative and invasive procedures have been used with success. They can be safely performed through a median sternotomy or a left lateral thoracotomy and also with the use of VATS.<sup>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Mediastinal and in particular pericardial cysts, although rare, present a significant challenge for the several specialties involved. The use of MRI, CT, and echocardiogram has made diagnosis and follow-up easier, as it is common for certain types of cysts, mainly pericardial cysts to be observed for a certain period of time for change is size, change in the radiological appearance, or change in presenting symptoms. The progress of VATS and minimal invasive procedures has improved surgical results, as surgery is the only treatment, in all cases, especially in view of acute hemodynamic or respiratory compromise.</p>
