<abstract>
<p>Open ankle fractures with dislocation are potentially limb-threatening injuries with complications ranging from infection to amputation. External fixation has been used in trauma institutions for limb salvage, particularly in the setting of extensive soft tissue compromise. The authors present a case of an elderly woman with an open ankle fracture dislocation who underwent a staged surgical approach. A LIMA external fixator was used in conjunction with antibiotic beads and subsequent definitive open reduction with internal fixation. At 5-year follow-up, the patient demonstrated pain-free range of motion with a return to activity comparable to the preinjury state. The authors highlight the benefit of procedure staging in the presence of a severe fracture dislocation of the tibiotalar joint.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Approximately 260 000 ankle fractures occur each year in the United States and 25% undergo surgical intervention.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1938640012463058">1</xref></sup> Open ankle fractures are limb-threatening injuries that can be a devastating event with associated complications, such as amputation, infection, and nonunion. The most common cause of open ankle fractures are automobile or motorcycle crashes, followed by falling and gunshot injuries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1938640012463058">2</xref></sup> Soft tissue trauma has been recognized to be of importance in the outcome of open fractures, along with obtaining and maintaining anatomic position on the fracture. Although closed dislocated ankle fractures are more common in clinical practice, open dislocations bring about a more complicated and challenging situation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1938640012463058">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1938640012463058">3</xref></sup> Subsequently, there is no well-established regimen that will provide a desirable outcome for open ankle fracture dislocations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1938640012463058">2</xref></sup> It seems that a combination of external and internal fixation is paramount for these clinical scenarios. The use of external fixation allows fracture alignment and reduction of soft tissue swelling with tissue healing. Indications for external fixation in the lower extremity include severe long bone fractures in the multiply injured patient who is too hemodynamically unstable for definitive fracture fixation, open fractures with arterial injuries, fractures with soft tissue not amenable to open repair, and severe periarticular fractures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1938640012463058">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1938640012463058">5</xref></sup> In the present case presentation, the authors use a staged treatment regimen for a severe limb-threatening open ankle fracture dislocation. A preliminary LIMA (Lualdo Industria Meccanica Anduins) external fixator is used with subsequent definitive open reduction with internal fixation. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1938640012463058">Figures 1-3</xref> demonstrate a sawbones representation of the construct used for the case presented.)</p>

<title>Case Presentation</title>
<p>An 80-year-old female presented to the Emergency Department at the University of Louisville Medical Center on October 16 after a tress (from the foundation of a house she was building) fell on her right leg and left side of her chest. The patient sustained multiple injuries, including an open trimalleolar ankle fracture dislocation to the right lower extremity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1938640012463058">Figure 4</xref>), which was initially evaluated in the field by Stat Care and subsequently transferred to the university. The patient’s past medical history is significant for hypertension. Past surgical history is significant for hysterectomy. On physical exam, the neurovascular status was found to be intact, although her right foot was completely dislocated medially and rotated 180° to the long axis of the tibia with an open wound adjacent to the fracture site.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1938640012463058-fig2.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>After medical clearance, the patient was immediately taken to surgery. The open wound was approximately 20 cm in length, extending around the medial and lateral aspect of the ankle. The medial malleolus was reduced and temporarily fixated with a 1.6-mm K-wire. After irrigation of the wound, antibiotic bead chains were placed. The LIMA external fixator was applied after reduction of the fracture dislocation was achieved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1938640012463058">Figure 5</xref>). A fine wire was placed into the tibia and into the fibula, then the appropriate ring size was attached and tensioned. An olive wire was then inserted into the calcaneus anterior to posterior with caution to avoid the neurovascular bundle and attached to the foot plate. Fine wires were passed through the first and fifth metatarsals and tensioned. Flouroscopy was used to confirm the position of the wires and the reduction of the fracture.</p>

</fig>
<p>Approximately 10 days later, the patient was brought back to the operating room for definitive fixation. The LIMA external fixator was disassembled and removed. The previously placed antibiotic beads were removed at bedside. First, temporary fixation with 2 K-wires was used for the medial malleolus, then definitively fixated with two 5.0 partially threaded screws. Attention was then directed to the distal fibula where a one third tubular 6-hole ITS plate was applied (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1938640012463058">Figure 6</xref>). Hydrocet was used to fill bone voids due to the extensive comminution of the fibula. All wounds were primarily closed and the patient was placed into a posterior splint. At 5-year follow up, the patient has satisfactory alignment and clinical outcomes with no complaints of pain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1938640012463058">Figures 7-9</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Management of severe ankle fracture dislocations with an associated open soft tissue envelope warrants a systematic, staged protocol. Effective initial damage control orthopedics entails external fixation with supplemental internal fixation, proper staging of the final open reduction, and proper soft tissue maintenance to avoid further complications in these devastating injuries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1938640012463058">6</xref></sup> Current treatment protocols include prompt injury recognition, intravenous antibiotics, aggressive debridement of all nonviable tissue, and immediate skeletal stabilization.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1938640012463058">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1938640012463058">6</xref></sup> The use of external fixation for open fractures has been well documented; researchers have achieved satisfactory clinical results (eg, reducing infection rates) with its use as a preliminary step in a staged protocol. Pearse and Nanchahal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1938640012463058">5</xref></sup> applied the Ilizarov method in combination with soft tissue reconstruction techniques for severe tibial fractures to reduce infection rates and improve union times.</p>
<p>Treatment protocols for open dislocated ankle fractures have evolved from immediate open reduction with internal fixation (ORIF) to the combination of external fixators and internal fixation. Earlier studies with immediate ORIF have reported a high incidence of infection, nonunion, and proximal amputations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1938640012463058">2</xref></sup> Ye et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1938640012463058">2</xref></sup> treated 16 patients with grade III open ankle fracture with severe dislocation with bioabsorbable screws/rods and an external fixator. After approximately 18 months of follow-up, the authors reported fair to excellent results in all but 2 patients, who had painful osteoarthritis 2 year after the surgery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1938640012463058">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1938640012463058">7</xref></sup> They concluded that external fixation is a minimally invasive treatment for open fracture dislocations and facilitates better care of the skin and soft tissues.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1938640012463058">2</xref></sup> Khan et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1938640012463058">3</xref></sup> compared the management of open ankle injuries with ORIF and external fixation; among the various complications, 4 cases of deep infection necessitated hardware removal in the ORIF group. There was one case of deep venous thrombosis, one case of distal tip necrosis, and no cases of infection in the external fixation study group.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1938640012463058">3</xref></sup> Some studies have reported a lower incidence of infection with external fixation as compared with plate fixation in open tibial fractures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1938640012463058">7</xref></sup> The authors believe that both internal and external fixation have their associated risks and benefits. The present case study illustrates the benefit of combining the 2 aforementioned techniques in a staged, standardized protocol. The authors routinely use an external fixator (eg, LIMA) for skeletal stabilization in the initial stage with subsequent definitive ORIF when the patient is optimized for intervention. The authors also recommend the use of antibiotic beads, negative pressure wound therapy, when necessary, and intravenous antibiotics.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The complicated ankle fracture with concomitant dislocation poses a dilemma in surgical management. Acute management of these complicated fractures has been a topic of controversy. Based on the authors’ experience, the use of a staged reconstruction with the use of the LIMA external fixator, antibiotic beads, and consequently, definitive ORIF yields satisfactory clinical outcomes and an optimistic rehabilitation potential.</p>
