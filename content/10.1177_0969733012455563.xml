<p>This study investigated the clinical application of the 2006 Third Revised Korean Nurses’ Code of Ethics and the moral sensitivity of nurses. A total of 303 clinical nurses in South Korea participated in the survey in May and June 2011. As instruments of this study, we used the 15 statements of the Korean Nurses’ Code of Ethics and Korean Moral Sensitivity Questionnaire. The mean score for application was 3.77 ± 0.59 (out of 5), and the mean score for moral sensitivity was 5.14 ± 0.55 (out of 7). The correlation coefficient (<italic>r</italic>) of the application and moral sensitivity was 0.336 (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). Nurses who scored high on moral sensitivity also scored high on application (<italic>t</italic> = −5.018, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). In clinical settings, educational programmes to develop the moral sensitivity of nurses are necessary for improving the application of the code of ethics.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>A more rigorous standard of ethics applies to practitioners of healthcare since the actions of such persons involve matters of life and death. A code of ethics is an important criterion in the definition of a ‘profession’. Internally, it serves to consolidate the solidarity and sense of membership among the members of the profession, and externally, it represents this as an entirety. Members of a profession can have their work duly recognised and validated by society and can protect their professional autonomy only through voluntary compliance with their ethical code, for, in doing so, they evince a full commitment to governing and managing themselves by its standards.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0969733012455563">1</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Nursing is a profession that has been historically subjected to strict codes of ethics since its ideology, purpose and function are bound to the health and survival of patients. A code of ethics for nurses may not have the force of law, but it is a testament of the commitment of the members of that profession that they take their social and professional responsibilities seriously. It is also a social representation of their resolution to fulfil all the duties.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0969733012455563">2</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>The International Council of Nurses (ICN) enacted the first code of ethics for nurses in 1953. It has since been adapted by the nurses of various countries around the world. An ethical code for Korean nurses was initially drafted by the Korean Nurses Association in 1966 and was formally enacted and promulgated in 1972. The code has been amended three times, first in 1983 and subsequently in 1995 and 2006. The code of ethics indicates that the basic purpose of nursing is the respect for human dignity and life, which are basic rights. It defines the essential responsibilities of nurses as covering the entire span of human life, from birth to death, and speaks of matters related to promoting health, preventing diseases, healing and alleviating pain.</p>
<p>Previous studies of nursing ethical codes indicate interest in the development,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0969733012455563">3</xref>

</sup> of these codes in various countries, including Europe and Hong Kong. However, Korean research is limited to the basic-level studies that are required for the development and amendment of the code.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0969733012455563">11</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0969733012455563"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0969733012455563">13</xref>
</sup> Therefore, there is a significant need for further research that would support improved instruction in, and practical application of, the ethical code for nurses.</p>
<p>Moral sensitivity plays a major role in the ethical decision-making of nurses. It is required for identifying core ethical dilemmas and for evaluating the appropriate values embodied in alternative solutions.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0969733012455563">14</xref>
</sup> Studies have argued that the higher the moral sensitivity of nurses, the better their ethical decision-making in clinical situations.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0969733012455563">15</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0969733012455563"/>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0969733012455563"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0969733012455563">18</xref>
</sup> Moral sensitivity is what enables nurses to be conscious of the ethical issues of their profession and to find creative solutions to problems.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0969733012455563">15</xref>
</sup> When making ethical decisions in clinical situations, nurses take general moral principles and possible consequences into account; in the process, they undertake actions that they regard as more rational. Along with nursing practices, the code of ethics provides a standard for consistent ethical decisions.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0969733012455563">16</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0969733012455563"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0969733012455563">18</xref>
</sup> Therefore, a code of ethics is vital to the profession since it provides a necessary means for the self-control of those who belong to it.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0969733012455563">2</xref>
</sup> In other words, moral knowledge and firm ethical values are prerequisites for nurses to make a decision that is not only ethical but also morally sound. Moral sensitivity is a personal attribute and an important contributing factor for decisions pertaining to the well-being of patients. This is related to combining an institution or practical experience with the knowledge of context and signifies experiencing of an honest motive that wishes to fulfil being ‘good’ to the patients. The ‘code of ethics’ confers ethical responsibility on nurses and ensures that the behaviours of professional workers adhere to the code in daily life. Therefore, from the nurses’ moral ‘behaviour’, their application of the code of ethics can be explained.</p>
<p>This study explores the practical application of the nursing code of ethics in clinical situations and measures the moral sensitivity of nurses. Its specific goals include the following:</p>

<p>This study was a descriptive survey to investigate the application of the nursing code of ethics in clinical situations and its correlation with the moral sensitivity of those who applied it. The study participants were nurses (<italic>n</italic> = 303), drawn through convenience sampling, who worked at one tertiary medical institute and two secondary medical institutes in Gyeonggi Province in South Korea.</p>

<title>Clinical application of the code of ethics</title>
<p>In order to assess the clinical application of the code of ethics, this study utilised a questionnaire consisting of 15 statements, based on the 2006 amended version of the Code of Ethics for Nurses in Korea.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0969733012455563">11</xref>
</sup> The code consists of three sections: nurse and patient, the obligations of a nurse as an expert and nurse and cooperator. The respondents were required to assess the application of the code of ethics in their clinical situations on a 5-point Likert scale, from ‘5’ indicating for ‘always applied’ to ‘1’ indicating ‘not applied at all’. The higher the score, the better the clinical application of the code of ethics. The Cronbach’s alpha value in this study was 0.927.</p>

<sec id="section6-0969733012455563">
<title>Moral sensitivity of nurses</title>
<p>In order to assess the ethical practices and convictions of individual nurses, this study sought to measure their moral sensitivity by using the Korean Moral Sensitivity Questionnaire (K-MSQ),<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0969733012455563">19</xref>
</sup> translated and adapted from the Moral Sensitivity Questionnaire (MSQ) developed by Lützén and Nordin.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0969733012455563">20</xref>
</sup> We obtained permission for applying the K-MSQ from Han. This questionnaire presents statements in five sections: patient-centred nursing, professional responsibility, experience of conflict, structuralising of moral meaning and expressions of good deeds. Consisting of 27 statements in total, the questionnaire requires respondents to assess themselves on a 7-point Likert scale, from ‘7’ indicating ‘completely agree’ to ‘1’ indicating ‘completely disagree’. The higher the score, the higher the moral sensitivity of the nurse. With regard to reliability of the instrument, Han et al.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0969733012455563">19</xref>
</sup> report a Cronbach’s alpha value of 0.76. In this study, it was 0.851.</p>
</sec>

<sec id="section7-0969733012455563">
<title>Data collection and ethical considerations</title>
<p>The Ethics Review Committee of the research institute concerned approved the study and sanctioned the questionnaires. The data were collected in May and June 2011. Two researchers visited the nursing departments of the three hospitals. They first explained the subject, purpose and importance of the study to the heads of these departments and then distributed the questionnaires to the nurses, asking them to self-assess according to the statements. Pursuant to approval, this study involved only those nurses who completed written consent forms agreeing to voluntary participation. It took each nurse approximately 20 min to respond to the statements.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0969733012455563">
<title>Data analysis</title>
<p>Using the PASW Statistics 18.0 program, the collected data were processed and analysed in the following ways: frequencies, percentages, means, standard deviations (SDs), maximums and minimums were calculated from the data to evaluate the general characteristics of the participants, as well as their application of the code of ethics and their moral sensitivity. The correlation between the application of the code of ethics and moral sensitivity was analysed using Pearson’s correlation coefficients and <italic>t</italic>-test.</p>

<title>General characteristics</title>
<p>All the 303 participants were female. Their average age was 30 ± 7 years (ranging from 21 to 53 years), and the period of work experience was 8 ± 6.8 years (ranging from 3 months to 33 years). In terms of their role in the hospital, 72.5% of participants were general nurses and the remainder were charge or head nurses. In terms of department in which they worked, 33% of the study participants worked on the internal medicine ward, 29% were employed in the intensive care unit and 19% worked on the surgery ward. In terms of level of education, 53.8% had graduated from 3-year college courses, 33.7% had graduated from 4-year college courses and 12.5% had master’s or doctoral degrees. In addition, 84.5% of the nurses had completed nursing ethics education at their schools and 57.5% had undergone this type of education in clinics where they worked. Regarding their occupational view of nursing, 77.3% of the participants thought of it as either ‘the best occupation’ or ‘a guaranteed job’, while 22.7% thought of nursing as a ‘temporary job’. When asked about their personal ethical standards and principles, 60.7% of participants answered ‘sometimes confused’, 20.5% answered ‘varies depending on situation’ and 18.8% stated that they had very strong, firm ethical convictions. A total of 84% of the participants also reported that they had experienced ethical dilemmas in clinical situations (see Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0969733012455563">1</xref>).</p>

<p>The nurses gave themselves a mean score of 5.14 (out of 7) for their moral sensitivity. The highest scoring items were Question 6 (‘In situations where it is difficult to know what is right, I consult with my colleagues about what should be done’) and Question 10 (‘It’s my responsibility as a nurse to know about the patient’s overall situation’), both of which scored above 6. The lowest scoring item was Question 21 (‘If a patient does not have insight into his or her own illness, there is little I can do’), which scored 3.86, which was below the median score of 4. When moral sensitivity was subdivided into six sections, patient-centred nursing scored the highest (mean: 5.68), followed by the professional responsibility section (mean: 5.64), the experience of conflict section (mean: 5.02), the structuralising of moral meaning section (mean: 4.64), and the expression of good deeds section (mean: 4.51; see Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0969733012455563">3</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>An investigation of the self-assessment of nurses in terms of clinical application of their code of ethics resulted in a mean score of 3.77 out of 5. While there is no previous empirical study of the application of this code to which this result can be compared, the score is nonetheless well above the median. Moreover, since nurses reported the greatest application of the code in the nurse–patient relationship, the study shows that they are especially keen on the need to provide nursing care without discrimination, to respect individual patient needs, to keep patient secrets confidential, to respect patient rights to information and autonomy, to respect the need for family involvement in patient care, to protect the vulnerable and to realise a healthier patient environment. Heikkinen et al.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0969733012455563">4</xref>
</sup> show that nurses adhere to and apply their code of ethics in clinical situations primarily in order to ‘clarify nursing as an ethical practice’ and as ‘a basis for ethical reflection, concrete decision-making, and teamwork with colleagues’. Their study also indicates that nurses point to ‘the codes themselves, nurses themselves, multi-professional teamwork, patient family members, organisations, nursing professionals, and society/healthcare policy’ as the main obstacles to implementing these codes. The study concludes that the application of the nursing ethical codes is affected by the changes within the profession itself, as well as in society at large. The code of ethics for nurses in Korea involved in this study was amended for the third time in 2006, to reflect the changing paradigm of social issues, including those affecting ‘the family, the vulnerable, and the environment’. The amended code also reflects the improved status and reputation of the nursing profession in Korea, as well as the growing ethical sensitivity of society in general.</p>
<p>This study also measured the moral sensitivity of nurses in clinical situations, which resulted in a mean score of 5.14 out of 7. While the score is lower than the mean scores of nursing students (5.28) or the nurses (5.40) as measured in a previous study,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0969733012455563">14</xref>
</sup> it remains higher than the mean score of 5.03 reported in the study by Lützén et al.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0969733012455563">21</xref>
</sup> The nurses gave themselves scores higher than 4 out of 7 in all items, except one, suggesting that their moral sensitivity was above the median.</p>
<p>This study also showed that a positive, statistically significant correlation exists between the moral sensitivity of nurses and their application of the code of ethics. The group with the highest score for moral sensitivity also had a high score for the application of the code, indicating that their moral sensitivity exercised an important influence on the clinical application of the latter. Moral sensitivity underlies ethical judgements and behaviour-specific situations.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0969733012455563">19</xref>
</sup> It is something that can be cultivated and developed through training and education.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0969733012455563">22</xref>
</sup> Therefore, in order for the members of the nursing profession to adhere to and apply their code of ethics, they must be morally sensitive. In order to improve the implementation of the code, effective training programmes must be developed to cultivate the moral sensitivity of nurses in clinical situations. Furthermore, in order to make ethical decisions in diverse clinical circumstances, nurses must be aware of the ethical issues involved and must possess high levels of moral sensitivity towards solving patient problems. Nurses should consider not only general moral principles but also their own code of ethics in making, prescribing and rationalising their ethical decisions and actions. Thus, it is essential to develop the moral sensitivity of nurses through various training and educational programmes.</p>
