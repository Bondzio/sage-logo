<title>Purpose:</title>
<p>To describe a hybrid approach for the treatment of a ruptured juxta-innominate artery saccular aneurysm.</p>
</sec>
<sec><title>Case report:</title>
<p>A 68-year-old smoker male with poor exercise tolerance sustained a contained ruptured saccular aneurysm at the origin of the innominate artery. Although under the femoral-axillary bypass to allow direct brain perfusion, a 36 × 110 mm thoracic endograft was successfully deployed with total coverage of the distal ascending and aortic arch. A sternotomy was performed and an aorto-innominate and left common carotid artery bypass was done. At 1-month follow-up, a type 2 endoleak at the innominate artery stump was noted and successfully treated with coil embolization. The patient remains neurologically intact 1 year after the surgery.</p>
</sec>
<sec><title>Conclusion:</title>
<p>Juxta-innominate artery saccular aneurysms are rare. A hybrid open-endovascular repair using a reversed sequence arch debranching after endovascular repair is feasible and may be an alternative to deep hypothermic circulatory arrest particularly in frail patients.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Aortic saccular aneurysms located near the origin of the innominate artery are rare.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1538574412470739">1</xref>
</sup> Traditionally, open surgical repair with hemi-arch or complete arch replacement with or without cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and circulatory arrest has been advocated.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1538574412470739">2</xref>
</sup> However, it carries significant operative morbidity and mortality especially in high-risk patients including those with rupture.</p>
<p>Hybrid open-endovascular therapy for aortic arch aneurysm has gained popularity.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1538574412470739">3</xref>
</sup> It is often accomplished as a hybrid approach including neck vessels debranching such as carotid–carotid or carotid–subclavian bypasses.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1538574412470739">4</xref>
</sup> A hybrid technique with neck vessel debranching is rarely indicated for aneurysm at the origin or proximal portion of the innominate artery, because this artery primarily serves as the inflow vessel to the other vessels to be debranched such as the left carotid artery (ie, right carotid to left carotid bypass).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1538574412470739">5</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>In emergent situations, when there is an aortic arch or innominate artery leak, selective cerebral perfusion via right axillary artery cannulation is prudent to provide access for CPB prior to sternotomy. The patency of the circle of Willis and its implication on cerebral perfusion has to be investigated whenever it is possible to ensure that a unilateral axillary artery cannulation is sufficient to maintain adequate perfusion to both cerebral hemispheres. However, in emergent cases, the time is of the essence precluding further evaluation of the brain circulation using a computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance (MR) angiogram of the brain.</p>
<p>We report a case of a contained ruptured juxta-innominate artery saccular aneurysm treated with total coverage of the aortic arch with a stent graft and subsequent aorto-innominate and aorto-left subclavian artery bypass in a reverse sequence arch debranching. The indications, rationale, and advantages of this technique are discussed.</p>

<title>Case Report</title>
<p>A 68-year-old hypertensive male presented to the emergency department with chest pain and shortness of breath. He was also a heavy smoker (1.5 packs of cigarettes a day for 40 years) and had myelodysplastic syndrome, chronic kidney disease, and poor exercise tolerance. A CT angiogram (CTA) showed the presence of a 2 cm saccular aneurysm in the distal ascending thoracic aorta, posterior to the takeoff of the innominate artery with no signs of aortic dissection.</p>
<p>Upon admission, the patient refused any intervention being initially treated with aggressive blood pressure control. However, his pain symptoms increased and a repeat CTA 3 days after his admission indicated a significant enlargement of the size of the juxta-innominate saccular aneurysm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1538574412470739">Figure 1A</xref>) with a new mediastinal hematoma, pericardial effusion, and suspicion of inflammatory component. A 2-dimensional echocardiogram indicated tamponade physiology; therefore, an emergent operation was discussed with the patient and the family. The location of contained rupture would require deep hypothermic circulatory arrest for open repair. Arch debranching followed by endovascular repair was not feasible in view of the new mediastinal hematoma and pericardial effusion. Thus, a hybrid open-endovascular procedure with reversed sequence debranching was planned.</p>

B, A 36 × 110 mm Talent Captivia thoracic endograft was successfully deployed with total coverage of the distal ascending aorta, innominate artery, both carotids, and left subclavian artery.

<p>After induction of general anesthesia, the right axillary artery was exposed. The right common femoral artery and common femoral vein were also exposed and the patient was placed on CPB (femoral-axillary bypass). This allowed direct perfusion of the right common carotid and subclavian artery with oxygenated blood. Endovascular access to both common femoral arteries was then gained and a 36 × 110 mm Talent Captivia (Medtronic, Minneapolis, Minnesota) thoracic endograft was successfully deployed with total coverage of the distal ascending aorta, innominate artery, both carotids, and left subclavian artery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1538574412470739">Figure 1B</xref>). With the area of rupture fully covered, a median sternotomy was carried out and a bifurcated 16 × 8 mm dacron graft was sewn end to side to the proximal ascending aorta and distally to the innominate and left common carotid arteries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1538574412470739">Figure 1C</xref>). The anastomosis to the innominate artery was end to side and end to end to the left common carotid. The innominate artery was ligated proximal to the graft insertion. Perfusion time was 140 minutes, ultrafiltration 1000 mL, and temperature was maintained at 37.8°C. Cerebral perfusion was assessed using continuous cerebral oximetry.</p>
<p>The patient remained neurologically intact throughout his hospitalization and was, therefore, discharged to a skilled nursing home facility on postoperative day 10. At 1-month follow-up, surveillance CTA of the aorta showed a type 2 endoleak at the innominate artery stump (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1538574412470739">Figure 2A</xref>). Noteworthy, the innominate artery was suture ligated during the first operation but not transected and oversewn. Approaching from the right brachial artery, a 4 F glide catheter was advanced reaching the innominate artery stump which was completely packed with some 12 mm diameter × 5 cm length coils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1538574412470739">Figure 2B</xref> and C). The patient was again discharged from the hospital after uneventful short stay.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Ascending aortic and great vessels saccular aneurysms are rare and may be related to penetrating atherosclerotic ulcers or focal aortic dissection.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1538574412470739">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1538574412470739">7</xref>
</sup> Some patients bearing those saccular aneurysms are not candidates for classic aortic arch or hemiarch replacement or patch angioplasty with or without CPB and deep hypothermic circulatory arrest.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1538574412470739">8</xref>
</sup> In particular, our patient with a symptomatic contained ruptured likely inflammatory saccular aneurysm, the conventional approach was felt to be unsafe.</p>
<p>Extra-anatomic aortic arch debranching without sternotomy (ie, carotid–carotid, carotid innominate, or carotid–subclavian bypasses) followed by partial coverage of the aortic arch by an endograft have been extensively described for treatment of aortic aneurysms involving the great vessels, dissections, and traumatic aortic injuries. Often, a hybrid approach with cervical debranching and aortic arch stenting is feasible when the innominate artery is spared and can be utilized as inflow. In those patients who have innominate artery involvement, the most common strategy consists of sternotomy with an aortic bypass to the great vessels using side-clamping and subsequent stent graft deployment in either an antegrade or an retrograde fashion.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1538574412470739">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1538574412470739">9</xref>
</sup> However, our patient had a contained rupture of a likely inflammatory saccular aneurysm and proximal involvement of the innominate artery making a direct approach via sternotomy without CPB risky for uncontrolled free rupture.</p>
<p>Some considerations about this technique deserve comments. First, establishing inflow through the right axillary/subclavian artery protects the cerebral circulation and allows for construction of bypasses when both carotids are covered, provided an intact circle of Willis is present. The circle of Willis may be preoperatively evaluated using a CT or MR angiogram. In emergent situations such as in our case, further investigation of the cerebral circulation may not be done due to time constraints. Second, cervical debranching in preparation for endografting is indicated to increase the proximal landing zone and to avoid a medium sternotomy; however, in patients who present with a contained ruptured aneurysm it may not be feasible because the time is of the essence. Furthermore, CPB prior to direct aortic approach seems to be helpful and indicated in cases where a contained rupture can be easily converted into a free aortic rupture. In this particular case, an inflammatory component of the aneurysm was likely present rendering a direct repair even more cumbersome.</p>
<p>Third, left subclavian artery revascularization was not attempted in this case based on current practical guidelines published by the Society for Vascular Surgery,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1538574412470739">10</xref>
</sup> which does not mandate left subclavian artery revascularization in patients with no left internal mammary to coronary artery bypass graft or left arm arteriovenous shunt for dialysis, no prior infrarenal aortic operation with previously ligated lumbar and middle sacral arteries, and no coverage of the descending thoracic aorta or hypogastric artery occlusion. Also, our patient did have a patent right vertebral artery shown in the preoperative CTA of the chest. One can make an argument about termination of the left vertebral artery into the posterior inferior cerebellar artery; however, more extensive workup to assess for this particular anatomic variation of the left vertebral artery and its connection with the posterior cerebral circulation was not done due to our patient’s emergent presentation. Finally, a multidisciplinary approach with a cardiothoracic and a vascular surgeon familiar with aortic endovascular interventions is extremely beneficial as it combines different treatment perspectives.</p>
<p>In conclusion, hybrid open-endovascular repair of a ruptured juxta-innominate saccular aneurysm using a reversed sequence arch debranching after total endovascular coverage of the aortic arch may be a feasible and safe alternative in high-risk patients.</p>
