<abstract>
<p>Few methods can predict the prognosis and outcome of traumatic brain injury. Electroencephalographic (EEG) examinations have prognostic significance in the acute stage of posttraumatic coma, and some EEG variables have been correlated with outcome. Furthermore, spindle activity and reactivity in the acute stage have been associated with good recovery. Assessments of consciousness based on EEG and magnetoencephalographic (MEG) recordings provide valuable information for evaluating residual function, forming differential diagnoses and estimating prognosis. This study objectively investigated how fast spindles could relate to the recovery of consciousness and cognitive function during the post-acute to chronic stages of diffuse axonal injuries (DAIs). Sleep stage 2 was examined in 7 healthy participants and 8 patients with DAIs. Simultaneous EEG and MEG recordings were performed in the post-acute (mean 80 days) and chronic (mean 151 days) stages of recovery. Magnetoencephalography enabled equivalent current dipole estimates of fast spindle sources. Clinical recovery was evaluated by consciousness, neuropsychological examination, and outcome. Six severe and two moderate injuries were studied in patients with favorable 1-year outcomes. In the sub-acute stage, significant decreases were detected in the frequency, amplitude, and cortical activation source strengths of spindle activities, but these recovered during the chronic stage. In the chronic stage, the Wechsler adult intelligence factor scale and subset patterning revealed significant improvement in cognitive function. These results suggested that spindles may reflect recovery of consciousness and cognitive function following a DAI.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Electrophysiological approaches to the clinical assessment of consciousness have been tried in many clinical situations with the anticipation that they will support diagnosis and prognosis. Electrical activity is a relatively sensitive index of the pathophysiological response of the brain to immediate and secondary damage and is therefore closely related to outcome.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1550059411428718">1</xref>
</sup> Accurate diagnosis and prognosis of traumatic brain injury (TBI) during the acute stage are important for long-term rehabilitation; however, the prognosis after traumatic coma is often uncertain.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1550059411428718">2</xref>
</sup> In head-injured patients with coma scoring of 8 or less on the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), the outcome ranges from death to a good recovery.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1550059411428718">3</xref>
</sup> The GCS, the duration of loss of consciousness (LOC), and the duration of posttraumatic amnesia (PTA) for the occurrence of the accident are valuable clinical predictors of the severity and long-term prognosis of injury. However, these assessments are frequently unknown or unrecorded. Therefore, there is a need to develop an objective and quantitative metric of the severity of brain injury using electroencephalographic (EEG) examinations.</p>
<p>Diffuse axonal injuries (DAI) were first recognized by Strich<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1550059411428718">4</xref>
</sup> who noted that with or without impact, a rapid acceleration and deceleration of the brain causes the fast rotational forces that are attributed to shear strain.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1550059411428718">5</xref>
</sup> At the neuronal level, rapid acceleration and deceleration and the consequent rotational forces damage the axons in the cerebral and brain stem white matter and, in serious injuries, in the cerebellum. This kind of axonal damage comprises torn axons, shearing of axon clusters, retracted balls of sheared axonal substance, and reactive swelling of strained and damaged axons.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1550059411428718">6</xref>
</sup> The characteristic distribution of a DAI encompasses the subcortical white matter, corpus callosum, and dorsolateral quadrant of the rostral brain stem. Many neuroimaging techniques can show the alterations in the brain parenchyma following a DAI. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can show white matter abnormalities or small penetrant-induced hemorrhages that appear normal on a computed tomography (CT). Diffuse tensor imaging was proposed as the method of choice for white matter injuries and for consciousness recovery after TBI.<sup>7</sup> However, relatively little is known about the relationship between the structural changes in the brain observed in a neuropathological examination and the objective evidence of dysfunctional electrophysiological changes measured with an EEG.</p>
<p>The functional integrity of the ascending reticular activating system modulates sleep–wake cycles. Impairment of arousal and cognition occurs after brain injury, and when there is unarousable unresponsiveness, coma is present. Spindle activities resembling those in normal sleep were shown to occur in posttraumatic comatose patients, which were reported as “spindle coma”. Spindle coma patterns are believed to indicate dysfunction at the brain stem level,<sup>8</sup> and with reactivity to external stimuli carry a good prognosis as long as there is no significant intracranial structural lesion or anoxia.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1550059411428718">9</xref>
</sup> The distortion and gradual disappearance of spindle activity was noted with deepening coma, and an increase in asymmetry and unilateral slowing of spindle activity has been related to worse outcome.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1550059411428718">10</xref>
</sup> Gottselig et al<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1550059411428718">11</xref>
</sup> demonstrated a significant reduction in the power and coherence of sleep spindle frequency activity in EEG recorded over the hemispheric ipsilateral to the lesion during the acute phase of stroke. They also observed a significant increase in the power and coherence of sleep spindle frequency activity from the acute to the chronic phases of stroke, suggesting that plastic mechanisms allowed for possible recovery. These results suggest that spindle activities may be closely related to the prognosis of traumatic coma and cortical plasticity.</p>
<p>This study investigated alterations in the cortical activation of fast spindles using simultaneously measured EEG and magnetoencephalographic (MEG) recordings and clinical recovery, during the post-acute to chronic period of DAI in patients who participated in our cognitive rehabilitation program. This study took advantage of MEG to determine the cortical sources of spindles, since the conductivities of brain structures affect the magnetic fields generated in the brain much less than the electrical fields. Additionally, time-varying cortical sources can be assessed more accurately with MEG.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1550059411428718">12</xref>
</sup> Clinical recovery was evaluated by consciousness, neuropsychological examination, and clinical outcome.</p>
<p>The aim of this study was to use simultaneous EEG and MEG to determine how fast spindles relate to the recovery of consciousness and cognitive function in patients following a DAI. If spindles could provide an objective evaluation or have prognostic value for the clinical recovery, this evaluation could be a valuable, objective, and clinical tool for assessing the prognosis and outcome of recovery during the course of neurorehabilitation.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section3-1550059411428718">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>Spontaneous activity during sleep stage 2 was determined in 8 patients with DAIs (7 males and 1 female; aged 21-37 years, mean 26 years) and age-matched 7 healthy volunteers (5 males and 2 females; aged 24-32 years, mean 28 years). Patients who participated in this study were examined in the sub-acute stage, during cognitive neurorehabilitation in our hospital. Patients received traumatic brain injuries in traffic accidents or accidental falls, had sustained consciousness disturbances in the acute stage, and were diagnosed with DAI. All participants were right-handed and were assessed by the Edinburgh inventory.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1550059411428718">13</xref>
</sup> None of the participants had a history of sleep disturbance, neurological disorder, or psychiatric disorder.</p>
<p>Participants were asked to refrain from alcohol or excessive caffeine both before and on the day of the recordings in order to achieve natural sleep. Informed consent was obtained from each participant after full explanation of the purpose of the study. This research was approved by the Committee of Medical Ethics of the National Rehabilitation Center for Persons with Disabilities.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1550059411428718">
<title>Recordings</title>
<p>Simultaneous EEG and MEG recordings were performed once in healthy participants, twice in patients with DAI; once, in the post-acute stage (mean 80 days after injury), when they were admitted to the hospital for cognitive neurorehabilitation, and the second time in the chronic stage (mean 151 days after injury), when they finished the in-hospital rehabilitation. Approximately 30 minutes of natural sleep data were recorded for each participant. All the data were collected just after sleep onset in the daytime laboratory examination. Bursts of the first 10 stable, artifact-free, fast spindles were selected for further analysis. EEG was recorded with a 60-channel electrode cap (Elekta-Neuromag, Finland) placed on the scalp according to the International 10-10 System.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1550059411428718">14</xref>
</sup> All electrodes were referenced to linked ear-lobe electrodes. A bipolar electro-oculogram (EOG) was recorded from electrodes below the outer canthus of the right eye to monitor eye movements and blinks. The impedance of all electrodes was maintained below 10 kΩ.</p>
<p>Magnetic signals were recorded from 204 planar gradiometers (Vectorview, Elekta-Neuromag, Finland) with a band-pass of 0.03 to 300 Hz for both the EEG and MEG signals. The sampling rate for digital conversion was 1001 Hz.</p>
<p>Each participant was asked to sit with eyes closed in a comfortable chair in a dark, quiet, magnetically shielded room. The participant’s head was securely positioned in a helmet-shaped dewar, and the participant was asked to relax and sleep. Four head position indicator (HPI) coils were attached to the electrode cap. Their locations were measured with a 3-dimensional (3D) digitizer (Isotrak 3S1002, Polhelmus Navigation Sciences, Colchester, Vermont) with respect to the anatomical landmarks of the nasion and bilateral preauricular points. At the beginning of each recording, weak electric currents were fed into the 4 HPI coils, and the magnetic signals produced were measured with the sensor helmet to determine the head’s location relative to the sensors. This information was used to align the MEG and MRI coordinate systems. During each recording, the condition of the participant was observed from outside of the magnetically shielded room via a video camera mounted inside the room. To monitor the participant’s vigilance, the participant’s EEG, EOG, and MEG waveforms were monitored. Sleep spindles were identified from the electric signals on the monitor.</p>
<p>Head MRIs were obtained with a 1.5-Tesla MRI system (Siemens Magnetom Vision Plus, Siemens, Erlangen, Germany). Oil tablets were positioned on the anatomical landmarks during the MRI scanning to align the MEG and MRI coordinate systems.</p>

<title>Clinical Evaluation</title>
<p>Patient data included age, the GCS score measured at the first physician’s arrival at the site of the accident, length of PTA, and length of stay in the intensive care unit (ICU). The criteria for assignment to the mild head injury group were GCS 13 to 15, PTA &lt; 1 hour, and LOC &lt; 20 minutes. Criteria for the moderate head injury group were GCS 9 to 12, PTA 1 hour to 6 days, and LOC 1 to 24 hours. Criteria for the severe head injury group were GCS &lt; 7, PTA &gt; 7 days, and LOC &gt; 24 hours. The patients in this study had sustained moderate-to-severe closed head injuries. The profiles of the patients are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1550059411428718">Table 1</xref>. The Glasgow outcome scale (GOS) score was evaluated for all patients 1 year after the accident. A GOS score of 3 was assigned to patients in a minimally conscious state. A GOS of 4 was assigned to patients with various disabilities, but with normal consciousness. Patients were also divided into 2 groups based on the recovery of consciousness. GOS of 1 to 3 had unfavorable outcomes, including death, persistent vegetative state, or a minimally conscious state. Patients with GOS of 4 to 5 had a favorable outcome, including minor or no residual impairment or residual impairments that did not affect consciousness.<sup>

<title>Dipole Source Analysis of the Spindles</title>
<p>For source localization, magnetic signals were band-pass filtered between 9 and 16 Hz to exclude frequencies outside the spindle range. Cortical sources were modeled as equivalent current dipoles (ECDs). The 3D locations, orientations, and current strengths were estimated from the signals measured with the 204-planar gradiometers. The spindles were sinusoidal waxing and waning waveforms, with the lowest amplitude at the spindle’s beginning and end, and the maximal amplitude at about the midpoint of the duration of spindles in the 1-s segment. A subset of 20 to 30 channels was selected on either side of the channel of maximal spindle amplitude. Equivalent current dipoles were calculated at 2-ms intervals over a period of 200 ms, which contained the maximal amplitude. Equivalent current dipoles were accepted only when they showed a goodness of fit (g values) above 80% and confidence volumes less than 500 mm<sup>3</sup>. Visual inspection of isocontour maps was performed to localize the source at the point where the latency of the magnetic field pattern was dipolar.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1550059411428718">18</xref>
</sup> A single dipole that best explained the measured waveforms was selected at a single point around the maximal amplitude, because planar gradiometers detect a local cerebral current source just above the maximal amplitude of the signal. The waveforms simulated by the estimated single dipole were compared with the measured waveforms. When a discrepancy was found between the measured and simulated waveforms, another subset of channels was selected around the maximal unexplained signal to obtain additional ECDs. Each time a new ECD was obtained, the waveforms predicted by the multidipole model were compared to the measured signals, with a conservative comparison that was only used to explain the dominant features of the field pattern. Thereafter, the analysis was extended to the entire measurement period and to all channels. This analysis used a multidipole model in which the strengths of the previously identified ECDs were allowed to vary as a function of time, and the ECD locations and orientations were fixed. The procedures were repeated until discrepancies between the measured and simulated waveforms were minimized and the g values could no longer be increased by more than 5%. The g values of the identified ECDs were calculated over 204 channels and over the entire period until the g values fulfilled at least 80% of the field variance.<sup>

<title>Neurophysiological Alterations and Clinical Outcome</title>
<p>In the acute stage, 6 patients had severe injuries and 2 patients had moderate injuries. In the post-acute stage, when they were admitted to the hospital, none of the patients had motor paralysis. However, they all had cognitive dysfunctions, including memory disturbances and attention deficit. After neurocognitive rehabilitation, the cognitive functions improved; WAIS-III subset scores of perceptual organization and working memory improved significantly (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1550059411428718">Table 2</xref>). All patients had favorable 1-year outcomes, with GOS scores of 4 to 5. They remained some cognitive dysfunctions after rehabilitation, but they all returned home or to work. (Table1).</p>

<sec id="section16-1550059411428718">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study demonstrated that the alteration of fast spindles during daytime naps was related to the recovery of consciousness and cognitive function during the post-acute stage of DAI. In moderate-to-severe closed brain injuries, the frequency, amplitude, and cortical activation source strength of spindles decreased during the sub-acute stage and significantly improved during the sub-acute-to-chronic transition. At the same time, consciousness, cognitive function, perceptual organization, and working memory significantly improved. All patients had a favorable 1-year outcome, the GOS scores were 4 to 5, and they all returned home or to work with some remaining cognitive dysfunctions. The improvement in spindle activities during the post-acute stage following DAI may have prognostic value for good recovery and outcome.</p>
<p>Previous studies involving whole-head MEGs demonstrated the existence of multiple, widespread cortical sources, particularly in the parietal and frontal lobes. This suggested that the sources underlying the spindles are very complex. The centers of cortical activation of fast spindles were located in the pre-central and post-central areas of both hemispheres in normal participants.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1550059411428718">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1550059411428718">20</xref>
</sup> The present study showed that the locations of the cortical sources of spindles did not change following a DAI, but the source strengths of these locations decreased. The corticothalamic and corticocortico connections modulate spindle generation, which were altered following DAI, and decreased the frequency, amplitude, and source strengths of fast spindles. Simultaneous EEG and MEG recordings can provide precise findings concerning the relationships between the distributions and patterns of cortical activation associated with spindles. The patterns of cortical activation following DAIs observed in this study suggested that distinct underlying plastic mechanisms could affect the thalamocortical system.</p>
<p>This study has some limitations. First, because all the patients had a good prognosis, this study could not compare the results to those of patients with poor prognosis, including those who died or experienced severe cognitive dysfunctions. Second, the presence of brain injury with its clinical sequelae of consciousness disturbances, particularly PTA in the acute stage, may have altered the sleep fragmentation of these patients. During the post-acute stage of neurorehabilitation, the recovery of cognitive dysfunctions, including memory and attention, occurred in conjunction with the recovery of the cortical activation of sleep spindles. In patients with moderate and severe brain injuries, the period of sub-acute recovery was marked by poor sleep efficiency.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1550059411428718">21</xref>
</sup> Decreased sleep efficiency may negatively affect memory return after brain injury and the recovery of sleep efficiency may improve memory. Many studies have shown a link between memory consolidation and sleep.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1550059411428718">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1550059411428718">23</xref> </sup>In healthy individuals, sleep disturbance was shown to damage the memory process. Sleep following brain injury, regardless of the underlying pathology, can impact cognitive functioning and behavior. This study did not investigate this possibility. Combined with the clinical evaluation of recovery of consciousness and cognitive function, the quantitative measures of fast spindles based on simultaneous EEG and MEG recordings can provide an objective evaluation of outcome prediction after DAI and can help in the clinical assessment.</p>
<p>All patients that participated in this study had sleep disorders including insomnia, daytime somnolence, fatigue, and alterations in the sleep–wake cycle. These result in daytime somnolence, which in turn may lead to poor daytime performance. The majority of abnormalities after DAI occurred in the septum, corpus callosum, deep gray matter, dorsolateral pons, and midbrain. All these areas are closely associated with sleep–wake mechanisms. The brain stem is involved in the sleep–wake cycle and spindle generation. So the alterations in thalamocortical function may have been caused by DAI and have changed spindle generation and the sleep–wake cycle.</p>
<p>Furthermore, spindle activity and reactivity have been associated with good recovery.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1550059411428718">10</xref>
</sup> In the Rumpl et al study,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1550059411428718">10</xref>
</sup> spindles were observed in 91% of the EEGs in acute coma and in 30% in prolonged coma. In cases of primary brain stem involvement typical spindles also suggested a good prognosis, despite the observation of serious clinical signs. As the outcome worsened, the percentage of spindle activity decreased and spindle distortion and asymmetry increased. In prolonged coma, spindle activity was markedly reduced regardless of the final outcome. When spindles were present, atypical and asymmetric forms significantly increased in patients with a worse outcome. In posttraumatic coma, although there were no significant differences in spindle activity in the different outcome categories, spindle activity had some prognostic value. These results indicated that the EEG might be useful in determining the prognoses and consequences of a TBI.</p>
<p>Recovery of consciousness following severe brain injuries can occur over long time periods of months and years. Focal injury patterns in the central thalamus are associated with coma, vegetative state, and a minimally conscious state. Medial components of the posterior intralaminar region of the central thalamus are known to be involved in spindle generation. Thus, both physiologically and clinically the recovery of consciousness may be strongly associated with the recovery of sleep spindles following brain injury.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1550059411428718">24</xref>
</sup> The central thalamus and the frontal lobe are closely linked through direct corticothalamic connections including supplementary motor, anterior cingular, premotor, and prefrontal cortex connections.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1550059411428718">25</xref>
</sup> Moreover, they have indirect links through the frontal corticostraito pallidal–thalamocortical loop systems.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1550059411428718">26</xref>
</sup> This system provides an appealing first-order explanation of the importance of the anterior forebrain mesocircuit in the global behavioral impairments observed after TBI. Recovery of sleep efficiency may affect the improvement of memory, whereas recovery of consciousness may affect the sleep–wake cycle and sleep spindles following DAI. Gradual improvements in the integrity of normal activity patterns within the anterior forebrain could underlie the continuum of outcomes observed across severe disability.</p>
<p>In conclusion, fast spindle activity, as a global neurophysiologic measure, may play an important role in understanding the nature of brain injury and its pathophysiology and recovery.</p>
<p>This study was the first to use simultaneous EEG and MEG recordings in patients during the chronic stages of DAI in combination with the clinical recovery to show that spindles comprise a very important predictor of the outcome and recovery of consciousness and cognitive functions of moderate-to-severe DAI.</p>
<p>Neurophysiological assessment of spindles with simultaneous EEG and MEG recordings during the post-acute stage may be a useful method for monitoring and predicting outcomes after neurorehabilitation.</p>
