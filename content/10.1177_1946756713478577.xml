<p>U.S. higher education is on course for massive restructuring this century, according to Roger Benjamin. He delineates the array of challenges that higher education faces, identifies the stakeholders involved, and describes potential solutions, including new assessments of student learning and incentive systems to encourage university systems to continually modify and improve themselves.</p>
<p>Enrollments are surging higher and higher—a 26-percent increase from 1997 to 2007 alone. The incoming students are routinely deficient, however, in critical academic skills and need substantial amounts of remedial instruction to bring them up to a college level of learning. These efforts are only partially successful, however, as too many college seniors graduate lacking critically needed job skills.</p>
<p>Moreover, college students in general still represent too small a proportion of today’s young people. Large percentages of teens either turn down a college education or, worse, fail to even finish high school. African Americans, Hispanics, and immigrants account for a disproportionately large share of the youths who drop out of high school or fail to finish college. Higher education will need to make itself more accessible and affordable if we are to ensure that every young person has a realistic chance at attaining a college education, which appears to be an indisputable necessity in this century’s knowledge economy.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, while the demands on colleges and universities are growing, the institutions are challenged by shrinking resource and funding bases. States and the federal government have been cutting support for higher education at an accelerating rate.</p>
<p>Compounding the problem, the costs of university operations have been moving steadily upward. Demands for noneducation-related services such as child care, museums, and radio and television stations are increasing, and so is public and private demand for access to universities’ research and development. In addition, universities often compete for students by lavishing funds on nonessential features like luxurious student dorms, recreational services, cafeterias, travel options, bookstores, and so on.</p>
<p>Faced with this mix of rising costs and falling revenues, universities have resorted to budget-tightening measures such as reducing library expenditures and laboratory space, increasing class sizes, and hiring fewer professors. They have also raised tuitions, with increases reaching or even surpassing 10 percent in most years since 2000. This inevitably discourages low-income students from pursuing college degrees. For them, it is more and more cost-prohibitive.</p>
<p>In all, according to Benjamin, the United States is failing to invest adequately in human capital—that is, the education, skills, and knowledge of its population. This will change in decades ahead, he argues, because in this century’s knowledge economy, human capital is what determines whether a country will be prosperous or poor. Whereas territory and raw natural resources were critical in earlier eras, human capital is now a country’s one truly vital resource.</p>
<p>Demand for greater transparency within the university system will probably accelerate in the coming decades, all the more so given the growing concerns over rising tuition costs. State-based and national programs are already calling on colleges to make their information on student learning outcomes public. And in growing numbers, colleges and universities are signing up. Two university associations—the American Public Land Grant Universities and the Association of American State Colleges and Universities—are leading the way in deciding what is appropriate to report publicly about student learning.</p>
<p>A comprehensive value-added assessment system has yet to be created, but fifteen U.S. states do have legislation requiring their colleges and universities to document evidence of student learning. A value-added approach is, furthermore, in the development stage in Nevada and several other states, where policy makers and education leaders are discussing potential systems of measurement. University systems should combine appropriate regional standardized tests with formative internal assessments.</p>
<p>Benjamin recommends continuous evaluation of the quality of student learning as well. This is vital, he believes, for student retention and student success, and is helpful in creating a culture of continuous improvement within the institution. Furthermore, as college tuition costs continue to rapidly rise, the only way to reliably evaluate productivity improvements and costs versus benefits is to have a way of concretely examining each improvement’s impacts. The best way to do this appears to be looking at the consequences of those improvements on student learning. Ideally, he adds, the assessments will focus on students’ acquisition of “higher order” skills—the skills conducive to producing innovations and improving productivity. A nation’s success in the twenty-first-century economy depends on these skills.</p>
<p>Greater transparency in student learning will inevitably cost faculty and administrators some autonomy. The trend will ultimately be a win for the universities and colleges themselves, however, and indeed for all who seek the advancement of human capital.</p>
<p>Toward the end of the volume, Benjamin delves into yet another driver of change in higher education: the rise of for-profit online colleges, which are giving traditional colleges and universities stiffening competition. The latter’s enrollments grew 12 percent in the academic year 2010–2011 to bring their total share of postsecondary education to 11 percent of the market. These for-profit institutions do not rely on physical buildings or large permanent faculty, so their overall expenses are far lower. They are also vastly more efficient, as they offer largely standardized courses and teaching methods—in contrast to traditional universities that diversify their curricula as much as possible, frequently devise new courses, specializations, and niches for new permanent faculty—and hire adjunct professors to teach most of these already fully designed courses. Although online education will not totally displace traditional learning, according to Benjamin, he does foresee online learning’s total market share surpassing 20 percent by 2020.</p>
<p>Benjamin expects traditional universities will significantly revamp to make themselves more efficient and cost-effective. They will eliminate many layers of bureaucracy, impose greater accountability on the faculty and administrators to produce evidence of positive student learning outcomes, and make tenured professorship far rarer; eventually, no more than 20 percent of professors might be tenured. The core curricula will persist but will use many more advancements in online education, such as using PDFs instead of textbooks. More mission differentiation—individual colleges focusing more sharply on specific subjects and initiatives instead of pursuing multiple missions simultaneously—may also take place.</p>
<p>In sum, the governance of colleges and universities must improve markedly. They will need to reallocate resources toward the highest priorities, more effectively meet research and teaching demands, and improve the quality of undergraduate education. Implementing all these changes will be difficult, Benjamin acknowledges. Like any large institution, a college or university has set patterns of operation and is generally reluctant to alter these. Moreover, the existing university governance model is decentralized and hampered by limited communication channels and the absence of a university-wide system for evaluating all departments and making decisions about them accordingly. Sustained commitments from education scholars, lawmakers, and forward-thinking administrators will all be necessary to solve this truly collective problem.</p>

<p>[Note: The U.S. colleges and universities draw students from not only every U.S. state but also from every continent. Applicants of all nationalities seek out and enroll in U.S. degree programs in every field, to become professionals who will staff organizations, research groups, and public service agencies in every corner of the globe. Thus, it is safe to say that the future course of this country’s higher education institutions will hold reverberations for young people everywhere. And Roger Benjamin’s <italic>The New Limits of Education Policy</italic> is an authoritative report on the challenges that U.S. colleges and universities face. Education stakeholders throughout the world will likely find it informative.]</p>
