<abstract>
<p>The majority of recent studies conclude that children’s private speech development (private speech internalization) is related to and important for mathematical development and disabilities. It is far from clear, however, whether private speech internalization itself plays any causal role in the development of mathematical competence. The main concerns of the present study were whether phonological awareness skills relate to private speech internalization, and whether the answer to this question changes with children’s age and mathematical achievement levels. Comparisons were made between 67 children diagnosed with math difficulties and 67 children without math difficulties from Grade 2 to Grade 7 in primary schools. Two separate laboratory investigations were performed to explore children’s developmental levels of private speech and phonological awareness, respectively. Analysis was based on private speech differences, phonological awareness differences, and differences in occurrence of private-speech/phonological-awareness category combinations. Children without math difficulties showed a grade-determined shift from less to more internalized private speech and from lower to higher levels of phonological awareness. In contrast, the development of children with math difficulties seemed almost to stop at the inaudible private speech/low level of phonological awareness combinations. Silence/high phonological level was the primary alternative for typical math achievers. Results are discussed in terms of directions for future research.</p>

<title>Private Speech</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0022219411419013">Vygotsky (1934/1986)</xref> hypothesized that the phenomenon of <italic>private speech</italic> (self-talk used by children that is not addressed to others) reflects children’s potential for self-direction in terms of planning, guiding, and monitoring their goal-directed activity. In short, Vygotsky placed great importance on the role of private speech as a tool for the development of higher psychological functions, such as planning, executive functioning, and behavioral self-regulation.</p>
<p>In terms of the developmental course of private speech through the developmentally typical chain of increasingly sophisticated private speech categories, referred to in the present study as <italic>private speech internalization</italic>, researchers have shown an overall ontogenetic pattern of children’s overt private speech being replaced by partially internalized whispers and inaudible muttering, and silent inner speech, as children progress through elementary school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022219411419013">Berk, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022219411419013">Bivens &amp; Berk, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022219411419013">Diaz &amp; Berk, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022219411419013">Duncan &amp; Pratt, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022219411419013">Flavell, Green, Flavell, &amp; Grossman, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0022219411419013">Kohlberg, Yaeger, &amp; Hjertholm, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0022219411419013">Winsler &amp; Naglieri, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>As well as its development, researchers have explored a variety of different aspects of children’s private speech, including its relations with children’s task performance and on-task behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022219411419013">Berk, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022219411419013">Fernyhough &amp; Fraley, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0022219411419013">Winsler, Diaz, &amp; Montero, 1997</xref>); task and setting influences on such speech (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022219411419013">Fuson, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0022219411419013">Winsler, Carlton, &amp; Barry, 2000</xref>); its use among children with behavior, learning, and/or attention problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022219411419013">Berk &amp; Landau, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0022219411419013">Ostad &amp; Sorensen, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0022219411419013">Winsler, 1998</xref>); and task-related utterances to self during problem-solving processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0022219411419013">Winsler, Feder, Way, &amp; Manfra, 2006</xref>). It is the last aspect—task-related private speech during problem solving in mathematics—that will be the main focus of the present study.</p>
<p>The use of input through the auditory channel to form connections between the phonological features of numbers has been discussed as an approach to learning number facts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0022219411419013">Robinson, Menchetti, &amp; Torgesen, 2002</xref>). Underlying this approach is the belief that arithmetical facts are stored in a sound-based, or phonological, form. Along this pathway, there are several variants of phonological storage hypotheses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022219411419013">Cohen &amp; Dehaene, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022219411419013">Geary, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0022219411419013">McClosky, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0022219411419013">Whalen, McClosky, Lindemann, &amp; Bouton, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>A further dispute relates to the extent to which phonetic and semantic memory systems might contribute to children’s basic fact proficiency in mathematics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022219411419013">Berk &amp; Landau, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0022219411419013">Hecht, Torgesen, Wagner, &amp; Rashotte, 2001</xref>). At present, it seems generally accepted that phonological-processing skills may play a part in the acquisition of number facts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022219411419013">Bull &amp; Johnston, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022219411419013">Campbell, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022219411419013">Geary, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0022219411419013">Ostad &amp; Askeland, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0022219411419013">Rourke &amp; Conway, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>A considerable body of evidence indicates that private speech differences are critical indicators of children’s basic fact proficiency (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022219411419013">Berk &amp; Landau, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0022219411419013">Ostad &amp; Sorensen, 2007</xref>). Thus, phonological processing deficits are quite commonly found among children who have difficulties in mathematics, and retrieval deficits are suggested to relate to difficulties in activation of phonetic representation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022219411419013">Geary, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0022219411419013">Geary, Hamson, &amp; Hoard, 2000</xref>). More specifically, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022219411419013">Geary (1993)</xref> suggested that it is weaknesses in representation of phonological information that underlie specific difficulties in learning mathematical facts. Rather than suggesting that children diagnosed with mathematical difficulties have general problems of retrieval from semantic memory, Geary suggests that retrieval problems are limited primarily to facts that are encoded in terms of their phonemic, or acoustic, features.</p>
<p>A later cross-sectional study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0022219411419013">Ostad &amp; Sorensen, 2007</xref>) provided further evidence for a hypothesized link between children’s private speech and mathematical competence. In summary, this study demonstrated a grade-determined shift among children without difficulties in mathematics (a) away from less to more internalized private speech and (b) in accordance with the movement through the developmentally typical chain of increasingly sophisticated task-specific strategy categories (strategy-use internalization), from less to more internalized strategy use (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022219411419013">Ashcraft, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0022219411419013">Ostad, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0022219411419013">Siegler, 1988</xref>). In contrast, the private speech and strategy-use internalization by children diagnosed with difficulties in mathematics seemed to converge at earlier developmental levels, so that the phonology and the strategy use of the children were closer to the initial, universal stage of development. It seems that people with difficulties in mathematics tend to fail at tasks that are particularly demanding in terms of phonological access (retrieval strategies). These results revealed reasons to assume that arithmetical facts are stored and retrieved from memory phonologically as a function of children’s level of private speech internalization, from audible to private speech in silence. In theory, the efficiency of phonological memory system may influence children’s ability to retrieve simple number facts from long-term memory (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0022219411419013">Siegler &amp; Shipley, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0022219411419013">Winsler &amp; Nagleri, 2003</xref>). However, evidence from the results of the study indicated that a high level of private speech internalization might underlie successful establishment of fact retrieval. In line with earlier studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0022219411419013">Geary et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0022219411419013">Hecht et al., 2001</xref>), this study seemed to lend strong support to the suggestion that retrieval difficulties of mathematically disabled children are related to difficulties in activation of phonetic representations measured by the rate of retrieving arithmetical facts from long-term memory. Thus, if this suggestion is valid, children’s difficulties in using retrieval strategies could at least be partly attributed to failure to use self-directed language (private speech) to guide their task-specific strategy use. Consistent with the private speech literature, the results of the study seemed to argue for the position, as some investigators have assumed (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0022219411419013">Meichenbaum &amp; Goodman, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0022219411419013">Harris, 1986</xref>), that children’s mathematical competence might be a function of efficiency in the production of task-relevant private speech (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0022219411419013">Ostad &amp; Sorensen, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Since the developmental level of private speech internalization seemed to reflect the quality of children’s mathematical competence, the research leads to the rather optimistic assumption that the impact of the difficulties in activation of phonetic representations can be compensated for by training programs developed to stimulate private speech internalization.</p>
<p>To this end, the overall purpose of a follow-up study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0022219411419013">Ostad &amp; Askeland, 2008</xref>) was to examine whether an intervention program (50 weeks), modeled in accordance with the developmental course of private speech (from audible private speech to silent inner speech) would add positively to the development of mathematical competence. It was proposed that a high level of private speech internalization (inner speech) itself might be able to act as a suitable <italic>retrieval tool</italic> for picking up information (e.g., single-digit multiplication facts) from long-term memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0022219411419013">Ostad &amp; Askeland, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>The sample comprised two comparable groups of 82 third-grade children. One group followed the intervention program; the other group followed a traditional teaching program. The main concern was whether private speech and task-specific strategy-use differences would arise as a function of different teaching programs carried out with the two groups.</p>
<p>On the whole, the results indicated the successful influence of the intervention program, reflected in more internalized private speech and more internalized task-specific strategy use. Since, however, an earlier study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0022219411419013">Ostad &amp; Sorensen, 2007</xref>) has demonstrated that the private speech internalization among mathematically less able children seems to converge at earlier developmental levels, there was reason to expect that the intervention program would influence relatively more successful children belonging to the lowest performance level. It was surprising, therefore, that the analyses based on children’s achievement levels in mathematics (three levels) showed that the most striking performance progress seemed to be related not to the less able children but to children belonging to the highest achievement level.</p>

<title>Phonological Awareness</title>
<p>The cognitive underpinnings of reading have been studied a great deal, and variations in children’s reading (decoding) are known to correlate highly with measurement of phonological ability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022219411419013">Durand, Hulme, Larkin, &amp; Snowling, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0022219411419013">Wagner, Torgesen &amp; Rashotte, 1994</xref>). The most unifying hypothesis of core deficits of developmental dyslexia is that these individuals have specific impairments in representation, storage, and/or retrieval of speech sounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022219411419013">Caylak, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0022219411419013">Hulme, Snowling, Caravolas, &amp; Carroll, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0022219411419013">Ramus &amp; Szenkovits, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0022219411419013">Snowling, 2001</xref>). Thus, several authors have argued that performance on all phonological processing tasks is influenced by a core phonological processing variable that taps the strength of children’s phonological processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022219411419013">Bowey, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0022219411419013">Rourke &amp; Conway, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0022219411419013">Snowling, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0022219411419013">Snowling &amp; Hulme, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0022219411419013">Swanson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0022219411419013">Vellutino, Fletcher, Snowling, &amp; Scalon, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Possible links between phonological processing abilities and arithmetical performance are supported by studies that have identified <italic>three main dimensions</italic> in phonological deficits: that is, poor verbal short-term memory, slow lexical retrieval, and poor phonological awareness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0022219411419013">Hecht et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0022219411419013">Noel, Seron, &amp; Trovarelli, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0022219411419013">Rasmussen &amp; Bisanz, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0022219411419013">Simmons, Singleton, &amp; Horne, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0022219411419013">Wagner &amp; Torgesen, 1987</xref>). The poor performance of people with math difficulties can be explained by one or more of the three dimensions. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0022219411419013">Ramus and Szenkovits (2008)</xref>, they all implicate phonological representations, each in its own way. (For more details, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0022219411419013">Ramus &amp; Szenkovits, 2008</xref>.) It is the third dimension, phonological awareness, that forms the main focus of the present study, however.</p>
<p>In general, phonological awareness involves the auditory and oral manipulation of sounds and refers to the ability to analyze the sound structure of oral language (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0022219411419013">Krajewski &amp; Schneider, 2009</xref>). Operationally, skills that represent children’s phonological awareness lie on a continuum of complexity. (For more details, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0022219411419013">Snow, Burns, &amp; Griffin, 1998</xref>.) Throughout this article, however, the term <italic>phonological awareness</italic> means awareness at all levels of complexity from basic rhyme to phonemic awareness. Thus, phonological awareness refers to one’s awareness of, and access to, the sound structure of oral language (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0022219411419013">Wagner &amp; Torgesen, 1987</xref>).</p>
<p>No area of reading research has gained as much attention during the past three decades as phonological awareness. Although it is well known that phonological awareness affects literacy development, its relation to mathematical competences is not well investigated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0022219411419013">Krajewski &amp; Schneider, 2009</xref>). Research studies, however, have identified phonological awareness as a significant predictor of arithmetic attainment. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0022219411419013">Leather and Henry (1994)</xref> reported that 31% of the variance in 7-year-old children’s arithmetical attainment was explained by their phonological awareness scores. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0022219411419013">Hecht et al. (2001)</xref> reported that phonological awareness was predictive of growth in arithmetical computation skills in school-aged children. More recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0022219411419013">Koponen, Aunola, Ahonen, and Nurmi (2007)</xref> reported from their longitudinal study that phonological awareness correlated statistically significant with counting abilities (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) and with procedural calculation (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) in Grade 4.</p>
<p>In summary, there is a lot of support for the relationship between phonological awareness and mathematical competence. The majority of empirical studies have suggested that phonological awareness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0022219411419013">Hecht et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0022219411419013">Koponen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0022219411419013">Leather &amp; Henry, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0022219411419013">Simmons &amp; Singleton, 2008</xref>) is linked to mathematical performance. More specifically, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0022219411419013">Swanson, Ashbaker, and Lee (1996)</xref> argue that phonological awareness tasks are sensitive predictors of emerging individual differences in mathematical computation skills because both domains strongly require resources devoted to phonological memory and the central controlling executive. That is, during online mathematical computation problem solving, the child must encode and maintain accurate phonological representations of terms and operators in phonological memory while simultaneously operating on that information by selecting, implementing, and monitoring strategies used to solve the problem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022219411419013">Ackerman &amp; Dykman, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022219411419013">Bull &amp; Johnston, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022219411419013">Campbell, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022219411419013">Dehaene, Piazza, Pinel, &amp; Cohen, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0022219411419013">Ostad, 1999</xref>). More recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0022219411419013">Krajewski and Schneider (2009)</xref> put forward the argument that a plausible explanation for correlation between phonological awareness and mathematical school achievement could be seen in an indirect influence of phonological awareness on mathematical school achievement via learning number words and the number word sequence. “Because phonological awareness reflects the ability to differentiate between meaningful segments of the language and to manipulate them, it should facilitate the differentiation and manipulation of single words in the number word sequence” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0022219411419013">Krajewski &amp; Schneider, 2009</xref>, p. 520).</p>
<p>Contrary to the above results, a few studies have come up with inconsistent findings. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022219411419013">Durand and colleagues (2005)</xref> could not confirm this relationship between phonological awareness and mathematical competence since phoneme deletion did not predict subsequent arithmetical skills. Also, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022219411419013">Fuchs and others (2006)</xref> reported similar results when phonological processing was measured by phonological decoding.</p>
<p>Despite the promising findings, many questions remain unanswered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022219411419013">Durand et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022219411419013">Fürst &amp; Hitch, 2000</xref>). Within the mathematical domain, one of these questions concerns possible interaction between phonological awareness and private speech internalization.</p>

<p>Although considerable controversy remains about whether general cognitive processes such as private speech internalization are causally implicated in mathematical development and disabilities (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0022219411419013">Geary et al., 2000</xref>, vs. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022219411419013">Butterworth &amp; Reigosa, 2007</xref>), the majority of recent studies conclude that private speech is related to and important for performance in mathematical tasks. Actually, a previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0022219411419013">Ostad &amp; Sorensen, 2007</xref>) lends strong support to the suggestion that the developmental level of private speech (private speech internalization) may be predictive of mathematical competence as measured by the rate of retrieving arithmetical facts from long-term memory. However, a (50-week) intervention program modeled as training in accordance with the developmental course of private speech indicated rather small (if any) effects in the groups of less able children. In this view, the results seemed to argue against the assumption that private speech internalization is a general cognitive process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0022219411419013">Ostad &amp; Askeland, 2008</xref>). More precisely, the results paved the way for an alternative hypothesis for future research: The mechanisms (phonological processing abilities) behind private speech internalization rather than private speech internalization itself are causally related to mathematical competence. Surprisingly, no published study on cognitive correlates of primary school mathematics performance has investigated the role of phonological awareness in private speech internalization.</p>
<p>In general, the present study addresses the aforementioned limitations in the private speech literature. Drawing on the Vygotskian developmental perspective, which has guided most research about private speech (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022219411419013">Berk, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022219411419013">Berk &amp; Winsler, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0022219411419013">Geary et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0022219411419013">Ostad &amp; Sorensen, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0022219411419013">Winsler &amp; Naglieri, 2003</xref>), the present study intends to add to our knowledge about cognitive underpinnings of private speech internalization. In particular, it will be determined (a) whether or not phonological awareness and private speech internalization are uniquely associated with mathematical ability as measured by both the <italic>Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children–Revised</italic> (WISC-R) and the simple arithmetical tasks and (b) whether or not the answer to this question interacts with the age of participants. To this end, it was suggested that the study was likely to be important for determining whether phonological awareness not only provides a supporting role for mathematical performance but is also causally implicated in private speech internalization.</p>

<title>Method</title>

<title>Design</title>
<p>Two separate laboratory investigations were carried out examining children’s (1) private speech and (2) phonological awareness, respectively. For each child, the two investigations were finished within a 7-day period. Participants in the two investigations were the same.</p>
<p>The study used a cross-sectional design. Private speech is known to be quite sensitive to settings. (For overview of research studies, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0022219411419013">Winsler et al., 2000</xref>.) Therefore, to ensure that the behavior of interest was recorded under comparable conditions across all subjects and grade levels, the design included research procedures for individual observation developed for employment outside the classroom. The children were seated at a table directly opposite the researcher. Order of administration of the four investigations was counterbalanced across subjects at each of the grade levels included in the research.</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>A range of terms for referring to difficulties in mathematics has emerged, along with different criteria (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022219411419013">Butterworth, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022219411419013">Dowker, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0022219411419013">Geary et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0022219411419013">Jordan, Hanich, &amp; Kaplan, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0022219411419013">Ostad, 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0022219411419013">1998</xref>). In the present study, control for mathematical performance and mathematical ability differences between children with (MD children) and without (Normal Mathematical Ability (MN) children) difficulties was based on the <italic>Standard Mathematics Performance Test</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0022219411419013">Hammervoll &amp; Ostad, 1999</xref>) and the arithmetic subtest of the WISC-R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0022219411419013">Undheim, 1977</xref>).</p>
<p>In the present study, MD children, defined as the mathematically less able children in their grades, were chosen from children who satisfied both of the following criteria: (1) attained stanine scores within the interval from 1 to 3 on the standard mathematics test, that is, a result among the 23% weakest results for her/his grade-group, and (2) attained scale scores within the interval from 1 to 7 on the WISC-R subtest, that is, a result among the 25% weakest results for her or his grade group. The cutoff described above was used to ensure a low incidence of false positives.</p>
<p>To avoid false negatives, MN children were defined as the mathematically most able children in the grades. These were selected by asking regular classroom teachers to nominate the mathematically most able children in their grades; each was a same-sex classmate to serve as a match for each of the MD children. The final selection of MN children satisfied both of the following criteria: (1) attained stanine scores within the interval from 7 to 9 on the standard mathematics test, that is, a result among the 23% strongest results for her or his grade group, and (2) attained scale score within the interval from 12 to 19 on the WISC-R subtest, that is, a result among the 25% strongest results for her or his grade group. (For more general discussion of the extreme groups approach, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0022219411419013">Preacher, Rucker, MacCallum, &amp; Nicewander, 2005</xref>.)</p>
<p>According to the above selection process, a total of 134 children from five state schools served as subjects. Half of the sample was composed of MN children, half of MD children. The children belonged to one of the following three grade groups (Ggr1, Ggr2, Ggr3): Grade group 1: Grade 2 and Grade 3 children (<italic>n</italic> = 44); Grade group 2: Grade 4 and Grade 5 children (<italic>n</italic> = 44); Grade group 3: Grade 6 and Grade 7 children (<italic>n</italic> = 46). The mean age for MD and MN children was: Grade group 1: 7.7 and 7.8 years; Grade group 2: 9.7 and 9.6 years; Grade group 3: 11.7 and 11.8 years. There were no statistically significant age differences between MD and MN children within the grade groups, <italic>F<sub>Ggr1</sub></italic>(1, 42) = 2.19, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .05; <italic>F<sub>Ggr2</sub></italic>(1, 42) = 0.98, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .05; <italic>F<sub>Ggr3</sub></italic>(1, 43) = 2.07, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .05.</p>

<title>Assessing Private Speech</title>
<p>The literature on private speech does not provide any one agreed system for categorizing units of private speech (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0022219411419013">Girbau, 2002</xref>). Accordingly, in the process of developing the categorization system applied in the present study, various viewpoints from earlier research were integrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022219411419013">Berk, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0022219411419013">Girbau, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0022219411419013">Kohlberg et al., 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0022219411419013">Ostad &amp; Sorensen, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0022219411419013">Winsler &amp; Naglieri, 2003</xref>). To this end, the categorization units of private speech were defined in relation to private speech internalization and included (1) <italic>audible</italic>, (2) <italic>inaudible</italic>, and (3) <italic>in silence</italic>, respectively.</p>
<p>More specifically, the first category (high, medium, or low) was <italic>audible—</italic>that is, intelligible to a listener, and could be transcribed. The second category was <italic>inaudible</italic>, but was observable by face-to-face observation and, accordingly, unintelligible to a very close listener. This category refers to externalized private speech that is not loud enough to attribute any semantic content to verbalization including inaudible muttering, and also made evident by lip and tongue movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022219411419013">Berk, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0022219411419013">Girbau, 2002</xref>). It seems to be widely accepted that private speech according to this classification unit represents an external manifestation of inner speech (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022219411419013">Berk &amp; Landau, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022219411419013">Fuson, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0022219411419013">Kohlberg et al., 1968</xref>). Furthermore, studies have determined that private speech can take place (in silence) as a fully covert, silent, inner speech without any external verbal production or lip/tongue movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0022219411419013">Girbau, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0022219411419013">Ostad &amp; Sorensen, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0022219411419013">Vygotsky, 1934/1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0022219411419013">Winsler et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0022219411419013">Winsler &amp; Naglieri, 2003</xref>). In view of the considerations alluded to above, answers given, with no evidence of visible whispers, inaudible lip movements, or muttering observed by the experimenter were coded in the third category, that is, <italic>in silence</italic>.</p>

<title>Assessment aids</title>
<p>The problems were constructed from the 64 possible pairwise combinations of the integers from 2 to 9 in addition. Tie problems were excluded (a tie problem is 2 + 2). The remaining problems, which consisted of 56 single-digit addition problems of the form “a + b,” were divided into two halves (half A and half B). The two halves were counterbalanced. This means that all 56 problems were pairwise matched (e.g., 9 + 8 and 8 + 9). Lots were drawn so that each of the problems in the pair randomly became part of one or the other of the two halves. Only one of the two halves (half A or half B) was used in testing each child. The problems (28 problems in each of the two halves) were horizontally placed and presented at the center of 21- × 10- cm ready-made printed booklets, with one problem on each sheet.</p>
<p>Other equipment placed on the table where the children were tested included paper, pencil, and 40 red and white cubes (sides measuring about 1.5 cm), 20 of each color.</p>

<title>Observation procedure</title>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022219411419013">Fuson (1979)</xref> the presence of another person creates the problem of separating social speech from private speech. To minimize communication with a responsive researcher, the child was informed that he or she had to answer all the problems without any application to the researcher. The children were told to solve the problems, which would be presented on the (28) pages in the “book,” During the time interval when the child turned to the next page, the private speech category for solving the problem was recorded by the researcher in the classification scheme developed for the investigation. The children were encouraged to use whatever strategy made it easiest for them to obtain the answer and write it down in their books. Also, the children were not informed about the phenomenon under investigation.</p>
<p>The reliability of this structured collection format was previously tested. Two master’s degree students, who had received extensive training in the research procedure developed for the study, coded—independently of each other—private speech responses based on 100 randomly chosen addition problems. The overall intercoder reliability (averaging the three private speech levels) for the broad category classification was 0.96. Intercoder reliability for each private speech level was: Audible, 1.00; Inaudible, 0.97; Silence, 0.95.</p>

<title>Assessing Phonological Awareness</title>
<p>Earlier research studies in this area had not used assessment instruments specifically developed for the mathematics domain. The relatively well-developed research literature in literacy, however (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022219411419013">Adams, Foorman, Lundberg, &amp; Beeler, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022219411419013">Braddy, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0022219411419013">Hecht et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0022219411419013">Kulak, 1993</xref>), provides insights into how an investigation should proceed toward assessing phonological awareness within mathematics. Thus, the test developed for the present study was modeled on those in the literacy domain.</p>
<p>More specifically, a wide variety of tasks have been used to measure phonological awareness: rhyming tasks, phoneme counting tasks, sound comparison tasks, blending tasks, segmentation tasks, and deletion tasks. There seems to be ample evidence that the tasks that require the manipulation of phonemes appear to be the most difficult. However, just how these tasks relate to each other is far from clear, and this makes it difficult to compare scores from different phonological awareness tasks (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022219411419013">Adams et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022219411419013">Chard &amp; Dickson, 1999</xref>). The test developed for the present study did not allow for such comparisons. In contrast, it was based on the assumption that the various aspects of phonological awareness measured by tasks may actually reflect a single latent ability (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022219411419013">Anthony &amp; Francis, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0022219411419013">Stahl &amp; Murry, 1994</xref>), and that the ability to be measured is unidimensional (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0022219411419013">Hambleton, Swaminathan, &amp; Rogers, 1991</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section11-0022219411419013">
<title>Assessment aids</title>
<p>The actual test included 15 items, that is, number words (2, 3, and 4 digits) arranged in order of difficulty. Each number word had four tasks, related to blending, analysis, deletion, and substitution, respectively. In the following paragraphs, the number word “795” is used as an example of the four tasks. (Note that the example is a direct translation to English from Norwegian, a language with an alphabetic nature.)</p>
<p><italic>Blending</italic>. The examiner said the separate digits (phonemes) in the number word (figure) to the child, and the child was instructed to <italic>blend</italic> the phonemes (digits) into the word. For example, “/7/, /9/, /5/ to /795/.”</p>
<p><italic>Analysis</italic>. The examiner said the number word to the child, and the child was instructed to say the digits (sounds) in the number word in the same order as he or she hears it. For example, “Tell me each sound (digits) you hear in the number word ‘795’ and in the same order that you hear it.”</p>
<p><italic>Deletion</italic>. The child was instructed to say the number word when one or more digits in the number word either in the beginning, the middle, or the end positions were omitted. For example, “What is ‘795’ if you remove the /7/ from the figure?”</p>
<p><italic>Substitution</italic>. The child was instructed to say the number word with a specified phoneme substituted for another one. For example, “What is ‘795’ if you change the /9/ with a /3/?”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0022219411419013">
<title>Observation procedure</title>
<p>The test was administered individually and there were four practice items for which feedback was available. The total number points were worked out in order of item difficulty and scored in the proportion 1: 2: 3 for number words with 2, 3, and 4 phonemes (digits), respectively. The participants gathered points from the actual number word only if all four tasks were satisfactorily answered. The testing was ended after two subsequent mistakes. The result showed that none of the participants gave wrong answers to any one of the questions in the <italic>blending</italic> or the <italic>analysis</italic> parts of the test. In view of this fact, it was decided to use only the participants’ gathered points in <italic>deletion</italic> and <italic>substitution</italic> as the base for the following statistical analyses. The total number of points (maximum = 32) was transformed to scaled scores.</p>
<p>Depending on the test results, the children belonged to one of the following phonological awareness group levels: low (LowPh), medium (MedPh) and high (HighPh). These levels included children with scaled scores of 1 to 8, 9 to 14, and 15 to 20, respectively.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The majority of recent studies conclude that private speech internalization is related to and important for mathematical development and disabilities (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022219411419013">Berk &amp; Landau, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022219411419013">Campbell, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0022219411419013">Ostad &amp; Askeland, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0022219411419013">Winsler &amp; Naglieri, 2003</xref>). It is far from clear, however, whether private speech internalization itself plays any causal role in development of mathematical competence. The overall purpose of the present study was to add to our knowledge about possible cognitive underpinnings of private speech internalization. The main concerns were whether phonological awareness skills relate to private speech internalization and whether the answer to this question changes with children’s age and mathematical achievement levels.</p>
<p>The first step of analysis replicated core findings of a previous longitudinal study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0022219411419013">Ostad &amp; Sorensen, 2007</xref>) and addressed patterns of private speech category differences between MN and MD children. MN showed a grade-determined shift from less to more internalized private speech (i.e., from the inaudible to the silence category). For these children, silence played an increasingly dominant role as they moved up through the grades. The increase in the occurrence of silence occurred mainly at the expense of audible private speech. The share of inaudible private speech remained relatively constant up through the grades.</p>
<p>In contrast, the private speech internalization of children with MD seemed almost to stay at earlier developmental levels. More specifically, there appeared to be no obvious increase in the occurrence of the silence category. The use of inaudible private speech was relatively dominant and remained relatively constant up through the grades. Consistently with a developmental difference model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0022219411419013">Ostad &amp; Sorensen, 2007</xref>), these children seemed to follow a sequence that was fundamentally different from typical math achievers.</p>
<p>The second focus concerned developmental differences in phonological awareness. In summary, the results from the present study seem to indicate among the MN children a grade-determined shift from the lower to the higher phonological awareness level. In contrast, the development of phonological awareness among children diagnosed with math difficulties seemed to converge at earlier grade levels. The phonological awareness level of MN and MD children differed significantly in all three age groups. Thus, in accordance with phonological deficit theory (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0022219411419013">Ramus &amp; Szenkovits, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0022219411419013">Rasmussen &amp; Bisanz, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0022219411419013">Wagner &amp; Torgesen, 1987</xref>), young children with low impaired phonological awareness seem to be at risk of developing problems with math.</p>
<p>In general, these results were consistent with earlier research suggesting that phonological awareness predicts the development of arithmetical attainment in school-age children, and the results seem to confirm the assumption that phonological awareness is a domain-general precursor variable of math achievement in children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0022219411419013">Hecht et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0022219411419013">Koponen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0022219411419013">Rasmussen &amp; Bisanz, 2005</xref>). If this suggestion is valid, the results argue against the isolated number hypothesis suggesting that phonological awareness has no impact on higher numerical competencies, but does predict basic numerical competencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0022219411419013">Krajewski &amp; Schneider, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>One of the major new insights of the present study concerns the third focus of the study addressing the relationship between private speech and phonological awareness across grades for children with and without mathematical differences. As far as the MD are concerned, the course of development throughout the whole primary school age is characterized not only by low level of phonological awareness but also by much more frequent use of the most primary levels of private speech internalization. MD children seemed to stay at the inaudible private speech/low level of phonological awareness combinations.</p>
<p>In the case of MN, a course of development was observed involving an age-determined shift in the development of private speech from the use of audible private speech to silent private speech and from lower to higher phonological levels.</p>
<p>The most striking difference between children with and without MD, however, seemed to be related to the silence/high phonological awareness combinations. The present study documented that MN children used this alternative far more often than the MD children, and that the difference between the two achievement groups became more marked through the grades. Interestingly enough, to an ever-increasing extent, the proportion of high-level phonological awareness used by MN children moved toward silence (more than 50% in Grade group 3). Silence/high phonological level was the primary alternative for typical math achievers.</p>
<p>In general, as a major finding, the results from the present study not only highlighted the impact of private speech internalization but also emphasized a parallel role of phonological awareness for subsequent mathematical achievement. The more general analysis from the present study indicated significant correlations between the children’s developmental levels of private speech and phonological awareness. An important question therefore is why the two dimensions (private speech and phonological awareness development) are affected together more often than it is reasonable to expect by chance.</p>
<p>There is no simple explanation for the pattern in the results. The matter of mathematical performance can be explored from many different perspectives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022219411419013">Geary, 1993</xref>). First, it could be possible that reciprocal relationships exist between mathematics, private speech, and phonological awareness. Thus, a plausible explanation for significant correlation between private speech and phonological awareness could be seen in an indirect influence, suggesting that both phonological awareness and private speech are underpinned by phonological skills that are dependent on the quality of phonological representations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0022219411419013">Wagner, Torgesen, Laughon, Simmons, &amp; Rashotte, 1993</xref>). Second, because children with MD displayed less use of more internalized private speech forms, an alternative interpretation would be that patterns of phonological awareness development might differ in these children as a function of their private speech internalization.</p>
<p>Interestingly, there is evidence from the present study that the relationship between private speech and phonological awareness is markedly weaker in MD compared with MN. Thus, the results from the present study are open to a third alternative explanation—that is, delay in phonological awareness could cause a delay in private speech internalization. If this alternative is valid, low level of phonological awareness might at least partly explain why systematic training in accordance with the developmental course of private speech (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0022219411419013">Ostad &amp; Askeland, 2008</xref>) had the most striking effects on mathematical competence, not among the less able children but among children belonging to the highest achievement levels.</p>
<p>Given that the results are valid, further work should determine the extent to which private speech internalization and mathematical competence can be influenced by systematic training that includes instructional activities in phonological awareness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022219411419013">Chard &amp; Dickson, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>In terms of the implications for educational practice, classroom teachers should be encouraged to allow their students to utilize their private speech in a private speech internalization perspective. Furthermore, consistent with suggestions developed from earlier private speech investigations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022219411419013">Chard &amp; Dickson, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0022219411419013">Matuga, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0022219411419013">Ostad &amp; Askeland, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0022219411419013">Winsler et al., 2000</xref>), the various roles that private speech and phonological awareness play should be a critical objective in teachers’ preparation programs.</p>
<p>Limitations of the present study suggest that obtained findings should be accepted with caution. First, in interpreting the results, it is important to bear in mind that the measurements involved in the present study were concurrent in nature, and the causal direction of the relationships analyzed is not known. Second, it should be noted that the design did not include participants’ task-specific strategy use as a variable in the study. In fact, if all of the participants are using retrieval strategies, then we might not find any group or age differences in relations between phonological awareness and private speech and math performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0022219411419013">Ostad &amp; Sorensen, 2007</xref>). Third, the study did not include data to determine the complexity of cognitive processes hidden behind the private speech category in silence (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022219411419013">Butterworth, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022219411419013">Campbell, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0022219411419013">McCloskey, 1992</xref>). Moreover, the sample size was relatively small. As a consequence, some of the statistical analyses of relations between private speech and phonological awareness are based on categories of relatively rare occurrence. Perhaps even more significant is that the present study used simple number fact problems in addition as its point of departure in the assessment of private speech internalization. Future investigations should address these limitations and include a broader selection of mathematics problems, word problems, and number fact problems in subtraction and multiplication. To this end, the broader selection might provide more safe data for evaluating reliability and validity of the assessments included in the study.</p>
