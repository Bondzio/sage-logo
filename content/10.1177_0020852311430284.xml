<abstract>
<p>The use of Turnaround Management Strategies (TMS) in public administration has received growing interest among both researchers and practitioners who deal with public performance. However, our theoretical and empirical knowledge about TMS suffers from significant lacunae. This research presents results from a unique empirical survey that tests the effect of TMS on group-level Organizational Citizenship Behavior. One hundred and twenty-six senior leaders of English local authorities participated in the study. The findings show that local authorities that implemented repositioning and reorganization at the organizational level to a high extent experienced high levels of group-level Organizational Citizenship Behavior, while high implementation of reorganization at the personnel level was linked to low group-level Organizational Citizenship Behavior. Group-level Organizational Citizenship Behavior was indifferent to retrenchment strategies. Implications and suggestions for future studies are discussed.</p>
<sec><title>Points for practitioners</title>
<p>Modern public administrations face repeated ups and downs. This being so, public managers are expected to pursue far-reaching organizational changes to achieve goals ranging from maintaining excellence to recovering from poor performance. This study explores the effect of Turnaround Management Strategies (TMS) on organizational behavior. The findings offer two useful lessons for practitioners. First, repositioning and reorganization at the organizational level may be used as a foundation for improving the organizational culture, work relations, morale and cooperation. Second, introducing major personnel changes is likely to produce mixed or even undesired outcomes.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0020852311430284" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Since the early 1980s, as a reaction to fiscal crises, public organizations of various sectors have continually pursued better performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0020852311430284">Talbot and Johnson, 2007</xref>) in order to maximize aims such as social welfare (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0020852311430284">Rainey et al., 1976</xref>). However, this movement has gradually but continuously lost ground as the traditional public sector has struggled to cope with huge challenges – on the one hand, increasing demands for more and better services, and on the other, a severe lack of resources resulting from, <italic>inter alia</italic>, lost revenues and poor management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0020852311430284">Martin, 2002</xref>). In accordance with expectations to espouse standards, values and practices imported from the private sector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0020852311430284">Boyne, 2006</xref>), those public sector bodies that have not met these challenges – i.e. poor performers – have been pushed to adopt a unique set of strategies known as Turnaround Management Strategies (TMS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0020852311430284">Borins, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0020852311430284">Jas and Skelcher, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>In a nutshell, TMS refer to actions taken by the organizational leadership in order to bring about a recovery in performance by encouraging efficiency, stability, and innovation, and by rechanneling resources and making organizational changes directed toward supporting these aims. Organizations are forced into adopting TMS to deal with low-probability, high-impact situations that result from multiple and interrelated external and internal factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0020852311430284">Balgobin and Pandit, 2001</xref>) and that can be seen as a decline in performance, crisis or failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0020852311430284">Hofer, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0020852311430284">Meyer and Zucker, 1990</xref>). Poor performance is extremely negative for both the public and the political reserves of local leaders; the label ‘poor performer’ is therefore often highly contested by stakeholders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0020852311430284">Boyne and Meier, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>While TMS originated in the private sector, scholars suggest that TMS are relevant and feasible for public organizations (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0020852311430284">Boyne, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0020852311430284">Cornforth and Paton, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0020852311430284">Turner et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0020852311430284">Walshe et al., 2004</xref>). Nevertheless, both theoretical and empirical research on TMS suffers from sizeable lacunae, making it difficult to know whether TMS are effective for public turnaround. Several gaps in the literature are apparent. First, most large-sample empirical studies on TMS have involved private sector organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0020852311430284">Boyne and Meier, 2009</xref>) which employ practices used since the 1950s (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0020852311430284">Hofer, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0020852311430284">Schendel et al., 1976</xref>), leaving public sector organizations and more contemporary practices less examined. Second, many recent works on TMS are case studies that follow recovery stories of large firms (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0020852311430284">Balgobin and Pandit, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0020852311430284">Mellahi et al., 2002</xref>); few cover smaller firms or firms that employ TMS when not in crisis (this point will be covered further below). Third, turnaround is usually defined as a radical improvement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0020852311430284">Pearce and Robbins, 1993</xref>) in core organizational tasks and, especially, narrow financial ratios (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0020852311430284">Balgobin and Pandit 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0020852311430284">Schendel et al., 1976</xref>). Scholars have paid scant attention to other activities and behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0020852311430284">Boyne and Meier, 2009</xref>) though TMS have implications across broader intra-organizational areas, including human relations, organizational behavior and group-level behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0020852311430284">Khandwalla, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0020852311430284">Mellahi and Wilkinson, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>This study represents an initial attempt to close these theoretical and methodological gaps. The study explores the effect of TMS on aspects of organizational behavior. More specifically, it examines the relationship between TMS and Group-level Organizational Citizenship Behavior (GOCB). Methodologically, the study breaks ground by empirically investigating a large sample of leaders of public organizations, namely English local authorities. Finally, the study focuses on TMS as used not only by organizations in crisis, but by high-performing public organizations as well. This last point will be discussed in the following section.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-0020852311430284"><title>Turnaround management strategies: implications for public organizations</title>
<p>The literature suggests that TMS are likely to be successful in dealing with organizational crises, resulting in a recovery of organizational performance and outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0020852311430284">Boyne, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0020852311430284">Hofer, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0020852311430284">Schendel et al., 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0020852311430284">Walshe et al., 2004</xref>). A review and analysis of empirical studies of turnaround suggests that on average, TMS have had a positive impact on firm performance almost 70 percent of the time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0020852311430284">Boyne, 2006</xref>). Accordingly, TMS have been defined as the actions taken to bring about a recovery in performance in a failing organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0020852311430284">Pandit, 2000</xref>). Moreover, there is empirical evidence that TMS are indeed implemented in public organizations, including local authorities, public schools, colleges and universities, wastewater treatment agencies and railways (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0020852311430284">Beeri, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0020852311430284">Boyne and Meier, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0020852311430284">Jas and Skelcher, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0020852311430284">Turner and Whiteman, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>The picture becomes less clear, however, when high-performing firms are considered along with firms in crisis. Evidence from both the private (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0020852311430284">Hooley and Jobber, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0020852311430284">Savery and Luks, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0020852311430284">Yearout, 1996</xref>) and public sectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0020852311430284">Beeri, under revision</xref>) indicates that not only poor but also top-performing corporations are characterized by constant pressure to change, excel and reinvent themselves. As suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0020852311430284">Beeri (2011)</xref>, top performers suffer from ‘organizational performance perfectionism’: they perform much above normal, but their drive for success is associated with excessively high internal and external expectations, fear of failure and criticism, and a perception of competition as pressure. As a result, top performers have a tendency to initiate strategies aimed at far-reaching change and transformation (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0020852311430284">Hooley and Jobber, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0020852311430284">Imparato and Harari, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0020852311430284">Rogers et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0020852311430284">Savery and Luks, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0020852311430284">Yearout, 1996</xref>) – in other words, TMS.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0020852311430284">Imparato and Harari (1994</xref>: 24) described the situation faced by top performers as follows: ‘Looking a customer ahead presents a paradoxical challenge: even as a company pursues perfection of what it is doing today … , it must encourage risk and creativity in pursuit of the destruction of the status quo and the creation of the new – on behalf of tomorrow’s costumer.’ In accordance with this extended concept of TMS as relevant to high performers as well as organizations in crisis, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0020852311430284">Meyer and Zucker (1990)</xref> characterize TMS as ‘the combination of slash-and-burn together with aggressive new growth’. Thus, through this framework we refer to TMS as actions taken to bring about a radical change in performance.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-0020852311430284"><title>Turnaround management strategies: contexts of use</title>
<p>Though TMS are used by varying types of organizations at different levels of performance, they do not fit all managerial situations. Compared with improvement/change strategies, TMS are more extreme in terms of quantity, quality and nature. Accordingly, scholars have singled out five context-related features of TMS that distinguish them from ordinary improvement/change strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0020852311430284">Beeri, 2011</xref>). First, TMS are introduced in order to bring about radical and extensive organizational change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0020852311430284">Boyne, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0020852311430284">Paton and Mordaunt, 2004</xref>). Second, TMS tend to be launched in an <italic>urgent</italic> manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0020852311430284">Boyne, 2006</xref>). Third, TMS are likely to come under <italic>intensive monitoring and scrutiny</italic>, both internal and external (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0020852311430284">Turner and Whiteman, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0020852311430284">Turner et al., 2004</xref>). Fourth, TMS tend to be executed by either <italic>poor</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0020852311430284">Walshe et al., 2004</xref>), <italic>new</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0020852311430284">Hofer, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0020852311430284">Turner et al., 2004</xref>), or very <italic>enthusiastic management</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0020852311430284">Hooley and Jobber, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0020852311430284">Yearout, 1996</xref>). Fifth, TMS are expected to arouse <italic>resistance</italic> from some stakeholders, and thus may corrode the organizational climate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0020852311430284">Balgobin and Pandit, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0020852311430284">Mellahi et al., 2002</xref>). This study sheds some light on the first and fifth of these points. Both radical and extensive organizational change and the corrosion of human relations in the workplace are possible outcomes of TMS that will be taken into account in the model presented here.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-0020852311430284"><title>Group-level organizational citizenship behavior</title>
<p>Organizational Citizenship Behavior (OCB) comprises those employee behaviors that are discretionary, not explicitly recognized by the formal sanctions-and-rewards system and promote the effective functioning of the organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0020852311430284">Organ, 1988</xref>). OCB includes any act of assistance or support extended to colleagues, supervisors or customers which is not part of the employee’s formal job requirements. OCB is a formalization of ideas that have been around for a long time: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0020852311430284">Katz and Kahn (1966)</xref> argued that undertaking innovative and spontaneous activities beyond prescribed role requirements is important for the effective running of organizations and the formation of a healthy workplace environment. In public organizations, OCB is considered crucial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0020852311430284">Organ, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0020852311430284">Podsakoff et al., 2000</xref>). Researchers distinguish between two dimensions of OCB: behavior directed toward individuals (OCB-I) and behavior directed toward the organization (OCB-O). The former might include putting in extra effort to help a colleague with a heavy workload, while putting in extra time to finish an important task early would be seen as OCB-O. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0020852311430284">Vigoda-Gadot et al. (2007)</xref>, these micro and macro levels of analysis represent two measurement approaches to OCB that reflect integrated and correlated organizational outcomes.</p>
<p>Scholars have generally considered OCB a personality trait at the individual level. Only recently have studies begun to consider GOCB, i.e. the aggregation of OCB behaviors at the group level (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0020852311430284">Ehrhart and Naumann, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0020852311430284">Vigoda-Gadot et al., 2007</xref>). Like individual-level OCB, GOCB is constructed of two dimensions: GOCB directed toward individuals (GOCB-I) and GOCB directed toward the organization (GOCB-O).</p>
<p>GOCB has a major positive impact on the organizational workplace (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0020852311430284">Ehrhart and Naumann, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0020852311430284">Schnake and Dumler, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0020852311430284">Vigoda-Gadot et al., 2007</xref>). Indeed, one might argue that GOCB is far more important to the organization than individual-level OCB. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0020852311430284">Organ (1988)</xref> argues, sporadic actions by individual employees do not drive the organization forward. Or as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0020852311430284">Schnake and Dumler (2003</xref>: 283) put it, ‘it is OCB in the aggregate which impacts organizational effectiveness’. GOCB is especially vital when radical change becomes a formal target and the workplace suffers from an atmosphere of tension and urgency, as when organizations implement TMS.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-0020852311430284"><title>Turnaround management strategies’ implications for the work environment: theoretical framework and hypotheses</title>
<p>As noted above, while scholars agree that TMS are potentially useful for recovery or a radical change, research on their outcomes is rare. Scholars generally consider financial ratios and, particularly, profitability when assessing outcomes of TMS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0020852311430284">Balgobin and Pandit 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0020852311430284">Mellahi et al., 2002</xref>). However, such measures ignore other outcomes that affect organizational behavior and the work environment.</p>
<p>The core theory of strategic management holds that different organizational strategies lead to different organizational outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0020852311430284">Boyne and Meier, 2009</xref>). Accordingly, no combination of TMS deterministically leads to an ideal state of radical turnaround in organizational performance. Indeed, TMS may produce a continued status quo or even a worsening in performance, depending on the circumstances and how they are introduced and managed. This is especially true where failure and recovery are subject to political interpretations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0020852311430284">Boyne, 2006</xref>). Similarly, GOCB does not arise in a vacuum. The organizational context is likely to encourage or discourage GOCB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0020852311430284">Somech and Ron, 2007</xref>). Research has shown that job satisfaction and participation in decision-making are positively related to GOCB, and organizational politics and intentions to leave the organization are negatively related to GOCB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0020852311430284">Vigoda-Gadot et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>The human relations model holds that employees want to feel useful and important (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0020852311430284">Miles et al., 1978</xref>). They want both to belong to a group and to be recognized as individuals. Accordingly, the manager’s task is to help each worker feel useful while allowing him/her to exercise self-direction. The result is strategic harmony within the organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0020852311430284">Lamberg and Pajunen, 2005</xref>). Under this view, turnaround is not just a matter of procedures and techniques. Rather, it is about moving from a state of disharmony to a state of harmony – that is, a productive organizational culture. Nevertheless, as various scholars have pointed out (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0020852311430284">Kotter and Schlesinger, 1979</xref>), since radical organizational change may have costs, we assume that TMS have a mixed influence on the work environment.</p>
<p>Given that turnaround is a complex managerial process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0020852311430284">McKiernan, 2003</xref>), TMS can include a variety of actions that vary in their aims. However, they fall into three main groups, known as the 3Rs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0020852311430284">Boyne, 2004</xref>): Retrenchment, Repositioning and Reorganization. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0020852311430284">Figure 1</xref> presents the theoretical framework of the study. The model suggests that repositioning and reorganization at the organizational level will be positively related to GOCB, and retrenchment and reorganization at the personnel level will be negatively related to GOCB. These categories of TMS and relationships will be explained in detail in the following sections.

</sec>
<sec id="sec6-0020852311430284"><title>Retrenchment and group-level organizational citizenship behavior</title>
<p>Retrenchment aims at stabilizing the organization and making it more efficient; it typically involves cutting back on expenditures deemed less vital to the organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0020852311430284">Balgobin and Pandit, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0020852311430284">Boyne, 2006</xref>). The gist of retrenchment is a reduction in the size and scope of organizational activities in order to stem financial losses and generate resources that can be deployed toward more productive activities. In the private sector context, retrenchment can involve quitting difficult markets and eliminating unprofitable product lines. For public organizations, political considerations and regulation may make retrenchment more complex. Even so, public retrenchment is possible both technically and politically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0020852311430284">Balgobin and Pandit, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0020852311430284">Boyne, 2004</xref>). Indeed, over the past few decades, public organizations in much of the world have faced cutbacks. Thus, despite the complexity of implementing retrenchment, these strategies are among the most common sets of actions in public turnaround (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0020852311430284">Beeri, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0020852311430284">Boyne, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Some scholars argue that cutting costs is the foundation of successful turnaround (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0020852311430284">Robbins and Pearce, 1992</xref>). To this end, public organizations faced with retrenchment may narrow the scope of services; temporarily/permanently eliminate services and sub-units; and decrease expenditures for certain services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0020852311430284">Beeri, 2009</xref>). Consequently, TMS may have costly consequences for employees’ behavior and performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0020852311430284">Ahlstrom and Bruton, 2004</xref>). TMS can threaten the status quo of positions, powers and relationships; they can damage employees’ reputations and self-efficacy. Above all, replacement of personnel frequently involves suspicion and conflict. Thus, spending cuts, redundancies and work intensification will have a negative effect on employees’ desire to make voluntary contributions to an organization. Consequently, managers often try to avoid such outcomes by increasing secrecy, centralization and conservatism, which may further speed the organization’s movement toward failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0020852311430284">Khandwalla, 2001</xref>). Accordingly, we hypothesize that:

<sec id="sec7-0020852311430284"><title>Repositioning and group-level organizational citizenship behavior</title>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0020852311430284">Robbins and Pearce (1992)</xref>, retrenchment cannot be used as a stand-alone strategy because the actions it comprises are primarily reactive. Turnaround must be supported by proactive, complementary actions such as repositioning. As described above, the release of resources by the implementation of retrenchment triggers repositioning. Thus, repositioning deals with effectiveness, growth and innovation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0020852311430284">Schendel et al., 1976</xref>). Repositioning may involve improving or supplying brand new services to either current or new consumers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0020852311430284">Boyne, 2004</xref>). Repositioning strategies may include entering into collaboration with other agencies; changing the priorities of traditional activities; altering the image of the organization; modernizing services or utilizing new technologies; or any other strategy aimed at raising the quality of services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0020852311430284">Beeri, 2009</xref>). As repositioning involves a review of core organizational processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0020852311430284">Khandwalla, 2001</xref>) and substantial strategic change, it has also been described as an ‘entrepreneurial’ strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0020852311430284">Hofer, 1980</xref>).</p>
<p>According to the human relations approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0020852311430284">Miles et al., 1978</xref>), successful TMS should produce better organizational performance from employees and a more positive work environment, one characterized by improved morale, greater willingness to cooperate and high levels of employee satisfaction and involvement. This can happen through the creation of new organizational opportunities, as resources are transferred to new areas and employees are invited to innovate and to employ their skills to the fullest in a climate of revival.</p>
<p>Organizational climates characterized by voluntarism, professionalism and a commitment to service are also characterized by higher levels of GOCB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0020852311430284">Vigoda-Gadot et al., 2007</xref>). Depressed organizations, in contrast, suffer from apathy, lack of initiative and lack of commitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0020852311430284">Connors and Smith, 1993</xref>). The atmosphere of renewal inherent in repositioning – where resources are allocated to new areas, forcing organizational leaders to rethink and reprioritize their concerns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0020852311430284">Schein, 2004</xref>) – may create a new organizational culture along with new organizational opportunities, reshaping employees’ assumptions and behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0020852311430284">Connors and Smith, 1993</xref>). As leaders emphasize new modalities, commitments to quality and modern services, employees may become invested in this vision as well and put effort beyond their official in-role definition. In contrast to the ‘pre-repositioning age’, they may become more involved, proactive, enthusiastic and innovative, in the new spirit of ‘doing things better’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0020852311430284">Boyne, 2004</xref>). Thus, we can expect that:

</sec>
<sec id="sec8-0020852311430284"><title>Reorganization and group-level organizational citizenship behavior</title>
<p>Reorganization can involve any internal organizational change, which may stand alone or support retrenchment and repositioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0020852311430284">Walshe et al., 2004</xref>). Managerial actions directed at reorganization may be aimed at changing the organization as a whole (reorganization-O) or simply replacing key personnel (reorganization-P) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0020852311430284">Beeri, 2009</xref>). The two types of action are complementary; yet they may result in opposite outcomes in terms of GOCB.</p>
<sec id="sec9-0020852311430284"><title>Reorganization-O and group-level organizational citizenship behavior</title>
<p>The introduction of radical change at the organizational level, namely, reorganization-O, requires a new, proactive organizational culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0020852311430284">Walshe et al., 2004</xref>). That is, instituting radical change means changing employees’ values and assumptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0020852311430284">Schein, 2004</xref>), which in turn requires leaders to focus on turning their business or agency into a learning organization: investing in staff skills training, defining a common vision, improving the organizational climate and formulating an organizational working plan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0020852311430284">Beeri, 2009</xref>). As a result, employees are likely to feel more important, empowered and involved.</p>
<p>Employees who hold positive attitudes toward the organization and their role show greater OCB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0020852311430284">Organ, 1988</xref>). In keeping with this, organizations that strategically encourage a positive culture of mutual help and highlight the values of pro-social behavior increase the number of employees engaged in GOCB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0020852311430284">Vigoda-Gadot et al., 2007</xref>). Consequently, reorganization-O, which involves investment in staff skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0020852311430284">Beeri, 2009</xref>) and proactive organizational culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0020852311430284">Walshe et al., 2004</xref>), encourages positive thinking among employees about their workplace and job. Additionally, reorganization-O creates a climate in which employees identify with the process of organizational change through showing more GOCB. Hence the third hypothesis:
<disp-quote>
<p>H3: A positive relationship will be found between reorganization-O and GOCB.</p></disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec10-0020852311430284"><title>Reorganization-P and group-level organizational citizenship behavior</title>
<p>Reorganization-P involves replacing key personnel, including senior and middle managers; changing the organizational structure; and, often, taking extensive steps toward centralization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0020852311430284">Beeri, 2009</xref>). Scholarship on this process follows two main schools of thought. The ‘structural contingency’ theory suggests that organizations perform better if they adapt their internal characteristics to their external environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0020852311430284">Pennings, 1987</xref>). In contrast, the theory of ‘structural inertia’ holds that internal stability is the best response to a dynamic environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0020852311430284">Hannan and Freeman, 1977</xref>).</p>
<p>In private organizations, the most common reorganizational act is replacement of senior managers. The use of replacement in such cases is rooted in two predominant beliefs – first, that organizational failure can usually be traced to management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0020852311430284">Mellahi and Wilkinson, 2004</xref>); and second, that replacement may facilitate strategic change by bringing in new blood – i.e. individuals with different experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0020852311430284">Boyne, 2006</xref>) and no personal commitments to previous policies and practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0020852311430284">Schendel et al., 1976</xref>). Indeed, replacement of senior management is often considered a precondition for successful recovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0020852311430284">Hofer, 1980</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0020852311430284">Schendel et al. (1976)</xref> found that successful recovery of private corporations included replacement in over 80 percent of cases.</p>
<p>Though replacement of managers in public organizations is usually subject to political restrictions and regulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0020852311430284">Boyne, 2004</xref>), the tendency to carry into public administration values and practices rooted in the private sector has meant that public organizations do employ replacement to a large extent. Evidence suggests that the three typical components of reorganization-P – i.e. replacement, changes within the organizational structure and centralization – are widely employed in public organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0020852311430284">Boyne, 2006</xref>), chiefly though not exclusively within poor performers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0020852311430284">Beeri, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>There has been little empirical work on how reorganization-P affects public organizations. However, the work that does exist suggests that reorganization-P and particularly replacement of personnel, is not particularly effective. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0020852311430284">Boyne and Meier (2009)</xref> examined how structural change (measured in terms of personnel changes) affected the performance of public organizations facing external turbulence – specifically, failing school districts in Texas. Based on eight years of data, the authors claim that organizations that pursue structural change tend to perform more poorly than their stable counterparts, and that sticking with existing divisions of functions and responsibilities is likely to be an effective buffer against an unstable environment. Similarly, recent work by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0020852311430284">Beeri (under revision)</xref> suggests that greater employment of reorganization-P does not produce greater recovery in performance, and if such strategies are used, they should be preceded and balanced by other tactics, such as stabilizing a productive organizational climate and gaining subordinates’ trust.</p>
<p>On balance, the evidence suggests that if personnel changes in public bodies are too extensive, too frequent, or introduced too quickly, the result may be negative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0020852311430284">Probst and Lawler, 2006</xref>). Extensive replacement results in job insecurity, a situation in which an employer violates its long-term obligation of ensuring stable and continuous employment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0020852311430284">Wong et al., 2005</xref>). Based on social exchange theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0020852311430284">Gouldner, 1960</xref>), when the leadership violates such obligations, employees respond with reduced commitment. Simultaneously, the perceived threat of further layoffs makes survivors develop negative work attitudes, anxiety and feelings of powerlessness. As a result, they become willing to exert only the minimum effort required to keep their jobs. Extra-role behaviors such as OCB disappear, because they are easily curtailed with little risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0020852311430284">McLean and Kidder, 1994</xref>). Accordingly, we can hypothesize that:

<sec id="sec12-0020852311430284"><title>Procedure and sample</title>
<p>This study is based on quantitative data collected from leaders of English local authorities, using a survey designed to empirically test the relationship between the implementation of TMS and GOCB. The questionnaire was distributed toward the end of 2006 using professional online survey software, a technique that has recently been growing in use for its logistical advantages, but produces a relatively low response rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0020852311430284">Bryman, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>The population of the study is defined as senior managers of local authorities in England. Since power and policy-making roles within local authorities are divided between professionals and politicians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0020852311430284">Dunleavy, 1980</xref>), and since these key figures are involved in actual managerial processes and have insights regarding implementation of TMS, the sample was designed to include both types of senior managers, namely, elected councillors and unelected officers (the hierarchical regression technique revealed that position is not a significant predictor of GOCBs and thus, combining these groups is reasonable). Ultimately, 126 respondents from 45 local authorities participated in the research, a response rate of 18 percent.</p>
<p>The 45 local authorities to which the respondents belonged included 33 authorities whose performance was rated ‘poor’ or ‘weak’ in 2002 and 12 authorities that were rated ‘excellent’ for the period from 2002 to 2006; all potentially implemented TMS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0020852311430284">Beeri, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0020852311430284">Boyne, 2004</xref>). The ratings were supplied by the Audit Commission, a quasi-autonomous body charged with overseeing and assessing local public services in the UK (for a discussion of the Audit Commission’s methodology see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0020852311430284">Andrews et al., 2006</xref>). Poor/weak local authorities supplied 68 percent of the participants.</p>
<p>Most of the respondents (82.4 percent) were male. Respondents’ average age was 54.3 years (<italic>SD</italic> = 9.99); they averaged 16.4 years of education (<italic>SD</italic> = 3.45); and average tenure in the position was 6.73 years (<italic>SD</italic> = 7.85). More than four-fifths, 82.5 percent, of the respondents held elected councillor positions, including cabinet leaders (6.1 percent of the total), cabinet members (47.4 percent) and committee chairmen (29.8 percent). The other 17.5 percent were non-elected members, mainly CEOs/executive directors (16.7 percent of the total sample). <italic>T</italic>-tests and chi-square tests confirmed that there was no significant difference between respondents and non-respondents in terms of gender, age, position, and their authority’s performance ranking. This suggests that our sample was sufficiently representative.</p>

<sec id="sec13-0020852311430284"><title>Measures</title>
<p>The questionnaire was accompanied by a short personalized cover letter that specified the aims of the study and assured confidentiality. The questionnaire included scales for TMS and GOCB, described below, along with demographic information.</p>
<sec id="sec14-0020852311430284"><title>TMS scale</title>
<p>The TMS scale developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0020852311430284">Beeri (2009)</xref> was based on the ‘Extent of Strategic Change’ scale of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0020852311430284">Barker and Duhaime (1997)</xref> and measured the extent of implementation of TMS on a 5-point Likert scale (1 = Hardly at all, 5 = To a very large extent). Participants were asked to base their answers on their own experience with their current organization over 2002 to 2006.The TMS scale comprised 41 items, including nine for retrenchment (sample item: ‘Partially/temporarily exited from specific services’); 18 for repositioning (sample item: ‘Established new services’); nine for reorganization-O (sample item: ‘Defined a common vision of the Local Authority’); and five for reorganization-P (sample item: ‘Replaced the Chief Executive Officer’). Tests confirmed the scale’s validity and reliability (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.89).</p>
<p>Prior to using the TMS scale for testing the hypotheses, I conducted exploratory factor analysis (EFA). This procedure permits the reduction of a large number of items to the smallest number of latent meaningful dimensions. The initial analysis produced 10 first-order factors with a total loading of 69 percent. Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0020852311430284">Milfont and Duckitt (2004)</xref>, I used the 10 first-order factors to extract second-order factors which revealed three factors with a total loading of 58 percent. The three second-order factors had clear content similarities with the original 3Rs suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0020852311430284">Boyne (2004)</xref>. Accordingly, they were labelled ‘<italic>retrenchment</italic>’, ‘<italic>reorganization-P</italic>’ and ‘<italic>repositioning and reorganization-O</italic>’.

I adapted the GOCB scale to the local government sphere from its original school environment. Participants were asked to base their evaluations on their own experience with their current organization. The scale included 17 items: nine for GOCB-I (directed toward individuals) (sample item: ‘The employees here go out of their way to help new employees’) and eight for GOCB-O (directed toward the organization) (sample item: ‘The employees here conserve and protect organizational property’).</p>

<sec id="sec16-0020852311430284"><title>Data analysis</title>
<p>I used the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) 18.0 software for the data analyses. I first examined the linear relationships between the variables using the Pearson coefficient, then used hierarchical linear modelling (HLM) 6.08 to further test the research model. Using HLM ensures that the observations were independent, given that the analyses are based on nested data (senior leaders nested within local authorities) and controlled for the local authorities’ log population and performance group. Further hierarchical regression technique using SPSS revealed that gender, age and education are not significant predictors of GOCBs. The results are very similar to those found with HLM, and so here I present the HLM results only.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0020852311430284">1</xref></sup></p>

<p>The findings in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0020852311430284">Table 1</xref> also support the assumption that GOCB consists of two dimensions, GOCB-I (directed toward individuals) and GOCB-O (directed toward the organization). These two dimensions were also positively related: as the level of GOCB-I rose, so did GOCB-O (<italic>r</italic> = .700, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01).</p>
<p>Regarding the relationships between TMS and GOCB, the findings show a significant positive correlation between repositioning and reorganization-O and GOCB-I (<italic>r</italic> = .700, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01); a significant negative relationship between reorganization-P and GOCB-O (<italic>r</italic> = −.222, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05); and no correlation between retrenchment and either form of GOCB. These findings support Hypotheses 2 to 4. That is, as predicted, the work environment benefits from high implementation of repositioning and reorganization-O and low implementation of reorganization-P. Yet the work environment remains indifferent to retrenchment.</p>
<p>A further look at <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0020852311430284">Table 1</xref> reveals that excellent performers tend to employ reorganization-P to a lesser extent than poor/weak performers (<italic>r</italic> = −.359, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). Furthermore, senior leaders of excellent performers reported higher levels of GOCB-I (<italic>r</italic> = .284, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) and GOCB-O (<italic>r</italic> = .301, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01).

The initial step in HLM analysis (unconditional model) was to estimate variance between the local authorities in the outcome variables, i.e. GOCB-I and GOCB-O, with no independent variables. The results revealed an effect of the local authority for both outcome variables, justifying the use of HLM. The initial step yielded a predicted mean of 3.44 for GOCB-I and 3.50 for GOCB-O (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0020852311430284">Table 2</xref>). This means that the estimated variance of GOCB-I (<italic>τ</italic> = .10, <italic>SD</italic> = .31, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) and GOCB-O (<italic>τ</italic> = .05, <italic>SD</italic> = .21, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) between local authorities is significant, suggesting that 27 percent of the variation in GOCB-I and 15 percent of the variation in GOCB-O can be explained by the local authority (Intraclass Correlation Coefficient [ICC]).

<p>The next step, level-1 (partially conditional model), involved adding the TMS predictors. For GOCB-I and GOCB-O, the retrenchment slope (estimated fixed coefficient) is very small and not significant (<italic>γ</italic> = −.06, <italic>p</italic> = <italic>ns</italic>, <italic>γ</italic> = .001, <italic>p</italic> = <italic>ns</italic>, respectively). This finding indicates that GOCB-I and GOCB-O are not associated with extent of implementation of retrenchment and rejects Hypothesis 1. In contrast, the repositioning and reorganization-O slopes of GOCB-I and GOCB-O are solid, positive and significant (<italic>γ</italic> = .46, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, <italic>γ</italic> = .29, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, respectively), which supports our second and third hypotheses. Finally, the reorganization-P slopes of GOCB-I and GOCB-O are negative and significant (<italic>γ = </italic>−.23, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01, <italic>γ</italic> = −.28, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, respectively), which supports the fourth hypothesis.</p>
<p>Hence, GOCB-I and GOCB-O increase the more the local authority employs repositioning and reorganization-O, and the less it employs reorganization-P (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0020852311430284">Figure 2</xref>). Altogether, TMS explains 37 percent of the variance of GOCB-I and 34 percent of the variance of GOCB-O. The random effect further reveals that for both GOCB-I and GOCB-O, within local authorities, there is significant variance between the slopes for retrenchment (<italic>τ</italic> = .12, <italic>SD</italic> = .35, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, <italic>τ</italic> = .04, <italic>SD</italic> = .20, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01, respectively) and for repositioning and reorganization-O (<italic>τ</italic> = .06, <italic>SD</italic> = .25, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, <italic>τ</italic> = .18, <italic>SD</italic> = .42, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, respectively). In other words, there are significant differences between local authorities regarding the strength of the relationships between GOCB-I/GOCB-O and retrenchment, and between GOCB-I/GOCB-O and repositioning and reorganization-O.
<fig id="fig2-0020852311430284" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Slope differences between local authorities for the relationship between TMS and GOCB</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0020852311430284-fig2.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>Finally, since some of the differences between the level-1 intercepts and slopes were significant, I employed level-2 analysis. The fully conditional model views the intercepts and slopes as outcomes that may be explained by characteristics of the authorities, namely their size (measured by the log of population) and their performance ranking. As can be seen in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0020852311430284">Table 2</xref>, the mean intercepts of GOCB-I (3.32) and GOCB-O (3.38) differ significantly between local authorities of different performance rankings (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0020852311430284">Figure 3</xref>). GOCB-I and GOCB-O among excellent performers are higher by .30 and .29 (on a scale of 1 to 5) than among poor/weak performers (<italic>γ</italic> = .30, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, <italic>γ</italic> = .29, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, respectively). Performance group explains 5 percent of the total variance of GOCB-I and 8 percent of GOCB-O between local authorities. Population size does not appear to affect GOCB-I and GOCB-O (<italic>γ</italic> = −.14<italic>, p</italic> = <italic>ns</italic>, <italic>γ</italic> = −.32, <italic>p</italic> = <italic>ns</italic>, respectively). In addition, performance group and population size do not explain variances in slopes between local authorities.

<sec id="sec19-0020852311430284" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion and conclusions</title>
<p>Modern public administration faces repeated ups and downs in a rapidly changing, globalizing world, as governments and residents continually seek better performance, yet within a culture that demands public cost reductions. As a consequence, local leaders, politicians and local officers are expected to pursue rapid and far-reaching organizational changes to achieve various organizational goals, from maintaining excellence to recovering from poor performance. Often, these tasks require more than everyday managerial actions, but rather, TMS.</p>
<p>While the longed-for better performance of public organizations is frequently treated in terms of finances and services, this study adopts a different approach, bringing into play human relations. To this end, this study borrows the concept of Organizational Citizenship Behavior (OCB) as a well-studied phenomenon from the managerial, organizational behavior and work environment literature (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0020852311430284">Organ, 1988</xref>) and employs it to propose a model that may advance our knowledge about public management. The proposed model holds that productive and cooperative employees and organizational harmony are critical for better performance, and especially for turnaround situations. GOCB is one such combination of behaviors and climate that local leaders must recognize and encourage to achieve extensive organizational change.</p>
<p>The current study and its findings bear on three major points. First, the study extends the conceptualization of TMS with regard to public organizations and excellent performers. Second, the findings sharpen our understanding of how the major types of turnaround strategies affect (or do not affect) GOCB. Third, the findings show that GOCB is likely to be associated with whether a public body is poor or high performing.</p>
<p>With regard to the first point, the study extends the conceptualization of TMS in two ways. First, following evidence from the private sector, it broadens the concept of TMS to organizational strategies aimed at accomplishing any radical organizational change, not necessarily recovery after a crisis. The factor analysis – based on data collected from both poor- and high-performing local authorities – divided TMS into three factors: retrenchment; repositioning and reorganization at the organizational level (reorganization-O); and reorganization at the personnel level (reorganization-P). Our data show that most of these strategies – indeed, all but reorganization-P – were employed to a similar extent by poor and excellent performers. This finding is in line with studies in the private sector, which have found TMS relevant for top performers. Second, the three factors identified here can be compared to the 3Rs of retrenchment, repositioning and reorganization suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0020852311430284">Boyne (2004)</xref>. Under Boyne’s division, TMS are clustered according to their aims. The current findings suggest that TMS can be clustered according to their very different impact on the work environment and organizational climate, i.e. positive (repositioning and reorganization-O), negative (reorganization-P), or neutral (retrenchment).</p>
<p>To my knowledge, the current study is the first to test the theoretical and empirical impact of TMS on the work environment in public administration systems. As such, the study contributes significantly to practitioners and the literature by sharpening our understanding of how different strategies under the TMS rubric affect employees’ GOCB. The main finding in this regard is that greater implementation of repositioning and reorganization-O is linked with higher levels of both forms of GOCB (GOCB-I (directed toward individuals) and GOCB-O (directed toward the organization)). Thus, while repositioning and reorganization-O serve the general aim of bringing about a radical change in performance, they may be used as a foundation for improving the organizational culture, work relations, morale and cooperation. In this, the findings support other studies (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0020852311430284">Walshe et al., 2004</xref>) which suggest that TMS may bring in new aspirations along with the opportunities that accompany extensive change.</p>
<p>Another finding that deserves attention in this context is that certain TMS can have costs in terms of employee performance. In line with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0020852311430284">McLean and Kidder (1994)</xref>, the current study found a negative relationship between reorganization-P and GOCB, meaning that introducing major personnel changes is likely to produce mixed or even undesired outcomes. This finding supports the ‘structural inertia’ argument (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0020852311430284">Hannan and Freeman, 1977</xref>), which holds that internal stability is the preferred response to a dynamic environment. Public managers charged with planning and implementing TMS should consider these intraorganizational implications before replacing personnel and restructuring organizational positions on a large scale. These findings are especially important in light of previous findings that greater use of reorganization-P in public organizations did not result in better performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0020852311430284">Beeri, under revision</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0020852311430284">Boyne and Meier, 2009</xref>). Together, these studies cast into doubt the value and necessity of reorganization-P as a turnaround strategy.</p>
<p>The last set of turnaround strategies, retrenchment, has been in broad use in public organizations in recent years, as a combination of fiscal crises and a neoliberal political agenda have led to funding cutbacks and pressure on organizations to become more focused and efficient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0020852311430284">Beeri, 2011</xref>). Many scholars, too, regard retrenchment as crucial to achieving radical change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0020852311430284">Boyne, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0020852311430284">Robbins and Pearce, 1992</xref>). On the other hand, retrenchment is likely to result in reduced public services, potentially harming the public interest. While the current study cannot resolve this question, it helps clarify the discussion by showing that against my expectation, retrenchment does not undermine the organizational climate or employee behavior as measured by GOCB-I and GOCB-O. A possible explanation for these results may be that retrenchment primarily influences external stakeholders, who will no longer receive the same quantity and/or quality of services as before, while internal stakeholders and human relations are likely to be indifferent to retrenchment. Put differently, the findings help identify the outer bounds of retrenchment’s costs to organizational stakeholders.</p>
<p>A final word concerns the analyses which controlled for the performance rankings of the local authorities in the sample. Authorities ranked excellent enjoyed higher levels of GOCB-I and GOCB-O than poor performers. This finding is not surprising, given the many other studies that have found a positive relationship between organizational performance – in terms of corporate assessment, use of resources and quality of services – and positive outcomes vis-à-vis work relations and employee performance (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0020852311430284">Ehrhart and Naumann, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0020852311430284">Schnake and Dumler, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0020852311430284">Vigoda-Gadot et al., 2007</xref>). The findings strengthen the presumption that GOCB is an indicator of employee performance.</p>
<p>No study is free of limitations, and those of the current study may guide future attempts to explore TMS in public systems. First, the study sample is of modest size, and the data were collected in the local government sector. These limitations make it difficult to generalize the current findings to other public services. The literature would benefit if future studies test the current model on larger and more heterogeneous samples of public employees and organizations. Second, the data were collected in England. The results might differ in other cultures where local authorities have different work environments or operate under different central–local relations. Future studies should control for factors such as how the broader culture or setting affects the organizational culture. Finally, the current study did not employ a causal research design, and so any inferences about causality should be made with caution. Future studies could take the suggested model a few steps forward by employing a ‘before-and-after’ research design, which could point to causal relationships between TMS and the work environment.</p>
