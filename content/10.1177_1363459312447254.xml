<abstract>
<p>Obesity (or being overweight) is now considered a by-product of membership of developed societies. Moreover, it is considered a growing ‘global’ health problem. This article reports on a small qualitative study of adults who fell into one or other of these categories in Norway in 2010, and who have been faced with decisions about <italic>lifestyle</italic> versus <italic>surgical</italic> remedies. This decision making is contextualized and the principal criteria examined. Embodiment, bodywork, self- and social identity, stigma, deviance and issues around the idea of personal responsibility and public health emerge as key themes. The concluding paragraphs commend incorporation of a macro- or social structural perspective to the conceptualization and investigation of obesity.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>It is widely accepted that obesity has reached epidemic proportions over recent decades, with approximately 1.5 billion adults (age 20+) worldwide being overweight and at least 500 million obese (as defined by the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1363459312447254">World Health Organization (WHO), 2011</xref>), numbers from 2008). Being overweight was once considered a problem only in high-income countries, but is now raising health concerns in low- and middle-income countries as well. A large number of people go through drastic weight-loss programmes and surgeries in order to lose weight. Our aim in this article is to locate the various decisions and actions taken by individuals to live with or treat what is defined as their obesity within a sociological frame. Drawing on interviews with patients admitted for treatment in one of Norway’s university hospitals, our interest is in how patients view their status as obese and how they choose between alternative obesity therapies. Treatments offered by the hospital in this study include an intermittent residential programme, a commercial weight-loss camp, a hospital outpatient programme and bariatric surgery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1363459312447254">Martins et al., 2010</xref>). From a sociological point of view, how obese patients deal with health and therapy choices raises a complex set of questions about bodywork, self-identity, stigma, risk and responsibility. We ask why some people choose to go through risky surgeries in order to lose weight. We begin with a brief excursus on the sociology of the body before going into the details of obesity treatment.</p>

<sec id="section2-1363459312447254">
<title>Body morality in high modernity</title>
<p>The relation between health and appearance may be thought of as an ‘aesthetic of health’, in which particular looks reflect well-being, which in turn is evidence of devotion to self-improvement practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1363459312447254">Jutel, 2005</xref>). Appearance reflects a morality of eating, staying fit, taking care of oneself and so on; it speaks to an individual’s true nature.</p>
<p>In so far as weight is regarded as an indicator of health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1363459312447254">Jutel, 2005</xref>), health becomes visually accessible: it is manifest in the parameters of the body. Slim and overweight bodies signal very different living patterns. While the overweight body evidences self-indulgence and a lack of self-discipline, the slim body demonstrates a high level of self-control. The link between body-weight and consumption of food is taken as a given (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1363459312447254">Lupton, 1996</xref>). The body may be experienced as a source of pride if socially and normatively acceptable, but as a source of anxiety and humiliation if not. Being overweight is not necessarily a practical problem, as many overweight people are active and actually healthier than sedentary, skinny people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1363459312447254">Blair and Brodney, 1999</xref>). However, as western democracies have become more concerned with risk and responsibility, and even considered ‘risk societies’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1363459312447254">Beck, 1992</xref>), the concern is not only today’s problems but tomorrow’s. Thus healthy, active, overweight people need, indeed ‘ought’, to be concerned with a growing list of risks, ‘potential’ side-effects of ‘potential’ future obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1363459312447254">Gard and Wright, 2001</xref>). The mass media promotes a healthy, fit body, and people are increasingly concerned with their bodies as expressions of individual identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1363459312447254">Shilling, 1993</xref>). The body is a personal resource that reflects a person’s self-identity and has for many modern people become a project in its own right as appearance, size, shape and even its contents, can be reconstructed.</p>
<p>Having the right body shape is not only about ‘being healthy’ as the obese are often also characterized as lazy. This characterization is stigmatizing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1363459312447254">Goffman, 1990</xref>). Obese people are frequently portrayed as ugly, stupid, lazy, mean, self-indulgent, sloppy and emotionally weaker than ‘normal’ people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1363459312447254">Gilman, 2008</xref>). Control and virtue are to be found in slenderness, which gives underweight people a higher status than the overweight. People are deemed responsible for their own health. A moral responsibility is foisted on the individual to choose a good diet and make ‘correct’ choices when it comes to lifestyle and physical activity. Foods and behaviours are considered good or bad, which accords obesity discourse a pivotal role in creating a public ‘health scare’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1363459312447254">Rich and Evans, 2005</xref>: 352). Since childhood we learn to categorize foods as yes and no foods. Dichotomizing foods as good or bad is often implicit in both popular and medical discourses, assigning the foods moral meaning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1363459312447254">Lupton, 1996</xref>). In order to ‘raise awareness’ among the lay population mass media campaigns and social marketing techniques are used to spread information about risks and benefits associated with certain foods.</p>
<p>While the body has become increasingly important for people’s sense of self-identity in high modernity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1363459312447254">Shilling, 1993</xref>), bodies are possibly more ‘transparent’ through privatized, personalized and somatized body projects in a postmodern consumer-oriented culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1363459312447254">Chrysanthou, 2002</xref>). Drawing on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1363459312447254">Bury (1997)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1363459312447254">Giddens (1991)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1363459312447254">Shilling (1993)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1363459312447254">Chrysanthou (2002)</xref> argues that the body has become a crucial source of identity and meaning: self-identities are only loosely connected to religion and community and less readily associated with gender, class or age in high modernity. He argues that the physical body is ‘transfigured into an active utopian project’ in the alliance of health information, medical technology, health consumerism and self-screening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1363459312447254">2002</xref>: 469). The analytic gaze is turned inwards. In the case of obesity however, this inward ‘gaze’ is not motivated by individual body projects alone, but is also a response to the felt need to <italic>appear</italic> responsibly healthy, fit and self-disciplined. In a Foucauldian sense people discipline themselves in order to meet a <italic>panoptical</italic> society’s demands of having a healthy, normal body. Just as Bentham’s Panopticon makes all prisoners <italic>feel</italic> constantly surveilled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1363459312447254">Foucault, 1979</xref>), obese people are self-disciplined by the feeling of being constantly observed as noticeably ‘fat’ by the society at large. An important question in this article is therefore: what does it do to people when a (supposed) lack of self-control is manifest ‘in layers’ on one’s body? Questions of shame and blame become highly relevant.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1363459312447254">
<title>Shame and blame</title>
<p>Stigma usually refers to any attribute, trait or condition that distinguishes its bearer as different from what time and place dictate to be ‘normal’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1363459312447254">Scambler, 1998</xref>). Prejudice and stigma are associated with being obese, which is why many of the study participants wanted to lose weight. As they lost weight they experienced elevated acceptance in public. Stigma and deviance are often used as synonyms. Recently, however, an analytic distinction between them has been posited for sociological purposes, and it is one of relevance here.</p>
<p>For <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1363459312447254">Scambler (2009)</xref>, stigma represents an infringement against norms of shame, while deviance represents a breach of norms of blame. Stigma signals an ‘ontological deficit’ (involving ‘being’ imperfect) and a failure therefore to conform; while deviance signals a ‘moral deficit’ (involving ‘acting’ inappropriately) and a matter therefore of culpability. Moreover, each of stigma and deviance can take three forms. <italic>Enacted</italic> stigma and deviance refer to discrimination against individuals solely because of their ontological or moral inferiority or unacceptability respectively: enacted stigma is active ‘shaming’, enacted deviance active ‘blaming’. <italic>Felt</italic> stigma and deviance refer to internalized feelings of shame and blame, but also, and principally, to an anticipation and fear of meeting with enacted stigma and deviance. Finally, <italic>project</italic> stigma and deviance refer to the wilful endeavour to deny or resist enacted stigma and deviance without falling prey to felt stigma and deviance. Project stigma and deviance have to date been somewhat neglected in the sociology of stigma and stigmatizing conditions.</p>
<p>Drawing on the definition of stigma as the co-occurrence of ‘labelling, stereotyping, separation, status loss, and discrimination’, as well as a ‘power exercise’, a number of questions can be raised (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1363459312447254">Link and Phelan, 2001</xref>). For instance, what follows ‘if those who might stigmatise possess power enough to underwrite and maintain a separation of “us” from “them”’, and if ‘those who might confer stigma have the power to control access to core institutions like schooling, job markets, housing and healthcare in order to “put really consequential teeth into the distinctions they draw”’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1363459312447254">Scambler, 2009</xref>: 450). In the case of obesity we suggest that ‘what follows’ can occasionally be positive as well as negative. Ironically, the separation of ‘us’ from ‘them’, via a diagnosis of morbid obesity (BMI<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1363459312447254">1</xref></sup> above 40), might be marked by (fully covered) access to therapy.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1363459312447254">Campos (2004)</xref> proposes that much of the obesity discourse rests on the claim that there is a correlation between being overweight and having bad health. Although ill health often comes with excessive weight, the relationship between health and weight is complicated. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1363459312447254">Monaghan (2005)</xref> questions the biomedical weight-for-height categories, as health, size and weight are not as intertwined as often presented. Using BMI as an indicator of health and fitness is also problematic as a high BMI is not always associated with bad health. Despite this, BMI is typically considered the ‘gold standard’ of the obesity industry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1363459312447254">Ruppel Shell, 2003</xref>). In fact the BMI says little about somebody’s health since it indicates weight rather than fat (and may define muscular and athletic people as morbidly obese because the measurement does not distinguish muscles from fat). However, our participants characterize their health by referring to their BMI, and because of this we stick with BMI as a standard definition in this article.</p>

<title>Treating obesity: the surgical option</title>
<p>Surgical treatment for obesity has emerged to supplement or even displace more longstanding and researched lifestyle interventions. Attempts to change the size and shape of bodies by surgery carry a risk. In a survey of obese patients’ motivations for choosing between lifestyle intervention or weight-loss surgery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1363459312447254">Strømmen et al., 2009</xref>) found that many patients who opted for surgery most feared social intimacy with other patients and therefore felt uncomfortable with lifestyle (group) therapy. Many who chose lifestyle intervention were anxious about anaesthesia and therefore wanted to reduce weight in a more traditional manner.</p>
<p>Weight-loss surgery has been performed in Norway since the 1970s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1363459312447254">Våge et al., 2002</xref>) and is based on two main principles that can be used separately or combined: (1) a restriction of the stomach’s volume; and (2) a bypass intervention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1363459312447254">Badman and Flier, 2005</xref>). People with a BMI above 40 or BMI less than 40 but with comorbidities are classified as morbidly obese. People who are morbidly obese may get surgery free of charge, but the length of the waiting lists encourages many people to pay for surgery in private clinics. Patients with a BMI over 40 are usually recommended gastric bypass while patients with a BMI lower than 40 may choose between gastric banding and sleeve resection.</p>
<p>Severe obesity can have negative health effects such as type 2 diabetes, hypertension, excessive lipids in the blood (hyperlipidaemia) and abnormal breathing due to a physical block of airflow (obstructive sleep apnoea) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1363459312447254">Badman and Flier, 2005</xref>). After surgery many patients recover from these effects and the majority experience better psychosocial function and mental health. However, weight-loss surgery may also lead to serious complications in relation to the surgery, the quick weight loss and later nutritional or metabolic problems. Operative mortality is very low, but a total of 15–20 per cent experience surgical complications like reflux, vomiting, dysphagia, dumping syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1363459312447254">Maggard et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1363459312447254">Ogden et al., 2006</xref>) and nutritional problems (lack of proteins, vitamins and minerals) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1363459312447254">Dolan et al., 2004</xref>). Despite known risks, an increasing number of Norwegians go through weight-loss surgery every year. Some who go through surgery have participated earlier in lifestyle interventions without achieving permanent weight loss. Notwithstanding improved health after lifestyle therapy, many still choose to go through bariatric surgery.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1363459312447254" sec-type="cases">
<title>Case and research methods</title>
<p>In the study<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1363459312447254">2</xref></sup> reported here we used a qualitative design with a total of 22 in-depth semi-structured interviews, carried out between December 2009 and April 2010. The questions concerned the informants’ background, choice of treatment, need for information and participation in self-help groups and forums, among other themes. With assistance from the Obesity Clinic (Obesitaspoliklinikken) at St Olavs University Hospital, 90 former obesity patients were contacted by letter, 14 of whom agreed to participate. In addition, the first author did one pilot interview while visiting Røros Rehab, and a further seven participants were recruited through snowball sampling. In all, 17 women and five men participated in the study. Most of the interviews took place in participants’ homes, while three were conducted in cafés. The interviews lasted approximately 70 minutes and were audio-recorded, transcribed and inductively coded with HyperResearch, a computer software tool for data analysis, and later analysed.</p>
<p>Our analysis followed an inductive strategy, as suggested in concepts such as grounded theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1363459312447254">Glaser and Strauss, 1967</xref>) and stepwise-deductive induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1363459312447254">Tjora, 2010</xref>), in which themes being identified in the data limit concepts in the further analysis. While there are for instance obvious gender-related issues related to the body, overweight and obesity, such aspects have not been especially addressed in the study, nor brought up by the female nor male participants in the study (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1363459312447254">Glaser, 2002</xref>). That this article does not discuss gender issues, does by no means indicate that such themes are not relevant in a more general sense.</p>
<p>Obese patients admitted at our case hospital could choose between a ‘residential intermittent programme’ at Røros Rehabilitation Centre (hereafter Røros Rehab) in the region or a ‘weight-loss camp’ at Ebeltoft Kurcenter (hereafter Ebeltoft Camp) in Denmark. Twelve of the participants in our study had gone through treatment at Røros Rehab, while an additional two had been at Ebeltoft Camp. These two patients and a third patient from Røros Rehab went through surgery a few years after lifestyle intervention.</p>
<p>The intervention at Røros Rehab consists of intermittent stays<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1363459312447254">3</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1363459312447254">Martins et al., 2010</xref>) in which treatment is based on activity, diet and mental therapy. Included are consultations with a psychologist, individually and in groups, workouts and healthy cooking. The aim is to establish new routines and eventually change the participants’ lifestyle. As the participants return home, follow-up is scarce and most participants go back to living like they did before the intervention. After a few months the participants return to the centre for check-ups, additional workouts and continued lifestyle interventions. The two participants who stayed at Ebeltoft Camp experienced a 21-week-long lifestyle modification programme at a private, commercially driven health resort. The programme is based on a conventional low-calorie diet, structured physical activity and cognitive therapy. The two youngest participants were between 20 and 30 years old while the oldest was over 60 years old. The characteristics and experiences of the study participants are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1363459312447254">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<title>Participants’ accounts: analysis</title>
<p>The participants tell stories about the choice of surgery, excuses for being overweight, failed diets, stigmatizing encounters and health problems. We will turn to these in the following sections.</p>
<sec id="section7-1363459312447254">
<title>Choosing surgery</title>
<p>Surgery is a drastic step and most participants considered it a last resort: if surgery did not help them, nothing would. Most of those who chose lifestyle therapy were surgery-sceptics. Some were afraid of not recovering consciousness after anaesthesia, while others were more worried about possible post-surgery complications, consequent lifestyle-change or adjusting to a ‘new body’. Despite this, few participants excluded surgery outright, but rather judged it <italic>a final way out</italic>.</p>
<p>Participants articulated different reasons and goals for discriminating between interventions. Going through bariatric surgery has many known complications and was considered a big step for most participants. The complications scared Oda, but she also worried about how her new body might look. In the event she offered the following observation: ‘When I was obese my fat was spread evenly and I was firm. I’m not firm anymore. I’m no aesthetic pleasure. Coming to terms with my body took a lot’ (Oda).</p>
<p>Henning feared anaesthesia, but had tried a variety of diets and therefore chose to have surgery without trying alternative lifestyle interventions: ‘A lot of people told me that I might not wake up after anaesthesia. I figured I had to take the chance. I’ll wake up or I won’t. At least I’ve tried it’ (Henning).</p>
<p>Some patients experienced post-surgery complications. Henning was experiencing severe ‘dumping’ when eating regular food. Dumping usually occurs after a high calorie intake, but in Henning’s case it occurred after eating anything but a few unhealthy foods like bacon and chocolate. He was dependent on large quantities of vitamins and nutritional supplements and was lacking energy. Despite this, he recommended people having surgery ‘if they needed it’. Wendy suggested that people go through surgery if they had failed several attempts of dieting. She believed that many obese people think that a skinny body comes with a happier life:<disp-quote>
<p>It’s not just the fact that you want to do what society expects, gaining a body that’s skinny, pretty and healthy. It’s a strong wish inside of every person that goes into this process and there’s a lot of suffering behind it. Very few people talk about the dream behind the act. A lot of obese people have experienced loss of family or social life. Maybe it’s about finding themselves and getting better self-esteem. It’s a dream about a body change that leads to a better life. (Wendy)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Nina decided to get surgery when she reached her 50s. After years of diets, stays at Røros Rehab and self-help groups, she realized surgery was the only solution. She was fully aware of its limitations and knew that many people regain weight at some period after surgery: ‘I know that I’m getting a major opportunity. I’m not given a magic stick, but a tool and I think a lot of people don’t realize that. It’s up to me to manage the tool the right way’ (Nina).</p>
<p>Ella and David both stayed at Ebeltoft Camp before having surgery. They lost a lot of weight while staying there, but rapidly regained the lost weight after returning home. When David finally decided to have surgery, he was anxious to get started:<disp-quote>
<p>I considered paying for surgery myself, just to get it faster … If I could afford it I might have done it, but I didn’t want to get in such a big debt when I was already on the waiting list. I could wait another year. (David)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Some of the participants never considered surgery as an option. Wendy had been struggling with an eating disorder since early childhood and had gone through a lot of therapy. When she finally felt ready to go through a lifestyle intervention she knew she would succeed. Losing weight was extremely important to her so her motivation never dipped and she kept fighting:<disp-quote>
<p>Being overweight is tiring and your life becomes so characterized by it. I understand why I have sacrificed this much in order to reach my goal and I understand why other people choose other ways to reach their goal. Even if they use all their money and pay for it themselves or choose other methods, I understand them. Getting under the knife is pretty much putting your life at stake. (Wendy)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Those who had gone through surgery offered various ‘legitimations’ for their choice. Some felt surgery was their ‘only way out’ since their eating habits were related to physical or mental health problems, making it especially difficult to maintain a ‘normal weight’. Most said they had learned ‘the hard way’ that dieting had made them gain more weight than they lost. Some chose to get surgery in order to avoid the stigma and prejudice related to obesity. And some said their reason for choosing surgery was rooted in mundane everyday experiences and challenges: being overweight was hard work. All participants detailed the histories of their weight-gain. Some of the stories were very personal and reached deep into the participants’ biographies.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1363459312447254">
<title>Excusing conditions for being overweight</title>
<p>During the interviews many participants ventured an account that ‘explained’ their obesity. Pregnancies, illnesses, mental health problems and difficult childhoods were among the reasons presented. Some also reported that they were genetically disadvantaged. Very few presented their obesity as a product of personal flaws like laziness. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1363459312447254">Goffman (1969)</xref>, most people present themselves or ‘act’ differently in public, or <italic>front stage</italic>, compared with in private, or <italic>back stage</italic>. Only David and Henning ‘confessed’ that their overweight was a result of overeating. David gained weight due to frequent coffee breaks and snacking while working as a cook in the army. For Henning a fast food addiction made him gain weight rapidly:<disp-quote>
<p>I started gaining weight when the hamburger reached Norway in the early 1970s. Hamburgers and French fries. I bought French fries two or three times a day. It was something new and it was tasty. I went from being a normal weight boy of 30–40 kilos to weighing 80 kilos in four or five months. (Henning)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Henning and David were the only participants who volunteered statements on their overeating. The other participants proffered different reasons for gaining weight and did not focus on excessive eating. Many mentioned genes, as obesity seemed to ‘run in the family’. Unni had gone through a lifestyle intervention at Røros Rehab after being encouraged by her dad, who had attended the same programme:<disp-quote>
<p>My dad has been here [at Røros Rehab], my uncle is here, my cousin has been here and my aunt as well. I hope they can find some genetic error that makes it easier for people to lose weight, at least for the people that are genetically challenged. If the genes play a crucial part there really isn’t that much I can do. If my overweight is <italic>meant to be</italic>, that is. (Unni)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>None of the participants asserted that obesity could be culturally determined, although only one had been diagnosed with a disease that is known to make dieting difficult. Despite this, most participants believed that their genes had had an important influence on their weight since they had been unable to lose weight no matter how much they tried. Thea came into this category. She has been overweight since childhood. She had always been active, but despite this her parents had chosen to put her on her first diet when she was nine years old: ‘I don’t know if it’s my genes, I just know that my sister and I ate the same food and we were treated that same way. Despite this I could never inherit my sister’s clothes’ (Thea).</p>
<p>Several of the participants experienced problems losing weight after pregnancies, while others blamed a weight gain on poor health. Gina was confident that her weight problem would be resolved when her knees got better: ‘I began gaining weight for real when I was in my 30s. When I was 45 and got knee problems I had to sit a lot and I gained weight really fast’ (Gina).</p>
<p>People are routinely and stereotypically judged by their physical appearance. Having a healthy body is not only about preventing disease, but plays an important role in making people feel good about themselves and how they present to others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1363459312447254">Shilling, 1993</xref>). While the overweight body signals laziness and lack of self-discipline, the fit body represents a healthy lifestyle and control. Obese people are often confronted by stereotypical characterizations like being lazy and sloppy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1363459312447254">Gilman, 2008</xref>). These characterizations reflect a personal ‘mark’ or stigma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1363459312447254">Goffman, 1990</xref>).</p>
<p>Most study participants reported to have little control over their weight as any putatively excessive eating or lack of exercise was the result of physical or mental problems over which they had little control. The litmus test for many was a series of failed attempts to lose weight. Diets, shakes and lifestyle interventions seemed not to have resulted in weight reduction; some even reported that dieting made them gain more weight than they lost.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1363459312447254">
<title>Failed diets</title>
<p>Fourteen of the participants had been through lifestyle intervention programmes at Røros Rehab or Ebeltoft Camp. Of the 12 who had undergone surgery, three had first gone through lifestyle interventions. According to Wendy, about a third of those who go through lifestyle interventions succeed, that is, they experience a permanent weight loss. Wendy was one of two participants who had successfully lost weight after staying at Røros Rehab. After an initial loss of weight she was determined to succeed on her own. She believed that most people prefer to lose weight on their own, but that a lot give up after experiencing a succession of ‘defeats’.</p>
<p>Unni, Siri and Viktor were the only participants who had not tried dieting on their own. After witnessing a number of failed attempts on the part of others, their impression was that dieting was generally counter-productive. The other participants had tried everything from diets, shakes and self-help to lifestyle therapy. They all experienced early weight loss before regaining it later: ‘I’ve fought against my weight since I was 14 years old. I’ve gotten fat by dieting. When I look at pictures and think about what happened I realize that I wasn’t fat when I first started dieting’ (Ruth).</p>
<p>For some participants their eating habits seemed to have led to eating disorders. Before surgery, Anna got up at night to eat bacon, chips or chocolate. Her eating disorder grew more severe and she eventually defined surgery as her last and only option. Anna tried all kinds of diets to no effect. Her family practitioner prescribed exercises and regular personal follow-ups, but nothing seemed to work. When she eventually applied for surgery her eating disorder was out of hand: ‘I gained more weight for every diet. I recommend surgery, at least if you have additional problems’ (Anna).</p>
<p>Resort to surgery following repeated failures of interventions based on lifestyle change was a major theme in people’s accounts. Ella and David each spent four months at Ebeltoft Camp. They lost a lot of weight and felt motivated to continue the ‘weight-fight’ when returning home; but neither succeeded:<disp-quote>
<p>We were there for four months and after that we were let loose – now you’re ready for the rest of your life! You return to the life you had before leaving and you realize that you haven’t done any changes. You get back to the same family, the same everyday life and that was your problem in the first place. (Ella)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Although only a few patients obtained a permanent weight loss after lifestyle interventions, several claimed to have experienced better health, more developed muscles and less fat. But this was deemed an insufficient return and bariatric surgery was often chosen:<disp-quote>
<p>I have been dieting many times and the lifestyle intervention at Røros Rehab was divided into sections. A few weeks of therapy followed by a few weeks at home, before going back to the centre again. That’s how I’ve been dieting earlier and I just can’t do it. I figured surgery was my last chance. (Marie)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Most participants mentioned innumerable failed diets as important for choosing surgery, but many also considered stigma and prejudice towards the obese important factors.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1363459312447254">
<title>Prejudice towards the obese</title>
<p>In Norway one is supposed not to harass people on the basis of their body size. However, felt stigma and deviance are pronounced, and enacted stigma and deviance far from unknown: ‘We have the ability of lying to ourselves when we’re fat. We tell people we’re happy with our weight, but we’re not. Life as obese is not a good life and you meet a lot of prejudice’ (Julie).</p>
<p>According to Ruth, there is a lot of shame associated with obesity and the general attitude is that ‘you just have to get a grip’. Wendy had the same concern and stated that most overweight are met with prejudice as they are considered lazy and demanding. Most participants had experienced comments about their weight in this vein:<disp-quote>
<p>Most people have a mirror and we can see for ourselves that we’re not exactly normal-sized. We’re all served comments and we tell each other that we don’t care, but we do. It becomes really easy to sit down and feel sorry for ourselves. (Fredrik)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The participants were asked to compare the cancer association with the obesity association. While cancer is considered a ‘status’ diagnosis obesity is closely related to shame:<disp-quote>
<p>There’s a lot of anxiety connected to cancer, but no shame. Obesity is associated with both shame and anxiety. Some people think it’s contagious. You don’t want to be with obese people ’cause they’re unpleasant to look at and you don’t want anything to do with them. (Wendy)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In addition to comments and stares, Anna had noticed that people avoided her when she was obese: ‘If you go to the cinema you don’t sit down next to a woman that’s overweight. I noticed that people avoided me when I was fat. It makes you feel sad, at least I did’ (Anna). After surgery and massive weight loss people treat Anna differently:<disp-quote>
<p>I had surgery during Christmas and Easter, [the year] before we were at a party with old classmates and I noticed that the only ones that talked to me were the ones I knew really well. When I went to a class reunion some time ago I met some of the same people and they wouldn’t leave me alone. Some of them didn’t recognize me, and they sat down next to me. It was the same people that avoided me earlier. (Anna)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Siri had gone through lifestyle intervention and was considering surgery. She preferred to keep her dieting a secret and informed only her closest friends about her stays at Røros Rehab:<disp-quote>
<p>They can all see that I’m overweight, but they don’t have to know that I’m part of a programme. People would probably ask me how I’m doing and if I exercise, and maybe I haven’t exercised that day or maybe not for months. It’ll make me feel bad. (Siri)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>During her stays at Røros Rehab, Wendy experienced that the therapists brought the group for a walk in the city centre:<disp-quote>
<p>You’re visible enough when you’re overweight and when you stroll around with a big group of obese people it’s a shock for the environment … The reactions from the society are reinforced when that many big people are together. Overweight people are considered demanding. You’re lazy and demanding – that’s the prejudices. (Wendy)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>One popular belief is that overweight people are themselves to blame for their body size. During an intensive period of dieting Fredrik needed a few days of sick leave in order to focus on his new routines, but was met with little understanding:<disp-quote>
<p>I went to see my doctor and he gave me the following comment: ‘Eat less and exercise more and stop complaining!’ I thought ‘you don’t understand jack shit’. I asked him if he expected me to pay for the consultation and he said yes. I told him to forget about it and I haven’t seen him since. (Fredrik)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In order to avoid embarrassing incidents, stares and comments, several of the participants withdrew from social activities. Feelings of shame left a lot of participants isolated from social gatherings and activities. According to Thomas’ dictum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1363459312447254">Thomas and Thomas, 1928</xref>: 572), ‘what man defines as real becomes real in its consequences’. Situations become real (i.e. being fat) when they are experienced as real (i.e. the feeling of being fat). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1363459312447254">Goffman (1990)</xref> shows how the body plays an important role in mediating the relationship between people’s self- and social identity. People’s self-identity is dependent on being accepted as a full member of the <italic>interaction order</italic>. If individuals’ bodily appearances and management mark them as ‘failed’ members of society, they may internalize this and incorporate it into what become ‘spoiled’ self-identities. According to Goffman, individuals typically see themselves through a mirror that reflects society’s prejudices. In the presence of embarrassment, a gap only too readily opens up between ‘virtual’ and ‘actual’ social identity.</p>
<p>As some participants mentioned prejudice and stigma as important factors for losing weight, others wished for a more functional body. Others, however, worried more about the health risk their excessive weight represented.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1363459312447254">
<title>Obesity and health problems</title>
<p>Most participants at Røros Rehab lost a lot of weight during the stay, but regained the weight on returning home. Despite this weight gain most of them claimed to have maintained the physical shape they gained at the rehab centre as a result of an increased daily activity level and a healthier diet, which is consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1363459312447254">Monaghan’s (2005)</xref> argument. In this article we do not discuss whether the participants’ health problems are a result of excessive kilos or inactiveness.</p>
<p>Health problems related to obesity usually appear with age. High blood pressure, problems with knees and backs, a high risk of type 2 diabetes and difficulty moving were important factors precipitating surgery. Health seemed especially salient to the oldest participants as the risks of developing cardiovascular disease and diabetes increase with age. Anna had surgery a few years ago. After surgery her life changed drastically and she no longer relies so much on medication:<disp-quote>
<p>I have arthritis and used to take four different pills. Now I don’t have to take any pills. I used to have high blood pressure as well and took an additional two pills for that. I had a tray filled with pills. (Anna)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The participants spent a lot of time and money on managing footwear and clothing. Worrying about how to get her shoes on in the morning could keep Britt awake through the night. Several participants reported that their aspiration to lose weight was mostly related to a desire to be more mobile, to make life easier, and to be able to do things that their weight was preventing them doing: ‘Practical things like being able to bend down to take my socks off without twisting and turning. Everyday dreams. Everything becomes easier, both everyday life and work if I only lose those 20 kilos’ (Nina). Nina had been a surgery-sceptic for a long time, but had recently decided to get surgery:<disp-quote>
<p>I’ve asked myself a few control questions. I am over 50 years old. Do I really want to continue living like this? There are lots of mountains I want to climb and things I want to do. I’m a risk to myself. I hoped that I could lose weight in a traditional way, but I’ve realized that it’s not going to happen. (Nina)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Researchers and health professionals often equate being overweight with bad health. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1363459312447254">Monaghan (2005</xref>: 312) is one of the critics of this view and he fears that health professionals and policy makers can be ‘blinded by fat’. He finds the obesity case exaggerated, as overweight people’s health is often significantly improved through diet and physical activity <italic>without weight loss</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1363459312447254">Gaesser, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1363459312447254">Galloway, 2006</xref>). According to Monaghan, using excessive fat as a health indicator can also be misleading since it is not always correlated with poor health. Monaghan argues that social inequalities, psychosocial stress and various forms of discrimination also have important impacts on health. By referring to a study of 22,000 male participants from middle to upper socio-economic groups, Monaghan shows that men who were ‘overweight’ and fit had cardiovascular and all-cause mortality rates that were similar to those who were lean and fit. Their mortality rates were significantly lower than those who were lean and unfit.</p>
<p>Thus participants had different reasons for choosing surgery. While some felt their weight was dependent on their genes or health problems, others had given up on dieting after years of failed attempts. Some were tired of meeting with stigma and prejudice, while others hoped that weight-loss surgery would afford them better health. In the discussion we take a closer sociological look at the participants’ reasons for choosing surgery.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Obese people are often confronted by stereotypical characterizations like being lazy and sloppy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1363459312447254">Gilman, 2008</xref>). These characterizations reflect a personal ‘mark’ or stigma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1363459312447254">Goffman, 1990</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1363459312447254">Goffman (1963</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1363459312447254">1969</xref>) considers the body a material property of the individual, which is controlled in order to facilitate social interaction. The meanings ascribed to the body are determined by shared vocabularies of body idiom, which is the most important form of non-verbal communication in public. Individuals present themselves on what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1363459312447254">Goffman (1969)</xref> refers to as the front stage. Private matters are normally hidden or reserved for backstage interaction. Severe obesity cannot be hidden backstage but the reasons for becoming obese can be summarized in an account or narrative. Goffman again: people who are obese are ‘discredited’, rather than ‘discreditable’, but can nevertheless opt for ‘covering’ that is, work to downplay or render less intrusive their conspicuously stigmatizing attribute. Mental and physical health problems, pregnancies and childhood traumas were some of the reasons participants included in their accounts to explain their overweight. Most avoided presenting themselves as lazy and greedy by explaining their weight problem through factors over which they had little or no control. David and Henning were exceptional in informing us that their overweight was the result of overeating. By telling us about their food-weakness they put themselves in a more vulnerable position than the other participants.</p>
<p>The distinction between stigma and deviance, together with their enacted, felt and project dimensions, are particularly useful in considering obesity and its impact of people’s biographies and decision making. Shame and blame run like threads through participants’ narratives for self and others. David, for example, frequently avoided social invitations and gatherings through felt stigma and deviance, feeling both shame and blame. It is a common finding in the literature on chronic illness and disability that felt stigma can be more disruptive of individuals’ social and working lives, and ultimately their biographies, than enacted stigma (felt and enacted deviance are only rarely identified as such) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1363459312447254">Scambler, 2009</xref>). We have seen that several of the study participants had experienced enacted stigma and deviance in the form of off-the-cuff comments and stares; but clearly in some cases, like David’s, felt stigma and deviance were stronger and more intrusive.</p>
<p>As was suggested earlier, the body, upon which can be inscribed shame and blame, represents an individual’s self-identity. For many the body has become a dynamic site of aspiration in its own right. People trying to lose weight are constantly working on this site. There are restrictions attached to how the perfect body should be achieved and maintained. While ‘working out’ is considered legitimate, correct and virtuous, surgery can be seen as morally problematic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1363459312447254">Sassatelli, 2005</xref>); the surgical option carries a risk of enacted and felt deviance. Many consider weight loss surgery <italic>the easy way out</italic>. Dieting has a higher status, which makes you more of a worthy patient.</p>
<p>The participants all made the point that surgery is a tool they had to learn how to use. Patients undergoing surgery have to learn how and what to eat, how to cope with the ‘known-about-ness’ and marks of surgery and how to handle its less accepted side-effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1363459312447254">Throsby, 2008</xref>). The challenge was to normalize the surgical intervention and rebut accusations of having ‘cheated’. By emphasizing their role as disciplined weight-fighters and minimizing the significance of the surgery, people announced that their obesity was a personal responsibility. None of the participants considered surgery an easy solution. After surgery, patients lose a lot of weight in the first year, but have to work hard to maintain this reduction in the second and subsequent years. Wendy believed that patients who lose weight on their own, as it were through will-power and self-discipline, are granted more respect than those who opt for surgery as there is a general belief that ‘easy fixes’ will be punished eventually.</p>
<p>A dialectic between the ‘logics’ behind attributions of shame and blame is apparent here. Being significantly overweight, especially to the point of obesity, remains an offence against what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1363459312447254">Goffman (1990)</xref> calls norms of identity or being, and is thus stigmatizing or shaming. But this is not all. There are sanctions also against those who are held accountable, or blamed, for ‘being fat’: popular stereotypes of laziness, greed and lack of self-discipline argue for moral culpability. Nor is this just a matter of public comment and prejudice. As the rationing of health care in developed societies becomes more explicit, ‘behavioural conditionality’ is increasingly being regarded as a reasonable criterion to prioritize treatments. It would be surprising if this were not debated sooner rather than later even in the relatively prosperous and welfare-oriented Norway. An eventual questioning or denial of the surgical option for obesity, at least in publicly financed medicine, might be anticipated for those who cannot demonstrate sustained attempts to ‘self-treat’ through lifestyle interventions. It is a matter, after all, of personal responsibility; for which a Foucauldian ‘technology of the self’ is a major pillar of post-welfare statist ‘governmentality’, amounting to an efficient form of social control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1363459312447254">Dean, 2010</xref>). In Norway, governmentality can be broached in terms of the official ‘guidelines’ concerning nutrition and exercise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1363459312447254">Helsedirektoratet, 2011</xref>). Advice is found on official websites, in commercials, newscasts and TV programmes about health and fitness. Although far from everyone leads an active, healthy life, there is a ubiquitous awareness of the benefits and risks linked to different lifestyles. Staying fit and eating healthily is commended while obesity is associated with low status as well as shame and blame. A latent inward gaze is produced and legitimized within the official policy to ‘fight obesity’, which in various ways is made manifest in our participants’ lives.</p>
<p>As if in anticipation, study participants’ hard-won, post-operative public acceptance was undermined when they confessed to their surgery. Oda did not want to be associated with weight-loss surgery and chose to tell only close friends and family about the intervention (felt stigma eliding here into felt deviance). When she lost weight in the first year a lot of people assumed she had got cancer. She said she preferred to keep a safe distance from obesity associations and forums and did not want to be associated with weight-loss surgery.</p>
<p>Acceptance rates for bariatric surgery differ between societies as different countries have different traditions and orientations to welfare and to surgery. A significantly private or fee-for-service health care system in the USA encourages more cosmetic surgery than occurs in Norway. In Norway taxes are high and health care universal, publicly funded and free of charge: morbidly obese patients are as yet covered for surgery. But surgery is expensive and since obese people are often defined as deviant, many consider weight-loss surgery a strictly unnecessary intervention. According to Wendy many obese consider receiving weight-loss surgery as something shameful. Julie had more than once been called a tax parasite for getting surgery for free. When she started to lose weight she proudly told people about the intervention. Negative reactions soon made her revise this policy of disclosure, as many people believe the obese ‘have themselves to blame’.</p>
<p>As considerations of the role and policy potential of personal responsibility enter Norwegian public discourse, it is being asked whether body size most reflects social, psychological or biological/genetic processes. Several informants claimed to be ‘genetically challenged’ given that obesity ‘ran in’ their families. While obese people themselves, as well as some researchers hunt for a <italic>genetic</italic> basis for obesity, the wider society, <italic>including the State</italic> and most medical doctors, seem reluctant to accept obesity as a genetic phenomenon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1363459312447254">Ogden and Flanagan, 2008</xref>). <italic>Pace</italic> Foucault, it is perhaps likely that Norway begins to follow the post-1970s ‘neo-liberal lead’ to replace its welfarist policy commitment to reduce enacted stigma in relation to obesity by a post-welfarist policy commitment to promote enacted deviance in relation to obesity. The ethics of the deployment of stigma and deviance in public health policy is now being openly debated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1363459312447254">Bayer, 2008</xref>). Should <italic>fat people</italic> (like smokers for instance) be blamed and feel ashamed for the sake of their and the public health? Would they then feel more responsible for doing something about it? Or do stigma and deviance represent an outmoded and ‘barbaric form of social control’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1363459312447254">Burris, 2008</xref>: 475)?</p>

<sec id="section13-1363459312447254" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>Concluding comments</title>
<p>In this article we have reported the findings of a small qualitative study of contextualized decision making on the part of obese or overweight individuals attending lifestyle and/or surgical treatment programmes in Norway. A number of themes have emerged, including: the pragmatics and aesthetics of bodywork; the salience and poignancy of embodiment of self- and social identity; the role of stigma and deviance – in all their dimensions – in personal choices for or against surgery; and the growing neo-liberal tendency to premise policy making on notions of personal responsibility.</p>
<p>The ‘social structural underpinnings of cultural norms and individual choice’ have not been emphasized here. The participants in this study, however, have exposed shame, blame, lies and embarrassment as shared experiences. In a sense the development of obesity therapy programmes represents an institutionalization of social relations in which personal tragedy and shame (i.e. stigma) are metamorphosed – following a trajectory from micro-phenomena of everyday interaction via meso-phenomena like life-style and surgical intervention programmes to macro-phenomena of public health policy – into matters of oppression and blame (i.e. deviance): ‘Enacted stigma and deviance can elide into government, and felt stigma and deviance into governmentality’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1363459312447254">Scambler, 2009</xref>: 453).</p>
<p>In terms of future research programmes, we would encourage a focus on the ways in which classifications, diagnoses and treatments of obesity and excessive weight are put into a broader social structural context, bringing into play not only state policies and activities, some of which might be deemed excessively bureaucratic or ‘oppressive’, but class-generated forms of commodification or ‘exploitation’. This macro-orientation would throw light on the ways in which norms of shame and blame and their enforcement relate to deeper social structures. A second focus would be on what we have called ‘project’ stigma and deviance. A number of quotations from study participants show that by no means all passively internalize social norms. Some who are reflexive about such norms actively resist them, and most do so now and again. Theirs remains a neglected form of resistance within medical sociology.</p>
