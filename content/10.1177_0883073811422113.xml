<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Moyamoya disease is an uncommon cerebrovascular disorder that is characterized by the progressive occlusion of the supraclinoid internal carotid artery and its main branches within the circle of Willis. This occlusion results in the formation of a fine vascular network (the moyamoya vessels) at the base of the brain. The incidence is high in countries in Eastern Asia such as Japan and Korea.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0883073811422113">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0883073811422113"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0883073811422113">3</xref></sup> According to the recent nationwide survey in Japan, the annual rate of newly diagnosed cases in 2003 was 0.54 per 100 000 population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0883073811422113">4</xref></sup> There are no effective medical therapies for moyamoya disease.

</p>
<p>The etiology of moyamoya disease is still obscure, but genetic factors may contribute to the development of the disease, because familial occurrence is observed in about 20% of patients with moyamoya disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0883073811422113">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0883073811422113"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0883073811422113"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0883073811422113"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0883073811422113"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0883073811422113"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0883073811422113"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0883073811422113"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0883073811422113">17</xref></sup> Recent studies have suggested some genes might be responsible for the development of moyamoya disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0883073811422113">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0883073811422113"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0883073811422113">18</xref></sup> According to a literature review, the majority of familial cases of moyamoya disease involve parent–offspring pairs and sibling pairs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0883073811422113">11</xref></sup> Compared with the general population, first- or second-degree relatives are known to have a 30- to 40-fold significantly increased risk of moyamoya disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0883073811422113">19</xref></sup> A female preponderance is significantly more prominent in familial cases than in sporadic cases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0883073811422113">11</xref></sup> Therefore, children born to women who had moyamoya disease can develop the disease as well. However, there are no studies that prospectively evaluate the incidence of moyamoya disease in such children.</p>
<p>In this report, we describe the first predictive case of moyamoya disease in a boy born to a woman who underwent surgical revascularization for moyamoya disease when she was 3 years old.</p>

<title>Case Report</title>
<p>This 20-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital because of a transient ischemic attack when she was 3 years old, and her condition was diagnosed as moyamoya disease. She underwent superficial temporal artery–to–middle cerebral artery anastomosis and indirect bypass on both sides in our hospital. Postoperative course was uneventful, and she has been completely free from any cerebrovascular events for 17 years after surgery. Her elder brother and sister were also admitted to our hospital because of transient ischemic attack and/or ischemic stroke and underwent surgical revascularization for moyamoya disease when they were 2 and 8 years, respectively. Their family pedigree is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0883073811422113">Figure 1</xref>.</p>

<p>The mother was referred to our hospital when she became pregnant. She was carefully followed to avoid ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke during pregnancy and parturition. She could safely deliver a baby through cesarian section at 38 weeks of gestation. Because a mother-offspring transmission of moyamoya disease was of great concern, we educated her and her family that her son was at a high risk for developing moyamoya disease and that her family should continuously pay special attention to him should he develop transient ischemic attack, episodic headache, or other neurologic symptoms. When he was 6 years old, he suddenly developed transient weakness of the right extremities for a very brief time (1-2 minutes) after crying. His grandfather could easily notice his attack and transferred him to our hospital. Neurologic and laboratory examinations revealed no definite abnormality. However, T1-weighted MRI revealed the dilated flow void signals in the bilateral basal ganglia. T2-weighted MR imaging also demonstrated many fine flow void signals in the basal cistern. These findings strongly suggested the moyamoya vessels. MR angiography showed occlusive changes in the bilateral carotid forks, and <italic>N</italic>-isopropyl-<italic>p</italic>-[123]iodoamphetamine single-photon emission computed tomography revealed reduced blood flow in the bilateral frontal lobes. These findings were more prominent in the left hemisphere (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0883073811422113">Figure 2</xref>). Cerebral angiography was performed under general anesthesia. Right internal carotid angiography revealed stenosis of the supraclinoid portion of internal carotid artery and the horizontal portions of the middle cerebral artery and anterior cerebral artery, which were associated with a marked development of basal and ethmoidal moyamoya vessels. These findings were judged as Suzuki’s stage 3. Occlusive lesions in the middle cerebral artery and anterior cerebral artery were more prominent in the left hemisphere. Their cortical branches were opacified very faintly, judged as Suzuki’s stage 4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0883073811422113">Figure 3</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>To our knowledge, this is the first predictive case with moyamoya disease born to a woman who was surgically treated for moyamoya disease. As described above, the mother’s two siblings also developed moyamoya disease in their childhood, suggesting a strong genetic background for the disease in their family (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0883073811422113">Figure 1</xref>). Therefore, we advised her and her family not to miss her son’s ischemic attack or headache because transient ischemic attack and headache are the most common signs in the early stages of pediatric moyamoya disease and that most pediatric patients with moyamoya disease develop cerebral infarct and/or ischemic stroke after repeated transient ischemic attacks or headaches.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0883073811422113">21</xref></sup> As the result, his grandfather could easily notice the brief episode of the boy’s ischemic attack and consulted with us. The patient had no cerebral infarct in spite of a marked reduction of cerebral blood flow, especially in the bilateral frontal lobes, because his disease period was short. Within 3 months after the first ischemic attack, he safely underwent revascularization surgery.</p>
<p>As described before, the natural course of functional outcome is poor in pediatric patients with moyamoya disease. More than one third of those studied were difficult to educate. Early onset, longer disease period, and complete stroke are involved in poor outcomes in pediatric moyamoya disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0883073811422113">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0883073811422113">23</xref></sup> Kurosawa et al evaluated their natural course and reported that mild intellectual and/or motor impairment was observed in 26% of them; special school care or care by parents or institution was needed in the teenage years in 11% and total 24-hour care in 7%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0883073811422113">23</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>There are no randomized clinical trial data to confirm the beneficial effects of surgical revascularization on the long-term outcome in pediatric moyamoya disease. However, previous studies have indicated that the incidence of transient ischemic attack rapidly decreases—perhaps even to zero—after surgery and, furthermore, ischemic stroke rarely recurs after surgery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0883073811422113">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0883073811422113">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0883073811422113">25</xref></sup> Several surgical procedures have been used to improve cerebral hemodynamics in moyamoya disease. Indirect bypass procedures are specific to moyamoya disease. The pediculate donor tissues such as the dura mater and temporal muscle have been used in these procedures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0883073811422113">2</xref></sup> Indirect bypass surgery induced spontaneous angiogenesis between the brain surface and the donor tissues, being simple to perform. The benefit of this approach are not immediate, however, because surgical collaterals require 3 to 4 months to develop, and the procedure carries a significant risk of perioperative ischemic stroke.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0883073811422113">25</xref></sup> Kim et al recently reported that their indirect bypass procedures resulted in cerebral infarct in 54 (13%) of 410 children within 2 weeks after indirect bypass surgery, and required a mean of 4.3 months to resolve transient ischemic attack.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0883073811422113">26</xref></sup> The surgical design is also crucial, as the degree to which collateral pathways are established through indirect bypass surgery depends on the size of the craniotomy and the extent of the bypass.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0883073811422113">27</xref></sup> Direct bypass procedure including superficial temporal artery–to–middle cerebral artery anastomosis can be a valuable approach for improving cerebral hemodynamics and for resolving ischemic attacks immediately after surgery. The incidence of perioperative ischemic stroke is lower after direct or combined bypass than after indirect bypass.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0883073811422113">25</xref></sup> Procedures that combine direct and indirect bypass have some of the advantages of both approaches. Our own recent data have shown that perioperative ischemic stroke occurs in only 4.3% of pediatric patients after a combination of superficial temporal artery–to–middle cerebral artery anastomosis and a novel indirect bypass technique, encephaloduromyoarteriopericranial synangiosis (EDMAPS), which can extensively revascularize the involved hemispheres, including the frontal lobes. In this procedure, the frontal pericranial flap is used to widely cover and revascularize the frontal lobes. The annual risk of cerebrovascular events during a mean follow-up period of 67 months was found to be quite low (0% in pediatric and 0.4% in adult patients).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0883073811422113">20</xref></sup> Actually, postoperative radiologic examinations revealed that surgical collaterals widely provided blood flow to the operated hemispheres, including the frontal lobes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0883073811422113">20</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Several factors are predictive of long-term outcome, including age of onset, nature of the surgical procedure, and postoperative cerebral hemodynamics. Kim et al demonstrated that cerebral infarction at presentation was associated with unfavorable outcome.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0883073811422113">26</xref></sup> Even after surgical revascularization, however, intellectual development is impaired in a certain subgroup of pediatric patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0883073811422113">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0883073811422113">28</xref></sup> Recent multivariate analysis has shown that ischemic stroke and surgery through a small craniotomy are independent predictors of poor intellectual outcome after surgery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0883073811422113">27</xref></sup> Small-craniotomy surgery such as encephaloduroarteriosynangiosis (EDAS) is technically easy to perform but has the disadvantage that the revascularized area is limited, and cerebral hemodynamics in the frontal lobe remains impaired even after surgery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0883073811422113">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0883073811422113">29</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Based on these observations, early diagnosis and surgical procedures performed over as wide an area as possible may be essential factors in improving long-term outcome in pediatric patients with moyamoya disease. Therefore, we emphasize the importance of identifying the occurrence of moyamoya disease in pediatric patients and treat them as early as possible by educating the family with a genetic background of moyamoya disease. As proven before, magnetic resonance angiography would be very valuable to noninvasively identify occlusive lesions in the intracranial carotid system.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0883073811422113">30</xref></sup> However, it is not always possible to efficiently treat offspring born from mothers with moyamoya disease by applying the present scheme. Thus, as some investigators<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0883073811422113">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0883073811422113">32</xref></sup> have pointed out, the clinical course is often aggressive in a certain group of pediatric patients younger than 3 years. Such patients often develop ischemic stroke at their initial presentation, repeat it before surgical interventions, and suffer poor functional and/or intellectual outcome. Therefore, it would be essential to establish a safe and effective protocol to detect the occurrence of moyamoya disease before such patients develop ischemic stroke in order to improve the long-term outcome.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we report the first predictive case of moyamoya disease in a boy born to a woman who was surgically treated in her childhood. It is quite important to educate the family not to miss the initial symptoms of their offspring at least when they have a genetic background of the disease, because early diagnosis and efficient treatment are essential to improve the long-term outcome in pediatric patients.</p>
