<p>Vitamin B<sub>12</sub> (B<sub>12</sub>) is essential in activating folate needed in DNA synthesis. Inadequate intake results in the impairment of nerve transmission and inadequate synthesis of erythrocytes and other hematological cells. Two separate mechanisms of B<sub>12</sub> absorption exist, a receptor-mediated endocytosis that occurs in the distal ileum and the mass-action pharmacologic mechanism. The recommended dietary allowance for B<sub>12</sub> for adults issued by the Institute of Medicine is 2.4 <italic>µ</italic>g/d. B<sub>12</sub> is only found in meats and other foods of animal origin. B<sub>12</sub> deficiency is widespread. Two main causes of deficiency include inadequate absorption and intake. Elderly and vegetarians are at highest risk for deficiency. Prevalence of deficiency ranges from 7% of the US population 3 years and older to 90% among vegans. The best way to assess deficiency is by using methylmalonic acid. Populations at risk could benefit from using B<sub>12</sub> supplements and from fortification of flour.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Vitamin B<sub>12</sub> (B<sub>12</sub>) was discovered in 1948 by Smith as an antipernicious factor.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1559827612450688">1</xref></sup> B<sub>12</sub> has the largest and most complex chemical structure of all vitamins.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1559827612450688">2</xref></sup> It has been named cobalamin because it contains the rare element cobalt in its chemical structure. Cobalamin belongs to a group of cobalt-containing compounds known as corrinoids that contain a specific corrin ring. Unlike B<sub>12</sub> analogues that are inactive in humans, the active forms of B<sub>12</sub> have 3 distinct molecules: aminopropanol, sugar (eg, ribose), and a nucleotide attached to the corrin nuclei.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1559827612450688">3</xref></sup> Methylcobalamin and adenosylcobalamin are 2 biologically active forms of B<sub>12</sub>. Other forms such as hydroxocobalamin (or aquacobalamin) and cyanocobalamin must be metabolized to either of the 2 active forms in order to be used in human cells. A specific R-group attached to the cobalt element is what differentiates these forms of B<sub>12</sub> chemically.</p>

<title>Function</title>
<p>B<sub>12</sub> (methylcobalamin) is a coenzyme involved in the transfer of a methyl group in a methionine synthase-requiring reaction that converts homocysteine to methionine. B<sub>12</sub> (adenosylcobalamin) is also essential in converting <sc>l</sc>-methylmalonyl-coenzyme A (CoA) to succinyl-CoA, a result of an action of another enzyme methylmalonyl-CoA mutase.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1559827612450688">4</xref></sup> In the first reaction, B12 activates folate, which is essential in DNA synthesis and thus affects nucleic acid (DNA) synthesis. Since methionine is needed for the synthesis of myelin, a coating of the nerve pathways, B<sub>12</sub> deficiency may result in inadequate myelin synthesis, maintenance, and repair and may impair nerve transmission. Methylmalonyl-CoA mutase is especially active in mitochondria, the energy production unit of cells. Other functions of B<sub>12</sub> include erythropoiesis and synthesis of other hematological cells.</p>

<sec id="section3-1559827612450688">
<title>Digestion and Absorption</title>
<p>B<sub>12</sub> is only synthesized by microorganisms. B<sub>12</sub> is not found in foods of plant origin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1559827612450688">3</xref></sup> It is, however, found in meats and foods of animal origin, including dairy products and eggs. In foods, B<sub>12</sub> is bound to proteins known as R-proteins or R-binders. For B<sub>12</sub> to be absorbed, the peptide bond that binds B<sub>12</sub> to the protein carrier has to be broken down. The process of digestion and absorption takes place in a few stages and requires adequate synthesis of hydrochloric acid, proteases and an intrinsic factor (IF), a glycoprotein secreted by the parietal cells of the stomach. B<sub>12</sub> is released from the R-binders found in foods by the actions of pepsin, an enzyme secreted in the stomach. This enzyme is secreted as pepsinogen and is activated by hydrochloric acid. Once released, B<sub>12</sub> binds with R-binders (also known as haptocorrins) secreted with the saliva. Bound to these R-binders B<sub>12</sub> travels into the small intestine wherein pancreatic proteases digest the R-binders, enabling B<sub>12</sub> to be taken up by IF, forming IF-B12 (or IF-Cbl) complex.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1559827612450688">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>There are 2 separate mechanisms of B12 absorption into the blood stream. The first is a receptor-mediated endocytosis that occurs in the distal ileum. IF-Cbl receptor is only expressed in the distal ileum of the intestines. Once inside the enterocytes B<sub>12</sub> is released from the IF and it then binds to holo-transcobalamin II protein (TCII), a protein carrier synthesized in the microvascular endothilium of the ileal villi.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1559827612450688">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1559827612450688">6</xref></sup> Cell membranes internalize the TCII-Cbl complex by a process known as endocytosis.</p>
<p>The second mechanism of B<sub>12</sub> absorption has been referred to as the mass-action pharmacologic mechanism.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1559827612450688">3</xref></sup> In the presence of large amounts of B<sub>12</sub>, such as in the case of ingesting B<sub>12</sub> supplements, about 1% or less of free vitamin B<sub>12</sub> is absorbed by diffusion across the epithelial ileum. This process does not require IF and bypasses IF-Cbl receptors.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1559827612450688">
<title>Recommendation</title>
<p>The recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for B<sub>12</sub> for adults issued by the Institute of Medicine is 2.4 µg/d.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1559827612450688">7</xref></sup> The daily amount that is actually needed to maintain adequate serum level to promote erythropoiesis and other hematological functions is considerably smaller but this recommendation assumes a 50% absorption rate of B<sub>12</sub> from the amount ingested with foods. The RDA issued by the Institute of Medicine is consistent with recommendations of other organizations. For example, the World Health Organization recommends an intake of 1.9 µg/d, the European Union, 3 µg/d, and the National Research Council, 2 µg/d.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1559827612450688">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1559827612450688"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1559827612450688">9</xref></sup> Intake of relatively high doses of B<sub>12</sub> does not appear to be associated with any detrimental health problems. Thus, the Institute of Medicine states that there is no sufficient scientific evidence to set a tolerable upper intake level for B<sub>12</sub>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1559827612450688">7</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1559827612450688">
<title>Food Sources and Bioavailability of B12</title>
<p>B<sub>12</sub> in foods comes in several forms, including adenosylcobalamin, hydroxocobalamin, methylcobalamin, cyanocobalamin, and sulfitocobalamin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1559827612450688">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1559827612450688">3</xref></sup> Adenosylcobalamin and hydroxocobalamin are the predominant sources in foods. Hydroxocobalamin and methylcobalamin are better absorbed than the other forms.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1559827612450688">10</xref></sup> Although B<sub>12</sub> is found naturally only in meats and foods of animal origin, some foods believed to be made exclusively from plant foods (eg, cereal, breads, pies, and even cookies) do contain very small amounts of B<sub>12</sub> because of either contamination during processing, adding of small amounts of ingredients derived from products of animal origin such as milk solids, or fortification.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1559827612450688">11</xref></sup> However, the amount of B<sub>12</sub> in the majority of these foods, except foods fortified with this vitamin, is negligible.</p>
<p>The highest amounts of B<sub>12</sub> are found in organ meats such as the liver and in clams. The content of B<sub>12</sub> in the liver varies from about 3.3 µg in whole chicken liver to more than 70 µg in 3 oz. of beef liver. Most other meats contain between 1 and 3 µg of B<sub>12</sub> per 3 oz. Bioavailability of B<sub>12</sub> from meats ranges from 10% from liver to as much as 90% from ground-cooked mutton patties.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1559827612450688">2</xref></sup> Bioavailability depends on the quantity of meats ingested. B<sub>12</sub> content of fish varies from 3.0 to 8.9 µg/100 g (about 3.5 oz). One of the best fish sources of B<sub>12</sub> appears to be the dark muscle of skipjack (159 µg/100 g).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1559827612450688">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>Milk contains between 0.3 and 0.4 µg B<sub>12</sub>/100 g. The absorption rate of B<sub>12</sub> from milk is about 65%. B<sub>12</sub> can be destroyed by heat. Boiling milk can destroy 30% to 50% of B<sub>12</sub> depending on the duration of cooking and pasteurization destroys 5% to 10% of B<sub>12</sub>. The B<sub>12</sub> content of dairy products such as cheese or cottage cheese ranges between 20% and 60% of that of milk.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1559827612450688">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>B<sub>12</sub> content of whole egg is between 0.9 and 1.4 µg/100 g.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1559827612450688">2</xref></sup> Most of the B<sub>12</sub> in an egg is found in the yolk. Bioavailability of B<sub>12</sub> from eggs depends on the preparation method (eg, scrambled egg, boiled egg) ranging from less than 4% to a little more than 9%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1559827612450688">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1559827612450688">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1559827612450688">12</xref></sup></p>
<sec id="section6-1559827612450688">
<title>Supplements and Fortified Foods</title>
<p>B<sub>12</sub> is widely available as supplements in pharmacies and health food stores alike in the United States, mostly as cyanocobalamin. Other forms of this vitamin such as methylcobalamin and hydroxocobalamin can also be found. The dose of cyanocobalamin in supplements ranges from 100 to 5000 µg.</p>
<p>In the United States, many foods are fortified with B<sub>12</sub>. This includes cereals such as Kellogg’s Special K, Wheat Bran Flakes, Total, Total Raisin Bran, All Bran Original, soymilk, and soy meat analogues such as MorningstarFarms Burger Crumbles. These foods contain from less than the RDA to more than 200% of the RDA for B<sub>12</sub>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1559827612450688">3</xref></sup> Additionally, 1 tablespoon of nutritional yeast contains 100% or more of the RDA of B<sub>12</sub>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1559827612450688">13</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1559827612450688">
<title>Bacteria-Synthesized B<sub>12</sub> in the Small Intestine</title>
<p>Although a team of researchers led by Albert<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1559827612450688">14</xref></sup> found that lactobacilli, streptococci, bacteroides, and other enteral bacteria made some B<sub>12</sub>, this amount does not seem to be adequate to maintain required B<sub>12</sub> status in humans. In addition, these researchers used microbiologic assays in assessment of the B<sub>12</sub> synthesis and this method measures both the active B<sub>12</sub> and inactive B<sub>12</sub> analogues.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1559827612450688">3</xref></sup> Thus, it is impossible to know how much of the isolated corrinoids was the active cobalamin.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1559827612450688">
<title>Algae as a Source of B<sub>12</sub></title>
<p>Although in the past algae such as spirulina, nori, or kombu were believed to contain B<sub>12</sub>, Herbert<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1559827612450688">3</xref></sup> showed not only that they almost exclusively contain inactive analogues of B<sub>12</sub> but also that they may interfere with absorption and metabolism of the active B<sub>12</sub> forms and thus, may contribute to the development of B<sub>12</sub> deficiency.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1559827612450688">
<title>Assessment of B<sub>12</sub> Status</title>
<p>There are several B<sub>12</sub> assessment techniques such as serum or plasma B<sub>12</sub>, TCII, homocysteine (tHcy), serum or urinary methylmalonic acid (MMA), and mean corpuscular volume (MCV). Each assessment technique has varying levels of accuracy in terms of diagnosing B<sub>12</sub> depletion or deficiency. Serum or plasma B<sub>12</sub> and TCII are direct measure of B<sub>12</sub>, and tHcy and MMA are metabolites affected by B<sub>12</sub> status. MCV is an assessment of the erythrocytes volume. TCII and MMA are the most accurate, whereas serum or plasma B<sub>12</sub> and MCV are believed to be unreliable.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1559827612450688">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1559827612450688">7</xref></sup> TCII can be used to assess B<sub>12</sub> depletion, whereas MMA indicates B<sub>12</sub> deficiency.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1559827612450688">15</xref></sup> Microbiological assay used to measure serum B<sub>12</sub> level, although commonly used, is especially unreliable because it measures both active B<sub>12</sub> forms along with inactive B<sub>12</sub> analogues.</p>
<p>According to Herbert,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1559827612450688">15</xref></sup> low serum B<sub>12</sub> is a relatively late indicator of B<sub>12</sub> deficiency whereas TCII indicates an early B<sub>12</sub> depletion. Serum or plasma B<sub>12</sub> level includes a total circulating B<sub>12</sub> from all B<sub>12</sub> carriers, including TCII and haptocorrin. At any given time, at least 80% of B<sub>12</sub> is bound to haptocorrin. Haptocorrin values reflect body stores of B<sub>12</sub>, including B<sub>12</sub> stored in the liver. According to Herbert,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1559827612450688">15</xref></sup> all cells have receptors for TCII whereas only the liver has receptors for haptocorrin. Thus, depletion of B<sub>12</sub> in some cells may develop before hepatic cells are depleted and before serum B<sub>12</sub> level shows a subnormal value. Serum assessment may not show low values until hepatic stores are depleted, which consequently will affect haptocorrin B<sub>12</sub> values. Haptocorrin has a half-life of approximately 240 hours whereas TCII only 6 minutes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1559827612450688">15</xref></sup> For the reasons mentioned above, TCII is considered more useful in detecting B<sub>12</sub> depletion early.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1559827612450688">16</xref></sup> Thus, using TCII instead of serum B<sub>12</sub> assessment will help in detecting B<sub>12</sub> depletion before stores of B<sub>12</sub> from the liver are depleted.</p>
<p>It is generally accepted that a level of serum B<sub>12</sub> that is less than 200 pg/mL (150 pmol/L) is considered to be B<sub>12</sub> deficiency. However, many people show symptoms of B<sub>12</sub> deficiency with higher levels of serum B<sub>12</sub>. Herbert<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1559827612450688">15</xref></sup> suggested using &lt;300 pg/mL (222 pmol/L) as the cutoff value for deficiency. A value of &lt;35 pmol/L is most often used when assessing B<sub>12</sub> status with TCII.</p>
<p>Methylmalonic acid and tHcy are elevated when B<sub>12</sub> status is compromised. Both of these metabolites are considered early signs of biochemical B<sub>12</sub> deficiency.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1559827612450688">16</xref></sup> Elevated tHcy (&gt;12 µmol/L) may also indicate folate or pyridoxine deficiency. Thus, additional tests have to be done to determine B<sub>12</sub> status. MMA is considered one of the most reliable assessments of B<sub>12</sub>. The Institute of Medicine set the normal urine MMA value as 0.58 to 3.56 µmol/mmol creatinine.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1559827612450688">7</xref></sup> Different cutoff values for serum MMA have been used, including 210, 260, 271, 370, and higher.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1559827612450688">16</xref></sup> MMA is a especially sensitive marker of B<sub>12</sub> deficiency; however, MMA, and to a lesser degree tHcy are affected by the renal function and thus in patients with kidneys insufficiency, using them to assess B<sub>12</sub> status may be inaccurate.</p>
<p>Normal MCV is between 80 and 96 fL. Higher values indicate a megaloblastic anemia. MCV is affected not only by B<sub>12</sub> level but also iron and folate status. Iron deficiency causes microcytic erythrocytes and thus decreases MCV, whereas folate deficiency causes megaloblastic erythrocytes. This is why assessment of MCV is also not reliable to assess B<sub>12</sub> status because it also reflects the status of folate and/or iron. In addition, MCV values may be normal with high folate intake even in the presence of B<sub>12</sub> deficiency.</p>
<p>Several researchers suggested using more than one assessment methods such as TCII and MMA or tHcy and MMA to evaluate B<sub>12</sub> status. Although MMA is considered the most sensitive marker of B<sub>12</sub> status, it is also the most expensive and this makes is less attractive for clinical use than TCII or tHcy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1559827612450688">16</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="section10-1559827612450688">
<title>Deficiency</title>
<p>Although once thought that B<sub>12</sub> deficiency is rare and unlikely to develop, except in strict vegetarians, studies conducted in the past few decades showed that this view has been based on the incorrect assumption, that it takes many years for the deficiency to develop.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1559827612450688">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1559827612450688"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1559827612450688"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1559827612450688"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1559827612450688">21</xref></sup> These studies showed that B<sub>12</sub> deficiencies are common in both developing and wealthier countries. Deficiency is particularly high among the elderly and vegetarians, but it is also prevalent among pregnant women and children, especially in less developed countries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1559827612450688">17</xref></sup> Studies showed that B<sub>12</sub> deficiency is common among people of European and African descents, Indian subcontinent, Central America, and South America. In Asia, B<sub>12</sub> deficiency is less prevalent except in vegetarians.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1559827612450688">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>B<sub>12</sub> deficiency may occur as a result of malabsorption due to a gastrointestinal condition, inadequate intake, lack of synthesis of TCII, a genetic defect of methylmalonyl coenzyme A mutase, or nitrous oxide poisoning. Malabsorption may have 2 primary causes: inadequate or complete inability of synthesis of IF and/or inadequate synthesis of or synthesis of weak hydrochloric acid, essential in activating pepsinogen to pepsin that digests dietary R-proteins. Although malabsorption due to the above-listed conditions is most prevalent among the elderly, it may occur at any age among people who have undergone gastrectomy such as in ulcer disease, gastric bypass for obesity, patients with celiac disease, Crohn’s disease, and those receiving chemotherapy. Deficiency due to inadequate intake has been reported in strict vegetarians, lacto-ovo-vegetarians, people following a macrobiotic diet, those who follow some form of raw food diets, children with regular disturbance in feeding behavior especially coupled with increased metabolic demand, and alcoholics. Also, mild B<sub>12</sub> deficiency is common in many countries with relatively low intake of meat and animal products such as Guatemala, Mexico, or Venezuela.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1559827612450688">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1559827612450688"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1559827612450688">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>The rate of B<sub>12</sub> deficiency reported in studies depends largely on several factors, including the assessment method and cutoff points used. Deficiency prevalence may have been underestimated in studies that used serum B<sub>12</sub> assessment for the reason described earlier.</p>
<p>According to the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data reported by Pfeiffer et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1559827612450688">22</xref></sup> 7% of the US population 3 years and older has elevated MMA (&gt;370 nmol/L). The rate of B<sub>12</sub> deficiency among elderly (&gt;60 years) Latinos from California participating in the SALSA study was 27.6% and an additional 40.3% had marginal B<sub>12</sub> status.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1559827612450688">23</xref></sup> Twenty-three percent of the elderly from Georgia were diagnosed with B<sub>12</sub> deficiency in a study led by Johnson<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1559827612450688">24</xref></sup> (MMA &gt; 271 nmol/L).</p>
<p>Using MMA as the indicator of B<sub>12</sub> status, B<sub>12</sub> deficiency has been reported in between 55% to slightly more than 85% in children adhering to macrobiotic diets (deficiency defined as &gt;430 nmol/L), 41% of adolescents formerly on macrobiotic diet (deficiency defined as &gt;290 nmol/L), 31% of adult lacto-ovo- or lacto-vegetarians who were taking supplements (deficiency defined as &gt;260 nmol/L), 47% of Chinese vegetarian women 55 years and older (deficiency defined as &gt;0.4 µmol/L), and 68% among Buddhist and Taoist monks living in Hong Kong (deficiency defined as &gt;0.4 µmol/L).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1559827612450688">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1559827612450688">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1559827612450688">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1559827612450688">26</xref></sup> Deficiency among lacto-ovo-vegetarians and vegans from Germany and the Netherlands was between 68% and 90%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1559827612450688">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1559827612450688"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1559827612450688"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1559827612450688"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1559827612450688">29</xref></sup> B<sub>12</sub> deficiency is relatively high among people in the developing world such as countries in South America with relatively low meat and animal products intake. Some studies showed a deficiency rate of 50% or higher.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1559827612450688">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1559827612450688">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>In rare cases, deficiency may also occur because of lack of or inadequate synthesis of TCII. TCII is the protein carrier of B<sub>12</sub> to all cells in the body, including transport of B<sub>12</sub> from intestines via the portal vein. Also, in even rarer cases, a genetic defect of methylmalonyl coenzyme A mutase, essential in the breakdown of some amino acids, is a cause of deficiency. In addition, all people who undergo a surgery under anesthesia should be screened for B<sub>12</sub> deficiency because nitrous oxide causes irreversible oxidation of cobalt, deactivating B<sub>12</sub>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1559827612450688">30</xref></sup></p>
<p>B<sub>12</sub> deficiency symptoms can be grouped into several categories, including hematological, neurological, and psychiatric. Specific symptoms of B<sub>12</sub> deficiency in each of the above categories are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1559827612450688">Table 1</xref>. Although description of symptoms of B<sub>12</sub> deficiency has been widely published, deficiency of B<sub>12</sub> is very often misdiagnosed. This is because these symptoms mimic symptoms of other health conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease, spinal cord compression, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, diabetic peripheral neuropathy, alcoholic peripheral neuropathy, and congestive heart failure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1559827612450688">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1559827612450688">32</xref></sup> The classic B<sub>12</sub> deficiency symptoms include synthesis of large, immature, oblong-shaped erythrocytes (megaloblasts) and myelin deterioration in both central and peripheral nervous systems.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1559827612450688">32</xref></sup> Megaloblastic anemia leads to symptoms such as weakness, fatigue, lightheadedness, tachycardia, angina, and pale skin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1559827612450688">7</xref></sup> However, high intakes of folate and iron-deficiency anemia can mask the megaloblastic symptoms, making assessment of erythrocytes volume an unreliable assessment tool for B<sub>12</sub> status. The deterioration of myelin may progress to axonal degeneration and even axonal death, which leads to neuropathy.</p>

<title>Toxicity</title>
<p>Hydroxocobalamin taken in high dose has been associated with acne-like dermatological effect.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1559827612450688">33</xref></sup> Cyanocobalamin does not exhibit similar association.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>B<sub>12</sub> deficiency is a prevalent nutrient deficiency resulting from a variety of factors, including inadequate intake and absorption. In the United States, to prevent B<sub>12</sub> deficiency, people 50 years and older are recommended to take supplements of this vitamin, as stated in the Dietary Guidelines for Americans document.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1559827612450688">39</xref></sup> It is, however, reasonable to assume that the majority of people in this age-group are not aware that they should be taking B<sub>12</sub> supplements. Furthermore, although some vegetarians may be aware of the risk, many do not supplement B<sub>12</sub> for a variety of reasons, including common misconceptions such as that a deficiency develops only in strict vegetarians after many years of following such a diet.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1559827612450688">40</xref></sup> In fact, the popularity of this misconception is not exclusive to some vegetarians. It has been disseminated in some scientific publications and even in a statement published on the National Library of Medicine’s Web site.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1559827612450688">41</xref></sup> B<sub>12</sub> deficiency is widespread and is associated with many adverse health outcomes from mild, such as forgetfulness and lack of energy, to severe, such as loss of smell, neural tube defects, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer’s disease, and inability to work.</p>
<p>Although taking a B<sub>12</sub> supplement has been shown to be effective in both prevention and treatment of B<sub>12</sub> deficiency, there is little effort on the part of public health officials to promote its use. Also, as already indicated, some groups of vegetarians resist taking B<sub>12</sub> supplements. Furthermore, the experience with promoting the use of folic acid–containing supplements to prevent neural tube defects has shown that promotion campaigns are largely ineffective.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1559827612450688">42</xref></sup> Many years since such recommendation was first issued by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, women are still unsure of what is the best time to use them, the dose, and the form of folic acid.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1559827612450688">42</xref></sup> This experience indicates it may take a very long time to increase awareness of the prevalence of B<sub>12</sub> deficiency and any efforts to combat this epidemic may be ineffective.</p>
<p>Some scientists have proposed fortification of flour with B<sub>12</sub>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1559827612450688">22</xref></sup> Fortification of flour with folic acid contributed to an increase in folic acid content of red blood cells, decreased total homocysteine and consequently, a reduction in rates of neural tube defects.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1559827612450688">22</xref></sup> It is reasonable to assume that this preventive measure would have the same effect in terms of reduction in B<sub>12</sub> deficiency and its associated symptoms. Oakley and Tulchinsky<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1559827612450688">43</xref></sup> suggested that B<sub>12</sub> deficiency symptoms would disappear if mandatory fortification of flour with B<sub>12</sub> was implemented in Europe. However, the benefits of fortifying products such as flour with B<sub>12</sub> can only be accomplished if adequate dose of B<sub>12</sub> were used. Different doses of B<sub>12</sub> fortification have been proposed, including 1, 10, and 20 µg per 100 g of flour.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1559827612450688">44</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1559827612450688"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1559827612450688">46</xref></sup> Although these proposed doses range from about 50% of the US RDA to almost 9 times higher than that RDA, only about 1% of the crystalline form of B<sub>12</sub> can absorbed. Carmel<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1559827612450688">47</xref></sup> suggested that fortification of flour with just 1 to 10 µg will be ineffective in preventing B<sub>12</sub> deficiency among the most vulnerable groups such as the elderly. In fact, Carmel suggested that if a total intake of B<sub>12</sub> is less than 100 µg in the elderly, it would neither prevent the deficiency nor replenish the body’s stores of B<sub>12</sub>. Thus, for the best benefit, flour would have to be fortified with a dose of 100 µg or higher per 100 g. Cyanocobalamin is the most stable of all B<sub>12</sub> forms and thus it is the best candidate to use in fortification.</p>
