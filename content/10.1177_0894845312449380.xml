Four hierarchical regression analyses were performed with a sample of 217 adolescent females in an urban high school. The dependent variables representing aspects of future career planning were (a) plans for the integration of work and family; (b) gender-traditionality of career choice; (c) career commitment; and (d) aspired education level. Personal variables made the greatest contribution to adolescent girls’ plans for the integration of work and family and career commitment. Background variables contributed most to gender-traditionality of career choice and aspired education level. Environmental variables did not make significant contributions to any of the dependent variables. Results and implications for counselors and educators are discussed.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>adolescent</kwd><kwd>career planning</kwd><kwd>work and family</kwd><kwd>career commitment</kwd><kwd>multiple roles</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Over the past three decades, the number of women participating in the workforce has climbed steadily. In addition, women with children are much more likely to be employed than ever before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0894845312449380">Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2008</xref>). Despite the increase in the number of women working outside the home, considerable gender differences remain in the types of careers women choose. Traditionally female occupations continue to be overwhelmingly dominated by women, and these occupations tend to be less well paid than traditionally male occupations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0894845312449380">Betz, 2004</xref>).</p><p>With consistent growth in the numbers of women participating in the workforce, the necessity for research addressing issues salient to women’s career development has increased substantially. At present, the body of literature pertaining to women’s career development identifies many variables that play an important role in the career development of women. Age, race/ethnicity, mother’s employment background, socioeconomic status (SES), anticipatory role conflict, academic self-efficacy, parental attachment, and parental support are variables that are often explored in the literature. Despite this information, there is still a lack of clarity about which factors are the most salient. An understanding of the most important factors influencing women’s career development will assist the development of appropriate interventions aimed at helping women reach their full educational and career potential.</p><sec id="section1-0894845312449380"><title>Adolescent Career Development</title><p>Beginning at the onset of puberty, adolescence is considered the time period in which children develop both mentally and physically into adults. Not surprisingly, research in the area of career development is often focused on the adolescent years, as it is a crucial time for career decisions to be made. Adolescence is an especially important time for the study of women’s career development because adolescent girls may make career decisions that are influenced by gender stereotypes and experiences of discrimination in the educational setting. Decisions made during adolescence can profoundly impact women’s career trajectories.</p></sec><sec id="section2-0894845312449380"><title>Model of Career Achievement Motivation for Women and Men</title><p>This study attempts to organize many of the factors that influence the career planning of adolescent girls and clarify which variables emerge as the most prominent. The study was informed by the model of career achievement motivation for women and men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0894845312449380">Farmer, 1997</xref>), which emphasizes the concept of agency, or the ability of an individual to shape his or her own career development. Farmer’s model also focuses on sex role socialization processes and their effects on beliefs, attitudes, and self-concepts, which in turn, affect motivation. The model of career achievement motivation for women and men draws heavily from social learning theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0894845312449380">Bandura, 1978</xref>) and emphasizes the roles of background, personal, and environmental factors on the career achievement motivation of women and men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0894845312449380">Farmer, 1985</xref>). Background influences are established characteristics that are beyond the control of an individual such as age, gender, and ethnicity. Personal variables are related to an individual’s self-concept such as attitudes and beliefs. Environmental variables are societal or other interpersonal factors that affect an individual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0894845312449380">Farmer, 1985</xref>). In an earlier version of the model, career and achievement motivation were explored through three dimensions: aspiration, mastery, and career motivation. Aspiration is described as the level of education and occupation to which a person aspires. Mastery is the tendency for people to choose to perform more difficult tasks and to keep struggling to master tasks once they have been started. Career motivation is the extent to which a person views involvement in a career as central to his or her adult life role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0894845312449380">Farmer, 1985</xref>). Farmer later added a behavior variable to account for the choices women made in terms of level of education attained, occupations chosen, marital status, and number of children. She noted that researchers might change the variables of interest in the model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0894845312449380">Farmer, 1997</xref>). In that spirit, Farmer’s model provides an excellent framework for exploring background, personal, and environmental influences on career development and identifying the most salient factors in adolescent girls’ career planning.</p></sec><sec id="section3-0894845312449380"><title>Current Study</title><p>In this study, the influence of background, personal, and environmental variable sets on aspects of adolescent girls’ career planning was explored. The background variables were comprised of age, race/ethnicity, mother’s work status outside of the home, and SES. The personal variables included anticipatory role conflict and academic self-efficacy. The environmental variables were parental attachment and parental support. The dependent variables in the model represented aspects of adolescent girls’ future career planning. The future career planning variables included: (a) plans for the integration of work and family; (b) gender traditionality of career choice; (c) aspired education level, and (d) career commitment. These variables represent common themes surrounding research on women’s career development including conflict between and management of work and family roles, discrimination experienced by women in work and school settings, and the tendency for women to underutilize their talents and abilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0894845312449380">Betz &amp; Fitzgerald, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0894845312449380">Fassinger &amp; O’Brien, 2000</xref>).</p><p>The background, personal influence, and environmental variables included in this analysis were also selected based on their prevalence in the literature on women’s career development. The following section includes an overview of research related to each variable.</p><sec id="section4-0894845312449380"><title>Background Variables</title><p>Racial/ethnic background often plays a role in women’s career development within the context of barriers to career development. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0894845312449380">Leung (1995)</xref> noted that barriers, as a result of racial discrimination, limit the occupational opportunities available to members of minority groups and can restrict both actual and perceived career options for individuals.</p><p>Research has also yielded evidence of perceived barriers to the career development of ethnic minorities. Studies show that ethnic minority students perceive more career and education related barriers than the European American students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0894845312449380">Fouad &amp; Byars-Winston, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0894845312449380">Luzzo &amp; McWhirter, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0894845312449380">McWhirter, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0894845312449380">McWhirter, Torres, Salgado, &amp; Valdez, 2007</xref>). In a study of specific barriers perceived by college students, personal finances were most frequently cited as barriers among African American, Native American, and Latino/Latina American college students while time management was the most frequently cited barrier among Asian American and European American students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0894845312449380">Perrone, Sedlacek, &amp; Alexander, 2001</xref>).</p><p>Similar to literature on the role of racial/ethnic background in career development, research exploring SES has also been conducted within the context of barriers to educational and career attainment. A qualitative study of students from both low and high socioeconomic backgrounds showed that students of low socioeconomic background expressed barriers to the school-to-work transition as more severe and frequent than those experienced by the students of higher socioeconomic background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0894845312449380">Blustein et al., 2002</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0894845312449380">McWhirter, Hackett, and Bandolos (1998)</xref> found that Mexican-American girls from a lower socioeconomic background perceived less parental support and interest in their academic work. Also, SES was found to play more of a role in educational choice for women than for men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0894845312449380">Trusty, Robinson, Plata, &amp; Ng, 2000</xref>).</p><p>Another area of research in women’s career development is the influence of various characteristics of mothers in relation to their daughters’ career development. Mothers’ characteristics such as education, employment, and gender role attitudes contributed to adolescent’s gender role attitudes regarding work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0894845312449380">Rainey &amp; Borders, 1997</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0894845312449380">Bohannon and Blanton (1999)</xref> found that there were no significant differences between mothers and daughters in attitudes with regard to the three variables of marriage, children, and careers.</p></sec><sec id="section5-0894845312449380"><title>Personal Influence Variables</title><p>With the majority of women with children now working outside of the home, the concept of role conflict has become a leading issue in the literature related to women’s career development (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0894845312449380">Ciabattari, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0894845312449380">Day &amp; Chamberlain, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0894845312449380">Perrone, Webb, &amp; Blalock, 2005</xref>). Role conflict stems from the difficulties women experience managing work and family roles. It can affect the career choices and trajectories of women as some may lower their career aspirations in order to maintain both homemaking and career roles. In a longitudinal study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0894845312449380">Hoffnung (2004)</xref> found that women with children had significantly fewer advanced degrees and lower career status than women without children.</p><p>There is also evidence that the perception of future role conflict affects the career trajectories of women. A negative correlation was found between work and family commitment among women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0894845312449380">Friedman &amp; Weisbrod, 2005</xref>). Also, women who planned for role sharing marriages were significantly more likely than women in conventional marriages to be committed to careers outside the home (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0894845312449380">Hallett &amp; Gilbert, 1997</xref>).</p><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0894845312449380">Bandura’s (1977)</xref> concept of self-efficacy is frequently explored in research related to career development, and it has been established as an important variable in women’s career development. Self-efficacy refers to individuals’ beliefs about their own capabilities and is acquired through four types of learning experiences: personal performance accomplishments, vicarious learning, social persuasion, and physiological and affective states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0894845312449380">Bandura, 1997</xref>).</p><p>Self-efficacy is considered to be a domain or task-specific concept (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0894845312449380">Bandura, 1997</xref>). In women’s career development, self-efficacy for math and science is often hypothesized to influence women’s aspirations for math and science related careers (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0894845312449380">Fouad &amp; Smith, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0894845312449380">Mau, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0894845312449380">Nauta, Epperson, &amp; Kahn, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0894845312449380">Schaefers, Epperson, &amp; Nauta, 1997</xref>).</p><p>Studies have also been conducted measuring self-efficacy for academic behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0894845312449380">Gore, 2006</xref>) in relation to career development. Academic self-efficacy refers to a person’s perceived ability to successfully perform academic tasks (e.g., study for a test, seek help from a teacher, taking a test) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0894845312449380">Schunk, 1991</xref>). Academic self-efficacy was found to be predictive of both career and academic outcome expectations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0894845312449380">Wettersten, Guilmino, &amp; Herrick, 2005</xref>) and significantly related to academic performance in first-year college students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0894845312449380">Chemers, Hu, &amp; Garcia, 2001</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="section6-0894845312449380"><title>Environmental Variables</title><p>Parental attachment is a concept that has been explored with numerous outcome variables related to career development and the career development of women. Attachment has been defined as an “enduring affectional bond of substantial intensity” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0894845312449380">Armsden &amp; Greenberg, 1987</xref>, p. 428). Higher levels of parental attachment were associated with greater levels of self-efficacy and environmental exploration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0894845312449380">Ketterson &amp; Blustein, 1997</xref>). Parental attachment was also shown to have a significant and direct effect on career self-efficacy, which directly influenced career aspiration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0894845312449380">O’Brien, Friedman, Tipton, &amp; Linn, 2000</xref>). High school adolescent women who experienced a moderate degree of attachment to their mothers exhibited strong levels of career orientation, realism and career self-efficacy beliefs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0894845312449380">O’Brien, 1996</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0894845312449380">Rainey and Borders (1997)</xref> found that the relationship between mother and daughter influenced early adolescent girls’ career aspirations.</p><p>Research has also substantiated the role of parental support in career development. In a meta-analysis on family variables that influence adolescents’ career expectations and aspirations, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0894845312449380">Keller and Whiston (2004)</xref> revealed that relational factors such as parental support positively influenced the career aspirations of adolescents. Perceived parental support has also been found to significantly predict vocational interests, perceived career value, career efficacy expectations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0894845312449380">Lapan, Hinkelman, Adams, &amp; Turner, 1999</xref>), and career task-related confidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0894845312449380">Turner &amp; Lapan, 2002</xref>). Higher maternal support was associated with greater career commitment while paternal support was positively linked to career expectations and educational plans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0894845312449380">McWhirter, Hackett, &amp; Bandolos, 1998</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0894845312449380">Alliman-Brisett, Turner, and Skovholt (2004)</xref> found that parental support represented 40% of the variance in girls’ self-knowledge concerning educational and career endeavors. Furthermore, emotional support from parents also predicted 38% of their career decision outcome expectations. These findings were corroborated in a study revealing a strong relationship between perceived parental support and career certainty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0894845312449380">Constantine, Wallace, &amp; Kindaichi, 2005</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="section7-0894845312449380" sec-type="methods"><title>Method</title><sec id="section8-0894845312449380"><title>Participants</title><p>The participants included 217 adolescent female high school students from a private, all-girls Catholic high school, in a large urban Midwestern city.

The data collection took place over a period of 2 days due to the length of the surveys. Teachers distributed the surveys to the students during their homeroom classes and instructed students to complete the first half of the surveys on the first day, and the remaining questions on the following day. Students were asked to read and sign the assent form before completing the first eight pages (Part I) of the study. They were also asked to print their names on the top of the assent form so that their survey packets could be collected by the homeroom teacher and returned to them on the second day of data collection. After the students completed the first part of the survey, the homeroom teachers collected the packets and stored them in their classrooms until the next day.</p><p>During the second day of data collection, the teachers returned the packets to the students and the students were instructed to complete the last seven pages (Part II) of the survey. After finishing Part II, the students were asked to detach the assent form and hand it to the teacher who placed it in an envelope. The surveys were then collected and kept separate from the assent forms. After the homeroom period, the homeroom teachers returned the surveys and envelope with assent forms to the researcher.</p><p>For the study, the principal extended the normally 20-min homeroom periods to 40 min each.

Higher scores on the scales represent a more attentive approach to planning for multiple roles. The first scale, Knowledge/Certainty, relates to women’s perceptions of their knowledge about multiple role planning, and certainty of their ability to realistically plan for multiple roles. A sample item is: “I don’t know how to plan for combining my career and my family.” The second scale, Commitment to Multiple Roles, explores the commitment to a lifestyle that includes multiple roles and one’s ability to manage it effectively. A sample item is: “When it comes to work and family, there’s no reason why women ‘can’t have it all’ if they just try hard enough.” The third scale, Independence, examines self-reliance in making decisions about multiple role planning. A sample item is: “Choosing how to best manage my career and my family is something I have to do on my own and nobody can tell me how to do it.” The fourth scale, Involvement, is the perceived immediacy of the need to plan for multiple roles. A sample item is: “I seem to spend a lot of time these days thinking about how I will combine my family and my work responsibilities.” Internal consistency estimates for each of the scales ranged from .79 to .84 on the overall validation sample.

The peer attachment scale was not used in the study since it was not a variable of interest. The quality of the attachment relationship was determined by the degree of trust and communication relative to alienation. The parent attachment score for each individual was determined by the sum of the trust and communication subscale scores minus the sum of the alienation subscale score. The parent attachment scale contains the following subscales: (a) trust (10 items) including “My parents trust my judgment,” (b) communication (10 items) including “My parents encourage me to talk about my difficulties,” and (c) alienation (8 items) including “My parents don’t understand what I’m going through these days.” Reliability coefficients on a sample of university undergraduate students ranged from coefficient α = .86 to .91 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0894845312449380">Armsden &amp; Greenberg, 1987</xref>).

The OOFI measures the perceptions of work and family involvement in both men and women. It consists of three scales, each of which reflects a different type of orientation (female traditional, male traditional, and atraditional). Two of the three scales were used in this analysis. The female traditional scale reflects the view that women are responsible for housework and childcare, and men are responsible for providing for the family. A sample item is: “After marriage, I see my spouse as working full-time and being the major financial provider.” The atraditional scale, reflects an integration of occupational and family roles by both partners in a marriage. A sample item is: “ I see my spouse and I both working full-time and sharing the financial responsibility continuously throughout our marriage.” The scales are measured using a 5-point Likert-type scale to answer how much a person thinks about the content of each item (1 = <italic>not at all</italic> to 5 = <italic>very much</italic>) and how much a person is committed according to the content of each item (1 = <italic>not at all</italic> to 5 = <italic>very much</italic>).

Personal variables contributed most to adolescent girls’ plans for the integration of work and family while the influences of background and environmental variables were not significant. Within the personal variable set, the attitudes toward multiple role-planning variable was a unique independent predictor in the regression analysis. This suggests that mindfulness and planning about multiple roles leads to higher levels of commitment to a future involving both family and occupational work. The finding is consistent with previous research conducted to address the impact of planning for future multiple role involvement. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0894845312449380">Hallet and Gilbert (1997)</xref> found that women who planned for marriages in which they would share the childcare role with their spouse were more likely to be committed to a lifelong career that would require a substantial amount of their time and energy.</p><p>Background and personal variables both significantly influenced gender-traditionality of career choice, with the background variables making the greatest contribution. The contribution of the environmental variable set was not significant. Age was a significant predictor within the background set of variables. This finding suggests that as adolescent girls age, they tend to plan for more gender traditional careers. One explanation for this result is that older adolescent girls are more aware of barriers that would make attaining a nontraditional career more difficult. This awareness could be influenced by personal experience as well as suggestions from family members and educators. Research by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0894845312449380">Kenny, Blustein, Chaves, Grossman, and Gallagher (2003)</xref> demonstrated that barriers negatively predict educational and vocational attitudes. Older adolescents may also be more likely to consider childbearing in their future and think about difficulties involved in rearing children and having a career outside of the home. They may be more likely to choose traditional careers because these careers tend to be more accommodating toward women who are primary caregivers as well as work outside the home (i.e., flexible schedules, job sharing).</p> <p>The academic self-efficacy variable was a significant negative predictor within the personal set of variables. This finding suggests that adolescent girls with lower academic self-efficacy endorse traditional female gender role careers more than nontraditional careers. Adolescent girls with lower academic self-efficacy may perceive themselves as unable to succeed in nontraditional careers and therefore are less likely to choose those careers. These results can be viewed as an extension of previous research demonstrating that higher math and science self-efficacy leads to a greater likelihood of success in math and science careers or traditionally male dominated careers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0894845312449380">Betz, 2004</xref>).</p><p>Personal variables made the greatest contribution to adolescent girls’ career commitment while the contributions of both the background and environmental variables were not significant. This finding is consistent with research by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0894845312449380">Farmer (1985)</xref> who found that career commitment was influenced by personal factors nearly 3 times as much as background and environment factors combined.</p><p>The academic self-efficacy predictor variable was significant in this analysis suggesting that higher academic self-efficacy leads to greater commitment to obtaining and maintaining a career outside of the home. An interpretation for this finding is that adolescent girls who demonstrate self-efficacy for school related tasks are more likely believe that they can be successful in completing tasks required in a future career. Similar findings have been demonstrated in studies exploring math and science related self-efficacy and commitment to math and science related careers (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0894845312449380">Chemers, Zurbriggen, Syed, Goza, &amp; Bearman, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0894845312449380">Mau, 2003</xref>).</p><p>Both the background and personal variables made significant contributions to the aspired educational level of adolescent girls with the background variable set making the greatest contribution. Within the background variable set, age was a significant and negative predictor variable. This finding suggests that younger students in the study aspired to higher education levels while older students aimed for lower levels of education. It is similar to the previous finding in this study that older students are more likely to strive for gender traditional careers. Again, an explanation for this result is that older students perceive more barriers to higher education than younger students. Younger students do not understand or do not yet anticipate any barriers to their career aspirations. Another explanation could be that the younger students have not spent enough time in high school to develop negative attitudes about education. As students attend higher grades, they are more likely to encounter difficult educational material that could cloud their view of their success and ability to achieve in education. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0894845312449380">Mau (2003)</xref> also found that the female students were less likely to persist in their science and engineering career aspirations over time and attributed this finding to institutional and cultural barriers that women face in educational and occupational arenas.</p><p>Academic self-efficacy was a significant predictor within the personal variable set. This result indicates that adolescent girls who have strong beliefs in their ability to succeed in academic tasks are more likely to aspire to higher education levels. Similar results have been shown in other research on self-efficacy and educational aspirations. Self-efficacy is associated with academic outcome expectations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0894845312449380">Wettersten et al., 2005</xref>) and high educational aspirations for scientific, educational, literary, and medical career pursuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0894845312449380">Bandura, Barbaranelli, Caprara, &amp; Pastorelli, 2001</xref>).</p><p>The environmental variables (parental attachment and parental support) did not demonstrate a significant influence on any of the dependent variables in the study. Although research shows that parental support and parental attachment do influence adolescent girls’ career development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0894845312449380">O’Brien, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0894845312449380">Rainey &amp; Borders, 1997</xref>), other research shows that parental variables influence self-efficacy, which in turn affects aspects of career development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0894845312449380">Ketterson &amp; Blustein, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0894845312449380">O’Brien, Friedman, Tipton, &amp; Linn, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0894845312449380">Turner &amp; Lapan, 2002</xref>). It is possible that even though parental influences were not significant in this study, they do influence adolescent girls’ career development through other variables such as self-efficacy. Additionally, it is possible that other environmental indicators besides parental interactions might demonstrate greater influence on aspects of adolescent girls’ career planning. Environmental factors such as extended family influence, teacher support, and teacher student dynamics could be explored.</p></sec><sec id="section18-0894845312449380"><title>Limitations</title><p>Several aspects of the sample population of this study should be noted when interpreting the results of this research study. Because of the school’s religious affiliation, the responses of the participants could have been influenced by their beliefs in the teachings of the religion and/or the views of the religion on women and the world of work. Additionally, the reading level of the participants in this study should be considered along with the study results. Participants were instructed to ask for assistance from their teacher if they did not understand a question, but some students may not have sought help and answered questions without fully understanding their meaning. Similarly, students who speak English as a second language may have experienced more difficulty reading and understanding the survey questions. This could have resulted in inaccurate responses in some of the surveys.</p><p>The self-report nature of the surveys should also be noted when interpreting the results of the study. Many factors such as participants’ moods, interactions with parents and teachers, and desire to please or retaliate against authority figures may have influenced their responses to the survey questions.</p><p>The indicators used in the background, personal, and environmental variable sets were selected based on their prominence in the career development literature. Other indicators that were not selected for the study could be shown to influence the career development of adolescent girls differently. Also, although the reliability of the measures used in the study was adequate, measurement error from the indicators used could have biased the results of the study. Future studies could employ measures with higher reliability or different measures altogether to represent the background, personal, and environmental variables.</p></sec><sec id="section19-0894845312449380"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The results of this study highlight the importance of adolescent girls’ backgrounds and personal attitudes or beliefs with regard to their career planning. Counselors and educators working with adolescent female populations should consider interventions designed to increase knowledge about planning for and managing multiple roles. Additionally, the finding that older students in this study had lower educational aspirations and more gender traditional career plans than the younger students suggests that interventions concerning the pursuit of higher education and the exploration of gender nontraditional careers should be aimed at younger adolescents. These interventions should also address barriers to career and education attainment since real and perceived barriers can inhibit adolescent girls’ planning for future careers. Finally, the results of this study demonstrated the importance of academic self-efficacy in adolescent girls’ gender traditionality of career choice, career commitment, and aspired education level. Findings about the importance of self-efficacy in women’s career development are consistently demonstrated in the literature, and they should be considered an important aspect of educational programming and interventions aimed at assisting adolescent girls in reaching their academic and career potential.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="conflict" id="fn1-0894845312449380"><label>Declaration of Conflicting Interests</label><p>The author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.</p></fn><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure" id="fn2-0894845312449380"><label>Funding</label><p>The author(s) received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="bibr1-0894845312449380"><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Alliman-Brisett</surname><given-names>A.
