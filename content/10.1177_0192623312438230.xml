<p>This concise volume (hardcover, 122 pp.) fills a gaping void in the existing toxicologic pathology knowledge base that is regularly encountered by pathologists, toxicologists, regulatory scientists, and basic researchers. Practitioners and consumers of the art and science of toxicologic pathology are constantly faced with reconciling the “representative” structures learned in a basic microscopic anatomy course with the range of potential variants that may be observed in a real-world setting. How does one distinguish genuine treatment-related lesions from common incidental changes in organs that diverge from the structural ideal? This reference provides an excellent source for defining the potential relevance of “normal abnormalities” when compiling pathology data sets.  </p>
<p>The text and illustrations reflect the work of 5 practicing toxicologic pathologists of international repute who among them have many decades of experience in the analysis and interpretation of tissue sections from preclinical toxicity studies. The scope is broad, as chapters cover all the major mammalian species that are employed in preclinical toxicity testing: rodents (mice, rats, guinea pigs, and hamsters), New Zealand white rabbits, beagle dogs, mini-pigs, and nonhuman primates. Furthermore, the scope is deep, and each chapter is arranged in system-specific sections that contain numerous figures, along with brief but thorough text descriptions and a solid citation list of relevant literature. Two “bonus” chapters provide a detailed cross-species comparison of age-related reproductive tract pathology for both sexes and an extensive catalog of potential histological artifacts.</p>
<p>The most critical component of any atlas is the illustrations, and in this respect the book is a valuable contribution to both art and science. All of the over 600 images are in full color, which excuses the seemingly high base price of about USD $220. Most illustrations exhibit features seen in conventional hematoxylin and eosin–stained tissue sections, although where relevant selected special stains and a few macroscopic figures have been included. Most panels are well focused, and potentially distracting artifacts such as negligible folds or small tears are infrequent. A minor disappointment is that the figures had to be kept small (2 × 2.5 in [5 × 6.5 cm]) to accommodate the 3-column format on the 8.5 × 11 in pages. However, an unforeseen advantage of the 3-column layout and small image size is that many entries include multiple illustrations to demonstrate the range of possible appearances. Furthermore, the authors have compensated for the constrained figure size by ensuring that illustrations were printed at magnifications suitable for establishing the point despite the diminutive fields of view. Another slight weakness is that the color quality varies among figures to a fair degree, even for those addressing a single topic that are shown on the same page. This criticism is trivial, however, as the quantity of illustrative material is more than adequate compensation for such negligible flaws in quality.</p>
<p>A 12.5-MB digital edition of this reference is available for Kindle viewing (base price, USD $188), which may provide several advantages to readers. First, the text is formatted as a single, double-spaced column in a large font, which should reduce the eye strain that might ensue when reading longer passages from the small-font, single-spaced print version. Second, the table of contents, figures, and in-text citations have been incorporated as hyperlinks. Finally, illustrations in the e-version are slightly larger and positioned so that they occupy the center of the page for easy viewing. Unlike the print version, the e-book has been formatted so that the font for the figure legends matches that of the main text, thus reducing a possible distraction. A trifling disadvantage of the Kindle version is that the print size will be 256 pages should one eventually decide to produce a hard copy.</p>
<p>In summary, newcomers to the field will receive the most benefit, but seasoned veterans will also profit by rediscovering many seldom-seen acquaintances and gaining a wealth of citations for further honing their skills. <italic>Background Lesions in Laboratory Animals: A Color Atlas</italic> is a timely addition to the toxicologic pathology armamentarium, and it is destined to remain a boon companion for both apprentices and adepts for many years to come.</p>
