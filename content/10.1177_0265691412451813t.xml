<p>‘Whoever fights monsters should see to it that in the process he does not become a monster’. Nietzsche’s words have powerful resonance for the Allied bombing of Germany between 1942 and 1945, which led to 600,000 civilian deaths. In February 1942, contravening the sacrosanct principles of ‘jus in bello’ which dictate that civilians should not be targeted directly, the British government decided to switch from bombing military targets in Germany to bombing German cities instead. At the heart of <italic>Terror from the Sky</italic>, as Lothar Kettenacker perceptively puts it, is the ‘total absence of recrimination about the most devastating and controversial of the bombing raids’ (215). For over half a century, Germans have struggled to come to terms with their nation’s actions during the Second World War. In Britain, by contrast, this is hardly the case. Does this merely reinforce the notion that history is a sanitized version of the past written by the ‘winners’? Or were there, in fact, sound strategic reasons for the Allied bombing campaign, meaning that it was a morally justifiable course of action? Igor Primoratz’s collection explores these questions.</p>
<p>What, then, was the logic behind Bomber Command’s campaign? Focus on military bases, it seems, were unsuccessful. German bases were carefully disguised, and even when there was a direct hit, the damage was easily repaired. By targeting German cities, Stephen Garrett explains, Bomber Command hoped to disrupt the German war effort in several ways: resources would have to be diverted from the German front to emergency relief at home; the need to reinforce anti-aircraft activity would undermine Germany’s offensive capability, and the constant raids on German cities, it was hoped, would break the will of ordinary Germans who would in turn put pressure on the Nazi government to surrender. There was also an implicit, emotive reasoning used to justify the bombing. Firstly, Germany had broken the rules of ‘just war’, first during the Blitz in 1940–41. For some, payback was then fair game. Secondly, the bombing of Germany was justified on the basis that a country which had provoked two global conflicts needed to be beaten into submission.</p>
<p>Though there were numerous reasons for the bombing on paper, examining the impact of this policy on ordinary civilians, as Martin Middlebrook and Earl R. Beck do in their contributions, reveals a rather more complex picture. In the firestorm raid on Hamburg between 27 and 28 July 1943, for example, when smoke filled air raid shelters while the houses above caught fire, Hamburgers were torn whether to stick to official advice and stay put, or to try to find safety elsewhere. Those who ventured out faced overwhelming heat, and many opted to throw themselves into nearby canals, preferring the risk of death by drowning than burning.</p>
<p>Did Allied bombing break German morale and in so doing hasten the end of the war? Primoratz argues it did not. In fact, he contends that the bombing strengthened rather than weakened the will to hold out. And yet for all that ordinary Germans continued to get on with their day-to-day lives in spite of the bombing, in reality they had little choice. Pace Primoratz, the bombing certainly contributed to a sense of war-weariness and disenchantment with the Nazi regime which had failed to protect them from the attacks. Indeed, the extensive chaos and damage caused by the Allied raids perhaps helps to explain why there was far less German resistance to the Allied occupation than was expected in Spring 1945.</p>
<p>But even if one concludes that the Allied bombing <italic>was </italic>decisive to the war’s final outcome, did the ends justify the means? Eric Markusen and David Kopf suggest not, categorizing the campaign as genocide, since it was the calculated slaughtering of masses of defenceless human beings. Primoratz too calls it ‘an unmitigated moral atrocity’. How much though, are these judgements coloured by the benefit of hindsight? The timing of the bombing is crucial to the question of morality. In 1942, the outcome of the war was far from certain. Area bombing was thought to be the only effective strategy in a legitimate war against a Fascist tyrant. By February 1945 however, the same was not true. Only two days after Roosevelt and Churchill met at the Yalta Conference to discuss how to divide up Europe after Germany’s defeat, Dresden was subject to punishing raids which left at least 25,000 Germans dead. Given the late stage in the war, it is difficult to justify the Dresden raid on strategic grounds.</p>
<p><italic>Terror from the Sky</italic> raises a number of interesting questions about the often overlooked practical and moral implications of the Allied bombing of Germany. It draws our attention to the morally contentious aspects of the campaign and explains why this subject has received so little attention up until now.</p>
