<p>Various economic and social problems have come and gone throughout American history, but one has remained present across the country and throughout the years: homelessness. During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, it was relatively common for people to migrate, constantly looking for work. This situation only increased with the Great Depression. Homelessness diminished for a few decades, but resurfaced in the 1970s. Sociologist Peter Rossi argued in 1989 that there had been a 224 percent increase in homelessness since 1975. Since the 1970s, numbers of homeless people have been increasing steadily.</p>
<p>While the problem of homelessness remains ever-present, its treatment and even definition is constantly changing. In <italic>Hobos, Hustlers and Backsliders: Homeless in San Francisco</italic>, Teresa Gowan explores how society views homelessness, as well as how the homeless view themselves. She argues that both groups switch between viewpoints of ‘sin-talk’ (homeless people bring their situation upon themselves), ‘sick-talk’ (the homeless are ill in some way and need treatment), and ‘system-talk’ (poor job markets, racism and other social institutions cause individuals to lose their homes). Gowan explores the world of homelessness from these different perspectives, studying dozens of homeless people in San Francisco. She discusses how society copes with homelessness, how the homeless spend their days, how they view themselves and are viewed, along with the difficulties they face, arguing that how our society treats its most down-and-out members reflects on its sense of community and very morality.</p>
<p><italic>Hobos, Hustlers and Backsliders</italic> is an intriguing look at homelessness, from the inside and out. Not only do we get a clearer perspective on how the general population behaves towards the homeless, we learn what the homeless think about homelessness, its causes, and its solutions.</p>
<p>One particularly enlightening piece of information Gowan imparts is a type of homeless person who does not act as a victim, but takes charge. The most clear-cut model of this is ‘the recycler’ – the homeless person who does not beg or steal for money, but instead collects recyclable items, such as glass and plastic, and sells them to a recycling company. Recycling is particularly large in California, where the 1987 ‘Bottle Bill’ instituted a recycling redemption scheme. In the next decade, over 2000 recycling centers were buying between 10 and 25 tons of recycling per week (p. 151).</p>
<p>Recycling not only gives homeless people an honest way to earn income, but allows them to develop a distinct subculture. Recyclers gain self-respect from their work. Hilario, a 23-year-old Mexican immigrant, said, ‘I can kind of lose myself in the effort. You forget everything, and it’s good for our health, you know, when you really pound the pavement. It’s your body … you realize you are strong after all. Maybe it’s going to be ok’ (p. 153). Gowan spent time with 26 recyclers in her research, and she found that many put in over 12 hours a day, taking in 200 pound loads.</p>
<p>Many of the homeless, especially the recyclers, compared themselves to hobos, the penniless migrant workers who rode the rails in the early 20th century looking for work. Gowan found that ‘recycling men all over the city claimed to be the true inheritors of the hobo dream’ (p. 165). Connecting themselves to hobos allowed the homeless to both consider themselves inheritors of a rich cultural tradition and to see themselves as honest workers, rather than sinful or sick people. Morris, a passionate ‘new hobo’ was an African American homeless man with a stutter who explained the similarities between hobos and modern homeless men. ‘We are the true hobo element,’ Morris said, ‘We do this hard, dirty work, we take too much bullshit. Or maybe, well, it’s not that c-completely, but we know if they give us bullshit that it’s their problem, you know, that they are full of shit. You know what I mean? The shame is on <italic>them</italic>. Anyone can g-go down these days. It’s like it was in my granddaddy’s time’ (p. 166).</p>
<p>Frequent emotional accounts such as these, which really reveal the thoughts and emotions of individual homeless people, make <italic>Hobos, Hustlers, and Backsliders</italic> an enlightening read. One of the homeless men Gowan spoke with, Martin, said that homelessness was easy to come by. Times were hard, and someone who might have been fine in other generations wound up on the street. His was a philosophy of system-talk. The economy, the law, and other factors were the major causes of homelessness.</p>
<p>David, a white homeless man, was another example who did not fit the sin-talk mold. He had a serious disc problem in his lower back and walked with a ‘bent-kneed, forward lean, in constant pain’ (p. 214). He worked temp jobs as a security guard and collected a few loads of recycling a week. These jobs would be hard for anyone, especially someone with an injured back. As he told it, he ended up homeless largely as a result of bad luck. ‘It’s been hard for me to find anything decent work-wise for a long time,’ he said. ‘I don’t have the right skills for what they are looking for right now. And there’s not so much I can do, with my back. I figure if you don’t have something decent going by the time you’re my age, you had better forget it’ (p. 215).</p>
<p>David’s problem was that, when times got tough, he did not have much support. He could not afford back surgery, and evidently neither the government nor his friends or family were willing or able to provide it. As a result, he did not have access to good jobs. Throw in some bad luck – Rick could not pay child support, his brother lied on a job application – and David ended up on the streets. He tried general assistance and shelter programs, but general assistance cut him off, and shelter programs, while meaning well, did not provide any clear path toward getting a home. Instead, they focused on things like addiction and anger management. This trope, of government programs using pop psychology – taking a new psychological theory and applying it to mass numbers of people without conducting any real analyses of the individuals to determine whether they fit the condition – but not really having the funds to support bringing people off the streets, is one repeated throughout <italic>Hobos, Hustlers, and Backsliders.</italic> Gowan argues that these programs focus primarily on sick-talk, which is not always the main cause of homelessness for all homeless people. She writes that many homeless people end up stuck in programs that assume their problems lie in behavioral problems rather than external factors, such as a poor job market and little family support. They end up being ‘taught’ things they already know, when they really need solid, often financial, help. Thus, Gowan believes the system – which includes things such as a bad economy, and parts that try and fail to help, such as the shelters – are responsible for many problems the homeless face.</p>
<p>Gowan often contrasts the situations of the clearly down-and-out homeless with the apparently unkind public, leaving the reader to spot the hypocrisy expressed by those unsympathetic towards the homeless. On some occasions though, she directly expresses her opinions, which, while not necessarily the most scientific approach, seems impossible to avoid with such an emotional topic.</p>
<p>According to Gowan, the 1930s</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>saw extensive efforts to study the homeless men using the categories of psychopathology. Sociologists, psychologists, ministers, and politicians discussed the best way to deal with this unruly population. For the influential psychopathologists of the day, the major causes of homelessness were alcoholism, mental instability, wanderlust, and physical and mental disability. (p. 283)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>It is a valid point. Today, we look back on the hobos of the Great Depression almost with reverence, considering them noble survivors of a terrible situation who kept on going, despite the difficulties they faced. But during the 1930s, towns put up signs stating ‘No work, no relief, keep moving’ to warn migrant workers to stay away from their towns. Such a solution was eerily similar to the one discussed in Émile Souvestre’s <italic>The World as It Shall Be</italic>, a dystopian novel published in France in 1846. In this book, the people of the year 3000 solve the tramp problem by putting up signs around towns telling the homeless to move on. They keep moving until eventually they die of starvation in ditches.</p>
<p>Such an idea seems heartless enough to be ridiculous, but it is not far from the truth. It happened in the 1930s, and in other forms, it seems to be happening in the present. Gowan argues that there are not many paths for homeless people to take towards getting homes. Few jobs are available to people without addresses or ways of maintaining hygiene.</p>
<p>During the 1980s, homeless legislation began a shift from trying to help the homeless to trying to help ordinary citizens who were bothered by the homeless. So-called ‘quality of life’ legislation was used to prevent the homeless from engaging in behaviors that irritated citizens. Increasingly, municipalities around the country have been looking at homelessness primarily as a problem for their home-owning citizens. In the late 1970s, homeowner organizations were bent on bringing down ‘loiterers’ or homeless ‘druggies’. ‘In general, the poor were increasingly treated as external threats to the social body rather than community members in need of help or integration’ (p. 55). Citizens have been demanding ‘quality of life’ legislation, which prevents citizens from having to deal with or even see the homeless in many situations. Laws are designed to prevent panhandling, stop the homeless from sleeping in public areas at night and prevent people from living in vans.</p>
<p>In the last few decades, new laws have been made to limit the activities of the homeless. According to Gowan, ‘While welfare benefits and social service provision to poor people were steadily scaled back, punitive measures against the deviant poor moved to the center of new policing philosophy’ (p. 54). Social programs to help the homeless experienced a serious decrease in quantity and funding. At the same time, laws were created against the poor, and the police were encouraged to focus on catching the poor for minor crimes, rather than paying more attention to larger scale crimes. Many policemen spent most of their time bothering the homeless, and still do. Clearance strategies have had a far larger effect on the lives the homeless than on social welfare (p. 245).</p>
<p>This area of analysis in the book would have been strengthened by further examination of police and homeowner attitudes. Gowan briefly discusses police attitudes in a few short paragraphs. She writes that ‘Some police officers seem to relish being given a mandate to clear the area of "lowlife scum"’ (p. 274). However, she mentions that Officer Vasquez did not see the point in bothering people living in vans. ‘Some of the [homeless] people are real troublemakers, you know, but most of the ones living in vans are OK,’ he said. ‘They don’t make much mess. This town is very expensive right now. It’s no wonder some guys are living out of vans’ (p. 275). Vasquez sees removing the homeless from the area as an obligation that comes with his job, not a reasonable reaction to the homeless problem. However, his earnest account is the exception. Little effort is made to explore the opinions of other players in the government or citizenry. The book focuses mostly on the point of view of the homeless, and it makes arguments on the side of the homeless. It does not really explain for more than a few sentences what the police think about having to arrest people for quietly living in vans, or how citizens were justifying their opinions (aside from the vague desire for an improved quality of life).</p>
<p>Ultimately, Gowan conducted intriguing research on the nature of homelessness. She used concepts of sick-talk, sin-talk, and system-talk to explore the causes of homelessness and explain how different parties – politicians, priests, citizens, shelter workers, and the homeless themselves – view their situation. Her discussion on recyclers, ‘new hobos’ and other homeless people who rightfully view themselves as hardworking individuals makes it impossible to see all homeless people as lazy or sinful, which is unfortunately a common public view. Gowan’s study of the history of homelessness in America makes the present clearer. It explains how subtle factors most would never connect to panhandling on the streets of San Francisco, such as the Protestant Reformation, actually led directly to modern attitudes about poverty, and thus also influenced modern action. Especially interesting is the revelation in <italic>Hobos, Hustlers, and Backsliders</italic> of the surprisingly important ‘quality of life legislation’, which relies on the assumption that the true victims of homelessness are ordinary citizens trying to enjoy their day without having to deal with homeless people. This idea seems ludicrous – obviously the homeless are more impacted by homelessness than are passing citizens – but Gowan argues that it has had more of an effect on the homeless population than most legislation intended to improve the lives of the homeless. <italic>Hobos, Hustlers, and Backsliders</italic> is an enlightening and interesting read, and it makes a strong argument that we, as a society, have a responsibility to treat all our members with respect.</p>
