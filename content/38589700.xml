               <title>Background</title>
               <p>The use of high-cost imaging has increased worldwide, contributing to increased healthcare expenditures. Without proper quality verification, the installation of used imaging equipment may lead to wasteful increases in cost due to ineffective and poor-quality imaging that requires repeat scans.</p>
            </sec>
            <sec>
               <title>Purpose</title>
               <p>To examine the relationship between the use of new or used computed tomography (CT) scanners and image retake rates to evaluate the comparative quality of used and new CT scanners.</p>
            </sec>
            <sec>
               <title>Material and Methods</title>
               <p>This was a retrospective cohort study of patients who first underwent CT from January 1 to June 30, 2008 (<italic>n</italic> = 258,572). Data were obtained by linking the Health Care Institution Registration Data with the Korean National Health Insurance Claims Database. Image retake rates within 30, 60, 90, and 180 days after the first CT scan were calculated, and differences in the image retake rate by new <italic>versus</italic> used CT scanners were assessed.</p>
            </sec>
            <sec>
               <title>Results</title>
               <p>After adjusting for confounders, use of a used CT scanner for the first scan increased the odds of retake within 30 days (odds ratio [OR]: 1.34, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.22–1.48), 60 days (OR: 1.59, 95% CI: 1.47–1.72), 90 days (OR: 1.48, 95% CI: 1.38–1.59), and 180 days (OR: 1.38, 95% CI: 1.30–1.46) compared with use of a new CT scanner. Such results were evident in scans of the spine, abdomen, chest, and face or skull base.</p>
            </sec>
            <sec>
               <title>Conclusion</title>
               <p>The quality control associated with import of used CT scanners should be improved. Moreover, regular and detailed quality inspections of used CT scanners currently operating in healthcare institutions are necessary.</p>

         <title/>
         <p>With increasing demand for cutting-edge instruments in medical services worldwide, healthcare institutions have increasingly installed medical imaging devices, and the proportion of total medical costs related to diagnostic radiology services has dramatically increased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-12-0290C1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-12-0290C2">2</xref>). This trend is notable in Korea. Computed tomography (CT) scanners installed at Korean healthcare institutions increased by a factor of 5.9, from 262 in 1990 to 1537 in 2005 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-12-0290C3">3</xref>). Korea has 35.3 CT scanners per 1 million people, 1.6 times higher than the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) average of 22.6 per million in 2010 (or the nearest year for some countries) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-12-0290C4">4</xref>). The fee-for-service system of Korean National Health Insurance (KNHI) has contributed to the preference of healthcare institutions for used high-cost devices because KNHI applies the same rate regardless of whether a medical device is new or used.</p>
         <p>The sharp increase in imported used medical devices in Korea, driven by the government's lifting of an import ban on used medical devices in 1997, has been particularly evident in hospitals and clinics with poor financial positions that preferred to purchase low-cost, used medical devices during the subsequent years of economic crisis in Korea. However, because they were imported without proper quality verification, concerns about the poor quality of these devices have persisted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-12-0290C5">5</xref>).</p>
         <p>The growing practice of installing used imaging equipment has raised suspicion as to whether this trend is associated with poor imaging performance, resulting in misdiagnosis, repeat examinations, and resultant overpayment by patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-12-0290C3">3</xref>). Additionally, unnecessary exposure to radiation from retakes, increased malignancy rates, and kidney injury secondary to the use of contrast agents are more likely to occur under these circumstances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-12-0290C6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-12-0290C10">10</xref>). Accordingly, the necessity for quality control for CT scanners, especially imported used CT scanners, has been the subject of ongoing debate in Korea.</p>
         <p>Empirical evidence on the performance of used imaging equipment is needed so that underdeveloped countries can make informed decisions as they strive to introduce more high-tech imaging equipment and so that developed countries can control lucrative use of imaging services. However, few studies providing confirmatory evidence based on comparisons of the performance of new and used CT scanners have been published. The objective of this study was to examine the relationship between the use of new or used CT scanners and image retake rates to provide information for establishing a policy on the performance criteria and quality control of used medical devices.</p>

            <p>Insurance claims for CT use submitted in 2008 were obtained from the KNHI Claims Database and linked with Health Care Institution Registration Data; instances in which CT was used for non-covered items were excluded from the analysis. In the KNHI system, physicians are required to submit claims showing medical services and prescriptions of medications for patients. Forty-nine million Koreans, 98% of the total population, are currently covered by the KNHI, and their records constitute a national database with a huge amount of health insurance claims (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-12-0290C11">11</xref>).</p>
            <p>Health Care Institution Registration Data contain information about the human resources, facilities, and medical devices in Korean healthcare institutions. According to the Enforcement Rule of the KNHI Act, a healthcare institution must report information on its human resources, facilities, and medical devices to the Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service (HIRA). The reported information is regularly verified, and any omitted information is additionally collected by the HIRA. The latest update of this database was performed in 2010.</p>

            <title>Study design and population</title>
            <p>This was a retrospective cohort study of patients who underwent CT at a hospital or clinic from January 1 to June 30, 2008, and who had no record of CT for 1 year before the first scan in 2008. They were followed up for medical utilization for 6 months after the first scan.</p>
            <p>The selection of study subjects was performed by the following process: (i) patients who underwent the first CT scan at a hospital or clinic from January 1 to June 30, 2008 (<italic>n</italic> = 299,639); (ii) patients who did not die during the 6-month follow-up period (<italic>n</italic> = 292,595); and (iii) patients whose CT scan was performed at the healthcare institution having only one CT scanner (<italic>n</italic> = 258,572).</p>
            <p>Patients who were scanned at the healthcare institution having both new and used CT scanners (<italic>n</italic> = 34,023) were excluded from analysis because we could not identify which CT scanner was used at the time.</p>

               <title>Dependent variables</title>
               <p>The primary outcome variable of this study was the CT scanning image retake rate. The image retake rate is one of the indices for evaluating the quality and cost-effectiveness of diagnostic radiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-12-0290C6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-12-0290C12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-12-0290C17">17</xref>). Despite some limitations, it is generally believed to be a valuable radiographic quality-assurance tool and is quite effective for (a) unveiling staff competency gaps, (b) planning educational strategies, (c) keeping track of patient radiation doses, (d) evaluating old and developing new examination protocols and work procedures, and (e) assessing the overall level of image quality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-12-0290C6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-12-0290C12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-12-0290C13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-12-0290C18">18</xref>).</p>
               <p>The image retake rate was calculated as a proportion of patients who underwent a CT scan again within 30, 60, 90, and 180 days after the first scan against total study subjects, but the number of image retakes were not considered here. In Taiwan, the image retake rate within 90 days is included in the evaluation criteria of healthcare institutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-12-0290C19">19</xref>).</p>
               <p>To calculate the CT retake rate for each body part, we classified the body into eight different anatomical areas (spine, abdomen, brain, chest, face or skull base, neck, upper extremity, and lower extremity) because different fees were paid based on this classification, and each healthcare provider specified the body part of interest for each CT scan in claims submitted to the KNHI program.</p>

               <title>Independent variable</title>
               <p>The primary independent variable was whether the CT scanners purchased and installed by healthcare institutions were new or used.</p>
            </sec>
         </sec>
         <sec id="s2d">
            <title>Covariates</title>
            <p>Covariates consisted of the demographic characteristics of patients and the characteristics of institutions performing the first scans. The demographic characteristics of patients included sex (male, female), age (0–19, 20–34, 35–44, 45–54, 55–64, or 65+ years), insurance coverage (NHI or Medical Aid), type of visit to the healthcare institution (inpatient or outpatient), Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI for years 2007 and 2008), surgical operation after the first scan (yes or no), and transfer to another healthcare institution after the first scan (yes or no). Transfer to another healthcare institution referred to whether the patient was referred for a transfer from the healthcare institution that performed the first CT scan. The CCI was measured in two ways: (i) the CCI for the year 2007 was based on all diagnostic information for 1 year before the first CT scan in 2008, and (ii) the CCI for the year 2008 was calculated with the diagnostic information at the time of the first CT scan. The first CT scanning institution refers to the healthcare institution that performed the first CT scan of a patient, and its characteristics included CT scanner installed (new or used scanner), years since manufacture (0–4, 5–9, or 10+ years), type of institution (hospital or clinic), and location of institution (Seoul, metropolitan area, city, or county). Years since manufacture referred to the period from the date of manufacture of the CT scanner to the first CT scan date in 2008 and was used to indicate the degree of deterioration of the scanner. A previous study reported that the competence of the doctor had an effect on the accuracy of diagnosis. Thus, the residency of a radiologist in a healthcare institution was also included in the characteristics of first CT scanning institutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-12-0290C20">20</xref>). Furthermore, because competence is understood to be related to experience, the total number of scans taken in a healthcare institution during 2008 (&lt;1000, 1000–1999, or ≥2000) was added as a variable.</p>

         <sec id="s2e">
            <title>Statistical analyses</title>
            <p>A chi-square test was performed to assess differences in the CT scan retake rate according to demographic characteristics and the characteristics of healthcare institutions that performed the first CT scan, and a multiple logistic regression analysis was performed to examine the relationship between the use of new or used CT scanners and image retake rates. The SAS statistical software (ver. 8.1 for Microsoft Windows) was used.</p>

            <title>Comparison of image retake rates according to demographic characteristics and the characteristics of first scanning institutions</title>
            <p>Of 258,572 subjects, 8.8% were rescanned within 30 days after the first scan, 10.1% within 60 days, 11.4% within 90 days, and 14.9% within 180 days (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="AR-12-0290TB1">1</xref>). A comparison by demographic characteristics of patients showed that the image retake rate was higher in men, Medical Aid recipients, inpatients, and patients who did not receive a surgical operation after the first scan. The image retake rate increased with increasing age and disease severity. The rate was markedly high (over 50%) in patients who were transferred to another healthcare institution after the first scan.

            <p>We found no major difference in the image retake rate based on whether a new or used CT scanner was used at the first scan, except that CT scanners had a slightly higher retake rate at 0–4 years after manufacture. The retake rate was higher in patients first scanned at institutions with a resident radiologist and institutions in a county location, and it was lower in patients first scanned at institutions that performed 2000 or more CT scans in 2008.</p>

            <p>In a multiple logistic regression analysis, patients who were first scanned by a used CT scanner had increased odds of retake within 60 days (OR: 1.05, 95% CI: 1.01–1.08), 90 days (OR: 1.05, 95% CI: 1.02–1.08), and 180 days (OR: 1.06, 95% CI: 1.03–1.09) compared with patients who were first scanned by a new CT scanner (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="AR-12-0290TB2">2</xref>). Moreover, patients first scanned for the spine and abdomen with a used CT scanner had higher odds of retake compared with those first scanned with a new CT scanner.

Compared with patients first scanned using a new CT scanner, patients first scanned using a used CT scanner had increased odds of retake within 30 days (OR: 1.34, 95% CI: 1.22–1.48), 60 days (OR: 1.59, 95% CI: 1.47–1.72), 90 days (OR: 1.48, 95% CI: 1.38–1.59), and 180 days (OR: 1.38, 95% CI: 1.30–1.46). Such results were evident in scans of the spine, abdomen, chest, and face or skull base.

         <p>Recently, many countries have addressed the unnecessary or excessively profitable use of high-cost imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-12-0290C21">21</xref>). In Korea, it has been suspected that profitable use of used scanners has contributed to the growing unnecessary use of imaging services.</p>
         <p>The Health Care Institution Registration Data shows that 2001 CT scanners were located in 1644 healthcare institutions in Korea in 2008. A total of 71.7% were installed and operated in hospitals (excluding general and university hospitals) and clinics (793 in hospitals and 641 in clinics). Of 735 used CT scanners purchased by Korean healthcare institutions, 93.9% (<italic>n</italic> = 690) were installed in hospitals and clinics (398 in hospitals, 292 in clinics). This means that half of the CT scanners operated in hospitals and clinics were used ones. The average number of years since the manufacture of used CT scanners was 9.1, which is more than the average of 4.9 years for new CT scanners. Of the total used CT scanners 35.8%, had been used for 10 or more years since manufacture compared with 12.5% of the total new CT scanners.</p>
         <p>The higher installation rate of used CT scanners at hospitals and clinics is attributable to the fact that many hospitals and clinics that suffered from the economic crisis in the late 1990s purchased low-priced, imported, used medical devices without proper quality verification after an import ban on used medical devices was lifted in January 1997. Despite the fact that the price of equipment is quite different by model and specification, the same fee-for-service (FFS) rate applies regardless of whether a medical device is new or used. Accordingly, an increasing number of healthcare institutions, especially hospitals and clinics with poor financial positions, have tended to install low-cost, imported, used CT scanners so that they can recover their capital expenditure and create profits as early as possible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-12-0290C5">5</xref>).</p>
         <p>According to a survey of the image quality of radiological examinations conducted in Korea in 2000, one in four CT scanners (25.4%, 175/689) operated in medical institutions produced poor-quality images that were worthless as precision diagnostic data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-12-0290C22">22</xref>). In the survey, all study scans were rated on six parameters: (i) intravenous contrast enhancement, (ii) oral contrast, (iii) window setting, (iv) presence of artifact, (v) visualization of fine anatomical structures, and (vi) other, by the consensus of two abdominal radiologists using a five-point scale (1 = worst, 5 = best). Using these parameters, scans were determined to be non-diagnostic if the sum of the six ratings was less than 20, given a total possible score of 30.</p>
         <p>This survey also found that the performance of CT scanners installed in clinics were poorer than were those in general or university hospitals: the worthless image rate was reportedly 68.7% in radiology clinics, 39.7% in clinics excluding radiology clinics, 25.7% in general hospitals, and 5.6% in university hospitals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-12-0290C22">22</xref>). When the satisfaction with new or used CT scanners was investigated in 309 healthcare institutions, high satisfaction was expressed for the durability, performance, and ease of operation of new equipment, but not for the price. In contrast, satisfaction with used equipment was low, with the exception of price (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-12-0290C5">5</xref>). Overall, the quality of CT scanners installed in hospitals and clinics is believed to be unsatisfactory, and one of the causes is the installation of used CT scanners. The quality of used CT scanners has been a continuing concern, but few studies have directly addressed this issue. Thus, our study attempted to evaluate the quality of used CT scanners installed in hospitals and clinics using the image retake rate as a measure of scanner performance.</p>
         <p>The image retake rate can be influenced by the characteristics of patients or of healthcare providers (doctors or healthcare institutions) as well as by the quality of medical devices. Studies have reported that the image retake rate differed with age, sex, and disease severity of patients, and varied depending upon the competence of the radiologist and the type of hospital (local or university hospital) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-12-0290C6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-12-0290C8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-12-0290C12">12</xref>). Our study showed similar results: the image retake rate was high in men, Medical Aid recipients, inpatients, and patients who were transferred to another institution after the first CT scan. The image retake rate increased with increasing age and disease severity. Additionally, the rate differed depending on whether a radiologist was in residence at the institution and the type and location of the healthcare institution. After adjusting for these variables, comparison of new and used CT scanners revealed that the image retake rate was higher in patients first scanned using a used scanner than in patients first scanned using a new scanner. In particular, patients who first underwent a scan of the spine and abdomen with a used CT scanner had higher odds of retake for the same body part than did those using a new scanner.</p>
         <p>Our study showed that patients who were transferred to another healthcare institution after the first CT scan had a higher retake rate. This may have occurred because the healthcare institution to which the patient was transferred had to retake the CT scan due to the poor image quality of the first scan; however, we cannot rule out the possibility that the healthcare institution had a policy to retake CT scans of transferred patients regardless of the image quality of the first scan in order to increase revenue. Therefore, for a clearer understanding of a CT scanner's quality, it is necessary to evaluate image retakes within a healthcare institution.</p>
         <p>From such a viewpoint, we analyzed the image retake rate of patients who underwent CT scans at the same healthcare institution without a referral to transfer and without transferring themselves to another healthcare institution. Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that, compared with patients scanned with a new scanner, patients scanned with a used scanner had 1.34-fold higher odds of retake within 30 days, 1.59-fold higher odds of retake within 60 days, 1.48-fold higher odds of retake within 90 days, and 1.38-fold higher odds of retake within 180 days. Such results were evident in scans of the spine, abdomen, chest, and face or skull base.</p>
         <p>Our study has some limitations. First, we could not clearly determine the causes of image retakes based on information from the KNHI Claims Database and Health Care Institution Registration Data. Possible reasons include poor CT scanner quality, patient request, the policy of the healthcare institution, poor radiology staff skills, or the treatment-outcome tracking process. Further investigations of the medical records of patients or other data are required to resolve this issue. Nevertheless, our method of evaluating the quality of used CT scanners is reasonable because our study took into account the characteristics of patients and CT scanning institutions, which constitute potential factors influencing the image retake rate.</p>
         <p>Second, we did not include all patients who first underwent a CT scan at hospitals and clinics in Korea in the first half of 2008. We also had to exclude patients who first underwent a CT scan at the healthcare institution that had both new and used CT scanners due to the limitation of data. However, these excluded patients accounted for only approximately 10% of the total subject pool, and thus our study did not encounter a problem with respect to the representativeness of the sample.</p>
         <p>Third, this study calculated four types of image retake rates according to different time periods (within 30, 60, 90, and 180 days) after initial examinations were performed on a given person. The time period of 90 days has been considered by an informal consensus of a multidisciplinary group of local experts to represent a broad window of time in which a repeat examination may be potentially relevant to the same episode of care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-12-0290C23">23</xref>). However, the retake rate within 180 days may more likely reflect clinically required follow-up studies rather than unnecessary, redundant examinations. Longer-term in-depth investigations that involve the review of medical records are needed to address problems associated with the quality of equipment and to control for the prevalence of necessary follow-up examinations in retake rates.</p>
         <p>Fourth, we did not consider whether each CT scan was performed with or without contrast material. An initial CT scan without contrast would be likely to be followed by subsequent CT scans with contrast; this can be another reason for CT retakes. Thus, not considering the use of contrast may increase the retake rates attributable to the poor quality of equipment.</p>
         <p>However, even if information on the use of contrast were available, we could not be sure that those subsequent CT scans resulted not from the poor quality of CT scanners but rather from other unconnected reasons. Thus, we see no serious problem with comparing the level of retake rates between new and used CT scanners. Additionally, the KNHI program reimburses only contrast CT scans when a clinician simultaneously submits a claim for an initial CT scan without contrast and a subsequent CT scan with contrast. We think that this would reduce the possibility of the aforementioned increase in CT scans for reasons other than poor quality. Nevertheless, further analyses separating CT scans with and without contrast are needed to measure retake rates more accurately.</p>
         <p>Despite these limitations, this study is meaningful in that patients who first underwent a CT scan in the first half of 2008 were followed up for medical utilization for 6 months after the first scan to calculate the image retake rate. Furthermore, the quality of used CT scanners was evaluated, which has rarely been attempted, taking into account potential confounding factors that might influence the retake rate of CT scans.</p>
         <p>In conclusion, after adjusting for various confounding factors, the retake rate of CT scans was higher in patients scanned with a used CT scanner than in patients scanned with a new CT scanner, justifying concerns about the quality of imported used CT scanners. Therefore, strengthened quality verification needs to be imposed on the import of used CT scanners, and regular and detailed quality inspection of used CT scanners currently operating in hospitals and clinics is necessary. Additionally, regular monitoring of scanning volume or image retake rates at healthcare institutions with a CT scanner is recommended to allow for implementation of an education program for equipment operating staff; this would prevent patients from unnecessarily paying additional medical costs or being exposed to health risks caused by unnecessary retakes.</p>
