<abstract>
<p>This article examines violence against racialized women in North America and how this violence is obscured through liberal conceptualizations of violence. I focus on cases of interracial stranger attacks of Asian women and girls by men. I contend that these cases – that range from homicide, sexual assault, prowl by night, to tampering with a food product – are connected and are local manifestations of national and global power relations. I end by foregrounding how some of the non-Asian men targeting Asian women are men of colour. I argue that this violence is an assertion of the right to place and space in both national and global hierarchies informed by the neoliberal uplift of elite Asian men and capital, and western constructions of the Asia Pacific century. In highlighting the specificities of Asian gendered difference, the intent is less to include Asian women in theorizing on violence, and more to examine how an intersectional, relational, historically specific and structural analysis of gendered violence brings into clearer view the systems of domination that violence secures.</p>

<p>The majority of anti-violence scholarship and activism on racialized women and girls in North America is limited to examinations of heterosexual violence within racialized communities, or on what racialized men and boys do to racialized women and girls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0964663912443919">Jiwani, 2006</xref>: Chapter 5). Many anti-racist and postcolonial feminists assert that what appear as attempts at cultural sensitivity in a multicultural context are often a form of culturalized racism that utilizes colonial and imperial constructs of women’s rights and victimization. Unlike violence against white women and girls, which is often deemed exceptional in legal and public discourse, the violence of minority communities is viewed as endemic. In western judicial and public discourse the cause of the violence against white women and girls by white men is often individualized as pathological men and/or deviant, not-quite-pure women, while the cause of the violence of the Other is the collective cultural and religious difference of their communities and nations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0964663912443919">Jiwani, 2006</xref>: 205–206; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0964663912443919">Mohanty, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0964663912443919">Smith, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0964663912443919">Volpp, 2001</xref>: 1187). Absent in these formulations where violence is seen as resulting from the misogyny of ‘traditional’, non-western, less democratic men, cultures and nation-states are structural considerations regarding the violence systemic to white settler nation-building, global migration, capitalism and everyday and structural forms of racism and sexism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0964663912443919">Jiwani, 2005</xref>: 852).</p>
<p>This paper draws on critical race feminist and postcolonial feminist scholarship to examine how race, gender, class, sexuality, nation and global economy inform both the violence done to racialized women in North America and how this violence is obscured and erased through liberal conceptualizations of violence. I address this issue by focusing on what a number of scholars and activists contend is a common, yet significantly under-theorized event in the lives of Asian females in the west: targeted stranger attacks by both white and non-Asian men of colour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0964663912443919">Cho, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0964663912443919">Robinson, 2005</xref>: 33–34; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0964663912443919">Zia, 2000</xref>: 541).</p>
<p>My intent in highlighting the specificities of Asian women is less to include Asian women in anti-violence theorizing and activism – by destabilizing the white heterosexual able-bodied, urban woman subject who is at the centre of much anti-violence work – but rather to examine how an intersectional, relational, historically specific and structural analysis of gendered violence brings into clearer view the systems of domination that violence secures. I investigate how a fully contextualized analysis of these acts of violence assists in complicating the targeted/random, stranger/interpersonal, public/private, collective/individual, everyday/structural, gendered violence/racial violence and local/global dichotomies that categorize legal and public framings of violence. Thus, in examining cases of interracial heterosexual violence<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0964663912443919">1</xref>
</sup> against Asian women in North American public and private spaces, I draw on scholarship on masculinities, and on western anxieties surrounding Asia’s recent geo-political and economic ascendancy, as well as work on gendered, racialized and sexualized violence.</p>
<p>I begin by providing a brief overview of the research on violence against indigenous and racialized women in North America. I emphasize how gendered and sexualized violence is historically contingent, and both constitutes and is constituted by colonial and racial violence. Drawing on Andrea <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0964663912443919">Smith’s (2006)</xref> work on the ‘three pillars of white supremacy,’ I underscore how women are racialized differently to uphold white patriarchal supremacy. I move on to focus on the peculiarities of Asian female difference in white settler space in the contemporary neoliberal moment. I document cases of interracial heterosexual violence against Asian females in North America and contend that these cases – that range from homicide, sexual assault and breaking and entering, to tampering with a food product – should be conceptualized as connected, and as local manifestations of national and global power relations. I end by foregrounding a thus far neglected aspect of the already limited scholarship on violence against racialized women in North America: some of the non-Asian men targeting Asian women are not white, but are men of colour. I argue that these acts of violence should be viewed not only as what white and non-Asian men of colour do to hypersexualized and hyperfeminized Asian women, but also in line with the theorizing on racial violence as an aspect of relations between men. The violence of white men and non-Asian men of colour against Asian women in North America should be understood in relation to the west’s deep hostility for, and admiration of, Asian men, nations and economies in the context of western constructs of Asia rising and the Asia Pacific century. I propose that through violence against Asian women, both white and non-Asian men of colour may express their anxieties regarding western male decline in the face of Asian foreign capital and bodies, and thereby support what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0964663912443919">Lake and Reynolds (2008</xref>: 12) refer to as the ‘transnational community of white men’. By upholding white male supremacy, men of colour simultaneously assert their dominance as western men and as men living in the west, and sustain their subordination as racialized men who are prime targets of the violence underpinning white supremacist societies.</p>

<title>Indigenous and Racialized Women in North America and Violence</title>
<p>What and who gets conceptualized and punished as violent is largely contingent upon the ways that hierarchical relations can be maintained and naturalized. Historical as well as ongoing slavery, genocide and colonialism, and the incarceration, banishment and violation of indigenous and racialized groups on reservations, in prisons, and in immigration detention centres and camps were, and are, primarily viewed, in dominant legal and public discourse, as necessary to build and protect the nation, its citizens, and increasingly, civilization and democracy. These practices are rarely categorized as murder, kidnapping, indentured labour, abuse, rape and torture (Heberle and Grace, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0964663912443919">2009</xref>: 4; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0964663912443919">Jiwani, 2006</xref>: 18–19, 23, 30–31; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0964663912443919">Smith, 2005</xref>: 30). In the North American context, white elite men have been, and still are, by and large, the ones who define legitimate and illegitimate violence, inflict it on others, are free from having it inflicted on them, and are least likely to be held accountable for the violence they commit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0964663912443919">Collins, 1998</xref>). The violence that indigenous and racialized women experience is minimized, unrecognized or hypersensationalized as intraracial violence (such as domestic violence or human trafficking). Their race and gender positions them outside the parameters of normative personhood and victimhood; the legitimate and normative human and citizen is the white elite man and the normative victim is the white elite woman (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0964663912443919">Larcombe, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0964663912443919">Nagel, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0964663912443919">Wilcox, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>The dominance of single-cause explanations of violence in legal and public discourse obscures the context that informs indigenous and racialized women’s susceptibility to, experience of violence, as well as social responses to it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0964663912443919">Marchetti, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0964663912443919">Volpp, 2001</xref>: 1200–1201). By and large, incidents of targeted violence are categorized as racial, ethnic and religious violence, violence against women, or homophobic violence. Conceptualizing violence through discrete, unitary identities and systems renders incomprehensible the extent to which, as stated by Gail <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0964663912443919">Mason (2002</xref>: 61), ‘categories of gender, race and/or sexuality … are the “vehicles of articulation” for each other’. Race, sexuality and class do not simply complicate gendered violence; gendered violence is racialized and classed, and racial and colonial violence is sexualized and gendered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0964663912443919">Smith, 2005</xref>: 151). Race, for example, informs rape in legal discourse, whether the rape is interracial or intraracial, even when the rape is that of a white woman by a white man. It does so because the normative rape script, which frames how rape is understood, involves tropes of white female purity (classed and heterosexualized) and racialized male criminality (classed and heterosexualized) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0964663912443919">Razack, 1994</xref>: 899–900).</p>
<p>While often unacknowledged as violence, racialized and gendered sexual violence has been and is the norm in white settler societies; it is central to the day-to-day maintenance of ongoing colonialism and the racial hierarchy of citizenship that underpins white settler societies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0964663912443919">Razack, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0964663912443919">Rodriguez, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0964663912443919">Smith, 2005</xref>). The legalized rape of black female slaves by their white masters during American slavery served as an important vehicle for white men to dominate black women (as well as black men and white women). The lynching of black men for allegedly raping white females in the Reconstruction South contained white fears of the perceived threat of black resurrection in the absence of legalized slavery. The myths of the always willing black female who cannot be raped, of uncontrollable black male sexuality, and of white female fragility, asserted patriarchal, racist and class-based constructions of morality, and restricted black socio-economic and political mobility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0964663912443919">Nagel, 2003</xref>: Chapter 4). Similarly, the myths of indigenous women as immoral, sexually loose ‘squaws’, and of indigenous men as savage brutes who kidnap white women, diverted attention from the brutal violence whites and white supremacist societies were routinely committing and continue to commit against indigenous people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0964663912443919">Baker, 2007</xref>: 327–329).</p>
<p>The crimes deemed most objectionable and deserving of attention largely conform to racialized, gendered and heterosexualized scripts involving criminal men of colour, victimized white women and children, and heroic white males who take up the cause of protecting their women, children and nation. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0964663912443919">Irving (2008</xref>) contrasts the hysteria surrounding the 1989 New York City rape of the Central Park jogger, a white female investment banker, allegedly by a group of young black and Latino men, with the scant attention paid to another crime the same day, the rape of a young black woman who was subsequently thrown off the roof of a four-story building. The latter and the hundreds of rapes in New York City the previous year garnered minimal attention, whereas the violence done to the Central Park jogger was utilized by white elite men to reassert control of the city through discourses of threat and security (Irving, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0964663912443919">2008</xref>: 110). Paul Bernardo and Karla Holmolka – a young, middle-class, white couple – are notorious for the rapes and murders of young white females in Ontario, Canada in the 1990s, whereas the hundreds of missing and murdered indigenous women across Canada were largely dismissed as unworthy of attention for decades (Razack, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0964663912443919">2000</xref>: 106). Although western criminal justice systems, public authorities and the media tend to construct white, middle-class, married, (sub)urban, heterosexual women as rape victims (Volpp, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0964663912443919">2001</xref>: 1200–1201), indigenous women in the United States are more likely than other women to be sexually assaulted, and twice as likely as any other group of men and women to be the victims of violent crime. Unlike black and white women who are primarily attacked by members of their own race, over 60 per cent of the attacks on indigenous women are by whites (Baker, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0964663912443919">2007</xref>: 329; Smith, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0964663912443919">2005</xref>: 26, 28).</p>
<p>Differential racialization and the intersection of race, gender, class, citizenship, disability, sexuality, and so forth, produce diverse forms of violence against differently situated women. Andrea <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0964663912443919">Smith (2006</xref>: 67) clarifies that white patriarchal supremacy is best understood as ‘constituted by separate and distinct but still interrelated, logics’. Within what she terms as the ‘three pillars of white supremacy’, black people are confined within the logic of ‘Slavery/Capitalism’ as bodies that are inherently enslaveable, and thus are property. Indigenous people are, within the logic of ‘Genocide/Colonialism’, people who must disappear and are always disappearing. Both groups fall outside the realm of universal justice; blacks are marked for exploitation whereas indigenous people’s continual death is necessary to reinforce non-indigenous claims to and exploitation of indigenous land, resources and cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0964663912443919">Smith, 2006</xref>: 67–68). While slave owners raped black women to reproduce a slave population, the rape of indigenous women by white settler men supported Blood Quantum laws in the United States and Indian Act laws in Canada aimed at eliminating the existence of indigenous peoples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0964663912443919">Smith, 2005</xref>: 15–16).</p>
<p>Framed by the third pillar of ‘Orientalism/War’, Asians are not property or those who must disappear; Asians are forever foreign and suspect internal and external enemies. Historically, Asian exclusion laws were passed in North America to benefit from the exploitation of cheap Asian male labour while severely restricting permanent settlement. Wives and daughters in particular were disallowed entry in order to prevent the formation of communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0964663912443919">Dua, 2007</xref>). Much of the violence committed against Asian women and men, historically and in contemporary times, is premised on white anxieties surrounding foreign intrusion and the loss of white economic and political domination at the hands of an irrevocably alien, less entitled people. While the logic of enslaveability is the bedrock of capitalism, and the logic of the disappearing ‘Indian’ is required for colonialism, the logic of the foreign threat legitimates war and imperialism. War is normalized through the threat of foreign and immigrant non-white Others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0964663912443919">Smith, 2006</xref>: 69).</p>
<p>As the bodies that justify war and imperialism, the Oriental Others are, unlike black and indigenous people, defined as part of a civilization that is capable of challenging the west. I propose that this particular configuration of Asian difference as viable competition – exotic, inferior and yet civilized and modern – underpins the extent to which Asian women are characterized as passive, in need of domination, and eager to please. In other words, western constructions of the possibility of Asian male and economic domination of the west shapes and requires Asian women’s (and men’s) hyperfeminization. In relation to white women and other women of colour, Asian women are hyperpassified as ‘low-maintenance wives’ (Smith <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0964663912443919">2005</xref>: 29, citing Tadiar), and hypersexualized as ‘sexually experienced whores’ (Gossett and Byrne, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0964663912443919">2002</xref>: 703). These representations of the Asian woman frame her exploitability and make her, as Sumi Cho (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0964663912443919">2003</xref>) argues, particularly vulnerable to racialized sexual harassment (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0964663912443919">Pyke and Johnson, 2003</xref>: 45–46).</p>
<p>Significant research exists on the production of gendered and racialized images of Asian females in western mass media and popular culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0964663912443919">Marchetti, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0964663912443919">Prasso, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0964663912443919">Yamamoto, 2000</xref>). A few texts highlight how these representations are tied to interracial violence against Asian women who are in the west as, for example, mail-order brides and domestic workers (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0964663912443919">Cunneen and Stubbs, 2000</xref>). Esther <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0964663912443919">Chen (1997</xref>), like <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0964663912443919">Cho (2003</xref>), emphasizes everyday forms of gendered and racialized violence and focuses on racialized sexual harassment in the workplace, in schools and on the street. Centring pornography, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0964663912443919">Zia (2000)</xref> links the 1985 rape and hanging of eight-year-old Chinese American Jean Har-Kaw Jewel to a <italic>Penthouse</italic> magazine pictorial of young Asian women being tortured, bound and hung from trees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0964663912443919">Zia, 2000</xref>: 542). As I will expand on in the last section of this paper, the above research alludes to how these representations and acts of violence are tied to western involvement in war and conquest in Asia. In the following section, I document cases of racialized and sexualized targeted stranger violence against Asian women in North America, garnered through newspaper and internet searches, in order to frame them as connected, and to highlight how they reveal the necessity of broadening current explanatory understandings of violence.<sup>

<title>Documenting Interracial Heterosexual Violence Against Asian Women</title>
<p>There are a number of cases in North America where non-Asian men are known to have targeted or mainly targeted Asian women for various forms of sexualized violence. In presenting these cases together, I problematize their misrecognition as disconnected acts of violence against women who are at times also named as Asian.</p>
<p>In the Greater Toronto Area, in 2002, Guyanian-born Stuart Cameron was found guilty of the attempted murder in 2000 of Theresa Wu and the murder of her sister Tina Wu, in what police consider an attempted sexual assault and robbery. Cameron had sexually assaulted and robbed two other Chinese women in two separate incidents the previous year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0964663912443919">Lin, 2004</xref>). The following year, in 2001, Toronto police unsuccessfully searched for a male offender who sexually assaulted 11 Asian women in a west-end neighbourhood. The victims were Chinese, Korean, Filipina and Vietnamese women between the ages of 20 and 35 years. He is described as a white male in his thirties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0964663912443919">Alcoba, 2001</xref>). More recently, in 2010, Toronto police arrested Jeffrey Fraser for a series of University of Toronto student residence break-ins, in which a man engaged the women in a sexual conversation and then fled the scene. Most of the women were young and Asian (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0964663912443919">

<p>Outside of the province of Ontario, police in Calgary, Alberta, charged David Gould in 2001 with the rapes of five Japanese women attending Mount Royal College and the University of Calgary. Gould identified his victims by speaking to Asian women in his limited Japanese (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0964663912443919">City of Calgary, 2001</xref>). A number of cases have also occurred in the lower mainland of British Columbia, including Leonardo da Vancouver, who was incarcerated for a series of sexual assaults against Asian women and girls in the early 2000s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0964663912443919">
<italic>Vancouver Sun</italic>, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>South of the border, in Spokane, Washington, two men and one woman all pleaded guilty to the abduction and rape of two Japanese women in 2000. They chose Japanese English-as-a-Foreign-Language students because they believed they would not report the crimes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0964663912443919">Woan, 2008</xref>: 295–296). Also in Washington state, between August 2006 and May 2008 there were at least 23 sexual attacks of Asian women and girls in Seattle. The suspect is a black man in his twenties or thirties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0964663912443919">Sullivan, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>In the state of California, Oakland police officer Richard Valerga was sentenced to six months’ incarceration for illegal traffic stops on 18 Asian American women in 2004 and 2005. Valerga stopped the women and then sexually harassed or assaulted them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0964663912443919">Lee, 2006</xref>). In 2009 Tyreese Lamar Reed, a 32-year-old black male, was sentenced to 150 years for crimes related to his sexual assaults and robberies of 21 Asian women in the Koreatown area of Los Angeles in 2004 and 2005 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0964663912443919">Blankstein, 2009</xref>). Also in 2009, Thomas James Parker, a 39-year-old white male, was arrested for six attacks on Asian women in San Diego from June 2008 to May 2009 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0964663912443919">Sierra and Kucher, 2009</xref>). In a still unsolved case, police have linked 10 rapes since 1991 to a person referred to as the Northern California rapist. His first two victims were white, while the remaining victims were Asian women in their twenties. Surveillance footage shows a short, heavyset, white man in his thirties or forties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0964663912443919">Geissinger, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>In a 2004 case that galvanized the Asian American community in Chicago and the surrounding area, Mark Anthony Lewis, a black man in his thirties, was found guilty of sexual assault, home invasion and robbery involving eight Asian women and one Latina woman over a three-month period in 2000 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0964663912443919">Esguerra, 2003</xref>: 423). In another prominent case in 2005, Michael Lohman, a white male Princeton University doctoral student, was arrested for sex-related crimes against over 80 Asian women on the Princeton University campus. He cut locks of hair, poured his semen and urine into their beverages, and onto their bodies. He was charged with reckless endangerment, tampering with a food product, harassment and theft (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0964663912443919">Woan, 2008</xref>: 294–295).</p>
<p>These cases cover a broad spectrum of sexualized violence. The women and girls are diverse in ethnicity, age, citizenship and immigration status, English language proficiency, class, and so forth, and the crimes took place in two countries with significant differences. However, my particular concern is that all of the above cases involve targeted violence by a non-Asian male who appears to mainly or only target Asian females, in the context of white settler states with relatively similar histories of Asian selective inclusion as well as contemporary discourses of Asia rising. This dynamic may shed light on studies that reveal that Asians in the United States, like indigenous people, but unlike blacks and whites, are most often attacked by non-Asians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0964663912443919">Woan, 2008</xref>: 297).<sup>

</p>
<p>While race is central to these crimes, the race or ethnicity of the victims is only sporadically mentioned. Princeton University’s official public safety announcement did not mention that Lohman’s victims were all Asian women. When race is presented, it is inserted as part of the details of a case, but without elaboration. In the case of the Wu sisters, the police and the media acknowledged that all four of Stuart Cameron’s victims were Asian women, but then continued to caution all women living in a particular area of Toronto to be vigilant. In the Cameron case, race was acknowledged as being part of the crimes but racism was not a category of discussion.</p>
<p>In a similar way, judicial and media texts in these cases only sporadically refer to the race of the perpetrator and only as one of the details of the crime (along with the location, day and time of the incident), that is in a way devoid of social relations. Unlike the race of the victims, however, the race of the perpetrator is ignored or presumed to be white by community organizations and feminist scholars and activists. In attempting to re-categorize these types of cases as racially motivated hate crimes (as well as gendered sex crimes), Asian American activists tend to utilize the dominant framing of interracial violence as simply anti-Asian racism, even when it is commonly known that the perpetrator is a non-Asian man of colour. While scholars note that not all of the non-Asian men who desire or are violent towards Asian women are white, all neglect to account for how disparately positioned men perform and sustain white heteropatriarchal supremacy differently through acts of violence against women (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0964663912443919">Chin, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0964663912443919">Esguerra, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0964663912443919">Robinson, 2005</xref>: 23; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0964663912443919">Zia, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Elizabeth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0964663912443919">Stanko (2001</xref>) prefers the term targeted violence rather than hate crime, since targeted violence recognizes the contextual disadvantage of the victim in relation to the perpetrator without restricting the disadvantage to a particular category such as race, religion, or sexuality. She argues that the relationship between the victim and the perpetrator is ‘situationally relationed’ and that ‘vulnerability is structurally determined by the multiple of vulnerabilities/advantages victims and perpetrators have in relation to each other’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0964663912443919">Stanko, 2001</xref>: 318–319). Targeted violence suggests that an attacker harms a particular ‘situationally relationed’ person in a specific manner because of who the victim is or is believed to be. The perpetrator does so because he is part of a collective that has adequate resources, and has received sufficient messages that the violence is legitimate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0964663912443919">Stanko, 2001</xref>: 318). What then informs relations between Asian women and white men in North America, as well as Asian women and non-Asian men of colour in North America, and how are the two relations similar and distinct? How does the logic of Orientalism/War shape these performances of racialized masculinities in the contemporary neoliberal context?</p>

<title>Asian Women, White Western Masculinity and Global Conquest</title>
<p>In their study of internet rape pornography, Gossett and Byrne (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0964663912443919">2002</xref>) found that in images where the race of the rape victim could be discerned, the majority were young Asian women (2002: 698–699). They surmise that Asian women’s overrepresentation in internet rape pornography is due to gendered Orientalist representations of Asian females as hyperservile and hypersexual. What distinguishes Asian women from heteronormative constructs of white women and other women of colour is their presumed enjoyment of subjugation and domination (and thus perpetual consent to sex) (see also Woan, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0964663912443919">2008</xref>: 23). Nonetheless, Gossett and Byrne (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0964663912443919">2002</xref>) note that the images do not depict what one would presume, an exoticized passivity. The images of Asian women in rape pornography are associated with torture and the women’s faces express pain and horror (2002: 701–703). Asian women’s acquiescence to male will may be implicit in rape pornography depicting Asian women. However, these images are, first and foremost – as, I would argue, are the cases of interracial violence documented above – ones of collective, relational violence and domination. As such, they reflect and support white men’s efforts to dominate not only Asian women, but women and racialized minorities in general, as well as white women and Asian men in particular.</p>
<p>Liz Philipose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0964663912443919">2007</xref>), using the work of Sironi and Branche, stresses that torture is not about destroying an individual’s defences; it is violence intended to defeat a group and nation. Torture is not meant to make people reveal themselves and their knowledge; it is meant to keep them quiet, and render them isolated and humiliated (Philipose, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0964663912443919">2007</xref>: 1064–1065). The humiliation and silencing is directed towards the group(s) the individual represents, rather than the individual herself. Rather than being seen as a man’s desire to dominate a particular group of women because of Orientalist cultural misrepresentations, acts of violence against Asian women become ‘performative means by which relationships of structural inequality are ensured’ (Ahmed, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0964663912443919">2001</xref>: 348–349). In other words – as violence and desire are racialized, gendered, classed and sexualized – targeted stranger violence against Asian women in the west is part of how the boundaries of race, gender, class and sexuality are constituted and reinforced (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0964663912443919">Agathangelou and Ling, 2004</xref>: 536). The violence is part of how white hegemonic masculinity is supported in white settler states, since heterosexual masculinity, racial anxieties and national anxieties are inseparable. P<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0964663912443919">hilipose (2007</xref>: 1067) states it well: ‘racialized anxieties are national anxieties, and if we take the nation as the embodiment of masculine values of virility and potency …, these are also anxieties about the state of masculinity in the twenty-first-century …’. Asian women play a starring role in assisting disaffected (white heterosexual) men assert their masculinity in a women’s movement, post-civil rights, and ‘Asia rising’ era.</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0964663912443919">Hobbs, Na Pattalung and Chandler (2011</xref>) contend that western men travel to Thailand as sex tourists to (re)construct, (re)affirm and (re)establish their masculinity (2011: 89–90). Less able to enjoy their masculinity at home amidst the formal legitimation of rights-seeking minority groups (albeit tenuous and limited), western men travel to Asia to be men with Othered women who are structurally and ideologically exploitable. This narrative of decline that haunts white western masculinity is prevalent in predatory heterosexuality. In his provocative essay on how the logics of hunting by North American white men mirror the logics of predatory heterosexuality, Brian <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0964663912443919">Luke (1998</xref>) reveals that men who rape often report feeling threatened by their victim, and define the rape as permissible revenge and the restoration of lost control (1998: 633). Importantly, white men’s violence against Asian women restores lost control by attacking women meant to be impregnated, protected and provided for by Asian men and nations (irrespective of the woman’s citizenship and history in the west). This emasculinization of Asian men and nations asserts a global, imperial colour line as well as a national, colonial colour line (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0964663912443919">Philipose, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>In 1910, W.E.B. DuBois announced the emergence of a transnational whiteness. DuBois stated, ‘the world, in a sudden emotional conversion, has discovered that it is white, and, by that token, wonderful’ (quoted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0964663912443919">Lake and Reynolds, 2008</xref>: 1–2). In the face of the rise of the ‘tide of colour’ in a neo-colonial era, and the mass migration of colour to the new world, white elite men in Canada, the United States, Australia, Britain and South Africa supported each others’ efforts to solidify the dominance of a newly constituted whiteness (Lake and Reynolds, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0964663912443919">2008</xref>: 184–209). At the turn of the twenty-first century there is a renewed reassertion of transnational whiteness through constructs of western civilization and the clash of civilizations, democracy and human rights. Frequently constituted through discourses of war on terrorism and Islamophobia, transnational whiteness is also affirmed through anxieties surrounding the economic and political rise of parts of Asia. The economic rise of Japan in the 1990s and the more recent rise of China and India have destabilized what is central to white power: being exclusively more human and less deficient than other races (see Philipose, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0964663912443919">2007</xref>: 1051–1052). Understood within the logic of Orientalism/War, Asian difference can threaten white supremacy in neighbourhoods, workplaces, schools and boardrooms at home and globally. This threat is represented not only through military stealth and vociferousness, but also through foreign capital and civilizational might.</p>
<p>A study conducted by the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0964663912443919">
<italic>Global Language Monitor</italic> (2009</xref>) on English-language print and electronic media, found that the rise of China as a global economy was the most discussed news story of the first decade of the twenty-first century. A mix of economic hype and Orientalist representations of Asia as a model/miracle and threat/peril for the west, western ‘China/Asia rising’ discourse contains elements of admiration, anticipation and enthusiasm, along with fear, uncertainty, trepidation and hostility. Christine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0964663912443919">So (2008</xref>) contends that while Asian Americans have long been associated with economic exchange, it was not until the 1970s that ‘we have witnessed the full-blown identification of Asia with capital’ (2008: 12). In the last decade of the twentieth century, western anxieties about global capital, and specifically about Asia, morphed into a situation whereby ‘multinational capital itself is imbued with oriental cultural difference’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0964663912443919">So, 2008</xref>: 13). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0964663912443919">So (2008</xref>) clarifies that the west is not simply concerned about the shift in geopolitics and its own fears regarding the end of the American/western century. It is also concerned that the west may be overrun with Asians (14). While many government and corporate leaders define the ‘Asian homo economicus’ as desirable, Asians are still positioned within Orientalist mythologies of the ‘Oriental as trade enemy’ in a context in which ‘global trade is viewed as war’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0964663912443919">Ong, 1999</xref>: 132).</p>
<p>Woman and girls appear to be marginal to this process of capital accumulation and exchange that takes place primarily between elite men. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0964663912443919">Agathangelou and Ling (2004</xref>) remind us, however, that global politics circulates around ‘hyperfeminine militancy’ as well as ‘hypermasculine envy (e.g. who has more power?)’ (2004: 521). The sexual humiliation and rape of women and girls, for example, is a key technology of war; the violent defilement of wives, daughters, mothers and grandmothers symbolizes the occupation and domination of enemy land and men. Examining the connections between women, nation and global economy, Traise <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0964663912443919">Yamamoto (1996</xref>) contends that western feminizing of Asia and Asian men, and the subsequent hyperfeminization of Asian women, serve to pacify American fears that the Japanese nation and economy pose a threat to western hegemony (1996: 388). Along these lines, Asian women can be viewed as targets of sexualized domination due to Orientalist perceptions that Asian females are exemplary vehicles through which white heterosexual men can reposition themselves as being in control in relation to the threat from minorities inside the nation-state and at its borders (represented by immigrants, racialized minorities, sexualized minorities, white women), and from Asian nations and capital. While targeted stranger violence is categorized as local and individual, and sexualized militarized violence is viewed as global and systemic, I would argue that it is imperative to conceptualize both as forms of systemic violence informed by and constitutive of local, national and global hierarchies.</p>
<p>Referring specifically to Asian ‘mail-order brides’, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0964663912443919">So (2008</xref>) highlights how western ambivalence towards Asia operates on local, national and global scales. On the one hand, the mail order bride strengthens ideologies of the heterosexual family that serve as the foundation of the nation; yet she is also a ‘repository for national fears about global competition, loss of U.S. jobs and cultural identity …’ (2008: 103). She is ‘the perfect match between family-centrism and sex appeal’ who can bolster white heterosexual masculinity, and she is a sign of the extent to which eastern men and capital have entered western homes, streets and nations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0964663912443919">Koshy, 2004</xref>: 16–17). Her presence on North American streets is both desired, and seen as an aberration and a violation.

<title>Non-Asian Men of Colour and Asian Female Difference</title>
<p>In ‘“Outwhiting the white guys”: Men of colour and peacekeeping violence’, Sherene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0964663912443919">Razack (2002</xref>) critiques theories of violence that argue that racialized men compensate for their marginalized masculinity by being violent towards their own, or other subordinated groups, often women. These theories contend that racialized men ‘cushion the effects of the subordination they experience by dominating those below them in the pecking order’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0964663912443919">Ehrenreich, 2002</xref>: 293). While acknowledging that there may be a compensatory element to the violence racialized men commit against racialized men and women, Razack cautions that these theories can pathologize racialized men as more violent and as having more reasons to be violent than white elite men. Rather than ‘their non-western culture made them do it’, that dominates explanations of violence against women within racialized communities, compensatory theories insinuate, at least in part, that ‘racism made them do it’. Considering that all racialized men are marginalized by racism, while white men are privileged by it, racialized men are exceptionalized as having more to gain from violence, and are thus particularly deviant.</p>
<p>Speaking specifically about the murder of Somali youth, Shidane Arone, by two indigenous members of Canada’s armed forces, Clayton Matchee and Kyle Brown, during Canada’s peacekeeping mission to Somalia in the 1990s, Razack contends that their violence should not be viewed as that of racialized men who must compensate for their diminished manhood. Their violence should be understood within an anti-colonial framework as being what indigenous military men from the global North may do when posted in the global South. Razack states that indigenous men imagine themselves as ‘“men from the land of clean snow,” as colonizers … Somalis in this scenario constituted a threat to the men’s sense of being in control, a threat that violence could dissolve’ (2002: 337). Matchee and Brown were embedded in a context in which violence against black bodies is naturalized, and accordingly they acted violently. White supremacy frames all violence by Canadian soldiers against Somalis in what is, first and foremost, a colonial encounter; being racist (and sexist and homophobic) is central to ideal manhood, a manhood both white men and men of colour attempt to perform (see Nemoto, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0964663912443919">2008</xref>: 80–81). In naming the violence as part of First World domination, rather than as compensation, Razack emphasizes how racialized men have as much reason to be violent as white men, ‘no more and no less’ (2002: 335).</p>
<p>Along these lines I propose that non-Asian men of colour view themselves as western/American/Canadian or, at minimum, as men tied to the west who are threatened by a foreign, eastern menace. This menace threatens to dominate not only whiteness, but also all other racialized minorities in the west. In the context of white heteropatriarchal supremacy, and western desire for and anxieties over ‘Asia rising’, non-Asian men of colour assert their western superiority and masculinity through dominance over women defined in opposition to the west and all things western. Non-Asian men of colour may be performing their manhood, like white men, by ‘defending their freedom, their honour, [and] their [new] homeland’ from Asian women, men, capital and nations (Nagel, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0964663912443919">1998</xref>: 244). An aspect that Razack inadequately examines, and that I contend is central to understanding the violence of non-Asian racialized men against Asian women, is differential racialization (for example Smith’s pillars of white supremacy), and how racialized groups are required to negotiate the exclusions of liberal and neoliberal citizenship in relation to other racialized minorities.</p>
<p>There is almost no work on how racialized women are positioned in interracial alliances and conflicts between racialized minorities. The scholarship on black/Asian relations in the United States does, however, provide insight into how race, class, gender and citizenship operate in the contemporary neoliberal context. It reveals how racialized groups are racialized in contradictory and often oppositional ways to support white supremacy, as well as how they support each other’s racialization within the narrow confines of the institution of citizenship (Jun, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0964663912443919">2011</xref>: 17; Kim, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0964663912443919">2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Helen Jun (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0964663912443919">2011</xref>) terms this process for blacks in relation to Asians in the United States as black Orientalism. Jun stresses that black Orientalism is not a set of attitudes, perceptions and intentions, and is neither negative or positive, conservative or liberal; it cannot be reduced to anti-Asian racism or Asian scapegoating. Black Orientalism offers an alternative framework to rethink black/Asian relations beyond the limitations of either racial solidarity or racial prejudice by foregrounding how black and Asian claims to humanity and citizenship are mutually constitutive. As such, black Orientalism includes historically specific black imaginings of Asia and Asians that reflect the contradictions, denials and disillusionments of black citizenship (Jun, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0964663912443919">2011</xref>: 18–19). Arising from the enlightenment paradox, blacks make moral and nationalistic claims to citizenship, even though their exclusion from and brutalization within the nation has been pivotal to the nation’s development. Within this context, Jun writes, ‘the institution of citizenship compelled narratives of black inclusion that converged with the rhetoric and logic of the anti-Chinese movement’ (2011: 6). Thus the black press in the late 19th century asserted the citizenship rights of black men by contrasting black male respectability and integrity with Chinese and indigenous immorality and underdevelopment (Jun, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0964663912443919">2011</xref>: 25–29).</p>
<p>Blacks and Asians in the United States (and to a lesser extent Canada) have been positioned in opposition to each other, from the model minority discourse starting in the 1960s, to the conflicts between Korean immigrant merchants in black neighbourhoods in the 1980s and 1990s, and more recently, the continual negation of blackness in the Asia Pacific century. Jun summarizes:<disp-quote>
<p>… in the post-1965 period, black Orientalism names how the persistent failures of black citizenship – the inadequacy of legal equality, intensified residential segregation of the black poor, disenfranchisement through mass incarceration – are negotiated in relation to global restructuring, mass immigration, and a dominant cold-war American Orientalism that is wary of a future shaped by Asian economic domination. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0964663912443919">Jun, 2011</xref>: 100)</p>
</disp-quote>Personified by the Asian corner-store merchant/transnational migrant/global capitalist, and the black urban/incarcerated poor, blacks and Asians are disciplined through white supremacist narratives of the other. Asians are mobile, virtuous, independent, prosperous, conformist, measured, efficient, cunning, competitive, family-oriented and forward-looking, whereas blacks are poor, confined, pathological, criminal, decadent, dependent, violent, underdeveloped, stagnant, devoid of functioning families, and increasingly irrelevant. The discourse of Asians as model minorities – who immigrate in family units and abide by immigration laws after decades of exclusion (unlike Latinos who are viewed as illegal) and who labour and assimilate, without complaint, towards upward mobility – pathologizes all other minorities and economic poverty in general, while disavowing US imperialism in Asia. It does so by framing success and failure as individual, cultural and moral, and by disconnecting Asian immigration from the wars that produced their resettlement in the United States. The narrative of the model minority became the defining feature of Asian racial difference in the 1970s and 1980s as Asians began to be positioned in support of American meritocracy, globalization and neoliberalism. The demonization of the black urban poor, alongside the narrative of the model Asian minority, was central to legitimating the transition from the Keynesian discourse on individual rights and state responsibility to the neoliberal logic of self-responsibility and independence from the state.</p>
<p>Beginning in the 1980s and solidifying in the 1990s with the rise of Japan and the emergence of the Asian Newly Industrialized Countries (NIC) as global powers, the dyad of the enterprising Asians and the stagnant and dependent blacks became increasingly tinged with nationalistic anxieties about Asian (read as foreign) domination. Black disenfranchisement and lack of economic opportunity were displaced onto an Asian presence that was simultaneously perceived to be invasively exploiting the nation and the west. Anti-blackness was personified by the Korean inner-city shopkeeper while Asian foreignness, incompatibility and inscrutability were highlighted by black resentment. Black Orientalism at the present time conveys a nostalgia for a time when black citizens were valued by the nation, an era that Jun argues never existed and yet is yearned for in much of the black cultural production during the last decades of the twentieth century (Jun, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0964663912443919">2011</xref>: 121–122). Against the backdrop of Asian hypermobility lies the black subject who is no longer valued as exploitable labour, and is rendered obsolete within the dictates of global capital. Replaced by technology and the labour of exploitable Latino and Asian bodies inside and outside the nation, blackness overall has become surplus in the new millennium. Although there are key differences between the United States and Canada, particularly in relation to the black slave economy, both countries share racist ideologies about blacks as well as tensions surrounding white settler histories of Asian exclusion and the current valorization and demonization of Asian capital (Amadahy and Lawrence, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0964663912443919">2009</xref>: 114, 123; Mitchell, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0964663912443919">2004</xref>).</p>
<p>In examining black Orientalism, Jun restricts her analysis to black and Asian American cultural production and the realm of discourse. Nonetheless, her analysis of how the confines of liberal and neoliberal citizenship positions racialized minorities against and through one another supports claims that non-Asian men of colour who target Asian women for violence are not primarily compensating for their feminization as racialized men. I contend that this violence is best understood as an assertion of the right to place and space in both national and global hierarchies, using the bodies of women deemed ideal targets for such violence. The acts of targeted domination are informed by anxieties surrounding the neoliberal ‘uplift’ of Asians in general and elite Asian men and capital in particular within the context of the continued dehumanization and devaluing of all other non-Asian racialized communities and nations. If predatory heterosexuality is tied to perceptions of loss of domination and the need to reassert it, men of colour are, unlike white men, simultaneously asserting dominance and strengthening systemic inequalities that, by and large, support their domination. While men of colour should not and cannot be absolved from the violence they commit, it must be recognized that their violence against Asian women upholds dominant race and gender relations that define the national and global subject as white and male. The violence upholds constructions of racialized and immigrant communities as foreign and thus violable, and supports the heteropatriarchy that is central to gendered violence against men as well as women. While the men may be attempting to assert themselves as viable western men, they are still outside the realm of the (ideal) human.</p>

<title>Reconceptualizing Violence</title>
<p>In 2002, there were a series of stranger attacks against Asian females who were temporarily residing in British Columbia, Canada, to study the English language. Unlike many cases of Asian female targeting, in the 2002 British Columbian cases the mainstream media, the police and the public named and debated the role of race and ethnicity in shaping the violence. Elsewhere I have argued that this periodic foregrounding of issues of race and ethnicity was primarily due to concerns over the security of British Columbia’s English-as-a-Foreign-Language and tourism industries, rather than an acknowledgement of racialized sexual violence. The injuries done to the Asian women and girls came to represent the potential damage inflicted on the numerous businesses whose survival rested on Asian temporary migration to the west coast of Canada (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0964663912443919">Park, 2010</xref>). The solution to ending the violence, proposed by English language schools, the police and local government officials, was educating Asian females on Canadian ‘street-smarts’. Inappropriate female behaviour was categorized in terms of gendered Orientalist representations of ‘Canadian’ versus ‘Asian’ behaviour, rather than ‘good girl’ versus ‘bad girl’ behaviour.<sup>

</sup> Notably, while the above cases involved interracial heterosexual violence against racialized women and girls, they were still conceptualized within the framework of intraracial gendered violence that predominates in work on violence against racialized women and girls in North America. The British Columbian cases also reveal how Asia’s economic ascendancy frames the ways in which violence against Asian females in the west could be understood.</p>
<p>This paper has problematized the pathologization of non-western, racialized communities by highlighting how white heteropatriarchal supremacy operates through and in acts of violence against racialized women and girls. In doing so, I have addressed several absences in current research: the insufficient theoretical analysis of interracial violence against racialized females; inadequate examinations of how local and everyday violence operates on the level of the national and global, and is systemic and structural; work on masculinity and violence against women that addresses both female–male relations and male–male relations; and finally the elision of interracial violence against women in which both the victim and perpetrator are people of colour. More importantly, I contend that these absences and the definition and categorizations of violence itself are key to sustaining domination. The cases outlined in this paper serve as a departure point for questioning liberal separations between public and private, group and individual, east and west, local and global, and gendered violence and racial violence. I have argued that an accounting of the logic of Orientalism/War, historically and in its current articulation as the Asia rising discourse, is central to understanding these acts of violence against women and girls. The global rise of parts of Asia is arguably one of the most significant events of the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries. The potential of eastern (male) domination threatens to destabilize race, gender, class, national and global hierarchies. This threat appears to be acted upon by both non-Asian men of colour and white men through the domination of Asian women and girls.</p>

<p>I use the term interracial heterosexual violence to draw attention to how I am referring to a heterosexual dynamic, something that is often assumed and implied but goes unnamed. This is not to infer that the women and men involved in these cases are heterosexual.</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn2-0964663912443919">
<label>2.</label>
<p>I became aware of these types of cases through a television news broadcast of the 2001 police search for a white man sexually assaulting Asian women in a west-end neighbourhood of Toronto. Thereafter, I conducted online newspaper and internet searches for similar cases of Asian female targeting. In 2008 I created two <italic>Google Alerts</italic> using the search terms ‘Asian’ and ‘sexual assault’, and ‘Asian women’ and ‘targeted.’ These <italic>Alerts</italic> provided weekly summaries of internet newspapers and blogs that contained the combination of search terms. Of the links identified as relevant for this research, in most cases the links were to newspaper articles in which Asian women were identified by police authorities as the victims of sexual assault. In other cases they were links to Asian American blogs and websites in which a case of Asian female targeting was being identified that was not being discussed as a case of Asian female targeting by the media and/or legal officials. For some instances, my knowledge of the cases is primarily through media depictions, for others I have accessed judicial documents such as Reasons for Decisions. The North American cases presented in this paper were chosen due to their diversity in terms of type of crime, race and ethnicity, age, and so forth. Of relevance to this paper is that they are cases of targeted violence that are viewed as disconnected from each other; of significantly less concern are questions relating to reporting and non-reporting, media and judicial constructions of the victims, the outcomes of the trials and so forth.</p>

<p>A 2008 US Bureau of Justice report found that 35 per cent of Asian victims of violence reported that their offender was white, 26 per cent reported that the perpetrator was black, and 30 per cent of Asian victims cited ‘other’. This is in contrast to white and black victims where 66 per cent of white victims reported being attacked by whites and 76 per cent of blacks reported the perpetrator of violence as black (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0964663912443919">Woan, 2008</xref>: 297). While the above study cannot be viewed as definitive, and the numbers are most likely due to numerous factors, the disparities between racialized groups is, at minimum, worth noting.</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn4-0964663912443919">
<label>4.</label>
<p>I say ‘at least five’, since in some of the cases the race of the perpetrator is not stated and is unclear.</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn5-0964663912443919">
<label>5.</label>
<p>For example, in a workshop organized by an English-as-a-Foreign-Language school during the height of concerns over the violence, Asian women and girls were taught to perform empowerment and assertiveness by showing them a video of white women in a bar rebuffing the advances of men. This assertive behaviour was constructed as Canadian and non-Asian.</p>
