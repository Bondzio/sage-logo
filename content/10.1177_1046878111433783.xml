<abstract>
<p>Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems have had a significant impact on business organizations. These large systems offer opportunities for companies regarding the integration and functionality of information technology systems; in effect, companies can realize a competitive advantage that is necessary in today’s global companies. However, effective training for the incorporation and use of these large-scale systems is difficult and challenging; improved strategies for effective training include the use of business simulations. The question of the effectiveness of training remains—“How do we measure learning?”. In a recent <italic>Simulation &amp; Gaming</italic> article “Business Simulations and Cognitive Learning”, Anderson and Lawton (2009) focus on research associated with the assessment of cognitive learning in business simulations. They indicate that little progress has occurred in objectively assessing cognitive learning in simulations and call for research that might help determine whether simulations accomplish what they purport to achieve in terms of participant learning. In this research note, objective measures of learning are presented. The results of objective measures of learning are compared with those of self-assessed perceptions of learning in the context of an ERP business simulation game. Based on the comparisons of learning measures, self-assessed measure results were not different from those of objective measures; moreover, learning did occur.</p>

<p>In their recent <italic>Simulation &amp; Gaming</italic> article, “Business Simulations and Cognitive Learning,” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1046878111433783">Anderson and Lawton (2009)</xref> focus on research associated with the assessment of cognitive learning in business simulations. The authors indicate that little progress has occurred in objectively assessing cognitive learning in simulations and call for research that might help determine whether simulations accomplish what they purport to achieve in terms of participant learning. The current article focuses on measuring the effectiveness of using a simulation to effect learning of Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems.</p>
<p>As ERP systems have had a significant impact on business organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1046878111433783">Liang, Saraf, Hu, &amp; Xue, 2007</xref>), universities and corporate training programs have incorporated some of the commonly used ERP systems (SAP and Oracle) into curricula and training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1046878111433783">Antonucci, Corbitt, Stewart, &amp; Harris, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1046878111433783">Hayen &amp; Andera, 2003</xref>). This is mainly a result of the ever-increasing use of ERP and enterprise systems (ES) as major components of business organizations. The systems are large, commercial software packages that enable the integration of transaction-oriented data and business processes throughout an organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1046878111433783">Brehm, Heinzl, &amp; Markus, 2001</xref>). ERP systems were developed to replace functional information systems, which typically operate in silos within an organization and generate inefficiencies and inconsistencies due to their lack of integration. ERP systems offer opportunities for a wealth of learning about integration and functionality, as well as the competitive advantage of integrated information which is required in today’s global companies. However, the incorporation and use of these large-scale systems in classes and training programs is difficult and challenging.</p>
<p>In this article, we present and compare the learning results using objective measures to assess user knowledge with the results of self-assessed perceptions of learning in the context of an ERP business simulation game. These comparisons indicate that learning did occur as measured by objective measures and self-assessed perceptions of learning; moreover, the objective measures were not significantly different from the self-assessed perceptions of learning. These results complement <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1046878111433783">Anderson and Lawton’s (2009)</xref> findings by addressing the assessment of cognitive learning in business simulations and a means to determine whether simulations accomplish what they purport to achieve in terms of participant learning.</p>

<title>ERP/IT Training and Knowledge</title>
<p>User training is considered a cornerstone of change management and a key factor in any successful IT implementation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1046878111433783">Compeau, Olfman, Sein, &amp; Webster, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1046878111433783">Nelson &amp; Cheney, 1987</xref>). Deficient and inefficient training inhibits ownership of the technology and limits the full realization of benefits from these new investments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1046878111433783">Nelson, Whitener, &amp; Philcox, 1995</xref>). User training is often provided by means of classroom presentation, accompanied by “hands on” practice exercises with fictitious problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1046878111433783">Yi &amp; Davis, 2003</xref>). The common methods used in the classroom generally involve “hands on” use of ERP system modules in exercises to solve independent and often-unrelated business process problems such as production, inventory, sales, and customer orders. Learners in these training programs are engaged in an individual cognitive process that generally leads to the development of technical competency related to the application; this technical knowledge acquisition is generally not sufficient to train productive information systems (IS) users (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1046878111433783">Kang &amp; Santhanam, 2003</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1046878111433783">Kang and Santhanam (2003)</xref> suggest that users must be trained within the “business context” in which these applications are used as well as in the collaborative interdependencies underlying these systems; users must understand these interdependences.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1046878111433783">Seethamraju (2007)</xref> studies students’ perceived knowledge gain after incorporating ERP (based on SAP) instructional strategies into a business curriculum (readings, examples, exercises, and classroom lectures). His analysis revealed that students perceived that they had gained a significantly high level of knowledge (e.g., implementation and SAP software skills). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1046878111433783">Basselier, Horner Reich, and Benbasat (2001)</xref> suggest that the components of explicit and tacit knowledge are necessary for a manager to be competent in IT. They define IT competency as a set of IT-related explicit and tacit knowledge that enables one to act proactively to successfully perform the job. They suggest that explicit IT knowledge covers knowledge of technologies, applications, system development, management of IT, and access to IT knowledge. Tacit knowledge includes the experience of the manager (personal use of computers, IT project experience, and management of IT) as well as cognition (process adaptation and vision about the role of IT in the organization).</p>
<p>Other researchers have focused on the organizational level; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1046878111433783">Stratman and Roth (2002)</xref> define and operationalize constructs underlying ERP competence of an organization (a portfolio of managerial, technical, and organizational skills and expertise). They find evidence of a relationship between ERP competence at the organizational level and improved business performance. While this measure is also self-assessed and targets the measure of ERP competency at the organizational level, it encompasses dimensions relevant to measuring the knowledge of the IT workforce. These include business and IT skills in addition to IT training.</p>
<p>More recent studies have focused on a knowledge aspect central to the notion of the integration of systems. Building on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1046878111433783">Sein, Bostrom, and Olfman (1999)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1046878111433783">Kang and Santhanam (2003)</xref> suggest the consideration of IT knowledge as a continuum. Focusing on collaborative applications such as an ERP system application, they suggest that a productive IT user should have knowledge of the following dimensions: (a) <italic>technical IT knowledge</italic> related to the commands and tools embedded in the IS applications, (b) <italic>business IT knowledge</italic> related to the contextual knowledge covered by the use of the IS application, and (c) <italic>collaborative IT knowledge</italic> related to the understanding of tasks interdependent with those of other users of the IS application. The later dimension differentiates this particular framework from other previous contributions and more appropriately fits the context of an integrated enterprise system. While much of the current research has relied on attitudes, perceptions, and self-reports to assess learning, the present study reports objective measures and compares these results with traditional affective measures of learning.</p>
<sec id="section2-1046878111433783">
<title>ERP Simulation—Facilitating Learning of ERP-Related Concepts</title>
<p>Faculty at HEC Montréal developed a business simulation game with some unique features—the ERP simulation game (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1046878111433783">Léger, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1046878111433783">Léger, Charland, et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1046878111433783">Léger, Robert, Babin, Pellerin, &amp; Wagner, 2007</xref>). The HEC Montréal ERP simulation game uses a real-time simulation approach; the simulator, ERPsim, reacts in real time to individual team decisions for several teams. The interface between the simulator and the participants is SAP, a real ERP system. Simulation participants are placed in a continuous time situation in which they have to manage and run their business using SAP to implement business transactions similar to those in the world’s largest companies.</p>
<p>The ERP simulation game is a business game played by teams of three to five players. In the original game, each team runs a make-to-stock Muesli cereal company and competes with other teams. Teams have to plan, procure raw materials, schedule production, and market Muesli boxes. To perform these tasks, participants must be able to use an ERP system, SAP, to support decision making. The ERP simulation software automates a series of transactions that create a realistic business environment in which teams compete. To be successful in the game (i.e., to maximize profit), participants must not only be able to interact with SAP, but must also be able to collaborate as a team, understand the business environment (integrated processes internal to the company and competitive processes external to the company), and implement the appropriate business decisions.</p>
<p>Presented with scenarios, participants, in teams of three to five players, must operate a company in a simulated economic environment. Specifically, participants must operate the full business cycle of a manufacturing or a distribution organization; that is, they must plan, procure, produce, and sell. They have to operate their business using a real-life ERP system (SAP) which is used by the world’s largest companies. To ensure the profitability of their operation, participants use reports in the ERP to analyze their data, and then use transactions in the system to implement their operational and tactical decisions.</p>
<p>To put into place an efficient operational business process, operational tasks must be shared between the team players. Seven significant operational tasks (decisions that must be made during the simulation) are presented which correspond to various transactions in the ERP and must be executed by the players:</p>
<list id="list1-1046878111433783" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p><italic>Forecasting and production planning</italic>: Players must evaluate the market needs based on sales data and develop their own delivery and production strategy.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Material requirement planning (MRP)</italic>: Participants must evaluate and execute planning scenarios by using the MRP function in the ERP system. Based on the calculation by the system, they can choose to execute the proposed plan or to modify their own plan.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Material management</italic>: Participants must plan and execute their reorder strategy, making sure they are not running out of raw materials to meet their production requirements.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Production scheduling</italic>: Players must schedule production based on stock availability and current production resource status. Several production constraints must be taken into account in the decision.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Stock management</italic>: Players allocate their inventory into different regional warehouses to meet the regional demand.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Sales management</italic>: While the actual sale execution process is automated by the simulator, the main objective is to manage the sales rate to ensure that market opportunities are exploited, yet be able to sustain optimal safety stocks.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Accounting and treasury management</italic>: While the focus is mainly on operations management, participants must take into account other organizational functions such as accounting and finance.</p></list-item></list>
<p>The solution software which enacts this simulation is called ERPsim. This application is closely coupled with ERP technologies, which empowers participants to use an actual corporate information system (SAP) as they would in a business context. While other simulation games are typically turn-based, ERPsim simulation is <italic>in continuous time;</italic> thus, decision making is <italic>ongoing for the duration of the game</italic>. ERPsim serves three functions:</p>
<list id="list2-1046878111433783" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p><italic>Market generation</italic>: ERPsim provides the simulation of a market for buyers, so the game participants have a reasonable market that responds to their decisions just as one in the real world would. Allocation of sales uses decision data from the participants, such as pricing, marketing, production, and stock movements of products. As these decision data are posted by the participants in the ERP system, they are automatically extracted from the ERP by the simulator. The simulator automates the creation of the transactional data resulting from this allocation directly in the ERP system.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Task automation</italic>: ERPsim automates some of the business functions that are more administrative to make the game more fluid and realistic. For instance, once a purchase order is released by the participants, the simulator automates the activities that follow: receiving goods and invoice from vendor and sending payment to vendor. In general, strategic and tactical decisions are left to participants while all activities that follow these decisions are automated.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Time management</italic>: ERPsim simulates the passing of time. ERPsim compresses time into a short space, but still creates the appearance of time evolving so that the impact of the decisions taken over time can be evaluated. In this virtual time, participants of the game are able to adjust their decision-making processes and make better business decisions over time as they learn to play the game and see the results of the decisions they have taken.</p></list-item></list>
<p>ERPsim was designed to support a rich and representative manufacturing context typical for a medium-sized organization. In addition to being able to modulate the complexity of the simulation to address learning, the authenticity of the problem-solving context is supported by the following features:</p>
<list id="list3-1046878111433783" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p><italic>A rich and realistic demand model.</italic> The simulator does not replicate the market by using an aggregated demand function, one that could be pinned down easily by learners. Instead, the simulator creates a large population of representative customers, each with their own tastes and preferences. Each customer is attached to a retailer whose characteristics vary across regions and distribution channels. Sales orders generated from a given retailer reflect the preferences of the representative customers related to it. Each customer has an indirect utility function that depends on its preferences. Customers can compare prices and products offered by different companies, and are assumed to purchase the good that maximizes their indirect utility. The result is a rich, transactional-based simulation of the demand side. Because the customer’s behavior depends on preference parameters randomly generated at the beginning of the game, it is impossible to predict how the market will behave, and every new game is different from the previous one.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Constraints and delays in the supply chain.</italic> The simulator automates goods receipt in the procurement process; this introduces shipment delays into the game. The delay, in virtual days, is a random variable (typically from three to five virtual days).</p></list-item> <list-item><p>Similarly, the simulator controls the production confirmation to introduce production capacity. Each company has its own unique production line. The daily capacity is controlled by the simulator. The simulator will partially confirm the production orders, on a daily basis, as a function of the company’s production capacity and set up time between production runs. Teams can also invest to increase capacity and reduce setup time.</p></list-item></list>
<p>The constraints imposed on the teams (which include limited cash, delivery delays, production constraints, and others) force them to make important strategic choices. Teams cannot achieve excellence in everything; they must identify a niche in which they can focus and be successful. Furthermore, because success depends on particular preferences within the market and strategies of other teams, there is no single “best” strategy. Among the decisions available to the participants, teams must make crucial tactical and strategic decisions such as developing new products, setting an adequate pricing strategy, making decisions on the distribution network, and investing in additional capacity and setup time reduction, for example.</p>
<p>One of the distinguishing characteristics of this simulation is the fact that it uses the same IT artifact that manufacturing enterprises use to perform operations management. This forces participants to think in the same conceptual terms as they would in an actual business. One example is the difference between planning documents and execution documents. In an operational ERP, the production plan is materialized as a set of planning documents: purchase requisitions and planned orders. Subsequent actions must be taken by the manager to move from the planning to the execution phase, such as converting purchase requisitions into purchase orders, and releasing planned orders. This link with the real IT artifact enables the students to better understand the link between strategic, tactical, and operational planning.</p>
<p>By accessing standard SAP managerial accounting reports, participants analyze transactional data for business decisions and for the profitability of their operations. In the simulation game, participants (students, employees, or managers) must make business decisions and perform complex tasks with the objective of maximizing profits and/or market share of their (virtual) company. In pursuing these goals, the participants have the support of powerful integrated IT system processes within SAP.</p>
<p>In essence, the simulation places students in a near real-life environment of IT artifact, manufacturing, and industry constraints, where they must make the best possible decisions to become the most profitable enterprise, notwithstanding the uncertainty that comes with reality. The simulation is not complex to be complex, but rather it shows some level of complexity that can be adjusted by the moderator/instructor to challenge the participants to expand their skills and knowledge.</p>
<p>Traditional training methods that have been used include examples, lectures, and lab exercises. Alternatively, the ERP simulation game provides a unique and effective way to enhance business process learning and train users in the effective use of ERP systems. Based on the results of previous studies using self-assessed measures of learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1046878111433783">Cronan, Douglas, Schmidt, &amp; Alnuaimi, 2009a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1046878111433783">2009b</xref>), it appears that ERP simulation offers a method that facilitates learning of the concepts underlying ES, helps managers experience the benefits of enterprise integration firsthand, and allows participants to develop decision-making skills. As a training tool, it helps middle management learn how to become more productive by using ERP software. In addition, the simulation game could be used to enhance the decision-making skills of business managers and executives by making effective use of SAP’s integrated system processes.</p>
<p>The ERP simulation game and the participant’s guide to the simulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1046878111433783">Léger, Robert, Babin, Pellerin, &amp; Wagner, 2011</xref>) are now used by more than 100 faculty members and in more than 70 universities worldwide. As of June 2011, about 6,000 students annually have played the game across the SAP University Alliance. Professionals at many Fortune 1000 organizations are now introduced to SAP by playing the simulation game.</p>

<title>Phase I—Measuring IT Knowledge</title>
<p>The question “<italic>What IT knowledge is needed to effectively and efficiently use an ERP system?</italic>” has been of great interest to IT researchers. Over the last decades, several researchers have developed self-assessed constructs in an attempt to measure IT knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1046878111433783">Basselier et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1046878111433783">Cronan et al., 2009a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1046878111433783">2009b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1046878111433783">Yoon 2008</xref>; and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1046878111433783">Marcolin, Compeau, Munro, &amp; Huff, 2000</xref>, among others).</p>
<sec id="section5-1046878111433783">
<title>Self-assessed measures of IT knowledge</title>
<p>The individual self-assessed instrument items used in the current study consist of learning factors in addition to measures of attitude. Initially based on items used by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1046878111433783">Seethamraju (2007)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1046878111433783">Kang and Santhanam’s (2003)</xref> categories of knowledge components from their proposed collaborative application learning model, items were further developed and expanded to measure ERP learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1046878111433783">Cronan et al., 2009a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1046878111433783">2009b</xref>). The ERP learning factors with their corresponding items are presented in <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-1046878111433783">Appendix A</xref>. Based on exploratory factor analysis, 16 items were used to measure ES management knowledge, business process knowledge, and SAP transactions skills. <italic>ES Management Knowledge</italic> is defined as the extent to which an individual understands the impact of an ERP (as well as the integrated information it provides) on the organization as a whole—including impacts on organizational structures and responsibilities, business processes, reporting, control (or insurance), and decision making. ES reflects the individual’s knowledge of how enterprise management utilizes an ERP and how the use of ERP affects the enterprise.</p>
<p><italic>Business process knowledge</italic> is the extent to which an individual has a general understanding of business terminology, key operations processes, and their interrelatedness. Business process knowledge includes understanding the delineation of key business activities within and between functional areas such as financial accounting, procurement, manufacturing, and sales. <italic>SAP Transaction Skills</italic> represent the extent to which an individual has the information systems user skills required to utilize the SAP application to perform transactions supporting business operations as well as to setup and understand the associated master data. Factor analysis (with varimax rotation) was used to validate the learning factors for this study. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1046878111433783">Table 1</xref> present the results of the factor analysis and Cronbach’s alpha, which indicates that the scales were valid and reliable as was the case in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1046878111433783">Cronan et al., 2009a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1046878111433783">2009b</xref>).</p>

<title>Objective measures of IT knowledge</title>
<p>To objectively measure IT knowledge, a collection of objective questions measuring the IT competency and IT knowledge of an individual ERP/SAP system user was developed and compiled. Initially, 60 objective questions were developed by the researchers to address the three dimensions proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1046878111433783">Kang and Santhanam (2003)</xref>:</p>
<list id="list5-1046878111433783" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>the <italic>ERP application</italic> (command based, tool procedural, and tool conceptual)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>the <italic>business context</italic> in which the ERP application is used (business procedural and business motivational) and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>the <italic>collaborative tasks</italic> enabled by the ERP application (task interdependencies and collaborative problem-solving approach)</p></list-item></list>
<p>Building on the call from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1046878111433783">Anderson and Lawton (2009)</xref> to assess higher levels of learning domains, questions were developed to target the different levels of learning objectives from the revised taxonomy of learning objectives (Bloom’s taxonomy revised; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1046878111433783">Krathwohl, 2002</xref>)—basic knowledge, comprehension, application, and analysis. Question objectives vary from those which require the learner to be able to recognize information (basic knowledge), process information by restating in their own terms (comprehension), apply knowledge to a problem (application), and identify constraints in a problem (analysis). Due to the use of multiple answers to test knowledge, the present authors did not attempt to measure knowledge at the synthesis and evaluation level. The objective questions used in this research can be obtained by contacting the authors of this article (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app2-1046878111433783">Appendix B</xref>).</p>
<p>Next, ERP experts (faculty members of the SAP University Alliance who are teaching ERP systems) were asked to further develop these objective measures of IT knowledge. In addition to answering the 60 objective questions, the experts were asked to</p>
<list id="list6-1046878111433783" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>evaluate the extent to which each question measured the participant’s knowledge with respect to the ERP application, business context in which the ERP application is used, and collaborative tasks enabled by the ERP application and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>assess whether these questions targeted the various levels of learning objective.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>To address the learning objective assessment, the experts were asked to evaluate the level of <italic>perceived complexity</italic> of each of the questions. The perceived complexity was measured using a 7-point Likert-type scale from low complexity (learning objectives lower on the revised Bloom’s taxonomy) to high complexity (application and analysis levels on Bloom’s revised taxonomy).</p>
<p>The question set submitted to the ERP experts pertained to the use of SAP in the context of the ERP simulation game previously described. It should be noted that the experts invited to respond to the survey had been trained to use the ERPsim software and have previously used the software to run the ERP simulation game in their respective classes. Therefore, the simulation, the technology used to play it, and the business context of the business game offered a common point of reference for all experts.</p>
<p>Of the 100 faculty contacted, 59 valid responses were obtained (59% response rate). A question was considered to be ambiguous and removed from the analysis if it was not answered correctly by more than 60% of the experts. Based on these criteria, of the initial 60 questions developed, 30 knowledge questions were retained for Phase 2. The experts were able to correctly answer 85% of these questions.</p>
<p>The perceived complexity measure was used to determine whether a specific question was categorized as an easy or complex question. Questions were separated into easy (20 questions measuring low complexity knowledge) and complex (10 questions measuring high complexity—application and analysis) based on the median perceived complexity rating by the experts. Categorization based on the experts’ perceived complexity scale conformed to the initial targeted learning objective level from the revised taxonomy of learning objectives when the question was initially developed.</p>

<title>Phase 2: ERP Simulation—Self-Assessed and Objective Learning Measures</title>
<p>In all, 120 game participants were included in the study. Participants were organized into 40 teams, 3 participants per team (each team was composed of a planner, scheduler, and a seller). Each team played four nonconsecutive games of approximately 20 minutes each. The game used for this study was a version ERP simulation game developed at HEC Montreal which had been modified for the purpose of this research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1046878111433783">Léger, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1046878111433783">Léger et al., 2007</xref>). In the general release version of this simulation, participants typically play consecutive rounds of about 20 to 30 minutes over a period of time. In the present context, the game was restarted every 20 minutes to make each round independent, further ensuring that a team would not be penalized by any early mistakes. During the lab experiment, game participants completed the self-assessed learning instrument (16 items) and answered individually (in random order) all 30 of the objective questions developed in Phase 1.</p>
<p>Each team member had a specific self-assigned role (planner, scheduler, or seller) with specific tasks to accomplish within the team. To be successful during the game, teams had to manage a make-to-stock manufacturing company producing up to three products, and compete against automated robot teams which were managed by the simulator to ensure standardization of the game across teams. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1046878111433783">Appendix C</xref> provides a detailed description of the decision and reporting transactions executed by each player role in this simulation.</p>
<p>The <italic>planner</italic> role is responsible for planning production. In the ERP, this person was charged with forecasting, executing the MRP, and managing the purchasing process of the raw materials. The objective of this role was to make sure that required stock was on hand for each production release by the scheduler. The second role is the <italic>scheduler.</italic> This person is responsible for scheduling and releasing the production order. As a consequence, this person must coordinate with the planner to ensure that the required amount is available to be sold. At the same time, the scheduler must decide with the seller how many items should be put into production to meet the estimated customer demand. Finally, the <italic>seller</italic> role establishes a price for each of the three products based on available stock and market supply and demand. In the ERP simulation, the seller changes the price lists of the products and promotes the product by investing in marketing. The seller is tasked with analyzing sales orders and determines which products contribute the most to the profit of the company.</p>
<p>Each team member has an impact on the profitability of his or her firm in the context of the ERPsim simulation game. Incentives (a US $30 Amazon gift cards) were used to encourage participants to play the game in addition to the incentive that each team would maximize total company profits. The eight best teams were invited to participate in the grand finale and offered a chance to participate in the ERPsim international competition.</p>

<title>Knowledge Measures—Analysis and Results</title>
<p>The objective of this article is to present and compare learning results using objective measures of knowledge with the results of self-assessed perceptions of learning in the context of an ERP business simulation game. To compare learning measures, summary scores for learning and the degree of correlation between self-assessed measures and the objective measures of knowledge are presented. In effect, the researchers address whether participants’ perception of learning significantly related to their ability to answer objective questions about ERP systems.</p>
<p>ERP simulation participant learning measures (self-assessed and objective) were administered during and following participation in the simulation and then compared. A sample of 120 participants was used in the study. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1046878111433783">Table 2</xref> presents summary statistics for the self-assessed measures of knowledge. Results of the self-assessed measures indicate that the average self-assessed knowledge measures after participation in the simulation game are 5.25, 5.13, and 5.23 for ES management knowledge, ES business knowledge, and ERP transactions skills, respectively (using a 7-point Likert-type scale, where 7 is the highest level of self-assessed learning). Based on the results, participants perceived to have attained a high level of knowledge related to the use of the system. Their self-assessment of learning indicated that they perceived a strong understanding of the concepts of ES management, ES business knowledge, and ERP transaction skills.</p>

<title>Conclusions and Directions</title>
<p>The objective of this article was to present and compare two different methods to assess knowledge acquired in a simulation game—self-assessed knowledge and objectively measured knowledge. As reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1046878111433783">Anderson and Lawton (2009)</xref>, very few studies have used objective measures to assess the effectiveness of simulation-based learning at the higher levels of Bloom’s taxonomy. This article presents the learning results for participants in an ERP simulation game assessed by objective measures and by self-assessed measures. Learning measures are presented and compared. The results indicate significant correlation between the objective measures and the self-assessed measures of knowledge. Although these measures are correlated, more research is needed to be able to explain a greater amount of the variation in the measures. Another objective of the study was to access the validity of using perceived (self-assessed) measures as well as provide effective objective measures of learning in this ERP simulation context.</p>
<p>In general, it appears that a significant correlation prevails between the perception of knowledge of the participants (self-assessed measures) and their ability to answer objective knowledge questions about ERP system. The correlation is significantly stronger for the easy questions (developed to measure lower learning levels of the revised Bloom’s taxonomy) which should be expected. Moreover, some participants appear to overestimate their actual knowledge for higher levels of learning. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1046878111433783">Potvin, Riopel, Masson, and Fournier (2010)</xref> explore the impact of participants’ confidence about their knowledge in problem-based approaches. As suggested by their results, further research should explore the role of overconfidence of the participants regarding their misperception of knowledge in the context of business simulation.</p>
<p>Moreover, the effectiveness of using simulation to enhance learning is timely as the commonplace training methods that have been used include examples, lectures, and lab exercises. The ERP simulation game provides an alternative, unique way to enhance business process learning and train users in the effective use of ERP systems. Based on the results of this study as well as previous studies, ERP simulation appears to offer a simulation method that facilitates learning of the concepts underlying ES, helps managers experience the benefits of enterprise integration firsthand, and allows participants to develop decision-making skills. As a training tool, it should help middle management learn how to become more productive by using ERP software. In addition, the simulation game could be used to enhance the decision-making skills of business managers and executives by making effective use of SAP’s integrated system processes.</p>
<p>Further research is needed regarding learning gained from simulation-based problems (objective measures and self-assessed). More research in this area should not only make available reliable guidelines for developing and testing objective measures of learning specific to the simulation learning objectives, but attempt to discern what aspects of simulation-based learning are more effective.</p>
<p>Some caution is needed when interpreting and using the results. Because this study was done in a competition context, it is possible that students more interested in active learning were attracted, which could bias the results. In addition, objective knowledge was tested with multiple-answer questions only; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1046878111433783">Anderson and Lawton (2009)</xref> suggest that triangulating higher level learning with different assessment modes could help in getting a more valid measure of synthesis and evaluation learning objectives.</p>
