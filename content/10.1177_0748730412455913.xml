<abstract>
<p>When food is available during a restricted and predictable time of the day, mammals exhibit food-anticipatory activity (FAA), an increase in locomotor activity preceding the presentation of food. Although many studies have attempted to locate the food-entrainable circadian oscillator in the central nervous system, the pathways that mediate food entrainment are a matter of controversy. The present study was designed to determine the role of dopaminergic and histaminergic systems on FAA. Mice were given access to food for 2 h (ZT12-ZT14), and FAA was defined as the locomotor activity that occurred 2 h before the availability of food. Dopamine D<sub>1</sub> receptor (R), D<sub>2</sub>R, and histamine H<sub>1</sub>R-specific antagonists were used to clarify the role of dopamine and histamine receptors in FAA induced by food restriction (FR). FAA was monitored by infrared locomotor activity sensors. Mice were sacrificed at ZT12 on the 14th day of FR, and monoamine concentrations were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to electrochemical detection (HPLC-ECD). The results showed that pretreatment with the D<sub>1</sub>R antagonist SCH23390 at 1, 3, or 10 µg/kg significantly reduced FAA by 19% (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05), 26% (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05), or 19% (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01), respectively, and the D<sub>2</sub>R antagonist raclopride at 22, 67, or 200 µg/kg significantly reduced FAA by 16% (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05), 36% (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01), or 41% (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01), respectively, as compared with vehicle control. Moreover, coadministration of SCH23390 (10 µg/kg) and raclopride (200 µg/kg) synergistically inhibited FAA by 57% (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01) as compared with vehicle control. Consistently, the levels of dopamine and its metabolites in the striatum and midbrain were significantly increased during FAA, even with the pretreatment of D<sub>1</sub>R and D<sub>2</sub>R antagonists. However, pretreatment with pyrilamine at 2.5, 5, or 10 mg/kg did not significantly reduce FAA, although it reduced the locomotor activity during the dark period in ad libitum mice. These results strongly indicate that the dopaminergic system plays an essential role in the FAA in mice.</p>

<p>When food is available during a restricted and predictable time of the day, mammals quickly develop increased locomotor activity preceding food access, and this has been termed food-anticipatory activity (FAA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0748730412455913">Mistlberger, 1994</xref>). This food entrainment has been linked to the expression of a circadian oscillator because FAA is only entrained when food is provided in a circadian range, with free runs for several cycles during constant-fasting conditions, and it exhibits transients in response to phase shifts of food access (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0748730412455913">Stephan, 1992</xref>).</p>
<p>The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) in the hypothalamus has been identified as the light-entrained oscillator, whereas the mechanisms underlying the food-entrained oscillator (FEO) remain elusive. FAA is robust after a complete bilateral lesion of the SCN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0748730412455913">Stephan et al., 1979</xref>). Mutant mice lacking known circadian clock function in all tissues exhibit normal FAA both in a light-dark cycle and in constant darkness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0748730412455913">Storch and Weitz, 2009</xref>), indicating that FAA does not require the known circadian clock. Effects to localize oscillators driving food-anticipatory behavioral rhythms have for many years relied on lesion experiments. In rats, cell-specific lesions of the dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus (DMH) were reported to significantly, but only partially, attenuate or eliminate FAA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0748730412455913">Gooley et al., 2006</xref>). However, other groups working with rats and mice showed different results for the role of DMH in the expression of circadian FAA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0748730412455913">Landry et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0748730412455913">Moriya et al., 2009</xref>). Likewise, lesions of the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus (VMH), the lateral hypothalamic area (LH), the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus (PVH), and the olfactory bulb did not prevent FAA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0748730412455913">Davidson, 2009</xref>). Although these studies attempted to locate the food-entrainable circadian oscillator in the central nervous system, the pathways that mediate food entrainment are not yet fully understood.</p>
<p>Several studies have showed that both histaminergic and dopaminergic systems were involved in the regulation of arousal, locomotor activity, reward, and feeding circadian rhythm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0748730412455913">Doi et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0748730412455913">Hood et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0748730412455913">Inoue et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0748730412455913">Qu et al., 2010</xref>). In restricted feeding condition, histamine-containing neurons in the tuberomammillary nucleus (TMN) increased Fos-ir expression before mealtime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0748730412455913">Inzunza et al., 2000</xref>), and the increased locomotor activity that anticipates mealtime coincides with the activation of the TMN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0748730412455913">Meynard et al., 2005</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0748730412455913">Carr et al. (2001)</xref> reported that intracerebroventricular injections of the D<sub>1</sub> and D<sub>2</sub> receptor (R) agonists produced greater reward and locomotor-activation effects in food-restricted than in ad libitum–fed rats, and the activation of ERK 1/2 MAP kinase, CREB, and Fos-immunostaining in caudate putamen and nucleus accumbens increased in food-restricted rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0748730412455913">Carr et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0748730412455913">Haberny et al., 2004</xref>). Moreover, food restriction strongly increased mRNA levels of tyrosine hydroxylase and the dopamine transporter in the ventral tegmental area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0748730412455913">Lindblom et al., 2006</xref>). Based on these studies, we hypothesized that histaminergic and dopaminergic systems may play an important role in the mechanisms of FAA underlying food restriction.</p>
<p>D<sub>1</sub>R and D<sub>2</sub>R are the most widely and abundantly expressed receptors for dopamine in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0748730412455913">Kobayashi et al., 2004</xref>), and the histaminergic system regulates several functions such as arousal, circadian rhythm of locomotor activity, and exploratory behavior via the histamine H<sub>1</sub> receptor (H<sub>1</sub>R) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0748730412455913">Huang et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0748730412455913">Inoue et al., 1996</xref>). In the present study, we used a pharmacological and neurochemical approach to investigate the roles of dopaminergic D<sub>1</sub>R and D<sub>2</sub>R and histaminergic H<sub>1</sub>R in the FAA caused by FR. Our findings strongly indicate that dopaminergic system plays an essential role in the FAA in mice.</p>

<title>Animals and Housing Condition</title>
<p>Male ICR mice, weighing 25-27 g (8 weeks old), were obtained from the Laboratory Animal Center, Chinese Academy of Sciences (Shanghai, China). Animals were housed individually in an ambient temperature of 22 ± 0.5 °C with a relative humidity of 60% ± 2% and an automatically controlled 12 h light/12 h dark cycle (lights on at 0700 h, illumination intensity ≈ 100 lux), and mice had free access to food and water, unless otherwise stated. Experimental protocols were approved by the Medical Experimental Animal Administrative Committee of Shanghai. Every effort was made to minimize the number of animals used and any pain and discomfort experienced by the subjects.</p>

<sec id="section3-0748730412455913">
<title>Food Restriction Protocol</title>
<p>Mice were kept on a 12-h light/dark cycle (ZT0 defined as lights-on time [0700 h] and ZT12 as lights-off [1900 h]). After having free access to food and water for 4 days, experimental mice were subjected to 2 kinds of feeding conditions for 14 days. The FR mice were maintained with 2 h of food access per day and free access water. The group fed ad libitum (ad libitum mice) had free access to food and water. To ensure that the manipulation of removing and adding food did not interfere with the light-dark cycle during the light periods, we chose the restricted feeding regime: the food was given at ZT 12 (lights off) and withdrawn at ZT 14 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0748730412455913">Fig. 1A</xref>).</p>

<title>Body Weight and Food Intake</title>
<p>To track the health status of FR mice, the body weight of all mice was registered before and after the experiment. In addition, food intake for 2 h of food access every day for FR mice and for the 24-h interval for ad libitum mice was monitored for 14 days.</p>

<sec id="section5-0748730412455913">
<title>Locomotor Activity Recordings</title>
<p>Locomotor activity for an individual mouse was detected with a passive infrared sensor (Biotex, Kyoto, Japan) placed 17.5 cm above the floor of the recording cage (28 cm × 16.5 cm × 13 cm) as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0748730412455913">Nakamura et al., 2008</xref>). FAA was defined as the total locomotor activity for 2 h (ZT10-ZT12) before food access (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0748730412455913">Poulin and Timofeeva, 2008</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0748730412455913">
<title>Pharmacological Treatments</title>
<p>Pyrilamine (Sigma-Aldrich), a selective H<sub>1</sub>R antagonist; SCH 23390 (Sigma-Aldrich), a selective D<sub>1</sub>R antagonist; or raclopride (Sigma-Aldrich), a selective D<sub>2</sub>R antagonist, was dissolved in sterile saline immediately before intraperitoneal administration to the mice on the 14th day of FR. For exploring contribution of H<sub>1</sub>R, D<sub>1</sub>R, or D<sub>2</sub>R alone, and D<sub>1</sub>R/D<sub>2</sub>R together to FAA, an H<sub>1</sub>R antagonist pyrilamine alone was given at 1600 h (ZT9), whereas D<sub>1</sub>R antagonist SCH23390 or D<sub>2</sub>R antagonist raclopride alone, or combination of SCH23390 and raclopride was administered at 1700 h (ZT10) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0748730412455913">Fig. 1A</xref>). To investigate the role of coadministration of D<sub>1</sub>R and D<sub>2</sub>R antagonists or H<sub>1</sub>R antagonists on the spontaneous locomotor activity during the dark period in ad libitum mice, SCH23390 and raclopride together or pyrilamine alone was administered intraperitoneally at 1900 h (ZT12).</p>
<p>The dosages for H<sub>1</sub>R antagonist pyrilamine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0748730412455913">Huang et al., 2006</xref>) and D<sub>1</sub>R/D<sub>2</sub>R antagonists SCH23390/raclopride were selected based on previous reports and our preliminary data. In previous studies, SCH23390 at 15 and 50 µg/kg and raclopride at 0.5, 0.25, and 0.125 mg/kg did not influence spontaneous locomotor activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0748730412455913">Benturquia et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0748730412455913">Rodriguez-Arias et al., 2000</xref>). Our preliminary results showed that SCH23390 at 10 µg/kg and raclopride at 0.2 mg/kg did not decrease spontaneous locomotor activity in mice either, respectively. Therefore, we chose SCH23390 10 µg/kg and raclopride 0.2 mg/kg as the largest doses that did not affect spontaneous locomotor activity and selected 1 and 3 µg/kg for SCH23390 and 22 and 67 µg/kg for raclopride as small and middle dosages, respectively.</p>

<title>Sampling Procedure and Brain Dissection</title>
<p>Mice used for brain dissection were sacrificed at 1900 h on the 14th day of FR or ad libitum access, respectively. Following decapitation, the brains were rapidly removed and the cortex, hippocampus, striatum, midbrain, thalamus, hypothalamus, and medulla oblongata were dissected on ice according to previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0748730412455913">Glowinski and Iversen, 1966</xref>).

<title>Determination of Catecholamines and 5-HT Levels in Brain Regions</title>
<p>To determine dopaminergic neurotransmission in the FR-induced FAA, the levels of catecholamines and their metabolites together with 5-HT were determined using HPLC with electrochemical detection as reported previous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0748730412455913">Wang et al., 2012</xref>). Briefly, frozen brain tissues were homogenized in ice-cold 0.2 M perchloric acid containing 100 µM Na<sub>2</sub>-EDTA and 1 ng/mL isoproterenol as an internal standard. The homogenates were centrifuged at 15,000 <italic>g</italic> at 4 °C for 20 min. The supernatant was mixed with 1 M sodium acetate. The volume of sample injected was 20 µL. The levels of norepinephrine (NA), dopamine (DA), and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and their respective metabolites 3,4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC), homovanillic acid (HVA), and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) were determined by reverse-phase HPLC-ECD. A C18 reverse-phase column (EICOMPARK SC-5ODS 3.0 × 150 mm, 5 µm, Eicom, Kyoto, Japan), a precolumn (DIKMA 3.0 × 15.0 mm, 5 µm), and an electrochemical detector (Waters 2465, USA) were used. The mobile phase was 0.1 M acetic acid/citric acid buffer (pH 3.5) containing Na<sub>2</sub>-EDTA (10 mg/L), octanesulfonic acid (200 mg/L), and methanol (17%). The flow rate was 0.5 mL/min.

<title>Dopamine and Its Metabolites Increased in the Striatum and/or Midbrain in FR Mice</title>
<p>Pharmacological studies have showed that both D<sub>1</sub>R and D<sub>2</sub>R are involved in FAA. Therefore, we further determined the levels of catecholamine, 5-HT, and their metabolites in various brain regions of mice. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0748730412455913">Fig. 6A</xref>, the level of dopamine in the striatum of FR mice pretreated with vehicle was significantly increased by 32% and 33%, respectively, as compared with the ad libitum mice pretreated with vehicle or SCH23390 and raclopride. The dopamine metabolite DOPAC in the striatum also significantly increased in FR mice as compared with the ad libitum mice pretreated with vehicle. In the midbrain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0748730412455913">Fig. 6B</xref>), the levels of DOPAC and HVA were significantly elevated in FR mice as compared with the ad libitum mice, whereas there were no differences observed in dopamine concentrations among groups. With respect to dopamine turnover, an index of neuronal activity calculated as a ratio of (DOPAC+HVA)/DA in the midbrain was significantly increased in FR mice as compared with the ad libitum mice pretreated with vehicle. However, levels of norepinephrine, DA, DOPAC, HVA, 5-HT, and 5-HIAA were not altered in the cortex, hippocampus, thalamus, hypothalamus, or medulla oblongata (data not shown). Taken together, these findings suggest that FR increased dopaminergic transmission, which might be involved in FR-induced FAA.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The present results showed that the dopaminergic system including dopamine, D<sub>1</sub>R, and D<sub>2</sub>R, but not histaminergic H<sub>1</sub>R, mediated FAA induced by FR.</p>
<p>D<sub>1</sub>R and D<sub>2</sub>R are the most widely and abundantly expressed receptors for DA in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0748730412455913">Monti and Monti, 2007</xref>). D<sub>1</sub>R is a postsynaptic receptor coupled to adenylate cyclase, and its stimulation facilitates the activity of the enzyme. D<sub>2</sub>R is expressed both as presynaptic autoreceptors on dopamine neurons and terminals and as postsynaptic receptors on target cells, and the D<sub>2</sub>R subfamily is coupled to the inhibition of adenylate cyclase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0748730412455913">Monti and Monti, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0748730412455913">Usiello et al., 2000</xref>). D<sub>1</sub>R and D<sub>2</sub>R play an important role in control of locomotor and motivated behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0748730412455913">Kobayashi et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0748730412455913">Tomiyama et al., 2001</xref>). Activation of postsynaptic D<sub>1</sub>R or D<sub>2</sub>R or blockade of presynaptic D<sub>2</sub>R increased locomotor activity, whereas activation of D<sub>2</sub> autoreceptors or blockade of postsynaptic D<sub>1</sub>R or D<sub>2</sub>R inhibited spontaneous locomotor activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0748730412455913">Costall et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0748730412455913">Rouillon et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0748730412455913">Skirboll et al., 1979</xref>). Selective D<sub>1</sub>R antagonist SCH23390 and D<sub>2</sub>R antagonist raclopride blocked morphine- or nerve growth factor-induced hyperactivity, and the effect of D<sub>2</sub>R antagonist appears to be stronger than that of D<sub>1</sub>R antagonist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0748730412455913">Kobayashi et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0748730412455913">Rodriguez-Arias et al., 2000</xref>). These results support our present findings that D<sub>1</sub>R and D<sub>2</sub>R are involved in FAA, with D<sub>2</sub>R being more important than D<sub>1</sub>R. In addition, activation of D<sub>2</sub>R has been demonstrated to regulate expression of clock genes in the striatum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0748730412455913">Hood et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0748730412455913">Imbesi et al., 2009</xref>), a region important for motor control, food feeding, and reward, suggesting that the dopaminergic system in the striatum might be involved in circadian food anticipation. Although previous studies showed that mutant mice lacking clock genes exhibited normal FAA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0748730412455913">Pendergast et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0748730412455913">Storch and Weitz, 2009</xref>), the existence of compensatory mechanism in these mice may address this reason. These mice lack clock genes throughout the brain and body, making it impossible to localize the actions of clock genes or to determine whether the effects are due to disruptions of circadian rhythms or simply to the lack of clock genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0748730412455913">Amir and Stewart, 2009</xref>). Contrary to our results, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0748730412455913">Mistlberger and Mumby (1992)</xref> found no effects of dopamine receptor inhibition and large dopamine lesions of nucleus accumbens on FAA in rats. In their studies, dopamine receptor antagonist was given 30 min prior to feeding time; therefore, it did not inhibit total locomotor activity for 2-3 hours (FAA) before food access. In the present study, dopamine receptor antagonist was given 2 hours prior to feeding time and increased total locomotor activity for 2 hours before food access was significantly inhibited. In the studies by Mistlberger and Mumby, large nucleus accumbens lesions did not inhibit FAA; however, we determined the levels of dopamine and its metabolite DOPAC in the striatum and the midbrain but not lesioned nucleus accumbens. Our results showed that the levels of dopamine and its metabolite DOPAC in the striatum and dopamine metabolites in the midbrain were significantly increased during FAA. These results are similar to previous reports that food deprivation or restriction increases locomotor activity and levels of dopamine and its metabolite in the nucleus accumbens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0748730412455913">Heffner et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0748730412455913">McCullough and Salamone, 1992</xref>). Another study showed that lesions of the core of nucleus accumbens attenuated FAA, whereas lesions of the nucleus accumbens shell had no effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0748730412455913">Mendoza et al., 2005</xref>). Therefore, the difference in administration time of dopamine receptor antagonists and lesion regions might result in the discrepancy between our findings and those of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0748730412455913">Mistlberger and Mumby (1992)</xref>. Taken together, our results indicated that FAA could be regulated by the dopaminergic system, including dopamine, D<sub>1</sub>R, and D<sub>2</sub>R.</p>
<p>Concomitant activation of D<sub>1</sub>R and D<sub>2</sub>R is crucial in the control of diverse physiological function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0748730412455913">Aizman et al., 2000</xref>). Mice that are double-KO for D<sub>1</sub>R and D<sub>2</sub>R are severely growth retarded, with altered feeding behavior and a dysfunctional gastrointestinal system, suggesting an interrelationship between D<sub>1</sub> and D<sub>2</sub> receptor–mediated regulation of motor activity, food intake, and gastrointestinal functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0748730412455913">Kobayashi et al., 2004</xref>). Pretreatment of D<sub>2</sub>R KO mice with a D<sub>1</sub>R antagonist completely abolished the arousal effects of modafinil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0748730412455913">Qu et al., 2008</xref>). In the present study, coadministration of SCH23390 and raclopride was more potent in inhibiting FAA induced by FR as compared with using either alone. However, the spontaneous locomotor activity in the dark period in the ad libitum mice was not inhibited by copretreatment with SCH23390 and raclopride. These results indicated the presence of cooperative or synergistic functional interactions between D<sub>1</sub>R and D<sub>2</sub>R in regulation of FAA.</p>
<p>The histaminergic system is thought to modulate many functions of the hypothalamus that exhibit circadian and other rhythms, such as arousal state, locomotor activity, and feeding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0748730412455913">Huang et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0748730412455913">Inoue et al., 1996</xref>). Mutant mice lacking H<sub>1</sub>R demonstrated decreased spontaneous locomotor activity and exploratory behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0748730412455913">Inoue et al., 1996</xref>). The H<sub>1</sub>R antagonist pyrilamine significantly inhibited spontaneous locomotor activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0748730412455913">Lozeva et al., 2000</xref>). These results suggested that histamine increases spontaneous locomotor activity through H<sub>1</sub>R in mice given ad libitum access. Consistent with these results, our study also showed that the H<sub>1</sub>R antagonist pyrilamine at 10 mg/kg decreased the spontaneous locomotor activity during the dark period in the ad libitum mice. However, during the restricted feeding schedule, pretreatment with the H<sub>1</sub>R antagonist pyrilamine did not significantly inhibit FAA, indicating that the role for the histaminergic H<sub>1</sub>R in FR-induced FAA is different from that for spontaneous locomotor activity. Several studies have shown that the food anticipatory–induced signals from the food-entrainable oscillator are transmitted downstream to the arousal related areas, such as orexin neurons in the perifornical area (PeF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0748730412455913">Akiyama et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0748730412455913">Kaur et al., 2008</xref>). The TMN receives direct projections from the orexinergic neurons and may help regulate arousal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0748730412455913">Huang et al., 2001</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0748730412455913">Angeles-Castellanos et al. (2004)</xref> reported that the TMN might be involved in the arousal state during food anticipation. Furthermore, the activation of the TMN was associated primarily with arousal during feeding-related motivated behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0748730412455913">Valdes et al., 2005</xref>). Although histaminergic neurons of the TMN show activation of c-Fos protein during the food anticipatory phase in FR rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0748730412455913">Inzunza et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0748730412455913">Meynard et al., 2005</xref>), these data were based on the sampling of a single horizontal section of the TMN; therefore, their interpretation must be addressed with limitations, especially for the TMN, which contains many neuronal phenotypes. Collectively, our results suggested that the activation of the TMN might mediate only the nonspecific arousal state but not increased locomotor activity in the FAA-related activity.</p>
<p>Several lines of evidence indicate that FAA might not rely on a single nucleus but rather might be a distributed system consisting of interacting nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0748730412455913">Poulin and Timofeeva, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0748730412455913">Storch and Weitz, 2009</xref>). This distributed network may ensure the maintenance of vital physiological functions and behavior directed toward food seeking, feeding, and adequate preservation of energy resources. Therefore, it is important that such essential functions be maintained by redundant neurotransmission in a distributed network that functions harmoniously as a whole but also has a capacity for compensation and plasticity. D<sub>1</sub>R and D<sub>2</sub>R play an important role in the maintenance of many physiological functions and behavior, such as feeding and food- or drug-seeking behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0748730412455913">Ball et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0748730412455913">Sun and Rebec, 2005</xref>). Double-KO mice for D<sub>1</sub>R and D<sub>2</sub>R do not survive to the second or third week after birth due to severely growth-retarded with altered feeding behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0748730412455913">Kobayashi et al., 2004</xref>). Adequate preservation of energy resources is closely related with feeding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0748730412455913">Currie et al., 2011</xref>). Several studies suggest the influence of gastrointestinal tract-elicited signals as a driving force for FAA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0748730412455913">LeSauter et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0748730412455913">Morgado et al., 2011</xref>). D<sub>1</sub>R and D<sub>2</sub>R have been reported to mediate regulation of gastrointestinal functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0748730412455913">Cooper and Barber, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0748730412455913">Kobayashi et al., 2004</xref>), suggesting that gastrointestinal D<sub>1</sub> and D<sub>2</sub> receptors signal might be one of factors responsible for modulating FAA. Because D<sub>1</sub>R and D<sub>2</sub>R are the most abundant and widely expressed DA receptor in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0748730412455913">Monti and Monti, 2007</xref>), these receptor antagonists might decrease FAA mainly through the central nervous system. Although our findings do not address the whole distributed network that drives FAA, they provide information on the role of dopamine and D<sub>1</sub>R and D<sub>2</sub>R as components of the distributed system for the food-entrainable system.</p>
<p>In other studies, food is given in the middle of the light phase in order to observe FAA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0748730412455913">Moriya et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0748730412455913">Storch and Weitz, 2009</xref>). However, the manipulation of removing and adding food during the light phase interferes with the activity of the light-dark cycle because during the light phase, rodents spend most of the time resting. In the present study, in order to prevent the manipulation of removing and adding food from interfering with the light-dark cycle during the light periods, we chose the restricted feeding regime: The food was given at ZT 12 (lights off) and withdrawn at ZT 14. When food is provided during the day, the increased nocturnal activity is not altered by FAA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0748730412455913">Moriya et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0748730412455913">Storch and Weitz, 2009</xref>). In present studies, food was provided during the first 2 hours of the dark phase; once food was accessed, the nocturnal activity counts would temporarily decreased. However, the total nocturnal activity counts were more than the total diurnal activity counts, suggesting that the increased nocturnal activity still exists in the FR mice.</p>
<p>Herein we demonstrated that the levels of dopamine in the striatum and dopamine metabolites in the midbrain were significantly increased during FR-induced FAA. Pretreatment with the dopaminergic D<sub>1</sub>R or D<sub>2</sub>R antagonist significantly inhibited FAA, and there appear to be cooperative or synergistic effects between D<sub>1</sub>R and D<sub>2</sub>R. However, pretreatment with histaminergic H<sub>1</sub>R antagonist did not significantly inhibit FAA in FR mice, although it decreased the spontaneous locomotor activity during the dark period in the ad libitum mice. In conclusion, these findings indicated that the dopaminergic system, but not histaminergic H<sub>1</sub>R, is involved in FAA induced by FR.</p>
