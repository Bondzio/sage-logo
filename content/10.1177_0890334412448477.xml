<sec id="section1-0890334412448477">
<title>Background:</title>
<p>Since 2001, Quebec’s ministry of health and social services has prioritized implementation of the Baby-Friendly Initiative (BFI), which includes the original hospital initiative and its expansion to community services.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0890334412448477">
<title>Objective:</title>
<p>The objective was to document across the province compliance with the BFI’s Ten Steps to Successful Breastfeeding in hospitals, Seven Point Plan in community health centers (CHCs), and International Code of Marketing of Breast-Milk Substitutes (Code).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0890334412448477">
<title>Methods:</title>
<p>Using managers/staff, mothers, and observers, the author measured the extent of implementation of indicators formulated for each step/point and the Code, based on the revised WHO/UNICEF recommendations.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0890334412448477">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>Mean compliance scores in Quebec were 3.13 for 140 CHCs (range, 0 to 7) and 4.54 for 60 hospitals/birthing centers (range, 0 to 10). The mean compliance score for the Code was 0.69 for both CHCs and hospitals/birthing centers. The evaluation documented marked variations in implementation level for each of the steps/points and the Code. Also, managers/staff, mothers, and observers differed in their report of BFI compliance for most steps/points and the Code. Facilities that had applied for or obtained BFI designation demonstrated higher compliance with the BFI than those that had not.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0890334412448477">
<title>Conclusions:</title>
<p>Results disseminated to participating organizations allowed comparisons on a regional/provincial perspective and in relation to BFI-designated facilities. Furthermore, this first portrait of BFI compliance in Quebec provided provincial, regional, and local health authorities with valuable information that can be used to bring about policy and organizational changes to achieve the international standards required for Baby-Friendly certification.</p>

<title>Background</title>
<p>In 1991, the WHO and UNICEF launched the Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative (BFHI).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0890334412448477">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0890334412448477"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0890334412448477">3</xref></sup> Since then, BFHI implementation has become a global strategy to increase breastfeeding duration and exclusivity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0890334412448477">4</xref></sup> by encouraging hospitals to comply with evidence-based breastfeeding-related policies and practices, outlined in Ten Steps to Successful Breastfeeding (Ten Steps)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0890334412448477">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0890334412448477">3</xref></sup> and the International Code of Marketing of Breast-Milk Substitutes (Code).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0890334412448477">5</xref></sup> To reflect the continuum of care between hospital and community services in 1999, the Breastfeeding Committee for Canada proposed an expansion of the BFHI by introducing the Seven Point Plan for the Protection, Promotion and Support of Breastfeeding in Community Health Services (Seven Points),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0890334412448477">6</xref></sup> and the initiative the was renamed the Baby-Friendly Initiative (BFI).</p>
<p>In 2006, the WHO/UNICEF posted on their Website the first version (finalized in 2009) of the revised BFHI Global Criteria, which included more rigorous standards in regard to skin-to-skin contact (immediately after birth for at least an hour, unless medically justified) and rooming-in (no mother/baby separation allowed, unless for justified reasons), and now applying these standards to both vaginal and cesarean deliveries without general anesthesia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0890334412448477">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>Since 2001, Quebec’s ministère de la Santé et des Services sociaux (Ministry of Health and Social Services, or MSSS) has prioritized the BFI to promote breastfeeding duration and exclusivity among 87 000 women delivering annually in the province.<sup>8-11</sup> Particularly, the BFI was the main strategy retained in the province’s 2001–2007 Breastfeeding Guidelines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0890334412448477">8</xref></sup> and is a priority activity in the legally mandated 2003–2012 provincial public health plan.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0890334412448477">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0890334412448477">10</xref></sup> To date, 43 hospitals, community health centers (CHCs), and birthing centers belonging to 19 merged local services networks and 1 university network have been designated Baby-Friendly in Quebec,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0890334412448477">12</xref></sup> after passing an external evaluation confirming they met the standards described in the Ten Steps, the Seven Points, and the Code. In 2010, evaluation tools used for external assessments in Quebec were revised to include the new WHO/UNICEF recommendations and the Seven Points were integrated into the Ten Steps. The designation process is coordinated by a BFI Accreditation Committee, under the responsibility of Quebec’s MSSS. The author of this article has been a member of this committee since 2004 and has worked for the MSSS since 2009.</p>
<p>In parallel, the public health authority of the Montérégie (second largest region in the province of Quebec) had been developing and testing a methodology to assess BFI compliance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0890334412448477">13</xref></sup> This resulted in successive improved versions of 2 bilingual computerized tools to measure compliance in hospital and community settings.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0890334412448477">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0890334412448477"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0890334412448477"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0890334412448477">17</xref></sup> The tools include questionnaires and observation grids to assist data collection from the same information sources used during the BFI designation process, that is, pregnant women/mothers, managers/staff, and an external observer. Answers and observations are used to calculate implementation of the Ten Steps, the Seven Points, and the Code, summarized by composite compliance scores (see the methods section). It also includes tables and graphs to present assessment results.</p>

<p>In 2007, the provincial ministry gave the mandate to the Montérégie regional public health authority to coordinate an evaluation to document BFI implementation level in health care organizations caring for mothers and babies across Quebec. The purpose of the evaluation was 2-fold: (1) to assess the level of implementation of the BFI in response to the breastfeeding guidelines published in 2001<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0890334412448477">8</xref></sup> as well as a midway evaluation of the provincial public health program 2003–2012<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0890334412448477">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0890334412448477">10</xref></sup> and (2) to provide birthing facilities and CHCs with pertinent information to help them implement the latest international recommendations. To our knowledge, this evaluation is the only exercise that has attempted to measure compliance with all of the WHO/UNICEF’s revised Ten Steps<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0890334412448477">7</xref></sup> and the Code, using 3 sources of information. This article focuses on the process and results of the evaluation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0890334412448477" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>The evaluation used a cross-sectional design. Based on a triangulation approach, compliance with the Ten Steps for maternity units, the Seven Points for CHCs, and the Code was measured using the perspective of managers/staff, mothers, and an observer. The facilities targeted by the evaluation were those offering prenatal, obstetrical, and postnatal care in Quebec’s 18 regions. The regional public health authorities were responsible for recruiting the facilities and for the data collection process. Each region hired 1 or more observer–interviewers with expertise on breastfeeding/BFI who received a full-day training on data collection procedures for the evaluation.</p>
<p>Each participant facility received at least 1 prescheduled visit from the observer–interviewer to perform the observation and conduct the interviews with the manager and staff. Eligible staff included nurses, physicians, midwifes, nutritionists, lactation consultants, and other personnel likely to provide breastfeeding-related care, who had worked in the unit for at least 6 months. They were randomly selected between February and November 2007 from a list of those present during the observer–interviewer’s visit. To control data collection costs, the recommended sample size was 1 manager and at least 4 staff for each CHC and hospital/birthing center with fewer than 1000 births annually and 1 manager and at least 9 staff for hospitals with 1000 or more births annually. Each regional authority was free to increase the sample size for the facilities in their region. The required duration of observation was at least 1 hour. Observations targeted documentation and educational/promotional materials; observations of postpartum mother–baby dyads were optional.</p>
<p>Mothers were selected randomly from birth certificates received by the regional public health authorities between January and September 2007, stratified by CHC and level of vulnerability (mothers aged younger than 20 years or with incomplete high school were considered vulnerable). The objective was to retain 10 mothers (3 of them vulnerable) for each CHC, who were subsequently redistributed according to the hospital where they gave birth, to study BFI compliance in hospitals. For sampling purposes, participating birthing centers were considered as CHCs, and the objective was also to select 10 mothers (3 of them vulnerable) giving birth in this type of facility. (Quebec has a small network of birthing centers run by midwives who attended in 2007 less than 2% of births in the province.) Eligible mothers had at least 1 telephone call or visit from their CHC after discharge from the birthing facility, and their baby had received breast milk at least once during the 24 hours preceding that first contact with the CHC. (Under Quebec’s public health care system, there is a policy that recommends CHCs systematically call new mothers within 24 hours after their discharge from the birthing facility and do a home visit within 24-72 hours from discharge.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0890334412448477">11</xref></sup>) Mothers were interviewed by phone when their babies were older than 7 days and younger than 6 months. However, regional authorities were instructed to try to recruit mothers when their infant was between 6 and 10 weeks (or the closest possible to that age) to be sufficiently spaced from birth to allow delivery of assessed postnatal services while trying to minimize the risk of recall bias of prenatal and birth experiences. Inclusion and exclusion criteria are summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0890334412448477">Figure 1</xref>.</p>

Using the BFI as a framework, the tools measure a set of indicators formulated for each step/point and the Code (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0890334412448477">Table 1</xref>). Each indicator was measured with 1 or 2, mostly open-ended, questions or observations. To enhance comparability, whenever possible, questions on a given policy or practice (and the corresponding indicator) were similar for each perspective. However, staff responded in terms of their own as well as their team’s usual practices, whereas maternal answers related directly to the care they received. To better understand implementation level of the more strict standards related to skin-to-skin contact and rooming-in, information was collected for these steps by type of delivery (vaginal or cesarean) and additional questions were asked to allow for comparison with the 1992 BFHI Global Criteria.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0890334412448477">1</xref></sup></p>

<p>The Code seeks to protect and promote breastfeeding by ensuring the proper use of breast milk substitutes on the basis of adequate information and through appropriate marketing and distribution. For the purposes of the present evaluation, selected elements of the Code targeting health care facilities were adapted for the assessment tools.</p>
</fn>
</table-wrap-foot>
</table-wrap>
<p>The extent of implementation of each indicator was obtained by calculating the percentage of compliant or “correct” answers/observations. To consider an indicator completely implemented, its extent of implementation had to attain a 75% threshold (eg, at least 75% of mothers report they were taught in the hospital how to manually express breast milk). It should be noted that for the BFI designation process, an 80% threshold is required for most standards. For this evaluation, many facilities had 1 manager and 4 staff participating. Managers had the possibility to answer not applicable for questions measuring compliance with clinical practices if they were not familiar with “usual” practices in their service, leaving 4 staff to answer. An 80% threshold would require that all 4 staff give a compliant answer. A 75% would require that 3 out of 4 staff give a compliant answer, more in line with the spirit of the BFHI, which does not require perfect compliance with proposed practices. To summarize compliance, composite scores were constructed for each step/point (partial scores) and for all Ten Steps, all Seven Points, and the Code (global scores). To build the Step or Point partial compliance score, a value of 1 or 0 points was attributed to each indicator depending whether it was completely implemented or not. The score was then calculated by adding all the points attributed to each indicator of the given step/point divided by the maximum amount of points that would be accumulated if all the indicators of the step/point were completely implemented, resulting in a score that varied between 0 (<italic>no indicators completely implemented</italic>) and 1 (<italic>all indicators completely implemented</italic>). Global compliance scores were thereafter obtained by adding the partial compliance scores and thus varied between 0 and 10 for the Ten Steps and 0 and 7 for the Seven Points. The Code global compliance score was calculated in the same way as a partial score also with a range between 0 and 1. To examine the contribution of each source of information or perspective, partial compliance scores were reanalyzed by dividing the total amount of points obtained for each perspective (managers/staff, mothers, and observer) by the maximum amount of points that could have been accumulated for the perspective and renamed “partitioned” compliance scores. Detailed description of the methodology is available elsewhere.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0890334412448477">44</xref></sup></p>
<p>Descriptive statistics were used to quantify the extent of implementation of the indicators and to describe the distribution of BFI compliance scores for all 140 participating CHCs and 60 hospitals/birthing centers in Quebec. Means and standard deviations were used when the normality assumption was not seriously violated; otherwise, medians and interquartile range (IQR) values were used. When appropriate, data were analyzed by pooling answers from managers/staff or mothers. Weighting was performed to account for oversampling of vulnerable mothers as well as for noneligible and nonrespondent mothers. Descriptive statistics were also performed to describe BFI compliance in CHCs for each participating region and by type of facility delivering obstetrical care. Finally, significance testing was performed to explore differences in scores between perspectives and between facilities that had applied for or obtained BFI designation or not. Unless specified, <italic>t</italic> tests and ANOVA (in steps/points measured by 3 perspectives) were used when the normality assumption was not seriously violated; otherwise the nonparametric Kruskal–Wallis (K-W) test was used.</p>
<p>The evaluation was approved by the Ethics Committee of Charles LeMoyne Hospital. Because the assessment concerned the evaluation of a legally mandated public health plan, health care facilities were not required to submit the project to local ethic committees.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0890334412448477">45</xref></sup> All managers, staff, and mothers gave informed consent.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Of 18 regions, 16 agreed to participate: in 14 regions all the facilities participated, and in 2 others only half participated (partial participation). Reasons for not participating mostly arose from the regional authorities (unable to assume the cost of data collection, absence of a resource person to organize data collection). In 1 region with partial participation, some facilities refused to participate. Regions with partial or no participation represent 7.4% and 1.1%, respectively, of births in Quebec in 2007.</p>
<p>In total, 55 of 64 hospitals (86%), 138 of 152 local community services centers (Centres locaux des services communautaires, or CLSCs) (91%), 9 of 21 dispensaries in northern territories (43%), and 5 of 7 birthing centers (71%) agreed to participate. Since 2004, these facilities have been organized into either 95 local services networks responsible for the accessibility and continuity of services offered to the population living in their territory or 4 university networks. At the heart of each local services network, we have health and social services centers, which were created by merging CLSCs, nonuniversity hospitals, and long-term care centers. Currently, CLSCs deliver services to women residing in a defined territory, whereas hospitals (even if they belong to a local service network) can deliver obstetrical services to women living in different CLSC territories and in different regions. Regarding BFI status, 13 of 14 facilities that had applied for or obtained the designation at the time of the evaluation agreed to participated (1 certified birthing center with 158 births in 2007 did not participate). All 13 university hospitals participated. In this article we refer to all 60 hospitals and birthing centers as “hospitals” and all 140 CLSCs and dispensaries as CHCs (7 were excluded because at least 1 source of information was missing).</p>
<p>The sample of staff/managers included 535 out of 683 eligible hospital personnel (78% response rate) and 826 out of 856 eligible CHC personnel (96% response rate). To be noted, more than half of the 148 managers/staff who did not respond worked in 2 hospitals that had difficulties with sampling procedures (response rates of 30% and 44%). When excluded, the other 58 hospitals had a response rate of 90%. With regard to mothers, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0890334412448477">Figure 1</xref> depicts their selection among 2130 birth certificates, resulting in a sample of 1313 for CHCs and 1375 for hospitals. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0890334412448477">Table 2</xref> presents the characteristics of health care facilities and participants.</p>

In addition, significant differences (K-W test) were found in CHCs’ partial compliance scores for points 1, 2, 3, and 6.

In 9 out of 15 steps/points (including the Code) where staff/manager and mothers were used as sources of information, complete implementation at the 75% level was reported significantly more frequently by staff/managers than mothers. For example, the mean point 3 partial compliance score concerning prenatal counseling in CHCs is 0.36 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0890334412448477">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0890334412448477">Table 3</xref>); the mean partitioned score for that same step is significantly higher (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001) for the managers/staff perspective (score of 0.65) than for mothers (score of 0.06) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0890334412448477">Figure 4</xref>). It is interesting that 7 of the other 8 steps/points with significantly higher compliance scores for managers/staff than for mothers also assessed either pre- and postnatal counseling (steps 3, 5, and 8, and points 4 and 5; all with <italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001) or collaboration with breastfeeding support groups (step 10, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001; point 7, K-W test, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001). Only 1 hospital practice, rooming-in, showed a significant difference between perspectives in this same direction (step 7, K-W test, <italic>P</italic> = .010).</p>

<p>The remaining 6 steps/points (including the Code) showed either nonsignificant differences between reports from managers/staff and mothers (step 9 and point 6, data not shown) or the opposite pattern of a significantly higher partitioned score for mothers than for managers/staff. This was observed in 2 hospital practices (step 4, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .025; step 6, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001) and the Code (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001 for CHCs and hospitals). For instance, reports of noncompliant skin-to-skin practice with cesarean deliveries contributed to a lower partitioned score for managers/staff than for mothers delivering for the most part (79%) vaginally. Finally, with the exception of point 6, partitioned scores revealed that mothers and observers differed in their reports (step 10, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001; point 7, K-W test, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001; Code, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001 for CHCs and hospitals). Partitioned scores for managers/staff and observers did not differ when measuring the adoption of a breastfeeding policy (step and point 1), or the Code for CHCs and hospitals (data not shown for all 4 scores) but were significantly different when assessing step 10 (<italic>P</italic> = .006) and point 7 (K-W test, <italic>P</italic> = .001).</p>
<p>The step or point with the lowest partial compliance score was step 7, or 24-hour rooming-in (defined as mother and baby not being separated, even if for a few minutes, unless for justified reasons). In contrast to skin-to-skin contact, mothers’ partitioned compliance score was very low despite having mostly delivered vaginally and presumably with fewer challenges in implementing 24-hour rooming-in. In fact, pooled analysis showed that 83% of 1375 mothers reported being separated from their babies during the hospital stay, the majority for unjustified reasons. Moreover, 68% of the reasons given for separation were for infant care for which the mother could have been present (blood testing, weighing or bathing, medical examination, ultrasound, etc) or so the mother could rest or sleep at night. Data collected to compare with the 1992 Global Criteria revealed that 70% of the 1144 mothers separated from their babies had more than 1 separation (20% separated 5 times or more) and 49% were separated—in the case of the longest separation—for more than 1 hour at a time.</p>
<p>Finally, compliance scores were examined by geographical distribution in the case of CHCs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0890334412448477">Table 3</xref>) and by type of birthing facility (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0890334412448477">Table 4</xref>). BFI compliance varied considerably between regions and the type of birthing facilities. The mean Seven Points global compliance score calculated for each region varied between 1.19 and 4.39 (maximum 7), and for the Code between 0.44 and 0.86 (maximum 1). In the case of obstetrical services, the largest discrepancy in mean scores was between birthing centers and university hospitals.</p>
<p>Dissemination of results was an important aspect of this evaluation. Key players had access to different type of results, from data of qualitative nature (comments formulated by managers/staff, mothers, and observers entered in the assessment tool) to composite scores summarizing BFI compliance. The same information was presented in different formats—raw data, tables, figure, and histograms—to ease the use of results. Authorities in the participating 16 regions received in 2008 several files and were instructed to send them to the facilities in their region. More specifically, they received the completed individual assessment tools for each of the CHCs and hospitals in their region, 2 other compendiums for their region regrouping results for each facility (one for CHCs and another for hospitals),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0890334412448477">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0890334412448477">47</xref></sup> and 2 other compendiums showing results for each of the 7 CHCs and 6 hospitals having applied for or obtained BFI-designation (identified by letters). The regions that had at least 1 birth center, received also a compendium with the results for each of the 5 birthing centers (only the one from their region identified by name). All files included results for the group as well as for the province. Finally, a report with a statistical compendium presenting detailed results (in French) is available in the MSSS Website.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0890334412448477">48</xref></sup></p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The BFI has been the main strategy promoted by Quebec’s health authorities to increase breastfeeding exclusivity and duration, and voluntary participation in the assessment was encouragingly high. Overall, policies and practices promoted by the initiative are being implemented—albeit with variations—in health care facilities across the province. Variations in BFI compliance among a geographical region have been documented elsewhere,<sup>26-29,33,34,36,41</sup> underscoring the extensive stepwise revision in perinatal services generally required to comply with the WHO/UNICEF recommendations.</p>
<p>Also, differing reports from managers/staff, mothers, and observers can affect assessment of BFI compliance. For example, we found a disconnect in breastfeeding-related counseling in both CHCs and hospitals, with wide differences between what staff reported teaching to mothers and what mothers reported having been taught on a given topic, because mothers reported not remembering what they were told, not receiving the teaching, or receiving the wrong information. Although staff desirability bias and maternal recall bias may<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0890334412448477">49</xref></sup> contribute to these discrepancies between reports,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0890334412448477">44</xref></sup> it raises the question—particularly in the context of shorter hospital stays and limited postpartum contacts with CHCs—of whether teaching content may be too abundant for mothers to retain the information, or may happen when mothers are less receptive,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0890334412448477">23</xref></sup> or may contain contradictory information when interacting with different professionals. Moreover, this finding would suggest for these particular steps/points the importance of interviewing mothers to prevent an overoptimistic view of their implementation.</p>
<p>Mismatched information when assessing compliance with certain hospital practices and the Code may be related to measurement methodology. For example, poor agreement around step 6 may be because the questions used to measure unjustified supplementation were different for managers/staff (asked to mention at least 2 acceptable medical reasons for supplementation according to the WHO/UNICEF) and mothers (asked if their baby had received something other than breast milk during the hospital stay and reasons for supplementation). Regarding step 4, compliance scores may have been influenced by sample characteristics. As described elsewhere, results analyzed by type of delivery (vaginal or cesarean) show staff/managers and mothers are more likely to report immediate and uninterrupted “true” skin-to-skin contact for vaginal deliveries than for caesareans.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0890334412448477">44</xref></sup> Thus, higher compliance reported by mothers for this step might be explained by the fact 79% of them delivered vaginally and reported their favorable experience with this type of delivery (the majority of vaginal birth experiences in the sample drove overall compliance up), whereas the staff had to report compliant practices for both vaginal and caesarean deliveries (their report on caesareans drove overall compliance down).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0890334412448477">44</xref></sup></p>
<p>Low compliance with rooming-in reported by both managers/staff and mothers highlights the challenges that hospitals face in implementing the revised recommendations. WHO/UNICEF moved away from allowing any unjustified mother-baby separations, even if for less than 1 hour, tolerated in the 1992 Global Criteria. In fact, our evaluation seems to indicate many separations could be avoided if nonemergency care were performed in the postpartum room or with the presence of the mother if care for her infant is required to be done elsewhere.</p>
<p>As expected, the organizations already designated BFI or having applied for certification showed higher global compliance scores than those that had not. With regard to the partial compliance scores, differences in the first 2 steps/points can be explained by the fact that to apply for BFI designation, the organization needs to have a breastfeeding policy and needs to submit proof that staff fulfilled appropriate training. It is not surprising that CHCs that had applied for or obtained BFI designation provided a more welcoming atmosphere for breastfeeding families. As to hospitals’ practices, mothers having delivered in designated facilities were more likely to have experienced skin-to-skin contact with their babies, in line with recommendations, and were less likely to have been separated from their infant for unjustified reasons. Despite their superiority, the relatively low scores for BFI hospitals can be partly explained by the fact their designation was attributed based on the older and less strict 1992 BFHI Global Criteria.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0890334412448477">1</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="section12-0890334412448477">
<title>Strengths and Limitations</title>
<p>The methodology’s main strengths and limitations have been described elsewhere.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0890334412448477">44</xref></sup> One of its strengths is the use of triangulation of information sources and analysis that allow documenting discrepancies in reports from different sources.</p>
<p>In this particular evaluation, another strength relates to the random selection of participants that guards against selection bias. Furthermore, to ensure representativeness of the participants, weighting was performed to account for the oversampling of vulnerable mothers as well as those noneligible and nonrespondents. By doing so, weighted estimates of the extent of implementation of the indicators measuring the BFI and corresponding compliance scores can be inferred to the whole territory served by the CHC.</p>
<p>The main limitations were related to the fact that 2 regions and half of the facilities of 2 others did not participate in the evaluation, hampering the generalization of results to the whole province. For those facilities that did participate, the more important limitation was the small sample size used, especially when measuring policies and practices with large variation in their extent of implementation (ie, closer to 50%). Because personal experiences conveyed by mothers are likely more variable than the generalizations managers/staff are asked to report,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0890334412448477">44</xref></sup> the evaluation aimed for a larger sample size for mothers. Also, instead of pooling data to measure BFI compliance, we chose to perform the mean or the median of the estimates for each CHCs of a given region or the province, without considering the number of births in the territories. This was done to respect the nature of BFI designation, where standards and assessment procedures are the same for all facilities and to provide reference values for individual facilities. In regard to this limitation, previous use of the methodology in the Montérégie region seems to support the reliability of the measurement techniques. When comparing the compliance scores from this evaluation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0890334412448477">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0890334412448477">48</xref></sup> with those obtained in 2001 and 2004 for hospitals,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0890334412448477">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0890334412448477">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0890334412448477">50</xref></sup> and 2005 for CHCs,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0890334412448477">50</xref></sup> we observed similar patterns in BFI implementation. Furthermore, although there is no established gold standard to determine the accuracy of the methodology, it is noteworthy that it allows differentiating BFI-designated facilities from those that are not. More specifically, only 5 of 187 facilities that had not applied for or obtained BFI designation in 2007 had a Ten Step or Seven Points Global Compliance score higher than the mean for facilities that had done so. This is important because results of this type of evaluation can be useful for organizations in preparing for BFI certification or recertification based on the revised standards. In fact, this evaluation seems to be the only exercise that has attempted to fully measure the revised 2009 BFHI Global Criteria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0890334412448477">7</xref></sup> in hospitals and community settings.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The present evaluation provided Quebec’s MSSS a first detailed portrait of BFI compliance in hospitals, birthing centers, and CHCs across the province, based on the latest recommendations.</p>
<p>Results available in different formats allowed each participating facility to compare itself to other facilities in the same region, to other regions and the province as a whole, and to BFI-designated facilities. The ultimate goal is to provide key players at the provincial, regional, and local levels with information that will assist them in bringing about policy and organizational changes required to progress toward achieving the international standards required for Baby-Friendly designation.</p>
