<p>The Sandinista Revolution in Nicaragua is far removed—in time, technology, and geography—from the wave of Arab Spring revolutions witnessed recently. Yet, books like <italic>Adiós Muchachos</italic> allow us to understand the intricacies of political struggles in our current world. As Sergio Ramírez’s recollection of the Sandinista liberation suggests, revolutions are a tricky business. They do not happen within a vacuum. In fact, navigating the resulting power vacuum left by overthrowing a regime may be the best that revolutionaries could hope for. Furthermore, in the case of Nicaragua, the Sandinista Revolution occurred during the Cold War, resulting in further entrenchment in U.S. global politics as well as a less-than-subtle conflict with the Catholic Church.</p>
<p>Originally published in 1999, this edition of <italic>Adiós Muchachos</italic> contains Ramírez’s views on more recent developments in the Sandinista regime, including the re-election of Daniel Ortega as president in 2006. Like many memoirs, the book has a nostalgic tone. But despite being inter-dispersed with Nicaraguan poetry, it stops short of the melodramatic. A reader will undoubtedly ache for the purity of ideology and become queasy about the role that the United States played in Nicaragua’s history. Yet, Ramírez’s candid and ultimate disillusionment with the Sandinistas provides ample opportunity to respect the reality of what makes ideals so difficult to uphold.</p>
<p>Ramírez is the former vice president of Nicaragua and original member of the revolutionary government, making him a valid source of information, privy to intimate knowledge of the Sandinista revolution and the fallout thereafter. He provides as unbiased an assessment as we can expect from a memoir. He does not shy away from the fact that the revolution for the masses was led by a minority of elite individuals: writers, doctors, and lawyers.</p>
<p>Beyond being a valid and interesting source, Ramírez is also an accomplished writer, whose literary skill shines through in every detail of the memoir. His words leave vivid details lingering in the mind of readers: intrepid mothers bringing food to their sons on the battlefield, bodies lying in pools of blood, and the swell of elation among the people as the revolutionary government returned to the country. The book is overflowing with fascinating anecdotes, including recollections of Ramírez’s personal meetings with Jimmy Carter, Fidel Castro, and Muammar Gaddafi. Perhaps most memorable is the Sandinista interaction with Pope John Paul II and the events surrounding his disastrous 1983 visit to Nicaragua.</p>
<p>In short, a lot can be learned from this book that transcends history and present-day affairs. <italic>Adiós Muchachos</italic> provides the reader with inside knowledge of revolutions, global politics, and human aspirations. And perhaps the best gift this book offers is the opportunity to learn while enjoying a great read.</p>
