<p>As the Family Medical Review Act (FMLA) approaches its 20th year, employers continue to face a costly and burdensome policy that often yields confusing outcomes in the courtroom. For example, in disagreement with the Department of Labor’s understanding of FMLA, the courts have determined that a period of unemployment may sometimes be ignored when determining eligibility. Likewise, in certain situations, time spent at a previous and different employer may also count toward FMLA eligibility. With 52% of employees using FMLA and the cost of defense amounting to $80,000 per claim, employers will greatly benefit from developing an FMLA strategy, possibly to include punishment.</p>

<p>Imagine entering the workforce after graduating with a college degree and racking up thousands of dollars in student loan debt, just to be told by your doctor that you have a serious health condition. Most people would instantly fear losing their newly acquired positions. Prior to 1993 and the inception of the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), this fear was not just a concern but rather a reality.</p>
<p>Before the FMLA, there was no protection for an employee who had to take valid medical leave from his or her employer. Although the FMLA was intended to provide protection and benefits to employees, the outcomes resulting from its passage have caused vague interpretations for both employers and employees. As a result, employers carry the burden of providing coverage for workers who use FMLA. Thus, employers should define policies that adhere to the requirements promulgated by the Department of Labor (DOL) and courts. Additionally, employers should train HR professionals and supervisors so that they can help ensure compliance. But to recognize the true cost of the act, one must first understand why it was created.</p>
<sec id="section1-0886368712440485">
<title>FMLA Coverage</title>
<p>The FMLA was signed into law on February 5, 1993, with the intention of providing protection for employees who need to miss work because of birth or adoption of a child, a serious health condition or an immediate family member’s serious health condition and, later, for family members of active duty military personnel. This created an avenue for employees to balance both work and home life and provided 12 administrative workweeks, or up to 60 workdays, for these types of qualifying events. In 2009, the FMLA was updated to provide 26 weeks of coverage for covered service members. This coverage is provided for employees who are caring for a covered service member with ailments stemming from the line of duty while on active duty status.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0886368712440485">1</xref></sup></p>
<boxed-text id="boxed-text1-0886368712440485">
<p><italic>FMLA Basics</italic></p>
<p>In general, to be eligible an employee must have worked for an employer for at least 12 months, have worked at least 1,250 hours in the 12 months preceding the leave, and work at a site with at least 50 employees within 75 miles.</p>
<p><italic>Source</italic>: U.S. DOL, Wage &amp; Hour Division.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0886368712440485">2</xref></sup></p>
</boxed-text>
<p>Although the opportunities and eligibility for FMLA were created by Congress with reasonable simplicity, many FMLA rulings bring clarity to one part of the act whereas another part becomes vague. As a result, the ever-evolving coverage expands yearly as the cost of providing FMLA increases.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0886368712440485">
<title>The Costs of FMLA</title>
<p>One estimate is that an employer of 1,000 employees can expect a cost of $720,000 annually when the company’s absence rate increases by just 1%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0886368712440485">3</xref></sup> This cost is driven by the utilization of both paid and unpaid leave as well as by productivity loss.</p>
<p>To cover the cost incurred when employees invoke FMLA, companies must pass the costs to customers or perhaps cut employee benefits in other ways, such as decreasing pensions or 401K matches or requiring their employees to pay a higher portion of health care premiums.</p>
<p>The Employment Policy Foundation, based in Washington, D.C., indicated that the FMLA cost employers $21 billion in 2004. According to Bates,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0886368712440485">4</xref></sup> this figure only “represents the costs attributable to net labor replacement costs, lost productivity, and continued health benefits. Additionally, Bates argues that employers paid an astounding $10.3 billion in wages alone to employees for taking on additional shifts and overtime to cover those employees who invoked FMLA. In addition to these primary costs stemming from FMLA, there are other complicated issues employers must face.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0886368712440485">
<title>Complicated Issues of FMLA for Employers</title>
<p>The majority of employers have their employees’ well-being in mind as they adhere to the policies of FMLA. However, to avoid litigation the employers must err on the side of caution, which has resulted in an estimated 52% of employees being granted leave even though they do not qualify.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0886368712440485">5</xref></sup> Even when employers think they are in compliance with the FMLA, they may risk litigation. One such case occurred when the court determined that an employee of just 7 months was covered under the FMLA. This occurred after an employee separated and then rejoined his employer after a 5-year break. In opposition to the U.S. DOL’s “Friend of the Court” filing, the First Circuit Court chose to disregard the employment gap of 5 years and measure the earned 1,250 hours as though the employment was continuous. Furthermore, employment at a <italic>different</italic> employer can sometimes count toward FMLA eligibility. This scenario nearly became a reality for Dollar Tree Stores, Inc., when it acquired Factory 2-U Stores.</p>
<p>In the court case, <italic>Christina Sullivan v. Dollar Tree Stores, Inc</italic>., which made it to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, it was determined that Dollar Tree Stores could be held liable for a new employee’s claim for FMLA after a short period of time, if Dollar Tree Stores met certain requirements, making it a successor in interest. The factors that were considered in this case to determine whether Dollar Tree Stores, Inc. was, in fact, a successor in interest
<disp-quote>
<p>include[d]: substantial continuity of the same business operations; [the] use of the same plant; continuity of the work force; similarity of jobs and working conditions; similarity of supervisory personnel; similarity in machinery, equipment, and production methods; similarity of products or services; and the ability of the predecessor to provide relief.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0886368712440485">6</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Sullivan, the plaintiff, carried the burden of proof and was required to prove that Dollar Tree Stores was a successor in interest. It was also noted in the case that to determine if one was a successor in interest, all the factors must to be “considered in their totality.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0886368712440485">7</xref></sup> A plaintiff, then, would have to prove all factors together, not individually.</p>
<p>In this case it was determined that Dollar Tree Stores, Inc. was not a successor in interest because of the differences between the companies. Dollar Tree Stores sell a variety of merchandise for a dollar, whereas Factory 2-U Stores sell only clothing merchandise at a variety of prices. The similarity between the two only exists in the fact that both are in the discount retail industry. Dollar Tree Stores prevailed in this case for several reasons: It was not considered a successor in interest, and only a few employees were retained by Dollar Tree Stores, each of whom was required to apply for a new position at Dollar Tree Stores. However, the case also serves as notification to employers that when certain conditions are met, a company purchasing another can indeed be regarded as a continuous employer for FMLA purposes. Although complicated issues, such as in the Dollar Tree case, further increase the severe caution taken by many employers when considering FMLA, other financial risks associated with being wrong could be of a greater concern.</p>
<p>Some may argue that because employers must now allow employees the opportunity to better balance home and family life through use of the FMLA, employees will be happier to be at work, and when employees are happy at work, they produce more. Many forget, though, that allowing employees to miss work without consequences causes the supervisors, managers, and coworkers to incur stress, while costing the employers millions. Bates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0886368712440485">8</xref></sup> argues that 52% of employees took leave under the FMLA in 2004 more than once, whereas Harbison<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0886368712440485">9</xref></sup> claims that the average cost to defend FMLA against litigation is $80,000. Yet these numbers are rarely considered when proponents of the FMLA boast the cost savings.</p>
<p>There are also headaches created for the frontline managers of large employers. Managers are frequently responsible for determining what should be considered a serious health condition, which is not easily done. Though the courts have established helpful guidelines, the guidelines provided are still vague and difficult to decipher. To illustrate, consider a manager who must decide whether an employee is covered under FMLA for a migraine or if attendance at an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting is included. The managers must also decide how to replace the labor of an employee who is out on extended leave. Filling holes in the work schedule for most employers was tough enough before the FMLA, but now managers must play a staffing shell game, many times on short notice. One option is to hire temporary employees since the employer must keep the position open for the employees who are out on FMLA. This, combined with the vague interpretations of the act, has caused increased stress for managers, who may now also claim FMLA for the mental health conditions they acquired when attempting to decipher the law.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0886368712440485">
<title>Discrimination Under FMLA</title>
<p>Further complicating the FMLA issues for employers beyond the lengths of service is same-sex parents. The issue at hand for employers is to decide whether a nonbiological parent is entitled to the protection provided under the FMLA. Courts have ruled that “a simple statement asserting that the requisite family relationship exists is all that is needed in situations such as in loco parentis where there is no legal or biological relationship.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0886368712440485">10</xref></sup> As a result, employers continue to see opportunities for staff to abuse the FMLA since an employee can obtain coverage with nothing more than his or her word in a statement. Additionally, there is also the risk of being accused of retaliation.</p>
<p>Retaliation claims commence when an employee alleges that the employer discriminated against him or her for exercising his or her FMLA rights.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0886368712440485">11</xref></sup> In 2008, there were more than 90,000 charges of retaliation filed with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0886368712440485">12</xref></sup> Claims that are brought forth regarding discrimination or retaliation are brought under 29 U.S.C. §2615(a)(2).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0886368712440485">13</xref></sup> This has opened the door to allow disgruntled employees to sue their employers. One case involved an employee who was fired for making statements that violated her employer’s sexual harassment policy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0886368712440485">14</xref></sup> The court allowed her to proceed with her FMLA retaliation claim even though there was a question about whether others were terminated for similar conduct and the employee had just requested her eighth FMLA leave.</p>
<p>To establish a claim of retaliation or discrimination, an employee simply needs to present evidence that exists at “face value” aka prima facie. To do this, he or she must prove that he or she engaged in a protected activity and was subjected to an adverse action and that there is a causal relationship between the protected activity and the employer’s adverse action. The burden of proof then shifts to the employer to prove that the adverse action was brought for reasons other than retaliation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0886368712440485">15</xref></sup> Once the prima facie case is established and the burden has shifted to the employer, it becomes difficult to prove innocence since the courts have created an overprotection so that employees can take advantage of the FMLA benefits.</p>
<p>There are also interference claims under the FMLA, which occur when the “employee alleges that an employer denied or interfered with his substantive rights under the FMLA.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0886368712440485">16</xref></sup> These claims are also filed quite often, mostly when an employer terminates an employee or takes some other form of adverse action, in an attempt to prevent the employee from using leave under the FMLA.</p>
<p>This protection by the courts to ensure coverage for employees under the FMLA has burdened employers. In fact, an employee does not have to utter the term <italic>FMLA</italic> to invoke its protection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0886368712440485">17</xref></sup> since the courts have placed the responsibility on the employer to determine if an employee’s FMLA protection exists. The courts, however, have stated that the employee must provide sufficient information to inform the supervisor of the need for unforeseeable FMLA leave. Furthermore, an employee cannot simply call in sick and expect to receive FMLA protection.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0886368712440485">
<title>Developing an FMLA Strategy</title>
<p>When policies regarding FMLA are not managed properly, employers will be vulnerable to abuses of the system, which can have devastating results. Thus, employers’ policies should include information regarding the requirements and proper procedures for requesting any leave, including FMLA. These policies should outline each requirement and the process for obtaining approved leave, ensuring compliance with the law. The DOL provides information for employers to use when creating policies regarding FMLA on its website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.DOL.gov">www.DOL.gov</ext-link>).</p>
<p>Many companies have begun to inform employees who request FMLA leave that they must still follow established leave request procedures and that failure to do so can result in disciplinary action, including removal. Some employers have chosen this path because many employees have decided to attempt to take advantage of their FMLA benefits with disregard for company policies. Employers can feel trapped when employees have claimed FMLA and then fail to report for duty without calling in to request any leave. Hennepin County Medical Center, though, stood strong and enforced its leave request procedures when an employee failed to follow them while on approved FMLA leave.</p>
<p>In the Hennepin County Medical Center’s case, the employee, Melody Bacon, was on approved FMLA leave and was incapacitated for over a month with hives.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0886368712440485">18</xref></sup> The Medical Center informed Ms. Bacon of the importance of calling in while using FMLA leave. It was required that she request each and every day of leave, which she did do for the first month. Bacon then failed to call in and request leave, and after 3 days of no-call no-show, she was considered to have been voluntarily terminated. The court found that the Medical Center had, in fact, interfered with Bacon’s right to FMLA. The burden was then placed on the Medical Center to prove that it would have taken the same adverse action whether or not Bacon was on approved FMLA leave. Ultimately, the Medical Center did prevail by proving that it was strict on leave request procedures and would have taken the same action even if Bacon was not on approved FMLA.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0886368712440485">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Hennepin County Medical Center court case is important because it proves the importance of having policies regarding requesting leave. Leave request policies are just as important as having policies regarding FMLA. If employers choose to write a policy, they need to ensure compliance with all laws and regulations. Even though posters are typically found in a break room or some other area where employees normally gather and list various federal policies such as the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Polygraph Protection Act, the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act and so on, the FMLA information is typically provided in a very basic manner on such “store-bought” postings. Additionally, the FMLA policy should describe in detail each aspect of the employer’s leave policy and should not require employees to invoke FMLA in writing.</p>
<p>Courts have repeatedly stated that the employee may simply inform the employer of the possibility of the need for leave for a “qualifying event” as long as the employee provides sufficient information to determine that he or she may need to use leave under FMLA. If an employee, for example, knows that he or she may need surgery, then the employee should inform the employer of that need as soon as possible, indicating the serious health condition. The employer should ensure that the policy indicates the importance notifying the supervisor, preferably with a 30-day notice. The Sixth Circuit of Appeals
<disp-quote>
<p>found it useful to employ the following test: “[T]he critical test for substantively-sufficient notice is whether the information that the employee conveyed to the employer was reasonably adequate to apprise the employer of the employee’s request to take leave for a serious health condition that rendered him unable to perform his job.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0886368712440485">20</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The next step in developing the policy should be to include an explanation of what the employee can expect after invoking FMLA. The employer should request a physician’s statement as to what the serious health condition amounts to, the plan and duration of the treatment and the expected date the employee may return to work. The statement should be provided to the employer within 15 days to provide the physician time to prepare the statement.</p>
<p>The policy should indicate that a written approval, or disapproval, for FMLA leave will be provided to the employee within 5 days, as specified by the DOL. Additionally, the DOL insists that employers use the WH-381 form to inform the employee of his or her approval or disapproval and the rights and obligations for the use of FMLA. If the employer chooses to not use the WH-381 form, then the employer can use the form to assist with the formulation of a company-specific written notice.</p>
<p>The written notice should inform the employee of his or her rights and obligations while taking the leave. The written approval should include a statement that the employee is permitted 12 administrative workweeks, or 480 hours if used intermittently, of leave. The notice should also include an explanation of why the leave can be used, what the qualifying event is and any other right provided by the FMLA. For example, if the FMLA leave will be used for a serious health condition that requires intermittent use to visit the treating physician for follow-up care, then the notice should inform the employee that he or she may use FMLA leave for those visits, the employee should attempt to schedule the visits in advance and the employee should provide the supervisor with the expected dates and times of the visits as far in advance as possible if not foreseeable, as to not create conflicts with scheduling time off for those visits. The notice should also inform the employee that if he or she should have the need to use FMLA leave for reasons not outlined in the physician’s statement, then additional medical certification may be requested. Foreseeable intermittent use of FMLA should be requested 30 days in advance. If the leave is not foreseeable, then the request for leave should be practical. The procedures for requesting intermittent leave should also be addressed the policy.</p>
<p>The policy should also indicate that established leave request procedures are still in effect for requesting leave under FMLA. For example, if an employee has received approval for intermittent use due to migraines, he or she may need to call in for leave because of a migraine. The policy should indicate that the employee needs to follow the established leave request procedures, even when requesting leave for FMLA. Though employees are protected from not being terminated for using FMLA, they can still be disciplined if they do not adhere to the established procedures for requesting leave.</p>
<p>Attorney W. Melvin Haas III, JD,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0886368712440485">21</xref></sup> further explains that “in order to minimize disruption in the workplace, an employer must detect and deal with employees who abuse FMLA.” An employee abuses FMLA by attempting to use the FMLA leave for reasons not related to his or her FMLA claim. If an employee is on approved FMLA for migraines, he or she cannot call in to use FMLA because his or her back hurts. The FMLA leave was approved for migraines, not backaches. This allows an employer more discretion when approving or disapproving the sick leave request, while also attempting to curb the abuse of FMLA leave, which has proven to be a problem for some employers. To provide management the ability to create a policy and procedure under FMLA, an employer must look into the importance of training that individual along with the supervisors throughout the facility who have employees who invoke their entitlement under the FMLA.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0886368712440485">
<title>HR’s Responsibility</title>
<p>Training is the most important tool that can be used to protect an employer from abuse by employees under FMLA and from losing related litigation. Employers should not burden their managers with understanding every aspect of the FMLA. Instead, they should hire and train human resource professionals to handle issues like FMLA. HR is responsible for ensuring compliance in all areas of employment law; therefore, employers should have an expert HR employee work out each step of the company’s FMLA process so that they may ensure compliance. This also provides the employer with consistent determinations on approvals or disapprovals of FMLA claims. Additionally, it provides the employer with one or more individuals who only work on those cases, which creates an atmosphere of accurate determinations. When an HR professional is unsure of whether to approve or disapprove a claim, he or she can discuss the issue with legal counsel to obtain another opinion. Furthermore, after an HR professional has been hired to administer the FMLA program, he or she can begin to provide training to supervisors.</p>
<p>Training supervisors should <italic>not</italic> be an in-depth training process. Instead, it should provide the supervisors with information regarding the company’s policy on FMLA, specify who to contact if and when an employee might need FMLA and provide the supervisors with the basic knowledge needed to understand what exactly FMLA is. Moreover, supervisors should be trained to simply gather the information and forward the situation to an HR professional.</p>
<p>However, by providing training, employers will begin to see a change in the environment of FMLA abuse. Employees will be less likely to abuse the system if the supervisors are instilled with the right questions to ask when an employee requests FMLA. Similarly, employees will also be less likely to continue to abuse FMLA if supervisors know the right questions to ask when abuse is partially apparent or probable. When HR professionals do provide training to supervisors, they should provide them with a contact number so the supervisors may contact the HR person at any time with questions related to FMLA.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0886368712440485">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>As important as the intentions of FMLA are, Congress must not discount the cost and burden placed on the employers. Although the DOL pursued input in 2007 to learn about employers’ frustrations with FMLA, little has been done to provide clarity; rather, the act was simply expanded for military-related coverage. Thus, Congress should review the results of its intended goals with employers having a vested interest. As with many laws passed by Congress, only the framework was created for the FMLA; consequently, this lack of guidance caused a great deal of confusion for employers that were attempting to be compliant. As employees glean benefits created by the government, they fail to see the true cost they are paying for them in terms of reductions in other benefit areas. There is no dispute that there must be protection for employees who take legitimate leave, but the courts have failed to account for many of the problems created because of the FMLA’s passage.</p>
