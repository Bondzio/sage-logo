<sec id="sec1-1477153512472615"><title>RWG Hunt and MR Pointer (2011), <italic>Measuring Colour</italic>, 4<sup>th</sup> Edition, John Wiley and Sons Ltd., 469pp. Hard cover. £67.40. Print ISBN: 978-1-119-97537-3</title>
<p>Firstly, a disclosure in the name of fairness: The second edition of Measuring Colour was a frequent and essential reference source when working on my PhD thesis, so my opinion of this book may be somewhat biased. This is the fourth edition of Hunt’s <italic>Measuring Colour</italic> and brings the bonus of a new co-author in addition to new material.</p>
<p>There are 17 chapters and 9 appendices. These include discussion of the fundamentals of colour vision, lamp technology and physical measurement; the development of colour metrics, from spectral weighting functions through chromaticity diagrams and colour order systems to the colour rendering characteristics of light sources and colour appearance models that predict changes in perceived colour with different viewing conditions. The appendices include standard colorimetric data (colour matching functions and luminous efficiency functions), the spectral power distributions of standard illuminants, 27 representative fluorescent lamps and other discharge lamps, the spectral reflectance factors of colours used to calculate CIE general colour rendering index, and equations used in colorimetric analyses; I frequently use these data as an archived reference to confirm data I might more easily copy from internet sources. New material for the fourth edition includes colorimetry with digital cameras, and factors affecting the total appearance of coloured objects – a discussion of the influences of gloss, translucency and surface texture in parallel with colour. Readers will note a connection between this book and CIE publications on colorimetry and photometry, perhaps of little surprise bearing in mind Pointer’s role within the CIE. What this book does for me is to place CIE material into one source, providing more connectivity between issues.</p>
<p>One issue that might be of strong interest to those with a background in lighting is the colour rendering characteristics of light sources and this subject has now been moved to a separate chapter, reflecting recent interest and research activity in the subject. Currently, the standard measure of colour rendition is the CIE general colour rendering index (<italic>R<sub>a</sub></italic>), which is derived from the average differences in appearance of eight standard colour samples under a test light source and a reference light source. Being an average difference, saying nothing about the individual directions of any of these differences or whether a difference is in a favourable or unfavourable direction, I am surprised that <italic>R<sub>a</sub></italic> values less than 100 provide any useful meaning at all, but they appear to do so in many practical circumstances. The introduction of LED light sources has highlighted the need to re-evaluate how colour rendering is determined, following experiments showing that <italic>R<sub>a</sub></italic> tended to under-estimate the rendition characteristics of LED sources. <italic>Measuring Colour</italic> describes proposed improvements to the calculation of CIE general colour rendering index (alternative colour space and chromatic adaptation transform), a new Colour Quality Scale (CQS) which attempts to improve some of the disadvantages of the <italic>R<sub>a</sub></italic> procedure, and briefly describes alternative approaches: my one disappointment with the book is that this discussion is too brief. Alternative approaches include: graphical methods such as vector maps which visually indicate the relative changes (direction and magnitude) in hue and chroma of a large sample of test colours; alternative means of using the chromaticity of test samples such as gamut area; and data based on alternative perceptual attributes such as memory colours. And all of this within approximately one page!</p>
<p>I would recommend this book for researchers of colour and lighting and those in industry with the need to understand how colour appearance is measured, in particular those with a worn copy of the second edition.</p>
