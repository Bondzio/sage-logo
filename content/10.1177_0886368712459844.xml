<abstract>
<p>With the state of the economy slightly improving and the U.S. energy market experiencing increased exploration and production activities in shale plays, many companies and their investors are riding the wave of increased revenues and profitability. Although energy is succeeding overall, natural gas producers are struggling with the depressed state of the commodity price as a result of the realization that supply is currently greater than demand. As a result, poor total shareholder returns have Institutional Shareholder Services and shareholders unjustifiably calling for drastic changes to compensation. The natural gas industry will experience an uphill battle in the coming months as many companies attempt to avoid a failed say-on-pay vote.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The second season of say-on-pay (SOP) has concluded with results true to projections with a 35% increase in failures. A total of 54 companies failed the SOP vote in 2012, compared with 40 in 2011. Exploring and understanding the source of these failures has been, and will continue to be, key for companies interested in garnering shareholder support for compensation programs and future director elections. With the economy slightly improving and the stock market in recovery mode, many industries are experiencing a resurgence in stock prices and breathing a sigh of relief at the prospect of a great fiscal year and better shareholder returns, which hopefully translate into positive Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) recommendations. Although this may be the case in many industries, one industry in particular has been stuck in an uphill battle against commodity prices for the past 3 years—natural gas.</p>
<boxed-text id="boxed-text1-0886368712459844">
<title>Say-on-Pay: What Is It?</title>
<p>Under the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, publicly held companies with a public float of greater than $75 million are required to provide shareholders with a nonbinding advisory vote on the compensation of named executive officers, as described in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis section of the proxy statement.</p>
</boxed-text>
<p>Although the energy industry as a whole is once again thriving because of the increased oil prices and the increase in production since 2009, natural gas producers are struggling with the depressed state of the commodity price as a result of the realization that supply is currently greater than demand. This has resulted in falling stock prices and investors unhappy with marginal to negative returns. Notable companies, such as Chesapeake Energy, the nation’s second-largest natural gas producer, are reducing production, enduring associated stock price reductions and experiencing a failed SOP vote. Although this failure may have underlying issues related to poor governance and egregious pay packages, the negative total shareholder return (TSR) surely has not helped with SOP. Intuitively, it seems investors would understand the current state of the commodity market and cast SOP votes accordingly, but with the ever-increasing power of shareholder advisors, this is simply not the case.</p>
<p>The influence of shareholder activists groups, such as ISS and Glass Lewis, have increased substantially, as evidenced by the number of institutions that cast SOP votes blindly based on the recommendations of these groups. In response, the movement to dissuade investors from following ISS recommendations is at an all-time high, as many companies challenge its flawed methodologies. Exxon Mobil led the charge in the 2011 proxy season and JCPenny took a similar stance in 2012. Although the success of these endeavors is arguable, the current environment requires action. Therefore, understanding how ISS arrives at its recommendations and how to challenge their power is vital for natural gas companies seeking to mitigate the risk of failing SOP.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0886368712459844">
<title>ISS: An Understanding</title>
<p>ISS recommendations are based on a proprietary pay-for-performance model which necessitates the development of a peer group of comparable companies. In response to criticism received for flawed methodology in 2011, ISS devised a new methodology aimed at enhancing the analysis behind the vote recommendation and fixing the peer group selection process.</p>
<boxed-text id="boxed-text2-0886368712459844">
<title>What Is ISS?</title>
<p>ISS is a firm specializing in the research and analysis of proxy issues, namely, governance and compensation, and then making voting recommendations to investor institutions. ISS has drawn much criticism related to poor methodologies and inconsistent recommendations. Still, it remains the largest and most influential proxy advisory firm.</p>
</boxed-text>
<p>Unfortunately, the one-size-fits-all approach of this new methodology has created additional problems and resulted in greater criticism. At a basic level, the process ISS uses selects peers based on six-digit GICS (Global Industry Classification Standard) code (or four-digit if there are not enough six-digit peers) and attempts to create a peer group of 14 to 24 companies with the company being analyzed at the median of either revenue or market capitalization. Among other factors, ISS compares the TSR of the company with this peer group for 1- and 3-year periods.</p>
<p>Although this approach often results in unreasonable peer comparisons and relative TSR analyses for all industries, to understand the peer group selection problem for natural gas companies requires a deeper level of analysis. To put this into context, a recent ISS report for a building materials–manufacturing company contained mining, gold exchange and construction companies. Although the construction companies seem like a reasonable match, in what manner do gold and mining industries compare to the manufacturing industry in either stock behavior or company operations? The answer, of course, they do not. The unfortunate problem natural gas companies face is that uneducated investors do not see the disconnect between operationally similar peers and the peers developed by ISS. In many of these investors’ eyes, all similarly sized exploration and production companies are created equal. But this isn’t the case.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, oil companies have experienced increased production, increased revenues and profits and positive shareholder returns. All the while, natural gas producers continue to reduce production and have seen negative revenue growth over the same period, resulting in deflated stock prices. As you can see, the differences in oil and gas are night and day. However, ISS and their flawed company selection processes generate oil-heavy peer groups, which work to the detriment of natural gas companies when comparing stock price performance.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0886368712459844">
<title>The Expanding Role of Natural Gas</title>
<p>At this point, it is imperative to understand the importance of natural gas and the potential implications its failure would have on our nation. Natural gas is an increasingly important commodity in the U.S. economy as a good alternative to oil. Therefore, as the oil reserves in many parts of the world are being depleted, the availability of a viable alternative such as natural gas is becoming increasingly important for the future. In the United States in particular, the potential for natural gas to replace oil as the primary fuel source of our economy is increasing daily. This is particularly important because the United States is one of the most energy dependent countries in the world, and a domestic alternative fuel source is key. Another attractive feature of natural gas is the U.S. ability to produce natural gas domestically since large reserves of shale gas have been discovered in recent years. So, although gas will be imperative for the future success of our country, the current demand for the product is low, thereby creating depressed commodity prices, which result in meager returns to shareholders in the short term.</p>
<p>Since these companies are vastly important to our future way of life, what should be done to educate investor activist groups and garner support from shareholders? Although companies continue to fight back against ISS recommendations to shareholders and attack its flawed methodology, more can be done. These recommendations are applicable to any company facing SOP votes this coming year, but they are perhaps more important for struggling natural gas companies.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0886368712459844">
<title>Course of Action</title>
<p>Communication with shareholders is perhaps the most efficient route to take. Large institutional shareholders, among which the majority of voting shares are held, are usually segregated into two groups: (a) the governance/compliance group and (b) the financial/analyst group. It is not uncommon for the two groups to operate independently, resulting in mixed messages to companies and the investment community.</p>
<p>This was recently the case for a midsized natural gas company in 2011; they did everything right. Investors were contacted and the company was assured by them that the company would receive support for their SOP proposal. Unfortunately, communication within the institution was lacking and the governance department never got the message the analyst communicated to the company and instead blindly voted according to ISS recommendations. Fortunately, the company still passed the SOP vote, albeit by a very narrow margin. It is essential that the right people get the message. Communication with shareholders may not assure success, but it has been proven to work favorably for those companies that have relied on that strategy</p>
<p>Forecasting ISS peer groups is another prevalent practice that was adopted in late 2011 and early 2012. Through an in-house counsel or a consultant, companies can perform forecast modeling in an effort to determine the peer group ISS might assign to the pay-for-performance analysis and the possible vote recommendation. This method provided companies an advantage, allowing them the opportunity to talk to investors about potential ISS outcomes and communicate why they should support the SOP proposal ahead of ISS. Although this is a good practice and can be relatively accurate, in typical ISS fashion, they diverted from their own methodology in certain cases. An after-the-fact audit found that the actual ISS peer groups contained companies that were outside the scope of ISS’ own peer selection methodology. It is worth noting that ISS does provide companies the opportunity to purchase a preview of possible ISS results, but those results are not guaranteed and the final ISS peer groups often turn out different from the preview.</p>
<p>Pleading the facts of your case to ISS is another strategy. Although the success of this approach is marginal at best, in a few cases it has worked. Contacting ISS to describe the changes made to compensation programs, to explain why the ISS peer group does not make sense or to discuss other issues that affect ISS recommendations can cause ISS to revisit its analyses and even possibly change recommendations to investors.</p>
<p>The fourth strategy is to rebut ISS recommendations in supplemental proxy filings. Many companies, such as Chesapeake or Exxon Mobil, have taken to rebutting ISS recommendations and methodologies in supplemental proxy filings. Among those companies, there are two differing approaches: (a) aggressively attacking ISS and its recommendations or (b) diplomatically addressing the issues ISS has raised and explain the flaws. The temptation when dealing with an ISS “no” recommendation is to lash out and discredit any and all allegations, thus positioning the company as the victim, but this tactic is rarely successful. Instead, taking the diplomatic high road increases the chances that investors will look favorably on your recommendations, and although it may not swing the vote in the company’s favor this year, it continually increases the chances of long-term success.</p>
<p>Finally, companies can elect to make ISS recommended changes to compensation programs for 2013. ISS has a litany of compensation and governance “dos and don’ts,” which are provided in annual company assessments. Although some of the recommendations will not make sense culturally or practically, identifying those recommendations that are easy changes is a step in the right direction.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Many companies will face “no” vote recommendations in 2013, and the number of failures will likely continue to rise year over year; but if the state of natural gas prices does not begin to recover soon, natural gas companies will face an unprecedented lack of support for compensation programs in 2013. Therefore, investor communications will be the most important and efficient tool for natural gas companies going into the 2013 proxy season. In conclusion, it is important to understand the state of ISS and to make your case effectively. Better to be prepared than caught off guard.</p>
