<abstract>
<p>This article investigates the historical development of the use of ‘als ob’ (‘as if’) in a diachronic corpus of German narrative fiction prose from the 18th century until 2009. The results of this corpus-stylistic study suggest that ‘as if’-statements are associated with the recurring profile of an eloquent narrator who is more empathic than he is well-informed about the mental state of characters. Finally, we will show that this narrator profile has been used with historical variance that can be explained by literary historical considerations.</p>

<title>1 Introduction</title>
<p>Narrating is not just about presenting a sequence of events; narrating entails a particular stance according to which events are arranged and presented as a story. Such stances are only partially grasped in terms of broad typological terms such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0963947013489236">Genette’s (1972)</xref> differentiation of ‘who sees?’ from ‘who speaks?’. Taking a narrative stance not only influences the choice of personal pronouns (‘I’ vs. ‘he/she’), or the kind of information that might be provided by the narrator; rather we would expect that a narrator also brings in a level of subjectivity which influences the text on various rhetorical dimensions such as genre and ethos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0963947013489236">Booth, 1983</xref>), but also micro-stylistic elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0963947013489236">Biebuyck and Martens, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0963947013489236">Lodge, 1984</xref>). Even if these micro-stylistic patterns depend on individual stylistic choices by the author, we will show that some recurring patterns are associated with particular narrative stances or (as we would dub it) ‘narrator profiles’. Such patterns may remain unnoticed while reading a single novel, but by analysing a large corpus of narratives using corpus-stylistic instruments we discover that some stylistic choices are reinforced or attenuated according to the stances that narrations take towards the experiences and events that are presented. More particularly, we will show that the use of ‘as if’-statements in German is associated with the profile of an eloquent narrator who is rather more empathic than he/she is well-informed and who keeps information about the mental state of characters at a certain level of uncertainty and vagueness. Finally, we will show that this narrator profile has been used with considerable, but systematic variance in German literature between 1770 and 2009.</p>

<title>2 ‘Als ob’ / ‘as if’</title>
<p>A statement such as ‘it was as if we were in a war’ implies that there was actually no war at all, but that an experience was similar to being in a war. Hence, ‘as if’ is frequently a marker of figurative language, and may contain assertions which are counterfactual compared to the storyworld. Generally, ‘as if’ statements are considered to be content clauses (‘Inhaltssätze’; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0963947013489236">Duden, 2005</xref>: §1688) which may report vague, uncertain or even false impressions. We suggest differentiating the following types of use:</p>
<list id="list1-0963947013489236" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>(1) ‘as if’-statements that report feigned behaviour:</p></list-item>
</list>
<p><disp-quote>

<p>And she sat down at a table as if she were crying. (Our translation)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<list id="list2-0963947013489236" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>(2) ‘as if’-statements that report an uncertain fact or impression:</p></list-item>
</list>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Seine Augen waren eng, es schien als ob er sich etwas vorzustellen versuchte (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0963947013489236">Johnson, 1992</xref>: 99)</p>
<p>His eyes were narrow and it seemed as if he was trying to picture something. (Our translation)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<list id="list3-0963947013489236" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>(3) ‘as if’-statements that mark frequently figurative analogies which are neither feigned nor uncertain, but simply not part of the fictional storyworld:</p></list-item>
</list>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Sam Hawkens … zog ein Gesicht, als ob er Sauerkraut mit Pflaumenmus gegessen hätte (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0963947013489236">May, 1992</xref>: 82)</p>
<p>Sam Hawkens made a face as if he had eaten sauerkraut with stewed plum. (Our translation)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The relationship between the content of the ‘as if’-statement and the fictional storyworld of a narrative is in all cases ambivalent, if not counterfactual. To be more specific, ‘as if’-statements are connected to the challenge of narrating subjective experience and impressions: example (1) displays an informed narrator who is able to uncover dissimulative behaviour which is not obvious to other fictional characters in the same situation. Examples (2) and (3), which are tentative interpretations of behaviour or experience, are much more frequent in fictional literature: In (2) the narrator is simply uncertain about the interpretation of the behaviour of a character, thus this type (which we call ‘informative uncertainty’) indicates a limit to the narrator’s knowledge. In (3) the narrator offers a figurative analogy of an experience that might have led to a similar impression. Such forms are frequently encountered when a narrator tries to retell an experience which cannot be easily grasped in words. We call this type ‘linguistic approximation of experience’.</p>
<p>Curiously, as the graph in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0963947013489236">Figure 1</xref> shows, there are strong indications that the use of ‘als ob’ has declined during the 20th century.</p>

<p>Flow statistics of the use of ‘als ob’ in the <italic>DWDS</italic>-corpus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0963947013489236">Berlin-Brandenburgische Akademie der Wissenschaften (2004ff</xref>.).</p>

</fig>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0963947013489236">Figure 1</xref> is based on the corpus of the <italic>Digitale Wörterbuch der deutschen Sprache des 20. Jahrhunderts</italic> (henceforth <italic>DWDS</italic>. See <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0963947013489236">Berlin-Brandenburgische Akademie der Wissenschaften, 2004ff</xref>.). Its overall size is 100 million words; hence, it is considerably smaller than <italic>COSMAS</italic>-corpus of the Institut für Deutsche Sprache in Mannheim. However, the <italic>DWDS-</italic>corpus is balanced according to the genres ‘fiction’, ‘science’, ‘newspapers’ and ‘guidebooks/manuals’, and it provides a diachronic overview of language use in the 20th century.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0963947013489236">Figure 1</xref> shows that throughout the 20th century ‘als ob’ is mostly used in fiction. Moreover, the use of ‘als ob’ diminished in all genres of the <italic>DWDS</italic> during the 20th century. One possible explanation for this decrease may be that ‘als ob’-clauses have been replaced by other forms which fulfil similar functions. For instance, a decrease in ‘als ob’-clauses might be compensated by the alternative forms such as ‘wie wenn’, ‘als wenn’ or ‘als’ in combination with the subjunctive mood (‘Konjunktiv 1 &amp; 2’). In the following, we use ‘<italic>as if’-statement</italic> as an umbrella term for all these forms. However, within the <italic>DWDS</italic> there is no evidence that the overall use of ‘als ob’-clauses and alternative forms remained stable despite the decrease in literal ‘als ob’-clauses:</p>
<list id="list4-0963947013489236" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>‘wie wenn’-clauses decrease even more than ‘als ob’</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>‘als’-clauses with the subjunctive mood seem to have decreased as well (although with a slight recovery from 1990 onwards)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0963947013489236">1</xref></sup></p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Finally, the use of ‘schien’ (‘it seemed’, which may function in a similar way as ‘als ob’, e.g. ‘Smeik schien etwas Wichtiges mitzuteilen zu haben’ / ‘It seemed Smeik had something important to say’) also decreased during the 20th century, although – again – with a slight recovery from 1990 onwards.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>In summary, word frequencies in the <italic>DWDS</italic>-Corpus suggest that an important way of reporting impressions in fictional narratives decreased in use in German fiction during the 20th century. We think that this development is relevant to literary history. In order to determine possible reasons for this development, a closer look at the texts is necessary. Unfortunately, the interface of the <italic>DWDS</italic>-Corpus allows only partial access to its texts. Because of these limitations the following analyses have been based on our own corpus of fictional texts fully searchable hereinafter called <italic>NarrCo</italic>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0963947013489236">
<title>3 NarrCo Corpus</title>
<p><italic>NarrCo</italic>, our own digital corpus of narrative texts, was assembled in order to find out more about the historical development of the use of ‘as if’-statements in fictional narratives from the end of the 18th century to date.</p>
<p>So far, there has been little reflection among literary scholars about possible principles according to which literary corpora should be assembled. Sometimes, the corpus of a literary study is limited to an implicit canon; frequently, it is limited by financial and human resources. At the same time, there is unease among literary scholars with the deliberate exclusion of texts from a corpus. However, as we work on micro-stylistic patterns, we wanted to control the impact of the idiosyncratic style of a single novel or a particular author. As a consequence, it seems reasonable to control the size of single texts by taking text probes (compare <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0963947013489236">Semino and Short, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>As to <italic>NarrCo</italic>, the aim was not to assemble a ‘representative’ corpus. Nevertheless, we aimed at a large, historically varied corpus of fictional prose from the end of the 18th century till today. In order to achieve a large variety of styles, a corpus would ideally contain standardised text probes of a few thousand words from a wide range of different authors and genres (epistolary novels, short stories etc.). For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0963947013489236">Semino and Short, (2004</xref>: 25ff.) in their study of speech representation in literary narratives, suggest probe sizes of 2000 words per text. However, in a historical respect it is very difficult to accommodate the important issue of balancing text probes, with the aim of assembling a large varied corpus. In particular, we were confronted with the problem that the digitalisation of literary texts of the past is mostly restricted to a limited selection of canonical authors. As a compromise we have formulated the following guidelines:</p>
<list id="list5-0963947013489236" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p><italic>NarrCo</italic>’s time span 1770 until 2009 was divided into 12 periods of 20 years; each period containing approximately 300,000 tokens.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>All texts were prose narration, mostly fiction (the period 1810–1830 includes also two autobiographical texts).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Per author or text a maximum of 30 probes of 1000 words within one period was set; between 30% and 50% of the probes were collected from texts smaller than 30,000 words.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Typically, probes were collected from the beginning, the middle and the end of a novel.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Of course, there were various factors which were not taken into account when assembling <italic>NarrCo</italic>, and which might be considered relevant in order to achieve a broad stylistic picture. For instance, there has been no assessment of the portion of homodiegetic or heterodiegetic narration in <italic>NarrCo</italic>, nor of particular narrative genres (e.g. epistolary novel), nor of the gender or origin of the authors. Nevertheless, we believe that this corpus is suitable to investigate general tendencies of narration, even though we are convinced that in-depth research should rather be undertaken within particular genres.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0963947013489236">
<title>4 Frequency and distribution of ‘as if’-statements in <italic>NarrCo</italic></title>
<p>With respect to the distribution of ‘as if’-statements in <italic>NarrCo</italic>, we found a surprisingly distinct pattern of waves with two marked peaks during the 19th century and towards the beginning of the 20th century (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0963947013489236">Figure 2</xref>). It is noteworthy that the data curve in the 20th century is similar to the data curve of the <italic>DWDS</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0963947013489236">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>In addition, we were interested in what contexts ‘as if’-statements had been used. Therefore we automatically extracted all sentences that contained ‘as if’-statements. As mentioned earlier, an ‘as if’-statement may be expressed by various constructions such as ‘als ob’, but also ‘als wenn’, ‘wie wenn’ or by ‘als’ followed by a verb in the subjunctive mood. This last construction might appear more elegant, as it is slightly shorter and allows a foregrounding of the information that is carried by the verb. ‘Als ob’, on the other hand, appears astonishingly frequently in the prose of Heinrich von Kleist, but also in the prose of so-called ‘Dorfgeschichten’ (e.g. by Auerbach or Keller). In summary, it seems that the form of ‘as if’-statements differ according to the genre, and author. Therefore, we included all forms of ‘as if’-statements in the following analysis.</p>
<p>A statistical comparison of the relative frequency of words used in sentences containing ‘as if’-statements with the remaining parts of <italic>NarrCo</italic> (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0963947013489236">Table 1</xref> ‘positive keywords’) showed – apart from unsurprising results such as the heavy use of ‘als ob’ (<italic>as if</italic>) and grammatically related various forms in the subjunctive mood – that there is a frequent use of references to appearances (‘schien’ <italic>seemed</italic>; ‘Anschein’ <italic>appearance</italic>), thinking (‘zumut[e]’ <italic>to feel like …</italic>), pretence (‘tat so, als ob’ <italic>pretended</italic>) and various references to frequency and duration of events or experiences such as ‘suddenly’, ‘sometimes’, ‘moment’ (‘plötzlich’, ‘manchmal’, ‘Augenblick’). In particular, we were surprised by the frequent use of various 3rd-person pronouns (‘es’ <italic>it</italic>; ‘ihm’ <italic>him</italic>; ‘er’ <italic>he</italic>; ‘seine’ <italic>his</italic>; ‘sie’ <italic>she/they</italic>; but also ‘mir’ <italic>to me</italic>), and the relatively frequent use of unspecific pronouns (‘etwas’ <italic>something</italic>; ‘jemand’ <italic>somebody</italic>).</p>

<p>Most surprising is probably the frequent use of 3rd-person pronouns in ‘as if’-statements. The data suggest that ‘as if’-statements occur rarely in conversation; apparently, it is a rather artificial literary device. There is, however, no evidence that the frequent use of 3rd-person pronouns is connected to heterodiegetic narrations. In fact, the extracts from homodiegetic novels such as von Eichendorff’s <italic>Aus dem Leben eines Taugenichts</italic>, Rilke’s <italic>Malte Laurids Brigge</italic>, and Roth’s <italic>Die Kapuzinergruft</italic> reached the highest ‘as if’-ratio. The heavy use of 3rd-person pronouns indicates, however, that there is an issue with focalisation in the use of ‘as if’-statements, as they frequently deal with the states of mind of other characters.</p>
<p>In summary, the data suggest that ‘as if’-statements have been used to differing degrees in literary history. It seems plausible that this form is associated with a particular narrator profile. More specifically, we hypothesise that ‘as if’-statements typically occur in narrative reports by narrators whose knowledge is limited by figural focalisation, as these reports frequently convey interpretations about other characters’ feelings and impressions.</p>

<title>5 Case study of four narratives</title>
<p>So far, we have seen that there have been periods in the history of German literature when ‘as if’-statements were particularly fashionable. For a better understanding of the underlying narrator profile, we analysed four fictional narratives which were peculiar because of their comparatively heavy or comparatively infrequent use of ‘als ob’-clauses. We followed a close reading method, which was not restricted to the extracts of <italic>NarrCo</italic>, but considered the full texts of the following novels:</p>
<list id="list6-0963947013489236" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Robert Musil’s 1906 novel, <italic>Die Verwirrungen des Zöglings Törleß</italic> (The Confusions of Young Törless, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0963947013489236">1993</xref> [1906]), seems to be a good example for the narrator profile that is particularly associated with ‘as if’-statements: It belongs to the top scorers in <italic>NarrCo</italic>. Moreover, the novel is a good example of a heterodiegetic narrator who is mostly focalised on one character, the young boarding pupil Törleß.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Joseph von Eichendorff’s 1826 novella, <italic>Aus dem Leben eines Taugenichts</italic> (Of the Life of a Good-For-Nothing, 1993 [1826]), showed the highest ratio of ‘as if’-statements in the corpus (2.43 per 1000 words); it is autodiegetically narrated.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Johann Carl Wezel’s 1770 novel, <italic>Belphegor</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0963947013489236">1965</xref> [1770]), is a heterodiegetic narration with a low ratio of 0.2 ‘as if’-statements per 1000 words.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Peter Weiss’ s short novel of 1960, <italic>Der Schatten des Körpers des Kutschers</italic> (The Shadow of the Coachman’s Body, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0963947013489236">1991</xref> [1960]), is a homodiegetic narration with an equally low ratio of 0.2 ‘as if’-statements per 1000 words.</p></list-item>

<sec id="section6-0963947013489236">
<title>5.1 Musil: <italic>Die Verwirrungen des Zöglings Törleß</italic></title>
<p>Robert Musil’s classic ‘coming of age’ novella <italic>Die Verwirrungen des Zöglings Törleß</italic> appeared in 1906 and is still widely read in schools and in universities. ‘As if’-statements are used in various functions throughout the novel, but mostly, they occur when impressions are described. Such impressions are not necessarily figurative. In several cases, ‘as if’-statements report possible, but uncertain, facts about the storyworld:<disp-quote>
<p>Reiting war außer im Unterrichte und beim Speisen kaum zu sehen, Beineberg war schweigsamer denn je, und Törleß schob es immer wieder hinaus, über die Geschichte nachzudenken.</p>
<p>Basini bewegte sich unter den Kameraden, als wäre niemals etwas vorgefallen. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0963947013489236">Musil, 1993</xref>: 50)</p>
<p>‘Reiting was hardly seen apart from lessons and at dinner, Beineberg was more silent than usual, and Törleß postponed thinking about the events again and again.</p>
<p>Basini moved among his fellows as if nothing had ever happened.’ (Our translation)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The ‘as if’-statement shows that feigned behaviour is closely related to ‘informative uncertainty’. The uncertainty is caused by the limited focalisation of the narration (as a consequence, we do not consider this as an instance of ‘unreliable narration’, because there is no reason to doubt the narrator’s honesty). In this passage, the narrator is able to give information about the mental state of Törleß; however, he signals that he has no certain knowledge about the thoughts of the other characters: he can inform us about Reiting’s and Beineberg’s whereabouts, and about Basini – who had been previously accused of stealing by the other three characters – the narrator can only say that he behaved ‘as if nothing had happened’.</p>
<p>‘As if’-statements are not only used in the context of describing other characters’ mental states, but they are also used to describe complex experiences of Törleß who is mostly the centre of the focalisation. This type of ‘as if’-statement appears particularly dense when Törleß experiences transcendence:<disp-quote>
<p>Ihm war, als müßte man da mit einer langen, langen Leiter hineinsteigen können. Aber je weiter er hineindrang […], desto tiefer zog sich der blaue, leuchtende Grund zurück. Und es war doch, als müßte man ihn einmal erreichen und mit den Blicken ihn aufhalten können. Dieser Wunsch wurde quälend heftig.</p>
<p>Es war, als ob die aufs äußerste gespannte Sehkraft Blicke wie Pfeile zwischen die Wolken hineinschleuderte und als ob sie, je weiter sie auch zielte, immer um ein weniges zu kurz träfe. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0963947013489236">Musil, 1993</xref>: 62)</p>
<p>To him it was as if one had to climb up a long, long ladder into it. But the further he penetrated … the further the blue, illuminated ground receded. And still it was as if sometime it must be reached, as if by gazing one must be able to reach it and keep it. The desire to do so became distressingly intense.</p>
<p>It was as if his utmost stretched power of vision was throwing glances like arrows between the clouds; and yet, the further and further [his vision] aimed, they always fell just a little short. (Our translation)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The ‘as if’-statements introduce a staggering chain of figurative descriptions of Törleß’s experience of transcendence and infinity. What is interesting about these figurative descriptions is that they inform the reader about the protagonist’s feelings, but they do not correspond to propositional acts of thoughts.</p>
<p>We believe that the term ‘paranarrative’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0963947013489236">Biebuyck, 2007</xref>) accurately describes how these figurative ‘as if’-statements constitute an additional theme (‘talking about experiences which are difficult to convey linguistically’) within the narrative. The narrator mentions that Törleß knew ‘the infinite’ from mathematics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0963947013489236">Musil, 1993</xref>: 63), but that his experience of infinity added a quality to this concept that was previously unknown to Törleß. This contrast between lingual (e.g. mathematical) definitions of infinity and the actual rich experience of infinity (which is obviously difficult to express in words) is a recurring theme in the book, and the narrator works hard (more poetically than Törleß) to give these experiences appropriate words. The novel engages here in Musil’s own philosophical concerns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0963947013489236">Müller, 2011</xref>). In this respect, the ‘as if’-statements are instances in which the discrepancy between the naïve young character’s development and the poetically mature narrator become apparent. The author-philosopher’s concerns seem to contribute to a ‘paranarrative’ communication with the recipient, which does not advance the plot, which is (in its poetic complexity) not accessible to the protagonist, but which establishes an additional layer of meaning.</p>
<p>Törleß’ story is relatively rich with such figurative descriptions, which is why considerable parts of this novel contain rather few plot-advancing statements. As a consequence, we associate the use of ‘as if’-statements with the paranarrative, whenever descriptions of elements of the storyworld constitute an additional layer of meaning that is not necessarily made explicit on the level of the storyworld, and is only accessible to the narrator and the audience.</p>
<p>Such paranarrative uses of ‘as if’-statements could also be observed in a few novellas from the period of Poetic Realism. For instance, Jeremias Gotthelf’s novella <italic>Die schwarze Spinne</italic> (The Black Spider, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0963947013489236">1912</xref> [1842]), which also stands out within <italic>NarrCo</italic> with a ratio of 1.8 ‘as if’-statements per 1000 words, presents a narrator who is able to suggest (in contrast to the naïve position of the characters) that the mere promise to the devil to deliver the next unbaptised child in the village to him constitutes a malediction: ‘ein Donner fuhr über sie, als ob der Himmel zersprungen wäre’/ ‘A thunder went over her as if the sky had broken apart’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0963947013489236">Gotthelf, 1912</xref> [1842]: 40). And subsequently, the description of a stormy night is mixed with wedding metaphors:<disp-quote>
<p>Es war eine wilde Nacht. In Lüften und Klüften heulte und toste es, als ob die Geister der Nacht Hochzeit hielten in den schwarzen Wolken, die Winde die wilden Reigen spielten zu ihrem grausen Tanze, die Blitze die Hochzeitsfackeln wären und der Donner der Hochzeitssegen. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0963947013489236">Gotthelf, 1912</xref>: 40)</p>
<p>It was a wild night. The air and abysses were howling and roaring as if the ghosts of the night were holding a wedding in the dark clouds, [as if] the winds were acting out a horrible wild round dance, [as if] the lightening was a wedding torch and the thunder the wedding blessing. (Our translation)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The description in this passage almost looks like a tableau (air, abysses, and clouds) from an authorial point of view. It includes an evaluation by the narrator. Even if the villagers believe they can outwit the devil, the very act of not taking the deed of baptism seriously enough constitutes a devilish alliance.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0963947013489236">
<title>5.2 Eichendorff: <italic>Aus dem Leben eines Taugenichts</italic></title>
<p>Joseph von Eichendorff’s <italic>Aus dem Leben eines Taugenichts</italic> is among the texts displaying the highest number of ‘as if’-statements in <italic>NarrCo</italic>. As expected, the autodiegetic narrator frequently uses ‘as if’-statements to portray his interpretations of other characters’ minds or behaviours (as it has been occasionally observed in Musil’s <italic>Törleß</italic>). Another use is what we call ‘informative uncertainties’: reports of events that the narrator himself remains unsure about, but which inform the reader quite reliably about a factual event in the storyworld:<disp-quote>
<p>Das eine Mal aber kam es mir vor, als wenn es dabei von unten ‘pst! pst!’ heraufrief. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0963947013489236">von Eichendorff, 1998</xref>: 141)</p>
<p>Once, however, it felt as if something shouted ‘shush! shush!’ from below. (Our translation)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Both these kinds of ‘as if’-statements are closely linked to a specific storyline containing elements of the romanticist ‘Schauerroman’. They occur almost exclusively in the middle part of the novella, where most of this storyline is laid out. However, neither explaining other characters’ behaviour nor the expression of uncertainties is the main function of ‘as if’-statements in <italic>Taugenichts</italic>. Many of the ‘as if’-statements deal with the narrator’s attempts to convey his own feelings, emotions and impressions of the outside world. They are often hyperbolic and feature quite daring figurative imagery:<disp-quote>
<p>Denn mir war in dem fremden Lande nicht anders, als wäre ich mit meiner deutschen Zunge tausend Klafter tief ins Meer versenkt […]. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0963947013489236">von Eichendorff, 1998</xref>: 129)</p>
<p>In this foreign country it felt no different than as if I, with my German tongue, had been plunged thousands of fathoms deep into the sea. (Our translation)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Other instances of ‘as if’-statements describe experiences of the outside world surrounding the autodiegetic narrator-protagonist Taugenichts (literally ‘good-for-nothing’) by means of (non-)figurative counterfactual comparisons. While not all of these cases are figurative, Taugenichts constantly interprets and describes both his environment and his mental states with elaborate metaphors (as seen in the foregoing extract). Many cases are (figuratively or not) linked to extreme joy or sadness brought about by nature and, above all, Taugenichts’s beloved ‘beautiful lady’. In particular, the ‘as if’-statements linked to experiencing nature are often specified as either a positive or a negative reaction to (the freedom or loneliness of) travelling and the scope of the wide world.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Mir ist’s nirgends recht. Es ist, als wäre ich überall eben zu spät gekommen, als hätte die ganze Welt gar nicht auf mich gerechnet. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0963947013489236">von Eichendorff, 1998</xref>: 105)</p>
<p>I feel out of place everywhere. It is as if I had arrived too late everywhere, as if the whole world had never counted on me. (Our translation)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Remarkably, while the frequent use of ‘as if’-statements is quite evenly distributed across the text, the figurative approximations of experience become notably rarer in the ‘Schauerroman’<italic>-</italic>storyline, where the ‘informative uncertainties’ occur more often. This observation emphasises two different functions of the ‘as if’-statements: On the one hand, explaining minds and the use of ‘informative uncertainties’ suggest a seemingly attainable and intelligible account of the storyworld’s events, while retaining the under-informedness of the autodiegetic narrator of the <italic>Taugenichts</italic> as plausible. He gives us enough information to construct reliably the events in the storyworld, but remains notoriously oblivious to it himself. On the other hand, the approximations of Taugenichts’ own experience with ‘as if’-statements serve to express extreme emotions, often anthropomorphizing nature and expressing the transcendental feeling of the individual being detached from the world.</p>
<p>The narrative strategy employed in <italic>Taugenichts</italic> seems to suggest that the autodiegetic narrator’s metaphorical, literally dreamy account of experience <italic>foregrounds</italic> the theme of the boundaries between what is acceptable as fact, a subliminal perception and dream within the fiction without necessarily questioning those boundaries on an auctorial level. In Eichendorff’s case, one could say, the frequent use of ‘as if’-statements fits a narrator who is naïve, wide-eyed and under-informed within the fiction. Implicitly, this strategy already addresses a sort of scepticism of the alleged attainability of human experience implied by ‘as if’-statements.</p>

<title>5.3 Wezel: <italic>Belphegor</italic></title>
<p><italic>Belphegor</italic> (1776) stands out among the texts of <italic>NarrCo</italic>, since ‘as if’-statements are rare, with a ratio of 0.2 occurrences per 1000 words. The novel is an imitation of Voltaire’s <italic>Candide</italic> where the protagonist loses his belief in the kindness of humanity after being chased away by his fiancée Akante. Large parts of the novel are written in the form of what might be called a ‘staged narrative’, as speech within the narrative is (apart from being delivered within the frame of a narrative voice) presented in a similar way to dramatic communication. For instance, after Belphegor has been kicked out by Akante he expresses his distress in a long and ‘well-formed lament’ (‘wohlgesezte Klage’):<disp-quote>
<p>‘Ach’, rief er, ‘so ist auch Akante ungetreu? Auch <italic>sie</italic> thut, was ich sonst als die Beschuldigung eines bösen Herzens verwarf, das mir das edelste, schönste Geschlecht zu verläumden schien – … – O Akante! warum <italic>rissest</italic> Du mir die Augen auf, statt sie mir zu <italic>öffnen</italic>? (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0963947013489236">Wezel, 1965</xref>: 11)</p>
<p>Alas, he exclaimed, Akante is also unfaithful? So she is actually doing what I discarded as accusations that seemed to slander the noblest and most beautiful gender … O Akante! Why did you rip my eyes open instead of opening them? (Our translation)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Belphegor’s exclamations acquire a quite dramatic tone. In addition, they are not addressed to another fictional interlocutor. In fact, it is merely a monologue through which Belphegor expresses his inner feelings. Today, readers would probably expect that such information to be conveyed by some kind of thought presentation or descriptive account of his feelings (e.g. with an ‘as if’-statement). Belphegor’s staged narrative is not an exception in <italic>NarrCo</italic>. For instance, Christian Vulpius’s novel <italic>Rinaldo Rinaldini</italic> is similarly narrated, with a similarly low occurrence of ‘as if’-statements. This finding sheds some light on the low occurrences of ‘as if’-statements during the 18th century, when thought presentation is frequently direct, but appears sometimes to lack sophistication. The use of ‘as if’-statements presupposes that conveying subjective experience is perceived as an epistemological and poetical challenge.</p>

<title>5.4 Weiss: <italic>Der Schatten des Körpers des Kutschers</italic></title>
<p>A final example of a low occurrence of ‘as if’-statements is in Peter Weiss’s modernist novel <italic>Der Schatten des Körpers des Kutschers.</italic> The novel presents an autodiegetic narrator who actually fails in narrating the story, as he remains mostly an observer of facts, which he cannot connect with intentional agency. As a consequence, <italic>Der Schatten des Körpers des Kutschers</italic> remains a temporally ordered account of the narrator’s various observations, which are reported with precision, but without actually providing causal explanations.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, ‘as if’-statements are not absent from this novel. They occur in the context of the narrator’s experiments with putting salt into his eyes (in German, there is also the idiomatic expression of fooling somebody: ‘Salz in die Augen streuen’):<disp-quote>
<p>[Ich] legte mich, nachdem ich, nachdem ich [sic] mich nach dem Aufklauben der Steine in mein Zimmer begeben, diesen letzten Abschnitt meiner Beobachtungen niedergeschrieben hatte, auf mein Bett, streute mir ein paar Salzkörner in die Augen und sah, nach einem kurzen verschwommenen Stadium, ein Bild vor mir, oder besser, ich glitt in das Bild hinein; es war als bewege ich mich auf einer Landstraße dahin, einer breiten, asfaltierten Straße; es war als säße ich, bequem zurückgelehnt, in einem Automobil, einem Omnibus (das Fahrzeug war nicht zu sehen, es bestand nur aus einem Gefühl des Fahrens, des Dahingleitens), und während ich ebenmäßig und ruhend dahinglitt sah ich, soweit mein Blick reichte, längs der Landstraße Elche oder Hirsche, gewaltige Tiere, paarweise in der Begattung liegen. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0963947013489236">Weiss, 1991</xref>: 34)</p>
<p>After picking up stones, after I had written down my observations, I lay down on my bed, put some salt grains in my eyes and saw after a short while a picture in front of me, or rather, I slid into the picture; it was as if I was moving on a country road, a wide asphalted street; it was as if I were sitting, comfortably laid back, in a car, an omnibus (the vehicle could not be seen, it only consisted in the impression of driving, of gliding), and while I was harmoniously and restfully gliding I saw, as far as I could see, elks or deer, huge animals, copulating in pairs. (Our translation)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The long, complex sentence gives an accurate account of this narrator’s obsession with precision (as can be seen from various addition of nouns), but who fails to comment on possible causes (e.g. the obviously erotic content of his dream). In the case of the narrator’s experiments with salt, the ‘as if’-statements are used to provide an approximative report of an uncertain dreamy experience.</p>
<p><italic>Der Schatten des Körpers des Kutschers</italic> is an example of a novel that contains a low frequency of ‘as if’-statements, even if it is full of uncertain description. We assume that the narrator’s technique of providing lists of words that may adequately describe his experiences offers an alternative way of providing approximations of experiences without using ‘as if’-statements.</p>

<sec id="section10-0963947013489236" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>6 Conclusion</title>
<p>Most uses of ‘as if’-statements in our corpus could be grouped according to two basic functions: Approximative description of experience and descriptions in the mode of informative uncertainty. A third possible function, the disclosure of feigned behaviour by an omniscient narrator, played no important role in the texts that we have analysed, by close reading.</p>
<p>With respect to a narrator profile, we found, on the one hand, that the narrators’ approximations of a character’s mental state by ‘as if’-statements typically stresses the character’s focalisation and limits of his/her informedness. On the other hand, we found the narrators also had considerable difficulty in giving an approximative yet still intelligible account of mental states of fictional characters and/or events as they are perceived by characters. It seems that ‘as if’-statements are associated with a narrator who uses (figurative) ‘as if’-statements to communicate something that is beyond the focalising character’s scope, while conveying human experience in a poetic way, as the latter is notoriously difficult to arrive at by means of language. The same profile may occur in homodiegetic and in heterodiegetic narrations; in heterodiegetic narrations ‘as if’-statements suggest the presence of a so-called ‘reflector’-character (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0963947013489236">Fludernik, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0963947013489236">Stanzel, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>In literary history, ‘as if’-statements seem to be related to a particular narrative challenge: conveying an uncertain and vague experience linguistically. First of all, the ratio of ‘as if’-statements per 1000 words begins to rise in <italic>NarrCo</italic> for the first time towards the end of the 18th century and reaches a first peak between 1830 and 1850. This first increase might be explained by the growing interest in reporting a character’s experiences in a more poetic way, but also by a growing awareness that consciousness and thoughts can only be rendered by approximation. The two maxima of the average ratio coincide with the ends of periods that have been associated with a particular interest in the inner experiences of characters: Romanticism and the Decadent movement. It is noteworthy, however, that famous realist writers did not score particularly low in ‘as if’-statements. At present, we cannot fully explain the sudden decrease in the middle of the 19th century and during the 20th century. Nevertheless, we assume that high scores of ‘as if’-statements are associated with a narrator profile that demonstrates eloquence by providing daring approximations of inner experiences, and – at the same time – plays with limited focalisation. As a consequence, ‘as if’-statements display a fascinating inner contradiction. They can be both informative and uncertain; they can be both attempts of approximative descriptions of mental states and impressive instances of poetic (artificial) language.</p>
<p>In particular, we believe that this inner contrariness can be best understood in terms of a ‘paranarrative’. The use of ‘as if’-statements frequently concerns the ‘external communication’ system between author and reader, whenever the ‘as if’-statements contribute to an additional layer of meaning in a novel. ‘As if’-statements often seem to require a confident and eloquent narrator who tries to give words to any experience, and, at the same time, they entail the restrictions of character focalisation. This might also explain the strong decrease during the 20th century: As the epistemological scepticism in the narrator’s ability to take a superior viewpoint or to describe (even approximatively) in words any human experience grew, ‘as if’-comparisons went out of fashion.</p>

<p>However, the data we retrieved from the <italic>DWDS</italic> are in this case not very reliable. The general search for ‘als+finite verb’ included many wrong concordances, as the indefinite article accusative ‘einen’ was frequently interpreted as a finite verb form (‘einen’ in the sense ‘to unify’) in the immediate co-text of ‘als’.</p>
