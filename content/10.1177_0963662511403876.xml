<abstract>
<p>Although still a side issue in the German-language media, attention towards synthetic biology has risen clearly during the last years, in line with the first applications being presented. This paper presents findings from a content analysis of synthetic biology coverage in German-language media over the years 2004–2009. In the media, synthetic biology is not clearly separated from gene technology. News value is attributed to established categories such as persons and events. Many metaphors and analogies used in describing gene technology can also be found in the coverage of synthetic biology; however, engineering metaphors are more prominent. In addition, playfulness constitutes an aspect rarely found in genetic engineering coverage. Overall, the picture emerging is ambivalent, which leaves prospects for the further development of public debate ambiguous.</p>

<title>1. Background</title>
<p>Synthetic Biology (SB), defined as the design and construction of new biological systems not found in nature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0963662511403876">Boldt et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0963662511403876">Schmidt et al., 2009</xref>) is a new research and engineering area. It includes, for example, the design of minimal genomes, the construction of living cells from scratch or the creation of biological systems based on “unnatural” biomolecules. Since an international conference in 2004, a scientific community has been built and the field has gained increasing attention among experts. Concomitantly, scientists and stakeholders started to discuss possible implications emphasising potential contentiousness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0963662511403876">Balmer and Martin, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0963662511403876">IRGC, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0963662511403876">PCSBI, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0963662511403876">Schmidt, 2008</xref>). Stakeholders fear that SB might evoke public concerns similar to those of gene technology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0963662511403876">Schmidt et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0963662511403876">Torgersen, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Scientists disagree whether SB is a new development or an extension of older fields (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0963662511403876">Schmidt et al., 2008</xref>). Results from studies in Austria suggest that journalists and lay people tend to ascribe SB to conventional gene technology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0963662511403876">Kronberger et al., 2009</xref>). However, “synthetic biology has hardly entered public awareness”; it is unfamiliar to most Europeans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0963662511403876">Gaskell et al., 2010</xref>: 29) and stable attitudes have not yet formed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0963662511403876">Pauwels, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0963662511403876">Royal Academy of Engineering, 2009a</xref>). Thus, while hotly discussed in elite circles, the field is only slowly entering public discourse.</p>
<p>Media are key actors in informing the public about scientific developments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0963662511403876">Holliman, 2004</xref>); they contribute to public debates through their agenda-setting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0963662511403876">McCombs and Shaw, 1972</xref>) and to the shaping of opinions and attitudes through their news framing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0963662511403876">Nisbet et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0963662511403876">Scheufele and Lewenstein, 2005</xref>). The way and the context within which an issue is presented can influence the recipients’ opinion formation (for an overview see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0963662511403876">Scheufele, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0963662511403876">De Vreese, 2005</xref>). Online news media have grown in importance complementing newspapers, radio, and television (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0963662511403876">Mitchelstein and Boczkowski, 2009</xref>). To capture the wider picture of SB, coverage in online media must be included.</p>
<p>In relation to other fields of biotechnology, lay people often use references to genetic engineering when talking about SB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0963662511403876">Kronberger et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0963662511403876">Pauwels, 2009</xref>). Thus, analogies and metaphors place the unfamiliar into a familiar context. Metaphors as “unit(s) of circulation” of knowledge between different discourses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0963662511403876">Christidou et al., 2004</xref>) mediate between expert and lay cultures and link (different aspects of) science to other fields of society. Media use figurative language when framing scientific contents, providing recipients with interpretation schemes and thereby influencing public perception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0963662511403876">Scheufele, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0963662511403876">Scheufele and Lewenstein, 2005</xref>). Figurative language and contesting metaphors reflecting ambivalence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0963662511403876">Petersen, 2005</xref>) have often been used in communicating biotechnology (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0963662511403876">Hellsten, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0963662511403876">Musolff, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0963662511403876">Nerlich and Hellsten, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0963662511403876">Petersen, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0963662511403876">Pramling and Säljö, 2007</xref>). Thus, studying metaphor use in the framing of SB may shed light on its perception in relation to other fields of biotechnology and on how it is introduced in public discourse.</p>
<p>So far, only a few studies of SB representation in the media are available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0963662511403876">Pauwels and Ifrim, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0963662511403876">Synth-Ethics, 2010</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0963662511403876">Pauwels and Ifrim (2008)</xref> explored differences between European and American coverage and showed that US newspapers presented a more optimistic view of SB. Our study contributes an analysis of the German-language print and online media for non-expert recipients over 2004–2009. German-speaking countries are considered particularly sensitive regarding attitudes towards biotechnology. European surveys have repeatedly shown that their public tend to be less positive towards biotechnology (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0963662511403876">Gaskell et al., 2000</xref>), with low technological optimism and moral and ethical sensitivities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0963662511403876">Gaskell et al., 2010</xref>). Media representation in these countries may therefore hint at potential public opposition to SB early on.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0963662511403876" sec-type="methods">
<title>2. Methods</title>
<p>We analysed German-language articles on SB published in Austrian, German and Swiss print media (daily press and magazines) from January 1, 2004<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0963662511403876">1</xref></sup> to December 31, 2009, including online versions, popular science newsletters and journals, and in German-language online media<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0963662511403876">2</xref></sup> including portals of select broadcast stations presenting summaries of radio or television broadcastings (as a proxy for coverage in these media). Samples were collected retrospectively for 2004–2007 using the media database APAdefacto.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0963662511403876">3</xref></sup> Articles in 2008–2009 were collected continuously using Google Alerts and APAdefacto. All issues were analysed.</p>
<p>Screening press articles for synthetic biology coverage according to the definition of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0963662511403876">Boldt et al. (2009)</xref> rendered a combination of keywords leading to the best hit rate: “synthetic biology,” “artificial life,” “designer AND organism,” “minimal organism,” “minimal genome,” “bioengineer,” “biomachine,” “biobrick,” “artificial DNA,” “artificial proteins,” “artemisinin,” “biorobot,” “synthetic bacterium,” “synthetic virus,” “DNA AND synthesis” (German equivalents). Articles were examined for relevance; those not covering SB according to the definition were removed.</p>
<p>For the content analysis we combined qualitative and quantitative methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0963662511403876">Mayring, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0963662511403876">2007</xref>). Articles were coded along formal (length, media type, publication date, etc.) and content criteria (topic, applications, metaphor use, presentation of SB, etc.) using deductive (formal) and inductive (content) category development. Two independent analysts rated a randomly selected subset of the articles (20% of the material) according to a coding plan. The inter-rater reliability (Cohen’s Kappa) across different categories was .75, which can be considered acceptable.</p>

<title>3. Results and discussion</title>
<p>In summary, SB underwent an increase in media coverage from 2004 on although the term did not appear in one third of the articles. Potential benefits, primarily energy generation, were mentioned more frequently than risks such as biosafety and biosecurity issues. The highest news values were attributed to elite persons, mostly J. Craig Venter, and events such as conferences or published expert reports. Analogies and metaphors used suggest an unclear distinction from gene technology; however, engineering metaphors were more prominent, with playfulness as an important additional aspect.</p>
<sec id="section4-0963662511403876">
<title>General observations</title>
<p>The sample from 2004 to 2009 comprised 233 articles.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0963662511403876">4</xref></sup> Their number increased significantly over the years with a peak in 2008 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0963662511403876">Figure 1</xref>). The term “synthetic biology” was explicitly mentioned in 65% of all articles; 35% dealt with SB according to the definition without the term being used. We categorised short (0–299 words, 27%), medium-length (300–999 words, 60%) and long (≥ 1000 words, 12%) articles. From 2004 to 2006, predominantly medium and long articles could be found. For 2005 and 2006, in each case we found only one short article. Short articles started to appear more frequently in 2007 (4), increasing to 12 in 2008 and 11 in 2009. As SB is a complex topic needing explanation when introduced, it can be considered established from 2008 on, but only in the science news: 69% of the articles were published in a science/technology section or a special interest medium, 14% in a section not relating to science/technology such as economy; 17% could not be assigned.</p>

<title>Topics of and motives for SB media coverage</title>
<p>Two major groups of articles emerged (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0963662511403876">Table 1</xref>): one group described SB (18%) or discussed potential benefits and risks in general terms (10%); another dealt with the specific topics of synthetic DNA/RNA production (45%), metabolic engineering (11%), and minimal genomes (9%). Coverage mirrored particular events such as the 2004 international conference SB1.0 at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and the 2007 SB3.0 in Zurich, Switzerland. Events around the person of J. Craig Venter and his minimal genome project were prominently covered, such as the 2007 patent application or the publication of the complete synthesis of a <italic>Mycoplasma genitalium</italic> genome in January 2008 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0963662511403876">Gibson et al., 2008</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0963662511403876">Figure 1</xref>). Venter was mentioned in 43% of all articles indicating personalisation and reference to elite persons as crucial news values. The publication of an experts’ report on opportunities and risks of SB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0963662511403876">DFG et al., 2009</xref>) was another trigger taken up in 35% of all articles in 2009. It stimulated both general reporting and articles on opportunities and risks. Other important subjects were the International Genetically Engineered Machine (iGEM) competition and particular symposia and scientific publications.</p>

<title>Benefits, risks, and possible applications of synthetic biology</title>
<p>Similar to others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0963662511403876">Pauwels and Ifrim, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0963662511403876">Synth-Ethics, 2010</xref>), we found that media presented SB as a field with high potential but known and unknown risks. Articles emphasising benefits (83%) outnumbered those mentioning risks (51%). The most prominent benefit related to energy generation (43% mention synthetic organisms for energy production), followed by environmental applications. Health benefits from drugs ranked third, overtaking environmental benefits in 2009 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0963662511403876">Figure 2</xref>).</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0963662511403876-fig2.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>One of the highlighted applications was the semi-synthetic production of the anti-malaria drug artemisinin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0963662511403876">Ro et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0963662511403876">Royal Academy of Engineering, 2009b</xref>), mentioned in 7% of all articles. Other examples reported were biological computers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0963662511403876">Baumgardner et al., 2009</xref>) or bacteria for the detection of antipersonnel mines (iGEM competition homepage: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://2009.igem.org/Team:Edinburgh">http://2009.igem.org/Team:Edinburgh</ext-link>, accessed 1 February 2010).</p>
<p>Risk appeared in four categories, as issues of biosafety, biosecurity, ethics and other. Biosafety was referred to as the prevention of unintended harm to the environment or to human health e.g. through the accidental release of synthetic organisms. Biosecurity spotlighted the fight against intentional misuse of SB knowledge and/or material (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0963662511403876">Schmidt et al., 2009</xref>). Biosafety was addressed in 18% (41 articles) of all articles, biosecurity in 30% (70).</p>
<p>Ethical aspects increased in the reporting. In 2006, 11% of the articles mentioned ethical or social implications, increasing to 27% (2007) and 33% (2008) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0963662511403876">Figure 3</xref>). In 2009, 35% of the articles alluded to ethical issues such as to the understanding of life in general and the concept of man as creator (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0963662511403876">Boldt and Müller, 2008</xref>), probably mirroring the DFG report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0963662511403876">DFG et al., 2009</xref>). Patenting, located between business and ethics, was usually framed ethically, whether it is morally just to patent life, rather than in a business or legal frame.</p>

<p>According to a report by the Royal Academy of Engineering, commercial activity or collaboration between industry and academia occurs in health, energy, environment, agriculture and other parts of industry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0963662511403876">Royal Academy of Engineering, 2009b</xref>: 37). While other fields were covered in the media, agriculture was omitted regarding both topics and applications. The analysis does not provide clues on the causes for this finding, which might be a starting-point for further studies.</p>
<p>Regarding the distinction as a separate issue, major elements of SB coverage overlapped with general biotechnology reporting. A single topic dominated, namely synthetic DNA/RNA; secondly came metabolic engineering and the minimal genome. They provide anchor points for associations: the terms DNA, RNA, and genome are part of the basic biotech vocabulary, and metabolic engineering, i.e. interventions in the cells’ regulatory processes, is a long-standing topic in gene technology. In addition, J. Craig Venter had been the most cited scientist in the coverage of the Human Genome Project (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0963662511403876">Rödder, 2009</xref>). For the media recipient, a clear separation between SB and other biotechnology fields seems difficult.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0963662511403876">
<title>Metaphors, similes and analogies</title>
<p>The communication of SB was rich in stylistic devices, with a slight decrease in 2009. They can be assigned to different categories; most prominent were metaphors of engineering technology and construction, of creativity and design and of religion. In addition, the aspect of play was important. These categories were interconnected and not mutually exclusive; often, a series of metaphors was used to explain an issue in an article. Frequently used metaphors were analysed regarding their connection with gene technology and how they influence the picture of SB.</p>
<p>The most prominent rhetoric frame was technical, referring to engineering, machines, building, and bricks. People involved in SB were called architects, engineers or designers, and synthetic organisms were described as machines (“genetic machines” in Frankfurter Allgemeine, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://faz.net">faz.net</ext-link>, 25 January 2008) or factories, accentuating the engineering aspect. Engineering metaphors have occasionally been used for gene technology as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0963662511403876">Liakopoulos, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0963662511403876">Pramling and Säljö, 2007</xref>) but are far more dominant in media descriptions of SB. This reflects previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0963662511403876">Cserer and Seiringer, 2009</xref>) that experts describe SB in terms of its engineering work culture. In addition, there is an implicit allusion to creativity by invoking professional categories such as designers (“designer-microbes,” Technology Review, 27 December 2006; “designer-fuels,” Technology Review, 14 August 2007), genetic material “off the shelf” (Berliner Zeitung, 25 January 2008) and “made-to-measure” organisms (Kurier, 26 January 2008). The aspect of design also carries connotations of the technological manipulation of natural structures with uncertain consequences and of scientists as having the “power to reconfigure nature according to their own purposes” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0963662511403876">Petersen, 2005</xref>: 205). Similar to gene technology, these connotations of unforeseen results put SB in the context of risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0963662511403876">Musolff, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Another framing, apparently religious, was drawn upon in 34% of all articles: creation. It became manifest in metaphors like “Genesis” or “playing God” pointing at ethical questions. In his study on metaphors of biotechnology, Liakopoulos named one religious category “hubris” standing for arrogance or haughtiness: “the manner by which humans pride themselves on having god-like qualities” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0963662511403876">Liakopoulos, 2002</xref>: 18). He linked it to the “playing God” metaphor known from public representations of in-vitro fertilisation or cloning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0963662511403876">Dabrock, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0963662511403876">Petersen, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0963662511403876">Petersen et al., 2005</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0963662511403876">Van den Belt (2009)</xref>, “playing God” is a journalistic cliché no longer linked to a religious meaning but pointing at a deified nature. It illustrates the danger of overstepping socially and culturally sanctioned boundaries such as life and non-life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0963662511403876">Dabrock, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0963662511403876">Van den Belt, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Linked to the rhetorical use of God was the “Frankenstein” or monster motif pointing out the unforeseen results of technological manipulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0963662511403876">Musolff, 2009</xref>). Both metaphor categories, used excessively in discussions of life sciences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0963662511403876">Liakopoulos, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0963662511403876">Pramling and Säljö, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0963662511403876">Wagner et al., 2006</xref>), refer to ethical questions about the meaning of life and the moral adequacy of intervention in nature. In addition, “monsters” were used with a connotation of the fear of misuse, for example terrorists’ use of “monster microbes” (Der Spiegel, 14 August 2006). Information, text and code metaphors – referring to the alphabet, letters, writing or reading as in the communication of modern genetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0963662511403876">Pramling and Säljö, 2007</xref>) – also appeared in the media representation of SB (“genetic code: from reading to writing,” Die Presse, 27 May 2006). Despite a long tradition in molecular sciences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0963662511403876">Brandt, 2005</xref>) and science communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0963662511403876">Hellsten, 2005</xref>), they were not the most dominant here.</p>
<p>An interesting framing of SB emphasised playfulness. One of the headlines (“Dr. Venter plays Lego,” Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung, 27 January 2008), represents a group of articles using the Lego metaphor and other references to crafts. This conformed to an expert’s description of SB being in a “game state” and that the “Synthetic Biology community is playing with developing parts” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0963662511403876">Cserer and Seiringer, 2009</xref>: 31). Playing was considered to be fun. Projects to produce bacteria smelling like bananas or peppermint (Der Spiegel, 14 August 2006; Die Welt online, 9 February 2009) conveyed fun as an essential part of the scientific work. Playing might point to creative approaches to solutions; however, it might also question the seriousness of the endeavour, for example when writing messages in genomes by way of an amino acid sequence (Die Presse, 31 January 2008). “Playing a game” was also seen in the context of the International Genetically Engineered Machine competition (iGEM).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0963662511403876">5</xref></sup> It was displayed as a driving force not only for scientific progress but also for community building, particularly important for an emerging cross-disciplinary field in the transition from “forming and storming” to its “norming and performing” phases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0963662511403876">Smith, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>In summary, a number of stylistic devices known from genetic engineering were prominent in SB media coverage, such as “made-to-measure” products known from personalised medicine or human scientists ascribed God-like “designer” or “engineer” roles as in media representations of stem cell research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0963662511403876">Musolff, 2009</xref>). Also, the metaphor of “building blocks,” frequently used to express the engineering aspect of SB, can be found in previous descriptions of the role of DNA in genetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0963662511403876">Pramling and Säljö, 2007</xref>). However, the engineering aspect has gained much importance in SB coverage, which reflects the definition of SB as a combination of science and engineering.</p>

<title>4. Conclusion</title>
<p>Synthetic biology is still a side issue in the German-language media although there are indications that it has become established as a topic in the science sections. As Kronberger et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0963662511403876">2009</xref>: 25) pointed out, SB is “not perceived as different enough from biotechnology to merit special attention” and is supposed to raise the same questions as biotechnology. This is supported by the fact that 35% of the articles deal with SB without mentioning the term. Benefits and risks are presented similarly to previous discussions of gene technology, with similar figurative language. Furthermore, incidents have yet to evoke scandal, limiting the newsworthiness of SB. Reference to elite persons and events apparently has the highest news value.</p>
<p>As SB is an emerging technology and applications are likely to arise in the near future, media coverage might intensify. This could imply a transition to other media sections and eventually to tabloids. In contrast to the neutral presentation in the science sections there would be more room for emotional bonding. If framed negatively, this (and only this) would constitute the case stakeholders fear, namely SB evoking public concerns similar to those of gene technology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0963662511403876">Torgersen, 2009</xref>). For now, there are no hints at public opposition in the media, and SB seems to “hibernate” behind biotechnology.</p>
<p>So far, media coverage on SB has been ambivalent, presenting pictures from a possible “knight in shining armour” (taz.de, 26 January 2008<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0963662511403876">6</xref></sup>), solving problems such as climate change or the energy crisis, to a “Frankenstein’s creation”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0963662511403876">7</xref></sup> when man meddles with nature and creates uncontrollable “monsters.” This mixture of fascination and repulsion also influences the way persons are portrayed, most prominently J. Craig Venter (“juggler of genes,” Die Welt, 25 January 2008; “star and outrider,” Telepolis, 24 January 2008), who is compared to Frankenstein at times. The metaphor category of “playing” reflects this ambivalence well, questioning the endeavour’s seriousness as well as pointing to the creative aspect of problem solving.</p>
<p>SB not only builds organisms with “biobricks” but is also building its own community. It is in a phase of creating a scientific as well as a general audience reached through the media. Whether these audiences will be mutually reinforcing or antagonistic, how SB will be affectively embedded in public discourse and how scientists will react to such embedding remain to be seen.</p>
