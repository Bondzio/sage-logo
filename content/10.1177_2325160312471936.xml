<p>Sometimes I surprise myself. After all, working as a diabetes educator is largely about numbers.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Clear as day, I can remember sitting at the kitchen table asking my mother for help with math homework. She took one look at my worksheet and told me that this “new math” was too confusing and not to worry about it because nobody in our family could do math anyway. We are “word people,” she proclaimed brightly.</p>
<p>Aside from this not being a stellar parenting moment, there is a bit of foreboding in it. Two years later, my younger brother was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes at age 7. This left my mother overwhelmed with a boatload of numbers she didn’t understand or want to hear.</p>
<p>The numbers my mother dealt with are not the same numbers I wrestle with today. I watched her with a knot in the pit of my stomach as she put drops of urine and water in a test tube to check David’s sugar. The Clinitest tablet started fizzing when she dropped it in this concoction.</p>
<p>Rapidly, I learned that when the concoction turned yellow, indicating a 4+ sugar, my brother failed the test and my mom cried. Thankfully, blood glucose meters came along and replaced 1+, 2+, 3+, and 4+ with milligrams per deciliter. While there was a learning curve to using these readings, we all got comfortable with this “new math” together.</p>
<p>Diabetes in 2012 is a disease that has been studied up one side and down the other, I reassure newbies. Sorting through the mountain of information coming at you can be difficult, I warn. My aim is to frame up the information and offer an unbiased perspective.</p>
<p>The merging of the entertainment industry and medicine has made diabetes education a complicated business. I remember when Oz was merely a wizard. I wish eating too much sugar caused diabetes and margarine caused heart disease. What a nice, focused problem to fix. More likely, the causes are nebulous, and I know what a formidable opponent blood sugar is. I need look no further than the meter download on my desk to see what I am up against.</p>
<p>My father was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes in the early 1960s. He was a physical laborer taking 1 shot of NPH and Regular a day in a world without blood glucose meters, A1C tests, carb counting, or a multitude of other diabetes management tools that we now take for granted. Back then, we labeled a whole generation of people with uncontrolled diabetes “noncompliant,” and we gave up on them.</p>
<p>I need only look at my family tree to see the progress we have made in fighting my old nemesis, hyperglycemia. We now have standardized goals and improved treatments that make diabetes management a less lonely endeavor. Diabetes educators serve as the voice of experience, bridging gaps in knowledge and confidence and offering perspective until people can do it for themselves.</p>
<p>I can’t help thinking about how comforting it would have been for my mother to have someone to lean on. Knowing that hypoglycemia caused my father’s recurrent seizures would have changed our lives. Understanding insulin action times and how to adjust insulin would have offered a beacon of hope. Our education seemed to be limited to a few vague rules: No sugar, only angel food cake on birthdays, and take your shot every day.</p>
<p>While the dog-eat-dog pursuit of quality measures and the business it has become is frustrating, I know that the numbers I chase are not the numbers that brought my mom to tears. She cried over mortality rates, amputation rates, and a lot of other grim statistics that I am confident have improved.</p>
<p>In my small office, I meet person after person, poring over their numbers. It is always a good sign when their words start changing from fear, frustration, and anger to hope, confidence, and acceptance. It is in that moment that I know I am making a difference—as a “word person.” ■</p>
