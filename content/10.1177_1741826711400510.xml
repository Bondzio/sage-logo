<abstract>
<p><bold>Background:</bold> Detection and registration of high risk for cardiovascular diseases (CVD) by assessing individual’s absolute cardiovascular risk is recommended in clinical guidelines. Effective interventions to reduce cardiovascular risk are available, but not optimally implemented. The aim of this study was to assess the quality of cardiovascular risk-factor recording and lifestyle counselling in high-risk patients in European primary care and to identify factors related to these clinical processes.</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> An international cross-sectional observational study was conducted in stratified samples of primary care practices in nine European countries. Patient records were audited, using a structured data-abstraction tool based on internationally developed quality indicators. To identify factors associated with the recording, additional data were collected in a patient survey. Descriptive and multilevel data analyses were conducted.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> In 268 general practices across Europe, 3723 records of individuals at high risk for cardiovascular diseases were audited. We found important variations in the quality of documentation of risk factors and lifestyle interventions. Recording of risk factors was best for blood pressure (92.5% of audited records, 95% CI 0.89–0.96). Lifestyle advice was recorded best for smoking cessation (65.6%, 95% CI 0.58–0.73) and worst for physical activity (38.8%, 95% CI 0.31–0.47). Of the study population, 50.6% (0.42–0.59) had elevated blood pressure levels, 59.8% (0.51–0.69) had total cholesterol &gt;5 mmol/l, and 30.5% (0.22–0.39) were smokers. Multivariate analyses showed that recording of risk factors and counselling were related to specific patient characteristics more than to country effects.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Analysis of different country results can be helpful for developing quality-improvement strategies.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1741826711400510"><title>Background</title>
<p>Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the major cause of premature death in most European populations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1741826711400510">1</xref></sup> CVD is an important source of disability and contributes to the expanding costs of health care.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1741826711400510">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1741826711400510">2</xref></sup> Atherosclerosis, which is the underlying pathology of most CVDs, develops insidiously over many years and is usually advanced by the time symptoms emerge.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1741826711400510">3</xref></sup> It is long known that the development of CVD strongly relates to modifiable lifestyle factors such as smoking, poor physical activity, and unhealthy diets, with overweight and obesity as consequences. Healthcare providers face the challenge to monitor and manage risk factors and life styles in large numbers of individuals with increased risk for developing CVD. Modification of risk factors has unequivocally been shown to reduce morbidity and mortality.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1741826711400510">4</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1741826711400510">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>Cardiovascular preventive aims are to improve both quality of life and life expectancy for people at increased risk for developing CVD and those with established CVD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1741826711400510">7</xref></sup> Mass screening for CVD in the general population is not cost-effective,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1741826711400510">8</xref></sup> but opportunistic screening in the primary care setting is more promising.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1741826711400510">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1741826711400510">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>The key to CVD risk management is comprehensive risk assessment. Clinical guidelines, such as the European Guideline on cardiovascular disease prevention, recommend the assessment of the individual’s absolute global risk to get a cardiovascular event or to die from CVD within a specific timeframe as the basis for risk management,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1741826711400510">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1741826711400510">10</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1741826711400510">13</xref></sup> rather than to focus on individual risk factors separately. Consensus was reached on quality indicators for recording risk factors and lifestyle interventions in patients at high risk for CVD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1741826711400510">14</xref></sup> In the past, large European studies such as EUROASPIRE, have focussed on prevention of patients with established CVD,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1741826711400510">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1741826711400510">15</xref></sup> and stated a compelling need for more effective lifestyle management.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1741826711400510">16</xref></sup> However, data on prevention in patients at high risk for CVD in primary care were not available. We report here on a large European study which focused on cardiovascular risk management in primary care. The aim of this paper was to describe the registered cardiovascular risk assessment and lifestyle interventions in primary care patients at high risk for CVD in nine European countries.</p>

<sec id="sec2-1741826711400510" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title>
<p>This large European observational cross-sectional study (EPA Cardio) was conducted between 2008 and 2009. The participating countries were recruited from the TOPAS Europe Association, which is a collaboration of researchers of quality improvement in health care founded in January 2005. Ethics committees in all countries approved the study.</p>
<p>General practices were approached by the national research teams mostly out of a list provided by medical associations, intending to include 36 practices with 15 patients per practice from each of the countries in order to achieve a predefined degree of statistical accuracy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1741826711400510">17</xref></sup> The practices willing to cooperate were stratified by urbanization and practice size. ‘Rural’ was defined as practice in a town with fewer than 100,000 inhabitants. Size was ‘small’ with up to two GPs and ‘large’ with more than two GP full-time equivalents. Out of the resulting four stratification boxes, practices were randomly chosen according to the national distribution of general practices across the countries with the intention of achieving a representative country sample.</p>
<p>In each practice, 30 patients at high risk for CVD were randomly sampled (assuming 50% response) and invited to participate. Inclusion and exclusion criteria for patients are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1741826711400510">Table 1</xref>.

<p>Practice staff, mostly nurses but also practice assistants or GPs, identified the target population out of the practice registry receiving detailed written instructions and support from the research team. In the UK, a researcher visited the practice and undertook the audit. Where applicable, the nurses’ work was financially incentivized by the national research teams. Patients were asked to give written informed consent.</p>
<p>Data on recorded risk factors and life style counselling, relating to the last 15 months, were manually abstracted out of medical records, using paper-based abstraction forms. The audit was based on EPA Cardio quality indicators which had been developed in an earlier stage of the project.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1741826711400510">14</xref></sup> Completed abstraction forms were forwarded pseudo-anonymized to the national research teams. The following cardiovascular risk factors were audited: blood pressure, cholesterol, blood glucose, smoking status, physical activity, and weight or body mass index (BMI). Records were also reviewed for recorded lifestyle advice on smoking, physical activity and diet.</p>
<p>Participating patients were also asked to complete a patient questionnaire about sociodemographic factors. All instruments had been developed and piloted in the EPA Cardio project before being applied in the study.</p>
<p>Descriptive data analysis was conducted using SPSS version 18.0 for Windows. Outcome measures were recorded blood pressure, cholesterol, blood glucose, smoking status and advice for smoker, physical activity status and advice, weight/BMI, and diet advice. For each of these binominal outcomes, numeric and interval-scaled explanatory variables were included in a two-level logistic regression, taking into account that patients were nested in countries (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1741826711400510">Table 2</xref>). This multilevel analysis was performed with PROC GENMOD version 9.2 (SAS).

<p>Blood pressure was documented in 92.5% of the audited records, cholesterol in 83.9% and blood glucose in 78.4%. Lifestyle factors such as smoking status, weight/BMI, and physical activity status were documented in 77.3%, 66.4%, and 45.1% respectively. The documentation of risk factors showed some variation across countries and items. In total, the recording of the three risk factors blood pressure, cholesterol, and blood glucose was better than the recording of the lifestyle factors smoking, physical activity, and weight/BMI. Blood pressure was documented best, BMI worst. Assessment of risk factors was recorded most frequently in Belgium, Slovenia, and France, whereas recording of lifestyle factors was most often in Slovenia.</p>
<p>Lifestyle advice was recorded best for smoking cessation and worst for physical activity. Advice to quit smoking was documented best in Slovenia and UK, whereas advice about diet and physical activity were recorded most frequently in Slovenia (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1741826711400510">Table 4</xref>).

<p>On the patient level, blood pressure recording increased with increasing age of 5 years. In contrast, weight/BMI/diet advice were recorded less often with increasing age. In comparison to men as reference category, female gender came along with greater recording rates of weight/BMI/diet advice as well as physical activity and advice. The more risk factors a patient had, the greater was the documentation rate of all outcomes. The duration of being patient in practice showed less significant influence. Compared with patients attending the practice more than 7 times a year, the documentation rates, except for blood glucose, were smaller in patients, who attend the practice only up to 3 times a year. Self reported health status did not influence documentation rates significantly.</p>
<p>Country origin affected the outcomes in different directions. Compared with the UK as reference country, recording rates of smoking status, and advice for smoker were smaller in all other countries, whereas recording rates of blood glucose were greater in almost all other countries.</p>

<p>We measured in our study quality indicators relating to the recording of risk factors and counselling activities in the medical records of patients at high risk for CVD. The results showed that large proportions of these patients in Europe do not receive appropriate risk assessment and lifestyle advice as recommended in European guidelines.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1741826711400510">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1741826711400510">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1741826711400510">12</xref></sup> There is considerable variation between European countries.</p>

<p>The identification of individuals at high risk for cardiovascular disease in primary care for tailoring pharmaceutical treatment and lifestyle counselling is a major strategy in the prevention of CVD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1741826711400510">3</xref></sup> Mostly cardiovascular quality-improvement programmes focus on patients with established CVD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1741826711400510">14</xref></sup> Modifiable risk factors for CHD, accounting for approximately 80% of the risk for an acute MI,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1741826711400510">18</xref></sup> are easily to identify and to follow up in patients seen in the primary care setting. We found high percentages of individuals with elevated blood pressure and dyslipidaemia, suggesting that risk-factor treatment in this patient group is suboptimal. Similar rates were reported in the EUROASPIRE III survey, which reported data of high-risk patients out of general practices, although it is not mentioned how many practices per country were involved in this study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1741826711400510">7</xref></sup> Similar studies showed considerable variation in recording rates of risk factors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1741826711400510">19</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1741826711400510">21</xref></sup> Our results show that recording of lifestyle factors is improvable, especially recording of physical activity levels. Considering that the majority of our study population were overweight, it would be important to assess physical activity as a crucial part of weight-reduction interventions. Reasons for this might be that it takes more time and effort to assess individual’s lifestyle than to measure just blood pressure, as short lifestyle assessment tools are still not well implemented.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1741826711400510">22</xref></sup> Also, lifestyle factors are not needed to calculate cardiovascular risk and lifestyle advice can be provided without adequate recording. Low figures of lifestyle recording were also found in other studies within the primary healthcare setting.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1741826711400510">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>Lifestyle modifications are an integral part of effective disease-management plans,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1741826711400510">24</xref></sup> and effective behavioural counselling strategies for the primary care setting are described.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1741826711400510">25</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1741826711400510">28</xref></sup> Behaviour change counselling in general practices means continuous processes over a long time. Ideally, GPs should agree goals with patients stepwise during every consultation and follow up consequently: for example, without recording of goals or motivational stage, it is hardly possible to structure counselling steps as recommended. Therefore, in our opinion, GPs should assess risk factors and lifestyle, offer behaviour-oriented counselling and record the findings simultaneously. In our study, rates for recorded lifestyle counselling were improvable.</p>

<p>Increasing age was correlated positively with the documentation of blood-pressure and blood glucose, in line with previous studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1741826711400510">21</xref></sup> Gender inequalities were also seen in other studies which reported greater recording rates for cholesterol levels of treatment in men.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1741826711400510">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1741826711400510">30</xref></sup> The number of risk factors had the most impact on recording and counselling. This is consistent with other studies, which have shown that documentation in patients with established diseases is greater than in patients at lower risk and may reflect GPs’ attention on established diseases rather than on systematic risk-factor checking.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1741826711400510">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1741826711400510">30</xref></sup></p>
<p>The differences between the countries may be associated with different healthcare systems and different availability and reimbursement of preventive services. The UK showed greatest rates for the recording of smoking status and advice, explainable by quality-improvement strategies incentivizing recording of risk factors due to the Quality and Outcome Framework.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1741826711400510">31</xref></sup> Research has showed that technical enhancement of the electronic medical record, such as the automatic calculation of CHD risk and feedback, could lead to an increase of risk-factor documentation and detection of CHD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1741826711400510">32</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="sec10-1741826711400510"><title>Strengths and limitations</title>
<p>This is one of the largest international studies on management of high cardiovascular risk in patients without established cardiovascular diseases in European primary care. We used validated measures and carefully designed sampling procedures. Nevertheless, in some countries it was difficult to enrol 36 practices per country as intended in the study protocol. The additional workload of the audit and the difficulties in selecting the eligible patient groups out of the practice registry were the most important reasons for declining participation. Another limitation is that different sampling methods were used, e.g. based on ICPC codes in some countries but not in others, resulting in different samples. Women were underrepresented, which was to be expected as being ‘male over 60 years’ was one of the risk factors used for inclusion, explaining also the mean age of 66 years in the sample. However, in our logistic regression model we took the differences regarding demographic characteristics into account.</p>

<p>Completeness of risk-factor assessment is an important precondition for identifying patients at high risk for CVD and for modifying therapy accordingly. Although recording of risk factors such as blood pressure and cholesterol has improved over the years, the assessment of lifestyle factors and lifestyle counselling is consistently low. Disease-management strategies should consider addressing both sets of issues simultaneously to reduce the incidence of CVD. Analysis of different country results with different healthcare systems can be helpful for developing quality-improvement strategies in cardiovascular prevention.</p>
