<abstract>
<p>Atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases remain the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in both developed and developing countries. Adequate treatment of vascular risk factors, such as low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and systolic blood pressure are known to reduce the future risk of cardiovascular disease in these patients. However currently, large treatment gaps exist among high-risk individuals, in whom the guidelines recommend concomitant treatment with aspirin, statin, and blood-pressure lowering agents. Combining aspirin, cholesterol, and blood-pressure lowering agents into a single pill called the cardiovascular polypill has been proposed as complementary care in the prevention of cardiovascular diseases in both intermediate- and high-risk patient populations. It is now a decade since the first recommendations to develop and trial cardiovascular polypills. The major scientific debate has been about the appropriate initial target population. This review article focuses on the potential role of fixed-dose combination therapy in different patient populations, outlines the pros and cons of combination therapy, and emphasizes the rationale for trialing their use. Current and planned future cardiovascular polypill trials are summarized and the pre-requisites for implementation of the polypill strategy in both primary and secondary prevention are described. The recent development of combination pills containing off-patent medications holds promise for highly affordable and effective treatment and evidence is emerging on the use of this strategy in high-risk populations.</p>

<p>Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in both developed and developing countries. An epidemiological transition is occurring rapidly in recent decades in most low- and middle-income countries (LMIC), so most cardiovascular morbidity and mortality now occurs in these countries with attendant high social and economic impact.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1741826711428066">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1741826711428066">2</xref></sup> Control of this epidemic will require simultaneously addressing the societal determinants of the root causes of cardiovascular disease, the development of risk factors among individuals, and the use of medicines and other technologies to prevent and treat disease. This article focuses on the role of combination cardiovascular medicines (‘polypills’), outlining the rationale for trialing their use in high-risk patients and reviewing the ongoing trials.</p>
<sec id="sec2-1741826711428066"><title>Current guideline recommendations for long-term use of aspirin, statin, and BP-lowering agents</title>
<p>In patients with established symptomatic cardiovascular disease current guidelines recommend the use of aspirin, statin, and blood pressure (BP)-lowering agents with little constraints. This reflects the enormous body of evidence that such treatments reduce the risk of cardiovascular events and mortality, regardless of the initial levels of risk factors and independent of other treatments.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1741826711428066">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1741826711428066">6</xref></sup> Among people without established cardiovascular disease, there has been a transition in recent decades from treatment recommendations for statin and BP treatment being based on single risk factors (e.g. hypertension thresholds) to treatment based on predicted absolute risk of cardiovascular disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1741826711428066">7</xref></sup> Also in high-risk patients, statin and BP-lowering agents are recommended to be used unless clear contraindications exist. The reduction of risk factor is proportional to the clinical benefits.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1741826711428066">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1741826711428066">5</xref></sup> The use of aspirin in primary prevention is still under debate, although recent evidence demonstrating a considerable reduction in cancer deaths with long-term use can be expected to further change the risk–benefit equation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1741826711428066">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1741826711428066">8</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-1741826711428066"><title>Current treatment gaps in high-risk groups</title>
<p>Given the evidence that reductions in any level of cholesterol and BP reduce cardiovascular risk, pharmacological treatment should be prescribed to the vast majority of high-risk patients. However, a substantial gap exists between recommended treatment and clinical practice. Several reports indicate inadequate prescription rates of anti-platelet, lipid-, and BP-lowering agents and non-achievement of treatment goals. The EUROASPIRE III survey has shown that, in patients with established coronary artery disease (CAD), cholesterol was on target in 54% and BP in 39% of the patients. Anti-platelet agents were used in 91%, statins in 78%, beta-blockers in 80%, and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors/angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs) in 71% of the patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1741826711428066">9</xref></sup> Studies in Australia have shown that only about 50% of patients with established disease are receiving all three recommended treatments (aspirin, statin, and BP-lowering agents) and this falls to only 10% amongst high-risk patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1741826711428066">10</xref></sup> A survey performed in LMIC showed that patients with CAD and ischaemic cerebrovascular disease received aspirin in 80% and 71%, statins in 30% and 14%, beta-blockers in 48% and 23%, and ACE inhibitors in 40% and 38%, respectively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1741826711428066">11</xref></sup> These data indicate that even larger prescription gaps exist in LMIC countries compared to suboptimal prescription rates in high-income countries. It should also be emphasized that prescription rates exceed consumption or individual dosing rates. Various barriers may underlie suboptimal prescribing rates and low treatment-continuation rates in high-risk patients, which include the complexity of preventive treatment regimes for both doctors and patients, inequities in healthcare delivery and medication costs.</p>
<p>Non-adherence to therapy is one of the main obstacles for the unsatisfactory reduction of risk factors. Non-adherence is characterized by premature cessation of treatment together with suboptimal use of medication and is correlated with an increased risk of mortality.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1741826711428066">12</xref></sup> It is especially relevant in chronic, asymptomatic diseases as cessation of treatment does not lead to immediate discomfort. Patients usually do not understand the importance of taking long-term medication. Long-term adherence is low, with only 70% adherence to aspirin therapy and 45% to lipid- and BP-lowering therapy after 12 months.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1741826711428066">13</xref></sup> The problem gets worse as the number of prescribed drugs per day increases. Increasing age, established cardiovascular disease and/or type 2 diabetes usually indicate the usage of more than five drugs per day, polypharmacy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1741826711428066">14</xref></sup> Treating high-risk patients often require prescription of multiple medications even though this is known to be associated with diminishing adherence, inadequate prescription and drug interactions.</p>
<p>High drug costs largely affect treatment gaps in developing countries where most healthcare services are paid for out-of-pocket with little or no subsidy through health insurance or government. In this setting, the economic burden of secondary prevention of cardiovascular diseases is enormous, as the price of a month’s treatment can amount to 1–18 days’ wages of a government worker.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1741826711428066">15</xref></sup> Consequently, preventive drugs are unaffordable for the majority of individuals in developing countries. Patients can delay or omit drug doses and avoid collecting prescriptions in attempts to reduce costs. Though the efficacy concerns of preventive strategies may be recognized at a high scientific level, access and supply for the target population remains the major challenge.</p>

<sec id="sec4-1741826711428066"><title>The history of cardiovascular combination pills</title>
<p>Combination pills have been used for decades in hypertension and other diseases. The concept of ‘aspolol’ (aspirin and atenolol) was first discussed in the 1970s (R Peto, personal communication). Patents for multicomponent combination pills began to be lodged in the late 1990s.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1741826711428066">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1741826711428066">17</xref></sup> The first major scientific meeting on this concept was held in 2001, when the World Health Organization and The Wellcome Trust convened a meeting of experts to discuss evidence-based and affordable interventions for non-communicable diseases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1741826711428066">18</xref></sup> A major impetus for the meeting was the potential of fixed-dose combination pills containing aspirin, statin, and BP-lowering agents, noting ‘the use of a single pill could well encourage patients to adhere to treatment as well as seriously reduce the cost of the drugs’. In the medical literature, the concept of the cardiovascular polypill, a fixed-dosed combination pill, was discussed by Yusuf in 2002.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1741826711428066">19</xref></sup> The term ‘polypill’ was introduced with the publication of the Wald and Law’s papers in 2003. Wald and Law estimated that the use of a single pill (containing aspirin, a statin, three BP-lowering drugs, and folic acid) in all people aged over 55 years would reduce cardiovascular disease by more than 80% (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1741826711428066">Table 1</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1741826711428066">20</xref></sup> This proposal stimulated much discussion and resistance. Criticism of the polypill strategy seemed to be based on the view that it would largely be applied in the primary prevention of a population at a relatively low absolute risk of cardiovascular disease. It was argued that a large proportion of the population would be medicated unnecessarily. Furthermore, there was concern that the polypill might induce a sense of protection and deflect attention from healthy lifestyle behaviours like low fat diet and physical activity. On the other hand, Wald and Law pointed out that age is by far the best discriminator of cardiovascular risk, and that such criticisms would not be levelled to an intervention that reduced 80% of cancer, even though that would provide less health benefits compared to an intervention that reduced cardiovascular disease by 80%.

</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1741826711428066"><title>Polypill in high-risk groups</title>
<p>The use of the polypill in high-risk populations could be seen as the ‘low hanging fruit’ for research and implementation, for several reasons. Patients with established cardiovascular disease are at the highest absolute risk. Furthermore at a population level, over 40% of all events occur in 5–8% of people with symptomatic cardiovascular disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1741826711428066">21</xref></sup> In these patients, there is no doubt that the multiple components are indicated and the margin of benefit is high. By avoiding complex decision algorithms and enhancing the simplicity of prescribing medication, the polypill may well help in closing current substantial treatment gaps in this group. The polypill could be considered as baseline therapy providing the minimum standard therapy for high-risk individuals. The simplicity of the polypill containing ‘the core cardiovascular package’ could minimize physician visits for dose titration. The principal goal of this polypill strategy is reducing the risk of cardiovascular events and mortality and not normalizing risk factors. It should be noted that the polypill strategy does not rule out tailored care as every individual can be treated with additional cholesterol- and/or BP-lowering agents if the treatment goals are not achieved. If the effectiveness of this strategy is proven, polypills with various combinations of individual drugs at various dosages can be formulated, thus increasing the possibility of individualizing care.</p>
<p>Improvement of adherence in patients with a high cardiovascular risk is an important principle of the polypill. A pill burden of six or more pills per day is not uncommon in cardiovascular patients, especially with comorbid problems such as diabetes. It has been expected that reducing the number of pills increases adherence to therapy. This issue has not been extensively explored but there is evidence that indicates better medication adherence when combination treatments are used in the management of a variety of conditions including hypertension.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1741826711428066">22</xref></sup> The WHO suggested that increasing the effectiveness of adherence to therapy may have greater impact on the health of the population than any new interventions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1741826711428066">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>One further issue is cost-effectiveness. The use of aspirin, a statin, a beta-blocker, and an ACE inhibitor in the secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease is well accepted and part of standard care in most LMIC. Current standards qualify these treatments as highly cost-effective.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1741826711428066">24</xref></sup> A major advantage of the polypill, with tremendous consequences on health care in developing countries, relates to the low costs and improved affordability. By dispensing a single generic pill instead of the individual drugs, packaging, dispensing, and pharmacy expenditure can be reduced enormously. The aimed annual per patient cost for developing countries would be approximately €15–50 and for developed countries €100–200. In India, this equates to less than 3 rupees per pill per day. The intended pricing, motivated by public health considerations, would increase equitable access in LMIC and has the potential to bring an effective preventive strategy within the financial reach of poorer individuals and government in LMIC. Other indirect costs might also be reduced due to less physician/healthcare visits and laboratory tests. However, lower medication costs do not guarantee increasing cost-effectiveness. This needs to be addressed in future studies.</p>
<sec id="sec6-1741826711428066"><title>Limitations of the polypill</title>
<p>Even though the polypill strategy is conceptually simple, there are certain drawbacks to a combination pill meaning that pill strategy will not be applicable in every individual. For example, most of the current polypills contain an ACE inhibitor, which is known for causing cough, and beta-blockers, known for causing fatigue and limiting prescription in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Due to fixed combinations in the polypill, there is no flexibility in being able to change the class of BP-lowering drugs due to unacceptable side effects or contraindications. If patients develop side effects due to one of the agents, they have to stop taking the complete polypill and start taking individual agents again. This may be addressed in the future by the marketing of several polypills with differing components thereby giving the clinician greater choice of drug class whilst retaining the convenience of the polypill.</p>
<p>In addition, because of the combination of agents at a fixed dose in a polypill, it may not be suitable for all patients, as, for example, it may cause adverse events like orthostatic hypotension or dizziness in those requiring lower doses of BP-lowering agents. Alternatively, if the doses of some agents in a polypill are insufficient for some patients and treatment goals are not reached, then additional doses of those agents may be prescribed in addition to the polypill. However, it is hypothesized that the increase in adherence outweighs the relatively lower doses of the agents in a polypill and less frequently reaching treatment targets. Current clinical trials aim to test this hypothesis.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-1741826711428066"><title>Trialing the polypill</title>
<p>Though the effectiveness and efficacy of the individual agents of polypill have been demonstrated widely, the effectiveness of this strategy of providing treatment needs to be assessed. Currently several randomized controlled trials have been initiated, assessing the efficacy of the polypill in various patient populations using different study designs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1741826711428066">Table 2</xref>). Additional fundamental questions about this new simple and theoretically attractive treatment strategy are whether patients will use it and whether doctors, nurses, and healthcare systems will adopt it. At present, in clinical practice, the acceptance of the polypill by physicians seems to be moderate to high.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1741826711428066">25</xref></sup>

<sec id="sec8-1741826711428066"><title>Trials testing the polypill versus placebo</title>
<p>Three trials that have assessed the effects of polypill treatment on risk factor reductions, tolerability and estimated cardiovascular risk in low-risk populations have been published (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1741826711428066">Table 2</xref>). The Indian Polycap Study (TIPS) randomized 2053 low-risk individuals, aged 45–80 years and with one or more risk factors, to 12-week treatment with the Polycap (simvastatin 20 mg, aspirin 100 mg, hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg, atenolol 50 mg, and ramipril 5 mg) or to one of the eight other groups (aspirin, simvastatin, hydrochlorothiazide, three combinations of the two BP-lowering drugs, three BP-lowering drugs, or three BP-lowering drugs plus aspirin). After 12 weeks of treatment, a low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol reduction of 0.70 mmol/l and BP reduction of systolic 7.4 and diastolic 5.6 mmHg was seen (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1741826711428066">Table 1</xref>). The trial design demonstrates that the risk factor reductions and adverse events from each treatment modality were similar in the presence and absence of other treatments. The estimated total excess (i.e. placebo-corrected) of side effects could not be calculated since each comparison group contained at least one active component.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1741826711428066">26</xref></sup></p>
<p>The second trial was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial in Iran. In total, 475 low-risk participants, aged 50–79 years, were randomized to a polypill (aspirin 81 mg, enalapril 2.5 mg, atorvastatin 20 mg, and hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg) or placebo for a period of 12 months. The trial showed that the polypill achieved modest reductions of LDL cholesterol (0.46 mmol/l) and BP (systolic 4.5 and diastolic 1.6 mmHg) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1741826711428066">Table 1</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1741826711428066">27</xref></sup> Both trials had relatively high non-attendance at final follow up; 6% in TIPS and 27% in the PolyIran trial.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1741826711428066">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1741826711428066">27</xref></sup></p>
<p>Most recent double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of a polypill (containing aspirin 75 mg, simvastatin 20 mg, lisinopril 10 mg, and hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg) was performed in an intermediate-risk population of 378 patients. The polypill significantly reduced LDL cholesterol (0.8 mmol/l) and systolic BP (9.9 mmHg) over 12 weeks of treatment. The discontinuation rates in the polypill group compared to placebo were 23% versus 18% (RR 1.33, 95% CI 0.89–2.00). The treatment was calculated to more than halve cardiovascular risk.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1741826711428066">28</xref></sup> However, the relatively short follow up precluded the assessment of long-term adherence and effect on clinically relevant outcomes.</p>
<p>Among patients without currently established indications for treatment, such as low- and intermediate-risk patients, it is likely that outcome trials will be needed to pass regulatory requirements. While there is good evidence that effects are almost all mediated through reductions of cholesterol and BP levels, the current regulatory paradigm requires clinically relevant endpoint trials. Such trials are planned, following the initial trials on risk factor levels.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec9-1741826711428066"><title>Trials testing the polypill versus active/usual care</title>
<p>Trialing the polypill in people with vascular disease or other high-risk patients requires an active comparison group, since the component medicines are indicated and often provided. Therefore, research is required on the role of polypill-based treatment compared to usual care in delivering these therapies in the long term. Trials comparing the polypill strategy versus usual care have been initiated to assess the effectiveness of different strategies to improve long-term adherence. However, all currently available measures of adherence (self-reports, prescribing, uptake, or medication devices) are imperfect in one way or another, and so proxies like LDL cholesterol and BP levels may also be necessary. Furthermore, the acceptability, efficacy, and economic impact of a polypill-based strategy for the prevention of cardiovascular events are likely to vary substantially between countries, as these will be greatly influenced by the existing healthcare systems i.e. usual care and the subsidies offered for drug therapy. Hence, information about these healthcare system parameters for polypill strategy implementation from both developed and developing countries in high-risk patients is imperative. It could be hypothesized that implementation of the polypill strategy would be most beneficial in LMICs.</p>
<p>Recently the results of an open-label, parallel-group, randomized, controlled trial have been published, which enrolled 216 high-risk patients without established cardiovascular disease in Sri Lanka. The trial compared a polypill (aspirin 75 mg, simvastatin 20 mg, lisinopril 10 mg, and hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg) to usual care after 3 months of treatment. Both the polypill treatment and usual care resulted in marked reductions in total cholesterol, systolic BP, and 10-year risk of cardiovascular disease. These reductions in risk factor levels were not significantly different between the two treatment groups. However, it has been stated that the prescribed therapies in regular care comprised more use of statins and BP-lowering agents than was to be expected. Also adverse events were similar in both groups.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1741826711428066">29</xref></sup></p>
<p>A large international initiative to address the effects of polypill versus usual care was undertaken by the Single Pill to Avert Cardiovascular Events (SPACE) collaboration. The collaboration was initiated in 2009 and comprises a group of academic investigators from Australia, New Zealand, India, China, South Africa, Brazil, Canada, UK, Ireland, and The Netherlands. Currently, three trials have been initiated and others in different countries are planned. Each trial is as similar to ‘real life’ as possible within each national setting whilst maintaining as much uniformity between all trials as possible to facilitate the final pooling of data. Ultimately, in addition to providing locally relevant findings, it is anticipated that a pre-specified meta-analysis will provide substantial power to examine the effects of the intervention on clinical outcomes (including cardiovascular events such as myocardial infarction, stroke and mortality). Currently, the IMPACT (IMProving Adherence using Combination Therapy) trial in New Zealand is recruiting 600 patients, the Kanyini-GAP (Guidelines Adherence with the Polypill) trial in Australia 1000 patients, and the UMPIRE (Use of a Multidrug Pill In Reducing cardiovascular Events) trial in Europe and India 2000 patients. The polypill strategy will be assessed in patients with either clinically established cardiovascular disease or with &lt;15% 5-year CVD risk. The primary endpoints are adherence to indicated preventive medication (i.e. polypill) and changes in cholesterol and BP levels. In high-risk patients, these trials are essential to assess the efficacy of the polypill as complimentary treatment strategy compared to the usual care.</p>

<sec id="sec10-1741826711428066" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Currently, large treatment gaps exist among high-risk individuals, in whom the guidelines recommend concomitant treatment with aspirin, statin, and BP-lowering drugs. The polypill could be an important tool to help close these treatment gaps. Recent data indicate that combination pills can produce sizeable risk factor reductions, with a halving of predicted cardiovascular risk. Results from ongoing trials that are further assessing the effectiveness of combination pills in reducing cholesterol and BP levels, effects on adherence to indicated medications, and clinical outcomes would provide clear evidence on the role of polypill-based treatment strategy in long run and also hold implications for policy making to address both primary and secondary cardiovascular prevention globally.</p>
