<abstract>
<p>This article provides a bibliographical review of the major academic works which have been published in or translated into Greek and deal with the life of the Muslim minority of Greece. The article focuses on the methodological approach of these works, the time of their publication and the research fields which they cover or disregard. It argues that Greek academic works on the subject are highly influenced by the climate of Greek–Turkish relations. Most remain silent about Muslim populations who lived in the country prior to 1923 and focus on the Muslims of western Thrace, of whose minority life they give a distorted picture. This has started to change since 1989, but there is still a long way to go until Greek academia overcomes its biased, emotional and politically-influenced <italic>modus operandi</italic> on the subject and adopts a more dispassionate approach.</p>

<p>The focus of this article is Muslims who became ‘citizens’ of the Greek state through its territorial expansion from the time of its establishment as a new nation state in the 1830s to 1947, the year of its last territorial expansion – the annexation of the Dodecanese insular complex. With the exception of the Albanian-speaking Muslims of northwestern Greece, known as <italic>Çams</italic> and regarded as ethnic Albanians by the Albanian authorities, who thus sought to offer them political protection, the rest of the Muslims in Greece have been seen by the Ottoman Empire and later the Republic of Turkey as a religious kin group. Istanbul – and later Ankara – sought to protect this group’s minority rights in the various treaties which the Ottoman Empire, and after its demise the Republic of Turkey, signed with Greece.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0265691412448044">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>All that remains today of these people is a community of around 120,000 living in western Thrace – in the northeast of the Greek mainland – as well as fewer than 5,000 people living on the islands of Rhodes and Kōs.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0265691412448044">2</xref></sup> The rest left the country as a result of forced and voluntary emigrations, the compulsory Greek–Turkish population exchange of 1923 and retaliatory measures taken by the Greek state authorities and paramilitary organizations.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0265691412448044">3</xref></sup> The above numbers exclude the very many Muslim immigrants from neighbouring Balkan states, and the Middle and Far East who have come to Greece since 1989 seeking work and temporary or permanent settlement away from the political and economic hardships of their respective countries. These Muslim migrants are not, in any case, the focus of this article.</p>
<p>The existence of Muslims within the Greek territory has always been a hot issue in Greek politics and public life. This is especially so for the Muslims of western Thrace, the only officially recognized religious or ethnic minority in Greece, and both officially and widely known as ‘the Muslim minority of Greece’. For the majority of Greeks, the Muslims of western Thrace are seen as a <italic>Trojan horse</italic>, an ethnically and religiously alien group, akin to the country’s perceived biggest national enemy, namely Turkey, which could in the long term question state sovereignty in that region.</p>
<p>Greek historiography shares responsibility for this attitude. Overall the relationship between Greek historiography and the Muslim minority has been problematic in the sense that most published academic works have been influenced by the current political climate in Greek–Turkish relations. For this reason, this article aims to explore the way the Muslim minority is portrayed in major academic works which have been published in or translated into Greek. It examines the political environment in which they have been published, especially in relation to the political climate in Greek–Turkish relations, and discusses how this environment affects the timing of publication of these works and the research subjects they discuss, as well as their arguments in relation to these subjects, and, finally, their methodology and literary style. The article reviews major published monographs, journal articles and research papers written in Greek by academics working in academic institutes, and NGOs in the Hellenic Republic. Of course, there are published works which are not referred to in the article. This is for practical reasons, as it would have been impossible to review all the published work on the subject in a single such article, and because, rather than providing an exhaustive review of all published Greek historiographic works on the subject, the author’s primary aim is to provide an overall picture of the issues mentioned above by focusing on some eminent Greek academic studies.</p>
<p>The author is aware that much work on the issue has been published in other languages by non-Greek as well as Greek scholars.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0265691412448044">4</xref></sup> However, the focus of the discussion in this article is intentionally upon academic works on the Muslims of Greece which have been written in or translated into Greek. This is because the article is interested in discussing the various narratives produced on the subject by the Greek academic elite, including those foreign narratives which the native academic community showed an interest in translating into their mother tongue, and in exploring the reasons why they have done so.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-0265691412448044"><title>Timing of Publications</title>
<p>Prior to 1989 the number of published works on the Muslims of Greece was relatively small. The majority of publications on the subject appeared during the late Cold War and the early post-Cold War periods. This is exemplified by the exhaustive bibliographical overview of Foteinē Asimakopoulou and Sevastē Christidou-Lionarakē.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0265691412448044">5</xref></sup> From the approximately 164 Greek titles provided on the authors’ bibliographical lists with direct or indirect references to the Muslim minority of Greece, only 55 (34%) were published before 1989. Of the 55 titles published before 1989, around 18 (11%) are translated works by non-Greek academics, mainly Turks working in Turkish academic institutes, which leaves the number of published works by Greek academics working in Greece at 37 (22.7%).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0265691412448044">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>The main explanation for this proportional discrepancy between the periods before and after 1989 is related to the current climate in Greek–Turkish relations, and the way in which that climate has affected the relationship between the Muslim population and the Greek state. Following the ethnic conflicts of the 1950s, 1960s and early 1970s between Greek and Turkish Cypriots in Cyprus, which led to the 1974 Turkish invasion of the island, Greek–Turkish relations entered a prolonged period of tension, with the two states reaching the brink of war twice, in March 1987 and in January 1996.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0265691412448044">7</xref></sup> The crisis resulted from a series of bilateral issues, including respect for the minority rights of Muslims in western Thrace in line with the provisions of the 1923 Lausanne Treaty. In this context, the affairs of the Muslims in Thrace began to be a focal point of political and academic debate in Greece.</p>
<p>In April 1990, the conservative New Democracy party came to power and about a year later this government, under the premiership of the party’s leader, Kōnstantinos Mētsotakēs, tried to reform the legal framework governing the minority status of the Muslims of Greece by introducing Law 1920/1991. This law regulated the appointment of Muslim religious leaders, muftis. It was not well received by members of the minority elite and a debate followed with the participation of members of the Greek academic community, which in turn resulted in an increase in Greek published works referring to western Thrace Muslims. Thus, works such as those of Georgoulēs, Soltaridēs and Tsitselikēs were published after the introduction of Law 1920/1991 and attempted to situate the 1991 legal reforms of the status and duties of muftis in western Thrace in a broader historical framework, with the first two even providing examples of the status and duties of muftis elsewhere in the world.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0265691412448044">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>Besides monographs and academic articles, academic debate on western Thrace Muslims has also been conducted through the press, magazines and the mass media, and in this way reached the wider Greek public. Articles by Greek academics and specialists, such as Alexēs Alexandrēs and Kōnstantinos Vakalopoulos among others, have often appeared in the Greek press and magazines.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0265691412448044">9</xref></sup> In addition, at around the same time, in 1993, the first extensive bibliographic guide on western Thrace, with the inclusion of titles relating to the Muslim minority of the region, was compiled by Xanthippē Kotzagiōrgē and Anna Panayotopoulou. This guide was published through the Institute for Balkan Studies in Thessalonikē.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0265691412448044">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>The increasing academic focus on the Muslim minority in the 1980s and the post-1989 period can also be explained by a well-established view among academic circles in Greece and abroad that the end of the Cold War would result in regional instability in Eastern Europe and the Balkans, with minority issues being a major factor in this instability.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0265691412448044">11</xref></sup> This view was corroborated by the ethnic conflicts in the neighbouring Yugoslavia and by the disturbed state–minority relations in Bulgaria due to the Bulgarian communist regime’s attempts at the end of the 1980s to force the country’s Muslims to adopt Bulgarian names and to force a large number of Bulgarian Muslims to leave the country, as well as by the disturbed state–minority relations elsewhere in the Balkans.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0265691412448044">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>Within this context a number of academic works, such as those of Koppa, Rozakēs and others, discussed the significance of the minority factor in the domestic and regional security of southeastern Europe and referred to political measures taken by international actors such as the European Union (EU), the USA, NATO and other international organizations, which improved or undermined inter-ethnic as well as state–minority relations, and thus the political, economic and social stability of the region.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0265691412448044">13</xref></sup> Other works, such as those of Tsitselikēs and Christopoulos, refer to the issue of protecting human and minority rights in Greece, including those of the country’s Muslim minority, with reference to provisions in international law, the European legal framework and social practice elsewhere in Europe.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0265691412448044">14</xref></sup> Scholars like Troubeta, Tsibiridou and Petrakē explore issues such as Greek national ideology, national identity construction, bilingualism, ethnic as well as labour relations, sexuality, gender identities, and roles inside the family, with reference to the Muslim minority of western Thrace.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0265691412448044">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>The introduction on 10 April 1989 of a form of proportional representation, for the general elections of 18 June 1989 allowed the election of Ahmet Sadik, a member of the Muslim minority in western Thrace, as an independent MP (without affiliation to any of the existing parliamentary political forces). Here was another reason for Greek academics to focus on Muslim minority affairs in the post-Cold War period. Ahmet Sadik and his colleague Ahmet Faikoğlou, who was elected as the second independent Muslim MP in the general elections of April 1990, insistently and openly raised issues such as the violation of Muslim minority rights by the Greek state and local authorities in western Thrace, the right of those minority members who wished to call themselves Turks to be allowed by the authorities to do so, and many other subjects which had been taboo for the majority of Greeks until then. Within this context, and possibly influenced by the parliamentary representation of Muslims elsewhere in the Balkans, works such as those of Dōdos and Nikolakopoulos were published, which analysed the electoral behaviour of the Muslim minority in western Thrace:<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0265691412448044">16</xref></sup> the former in comparison to the electoral behaviour of religious and ethnic minorities in Bulgaria and Albania, while the latter focuses on its electoral behaviour from 1923 to 1955.</p>
<p>Two publications, one by the Centre for the Study of Greek Society at the Academy of Athens and another by Lois Lambrianidēs, point to the economic underdevelopment of the region and its economic and social effects on Muslims,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0265691412448044">17</xref></sup> including those living inside the zone of military surveillance which the Greek state authorities imposed in the region from 1936 to 1995.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0265691412448044">18</xref></sup> These publications are sited in the context of political measures taken by the then PASOK government which aimed at relaxing the restrictive measures affecting the Muslims in Thrace and culminated in the abolition of the zone of military surveillance in 1995.</p>
<p>The deterioration of Greek–Turkish relations in the 1980s and during most of the 1990s dramatically increased the number of Greek academic works on the Muslims of Greece and led to the appearance of a number of publications which approach the subject through a narrow nationalistic prism. Their aim was to alert the Greek state authorities and public to the changing political, economic and social state of the minority through a more active political involvement by Turkey in minority affairs. Works such as those of Gerondopoulos, Kēpouros, Magriotēs and many others fall into this category.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0265691412448044">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>From the 1980s onwards, the academic landscape in Greece began to change, and by the 1990s an increasing number of young scholars with postgraduate degrees from Western universities were taking up posts in Greek academic institutes. They have introduced new fields to Greek academia, including social history, anthropology, identity formation, human rights and gender studies, often using the Muslims of western Thrace as their case study. A number of scholars mentioned above, such as Asimakopoulou, Christidou-Lionarakē, Tsitselikēs and others, fall into this category.</p>
<p>Greek–Turkish relations were not only an influence on academic publications after the 1980s, but they also influenced those rarer publications which had appeared on this subject in the earlier period. Andreadēs’ seminal work <italic>Ē Mousoulmanikē Meionotis tēs Dytikēs Thrakēs</italic> (<italic>The Muslim Minority in Western Thrace</italic>), which discusses the life of Muslims in western Thrace during the interwar period as well as their relations with the Greek and Turkish state authorities, was published in Thessalonikē in 1956, about a year after the independence movement in Cyprus and the September 1955 pogroms against the Greek population in Istanbul. In the introduction, the author justifies his decision to write the book as follows: ‘When due to the Cyprus issue, the demagogy of Turkish newspapers in Istanbul regarding the living conditions of the Muslims in western Thrace began… I decided to write… a special essay’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0265691412448044">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>Andreadēs’ book was not unique in the timing of its publication. Bekiaridēs’ work was published in 1973, during a period of ethnic conflict in Cyprus and increasing tension in Greek–Turkish bilateral relations.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0265691412448044">21</xref></sup> By the same token, Eleftheriadēs’ study, and some others that followed, appeared at a time when Greece had doubled its territory after the end of the two Balkan wars and the First World War, and, as a result of this, a great number of Muslims had become subjects of the Greek Kingdom.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0265691412448044">22</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-0265691412448044"><title>Methodology and Writing Style</title>
<p>Most published Greek works referring to the Muslims of Greece approach various aspects of the life of Muslims within the narrow prism of Greek–Turkish relations. They are not dispassionate academic works whose task is to shed light on unknown aspects of minority political, economic, social and cultural life. Rather, their common denominator is that they emphasize that the Muslims of Greece enjoy all the minority rights they should or enjoy much more freedom and better living conditions than those of the Greek Orthodox in Turkey. This is done either to support existing minority policies on the part of the Greek state authorities or to criticize these for the allegedly excessive freedom they allow to the country’s Muslims, thus not reciprocating past and/or current tough minority policies towards the Greek Orthodox by the state authorities in Turkey. That Greek scholarly works on the Muslims of Greece are not always academically dispassionate is well illustrated by Symeōn Soltaridēs’ 1997 monograph, in which he explains that:<disp-quote>
<p>A proof of the political freedoms which the Muslim Minority of western Thrace enjoys is that all its members participate, like ethnic Greeks, in the general and local elections. It is noteworthy that in 1928 19 out of 92 elected local leaders (mayors) in western Thrace were Muslims… On the contrary, Turkey has violated the civil, political and economic rights of the Greek Orthodox in Istanbul and the islands of Imvros and Tenedos, by forcing the vast majority to leave these places without the existence of any bilateral treaty to rule any population exchange between the two states.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0265691412448044">23</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Elsewhere in his book, Soltaridēs includes a section which discusses the way in which muftis are appointed in states where the majority of the population is Muslim, citing Jordan, Tunisia and Egypt, and claiming that they offer: ‘proof that Ankara’s accusations that the Greek state authorities interfere with the religious life of the Muslims in western Thrace are totally unfounded because similar procedures of appointment of muftis to those of Greece existed elsewhere’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0265691412448044">24</xref></sup> However, the author’s argument at this point contradicts information provided elsewhere in the monograph, according to which, Greek Law 586/1941, which was in use during the entire Cold War and much of the post-Cold War period, provides that the Muslim minority authorities need the prior consent of the local Orthodox Metropolitan bishops for the erection of mosques in western Thrace, which is not the case in Jordan, Tunisia or Egypt, indicating that the Greek legal system provides for the interference of the established Greek Orthodox Church, in minority affairs.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0265691412448044">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>Many of the Greek historiographical works on the country’s Muslims are empirical analyses of events, with respect to religious as well as other institutional and minority affairs, which lack a theoretical framework and are mostly descriptive. In this they follow a historiographical tradition in the country, also found elsewhere in the Balkans and beyond, according to which a good historian should be in a position to provide more information on a subject than analysis or argument, leaving the reader to reach his or her own conclusions. Scholarly works which employed theoretical tools were relatively rare before the 1990s. For example, in her 2001 monograph Troubeta employs existing theoretical works on identity and minority building and applies these to the case of the Pomaks and the Muslim Roma in western Thrace in order to answer questions such as: how do religious, national, linguistic and cultural factors on the one hand, and social conditions on the other hand, affect the way members of a minority define themselves and are defined by others?<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0265691412448044">26</xref></sup></p>
<p>The terminology adopted by scholars when referring to the Muslims of Greece is problematic and inadequately defined. With the exception of Turkish academic works which have been translated into Greek and refer to western Thrace Muslims as a ‘Turkish minority’ or ‘Turks of Greece’, the majority of Greek academic works published by Greek scholars use the term ‘Muslim minority’ when referring to the Muslims of western Thrace. This is a politically correct term accepted by the majority of the Greek political elite and public and was mentioned in both the Lausanne Treaty of 1923 and the 1923 Greek–Turkish Convention which determined the rules for obligatory population exchanges.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0265691412448044">27</xref></sup> The only exception was during the early Cold War years, when the Greek authorities followed a policy of purposeful Turkification of the minority in which the Muslims of western Thrace were then called ‘Turks of Thrace’ or the ‘Turkish minority of Thrace’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0265691412448044">28</xref></sup></p>
<p>Many Greek academic works argue that the Muslim minority of western Thrace consists of three ethnic components, namely those of Turkish origin (sometimes referred to as Turkish-speaking Muslims), the Pomaks and the Roma (<italic>Athigganoi</italic> or <italic>Tsigganoi</italic>), but only a few of these works define these terms and when they do the definition is problematic. The terms ‘Muslims of Turkish origin’ and ‘Turkish-speaking Muslims’, which are often given to the majority ethnic group of the Muslim minority, are problematic. The first is based on genetic criteria and thus it is difficult to determine who is of Turkish origin and why. The second refers to language, whereas, due to the educational policies followed by the Greek authorities after 1923 and the inter-ethnic and inter-cultural contacts among all ethnic elements of the minority, Turkish is a widely spoken language and is used by many Pomaks and Roma. The term Pomak is problematic in the sense that it is a label which has been mainly decided upon and given by others to that particular ethnic group, and was not recognized by the members of the ethnic group themselves. Similar problems occur with the definition of the third ethnic group. Terms like Gypsies, <italic>Athigganoi</italic>, <italic>Tsigannoi</italic> are avoided by the members of that ethnic group because they are pejorative. In addition, human right reports have referred to persons identifying as Pomak and Roma and objecting to a Turkish ethnic identity.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0265691412448044">29</xref></sup></p>
<p>The first serious academic attempt to deal with issues of self-definition by the members of the Muslim minority, as well as of their definition by members outside the minority, is made by Troubeta in her 2001 monograph<italic>.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0265691412448044">30</xref></sup> In this monograph the author discusses all the problems regarding definitions of the three ethnic groups of western Thrace Muslims which have already been discussed, while the concepts ‘Minority Turks’, ‘Pomaks’ and ‘<italic>Athiganoi</italic>’, which are adopted by convention, are, by the author’s own admission, problematic.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0265691412448044">31</xref></sup></p>
<p>The majority of Greek publications on the subject by the end of the 1980s, and many of those published after that time adopt a militant and aggressive literary style. Their analyses are often emotionally driven and discuss aspects of Muslim minority life in western Thrace in comparison to how these issues are dealt with by the state authorities in the Republic of Turkey. The reference points of these works are the bilateral Greek–Turkish agreements, especially the 1923 Lausanne Treaty, rather than international agreements, treaties, conventions and policies of international organizations such as the UN, the EEC/EU or the CSCE/OSCE, in which Greece also participates.</p>
<p>The same pattern is followed by Turkish works translated into Greek, such as those of Aydinli, Kadurgali and others, to which this paper refers elsewhere and whose prose style is as militant and aggressive as that of their Greek colleagues in justification of arguments put forward by the Turkish authorities that the minority rights of the Muslims of western Thrace have been violated by the Greek authorities. In fact, it is not coincidental that these Turkish works have been translated into Greek. Their translation and circulation in the Greek book market is partly because many of these works respond to published works in Greek, and therefore there is a genuine interest in how the Turkish academic community reacts to the views of Greek colleagues on the issues of the Muslim minority of Thrace. However, the translation of these Turkish works, and not of others, into Greek is often due to the fact that they are not academically dispassionate and therefore they could easily feed and justify the aggressive attitudes of the Greek government towards Turkey, as well as justifying the polemical and politically driven arguments which many Greek works employ.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-0265691412448044"><title>Fields of Research</title>
<p>The majority of Greek academic works on the Muslims of Greece refer to the post-Second World War period. For the earlier period one can find works such as those of Eleftheriadēs, analysing treaties which the Greek state had signed with the Ottoman Empire. Being a legal specialist and high-ranking civil servant himself, the primary aim of Eleftheriadēs’ publications was to instruct the Greek courts and civil service on how to deal with various issues relating to the rights of Muslims in Greece.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0265691412448044">32</xref></sup> Besides Eleftheriadēs’ works there are also publications such as those discussing the issue of Islamization of indigenous people in the region of western Thrace in the late Byzantine and Ottoman periods. One such is Zeginēs’ work, which analyses the influence of the Muslim religious order of <italic>Bektashism</italic> in converting residents of Thrace to Islam.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0265691412448044">33</xref></sup> But, if Eleftheriadēs’ works were published to instruct Greek civil servants on how to deal with legal cases raised by Muslims, Zeginēs’ work appeared at the end of the 1980s when Greek–Turkish relations were in crisis and is part of the Greek academic fervour of the time to ‘enlighten’ the Greek political elite and public on what was regarded as a foreign national group inside the country who were often part of the Greek–Turkish controversy.</p>
<p>About ten years after the end of the Second World War, in 1956, the monograph of A. Andreadēs was published, which provides detailed information on the legal status as well as the political and social life of the Muslims of western Thrace at the time, including the powers of the muftis, Muslim education and other matters. Andreadēs’ monograph covers these issues in a way which, at the time of its publication, provoked reaction among academic circles in Turkey, which claimed that many of the historical facts presented in the monograph were biased. Thus, in response to this work, there were a series of Turkish publications at around the same time which discussed aspects of the lives of Muslims in western Thrace prior to, as well as after, the Second World War.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0265691412448044">34</xref></sup> Many of these works have been translated into Greek and published in academic journals, such as <italic>Valkanikē Vivliografia</italic> (Balkan Bibliography), <italic>Deltion Tourkikēs Vivliografias</italic> (Bulletin of Turkish Bibliography) and <italic>Valkanika Symmeikta</italic> (Balkan Mixed), while a number of Greek translations of Turkish academic works with reference to Muslims in western Thrace have also been published. Most of these translations are of works which were originally published in the Turkish academic journal <italic>Türk Kültürü</italic> (Turkish Culture).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0265691412448044">35</xref></sup></p>
<sec id="sec5-0265691412448044"><title>Ethnic Components of the Muslim Minority in Greece</title>
<p>The origin of the Pomaks has been a source of discord for Greek, Turkish and Bulgarian historians since the beginning of the twentieth century. For Bulgarian historians they are Islamized Bulgarians who adopted Islam during the Ottoman period. Turkish historians see Pomaks as Bulgarized Turks. Finally, Greek historians see them as Islamized indigenous peoples, descendants of ancient Thracians – the latter are viewed as ancient Greek tribal groups. The Greek scholar Charalambidēs provides a review of the dominant views of Greek, Turkish and Bulgarian historians regarding the origin of the Pomaks, which is published in the Greek academic journal <italic>Thrakikē Epetērida</italic> (Thracian Bulletin).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0265691412448044">36</xref></sup></p>
<p>Indeed, the majority of Greek works have attempted to trace the relationship between the Pomaks and ancient Thracian tribes in the region in an effort to disprove Bulgarian claims that Pomaks are Islamized Bulgarians. These works have been influenced by the political climate of the time. Recognizing the Pomaks as a Bulgarian ethnic group was viewed as paving the way for Bulgarian communist authorities in the future to claim political, cultural and other rights over that ethnic group. A number of works have been published since the early Cold War years which argue that the Pomaks are related to ancient Thracian tribes and are therefore not Bulgarian. Among these one could mention the works of Papachristodoulou, Xyrotyrēs and others.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-0265691412448044">37</xref></sup></p>
<p>The deterioration of Greek–Turkish relations in the late 1970s and during the 1980s and 1990s was a turning point in published works referring to the Pomaks. Until then Greek academics had denied the relationship between Pomaks and Bulgarians, but Turks were now added to the picture and the Pomaks were presented as an ethnic group with no ethnic relation to either the Turks or the Bulgarians. Within this context, Papathanasē-Mousiopoulou employed a series of historical sources in order to argue that western Thrace Pomaks are a <italic>sui generis</italic> ethnic group which speak a Bulgarian dialect, practise Islam and originate from ancient tribal groups living in the region.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-0265691412448044">38</xref></sup> The anthropological works of Tsiribidou and Efstratiou, as well as the sociological work of Mavrogianēs, show that the Pomaks constitute a unique ethnic group in the Balkans, whose community, cultural and everyday lives include both elements found in other ethnic and religious groups in the Balkans and others which are unique to that ethnic group.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-0265691412448044">39</xref></sup> Papadimitriou, although he recognizes the distinctness of the Pomaks as an ethnic group, examines how the rise and development of Greek nationalism has impacted on the ethnic identity of the Pomaks.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-0265691412448044">40</xref></sup></p>
<p>With reference to Muslim groups outside western Thrace, Manta’s monograph on <italic>Çams</italic> is worth mentioning.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-0265691412448044">41</xref></sup> The monograph analyses the way in which historical developments in this ethnic group affected Greek–Albanian diplomatic relations during the first half of the twentieth century and discusses claims which are often raised by the Albanian state regarding the economic compensation which the Greek state authorities should pay to the <italic>Çams</italic> for the properties they left behind after their departure from northwestern Greece. It provides a dispassionate analysis of events during and after the Second World War which led to the departure of <italic>Çams</italic> from Greece and moves away from biased Greek and Albanian academic works on the subject. In a similar way, Giōrgos Margaritēs’ work compares the policies of the Greek state towards the <italic>Çams</italic> and the Jews. This is an important contribution to the whole debate on the minority policies of the Greek state and a valuable work for anyone interested in the subject.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-0265691412448044">42</xref></sup></p>
<p>A number of academic works, such as those of Ladas, Pentzopoulos and others, focus on the issue of the 1923 Greek–Turkish obligatory population exchange, primarily the diplomatic negotiations and legal documents of the exchange, and to a lesser extent its impact on the societies of the two states.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-0265691412448044">43</xref></sup> However, Greek academic research has shown little interest in Muslim groups who lived in Greece prior to 1923, such as those of Epirothessaly, Epirus, Macedonia and the islands of the Aegean, including Crete and the Dodecanese insular complex. This is because Greek academics have avoided touching such a sensitive issue, which challenged established views of nationhood and the establishment of the modern Greek state. This could have brought them into conflict with the political establishment, the Greek Orthodox Church and other national institutions, and could have had implications for their academic careers and even their personal lives.</p>

<sec id="sec6-0265691412448044"><title>Political Structures of Muslims in Greece</title>
<p>Greek scholars like Minaidēs, Georgoulēs, Tsitselikēs, and others, have researched issues relevant to the political organization of the Muslims of Greece, such as the appointment of muftis, and the election of Muslim community councils and their political powers.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-0265691412448044">44</xref></sup> For the legal framework of Greece’s Muslims prior to 1923, Eleftheriadēs’ research is the first of its kind, and a reference point for most subsequent academic works on the subject.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-0265691412448044">45</xref></sup> Georgoulēs and Bekiaridēs focus more on the region of western Thrace.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-0265691412448044">46</xref></sup> A number of academic works discuss the existence of a civil society among western Thrace Muslims. Tsibiridou, Kourtovik, and others, shed light on Muslim civil associations during the 1980s and 1990s, and demonstrate the decline of civic life in those years.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-0265691412448044">47</xref></sup></p>
<p>Nikolakopoulos was the first Greek scholar to examine the electoral behaviour of Greece’s Muslims with reference to the country’s general elections.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn48-0265691412448044">48</xref></sup> His work focuses on western Thrace from 1923 to 1939. The author argues that during the interwar period the Muslims of western Thrace were represented politically through existing Greek political parties and that that situation continued after the Second World War and throughout most of the Cold War years. The 1985 general elections, however, seem to have marked a turning point in electoral behaviour. In those elections Muslims in western Thrace sought political expression though a political party named <italic>Eirēnē</italic> (Peace) which was religiously based, and mainly represented the Muslims of western Thrace. This pattern continued with the foundation of the Muslim parties <italic>Embistosynē</italic> (Trust) and <italic>Peprōmeno</italic> (Destiny). Ahmet Sadik was elected as a member of the former party in the constituency of Rhodopē, in the general elections of June 1989, with Ahmet Faikoğlou elected for the latter in the April 1990 general elections in the constituency of Xanthē.</p>

<sec id="sec7-0265691412448044"><title>Inter-ethnic Relations</title>
<p>Notaras portrays Greek society as tolerant towards its religious and ethnic minorities, including the Muslims of western Thrace. He explains this tolerance as the result of Greeks’ long-standing experience with the multi-ethnic environments of the Roman, Byzantine and Ottoman Empires. Also, through the Greek diaspora, Greeks have been in cultural contact with almost every religious, social and cultural formation in the world.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn49-0265691412448044">49</xref></sup> Other scholars, however, such as Voulgarēs et al., argue that Greek society has not been as tolerant as scholars such as Notaras have portrayed it. With reference to western Thrace, in particular, Voulgarēs et al. show that the Muslims of the region have been regarded as a non-Greek group, religiously, ethnically and linguistically, and that because of this they have often fallen victim to discriminatory policies by the Greek state and xenophobic treatment by the ethnic Greeks living in the region.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn50-0265691412448044">50</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="sec8-0265691412448044"><title>Economic Life</title>
<p>Little is known about the economic life of Greece’s Muslims prior to the 1923 Greek–Turkish obligatory population exchange, or of those living outside western Thrace after 1923. For example, academic works like Nakos’ monograph mainly discuss land or property issues, agricultural relations and the problems faced by the modern Greek state after its establishment in 1832, owing to the incorporation of parts of the Islamic Ottoman law into the country’s legal system. But Nakos does not discuss any other aspects of Muslims’ economic life beyond those just mentioned.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn51-0265691412448044">51</xref></sup></p>
<p>As regards the Muslims of western Thrace, there are references to their economic activities in various published works. Andreadēs, for instance, refers to the economic life of western Thrace Muslims in a section entitled <italic>Oikonomikē Katastasis</italic> (Economic Situation), while the following section discusses measures taken by the Greek authorities to reconstruct the minority’s economic life after the Second World War and the Greek Civil War.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn52-0265691412448044">52</xref></sup> A study conducted by the Research Centre for the Greek Society of the Academy of Athens and published in 1995 refers to the geographical, social and economic isolation which characterizes the life of western Thrace Muslims.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn53-0265691412448044">53</xref></sup> This research argues that western Thrace Muslims are highly dependent on traditional agricultural activities, such as the cultivation of tobacco, cereals, corn, sugar-beets and other crops, which, together with their low level of educational attainment, makes them a marginalized social group in the region and dependent on external funding from Muslim migrants to western Europe and from Turkey. This situation renders them susceptible to political propaganda from Ankara.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn54-0265691412448044">54</xref></sup></p>
<p>In his translated article published in <italic>Valkanikē Vivliografia</italic>, Erdogan Merçil refers to the mechanisms used by the Greek junta regime to confiscate Muslim properties in western Thrace.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn55-0265691412448044">55</xref></sup> Tahsin Ünal discusses a series of Greek laws which impede western Thrace Muslims from buying land and other types of property.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn56-0265691412448044">56</xref></sup> Scholars such as Oran and Akgönül refer to how a possible re-allotment of land in western Thrace would not be to the benefit of its Muslim population because it would leave them with small infertile pieces of land.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn57-0265691412448044">57</xref></sup> Both scholars were responding to Greek colleagues who argued that land re-allotment in the Greek-Bulgarian border zone under military surveillance would put an end to the arbitrary occupation of public properties by individuals which had occurred as a result of the gradual relaxation of the strict land regulations in the area.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn58-0265691412448044">58</xref></sup></p>
<p>In an article published in the Greek newspaper <italic>Kathimerinē</italic> (Daily), Alexandrēs argues that the low educational level of western Thrace Muslims is an element which characterizes Turkish people, whether they live in Turkey or abroad.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn59-0265691412448044">59</xref></sup> In his view, Turks follow traditional ways of life: they are emotionally attached to Muslim religious institutions and the land as a means of economic production. Within this context, the majority of Muslim farmers in Thrace, who in the article are implicitly thought of as Turks, show limited interest in higher education and many of them remain farmers without any prospects of significant change in the future. This view is not supported by the findings of later works, which argue that by the end of the 1980s and the beginning of the 1990s an increasing number of Pomaks had left their villages for urban centres in the region, where they worked mainly as builders. At the same time a number of Muslims in the Komotēnē area were small business owners and merchants.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn60-0265691412448044">60</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="sec9-0265691412448044"><title>Press</title>
<p>The Muslim press constitutes an important historical source for the study of Greece’s Muslims. Research into articles and news with political, social and cultural content could shed light on unknown aspects of their life. Yet, despite this there have been few works on Greece’s Muslim press. This is due to the fact that many Greek academics, even those whose research interests lie in the fields of Ottoman and modern Turkish history, refuse to learn Turkish or Ottoman. In addition, many Greek academics have not been as interested in studying the social and cultural life of the minority as they were in studying its relations with Turkey and the Turkish establishment, and for this reason issues related to Greek–Turkish relations are their main interest. Extracts from the Muslim minority press during the period of the Greek junta, 1967–1974, which are included in publications of the <italic>Türk Kültürü</italic> academic journal, have been published in Greek by the Greek academic journal <italic>Valkanikē Vivliografia</italic> (Balkan Bibliography).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn61-0265691412448044">61</xref></sup> Iordanoglou refers to the press conflict between the anti-Kemalist conservatives (<italic>Palaiomousoulmanoi</italic>) and the reformist pro-Kemalists (<italic>Neoteristes</italic>), from the aftermath of the signing of the Lausanne Treaty to the present, and the gradual predominance of the pro-reformist group. Iordanoglou’s work also provides a series of articles from Greek newspapers in Xanthē, Komotēnē, Athens and Thessalonikē referring to the western Thrace Muslim minority.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn62-0265691412448044">62</xref></sup> Iordanoglou’s work appeared at a time when Greek academics and politicians were seeking to challenge the view that the Muslim minority of western Thrace could be homogenized as a minority group, as the Turkish political establishment liked to see it, and opposed the policy of Turkification which Greece promoted in the early years of the Cold War. Greek–Turkish relations were at a critical point – in 1987 the two countries reached the brink of war – and the politicization of the minority with the election of independent MPs to the Greek parliament in the general elections of 1989 and 1990 was intense. Orhonlu’s work, which is published in Greek in the <italic>Deltion Tourkikēs Vivliografias</italic>, refers to efforts made by Greeks, including the Greek press, to control the content of the Muslim press of western Thrace, which has been of political interest to Greek–Turkish relations since the mid-1950s, and this is the main reason for its translation into Greek.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn63-0265691412448044">63</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="sec10-0265691412448044"><title>Education</title>
<p>Asimakopoulou claims that the current educational regime of Greece’s Muslims reproduces social differences and intensifies their introversion and marginalization from the wider social environment in which they live.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn64-0265691412448044">64</xref></sup> Yet, despite this and although education has been one of the thorniest minority problems, most of the academic works on the subject provide a rather general picture of this issue and do not discuss specific issues of Muslim education. Statistical information regarding the number of Muslim minority schools in western Thrace and the number of students and teachers can be found in many works.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn65-0265691412448044">65</xref></sup> In his article, which has been translated into Greek, Erdogan discusses minority education from the mid-1930s to 1966 and argues that during those years the Greek authorities interfered by supporting the operation of minority religious schools, known as <italic>medresses</italic>, to the disadvantage of secular education, lest a Muslim intelligentsia be produced which could challenge state sovereignty in the region of western Thrace.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn66-0265691412448044">66</xref></sup> The fact that Erdogan argues that the Greek state interfered with education in western Thrace attracted the attention of Greek publishers, who translated his work into Greek.</p>
<p>Little is known about the teaching staff in the Muslim minority schools. Exceptions are the works of Panagiotidēs and Fragoudakē et al., which refer to the categories of teaching staff and the educational training they received from the Greek state.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn67-0265691412448044">67</xref></sup> Also, Stathi and Tressou refer to the functioning of the Special Educational Academy of Thessalonikē (<italic>Eidikē Paidagogikē Akadēmia Thessalonikēs</italic>), an educational institution which was founded by the Greek junta regime within Aristotle University of Thessalonikē in order to train teachers for the Muslim minority schools in Thrace.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn68-0265691412448044">68</xref></sup> The objective behind that political move was to prevent the employment of teachers from Turkey and thus reduce Ankara’s interference in minority educational affairs. Panagiotidēs’ and Fragoudakē’s works appeared in a period, the late 1990s, when the picture in Greek academia began to change, with young academics, most of them educated in US and West European universities, becoming genuinely interested in the political, social and economic life of the minority. However, their work is not totally detached from the political climate of Greek–Turkish relations at that time. In January 1996, the newly appointed Socialist government of Kōstas Simitēs took the country to the brink of war with Turkey over the territorial status of Imia (in Greek, or Kardak in Turkish), a set of two uninhabited islets in the Aegean Sea situated between the Greek island chain of the Dodecanese and the southwestern mainland coast of Turkey. Within this context a number of young academics showed an interest in studying the Muslim minority of western Thrace and assisting its better integration into Greek society. This would release it from being a hostage to Greek–Turkish competition.</p>
<p>Poulēs, Tsitselikēs and Baltsiotēs refer to the legal framework of post-1923 Muslim minority education in Greece.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn69-0265691412448044">69</xref></sup> As these scholars argue, this framework was mainly established between 1952 and 1997. Tsitselikēs’ work, in particular, touches on issues such as the foundation and functioning of Muslim minority schools in the region, their status in comparison to non-Muslim state schools, the appointment of their teaching staff and the management of their properties by the school authorities. He is quite critical of the policies which the Greek state followed on the issue. These and other similar works should be seen within the same context which influenced Frangudakē’s and Panagiotiēs’ work.</p>
<p>A number of academic studies refer to the clash between the anti-Kemalist <italic>Palaiomousoulmanoi</italic> (conservative Muslims) and the reformist <italic>Neoteristes</italic> (reformist Muslims) around minority education affairs, such as the teaching methods to be followed in minority schools. The clash was particularly fierce after 1928, with the introduction of educational reforms by the Kemalist regime in the Republic of Turkey.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn70-0265691412448044">70</xref></sup> The great appeal of Turkish culture to many Muslim teachers, along with the importing of school textbooks from Turkey, led to the gradual predominance of the reformist group in the clash over the education of the minority.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn71-0265691412448044">71</xref></sup> These works aim to show the influence of the modern Kemalist state on Muslim minority education in western Thrace, and in this way have reinforced the view of many young Greek academics of the post-Cold War period that nationalism has negatively affected the life of Muslims in western Thrace, and that therefore this should be disengaged from the nationalist policies of both Greece and Turkey.</p>
<p>Article 41 of the Lausanne Treaty provides for the members of the Muslim minority of Thrace to receive their elementary education in their mother tongue as well as in Greek.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn72-0265691412448044">72</xref></sup> For reasons which have been explained elsewhere in this paper the Greek authorities forced all Muslims in western Thrace to regard Turkish as their mother tongue and thus to receive their education in that language. The deterioration of Greek–Turkish relations from the end of the 1960s led the Greek authorities to review this position. An increasing number of academic works appeared which researched the Pomak and Roma languages. Dictionaries and grammars for the Pomak language were published, while academic interest was shown in the Muslim Roma as a distinct ethnic group with their own language.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn73-0265691412448044">73</xref></sup></p>
<p>Vakalios et al., Stathē, and others, explore the curriculum, the teaching methods and the materials used in the Muslim minority schools of western Thrace.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn74-0265691412448044">74</xref></sup> They all agree that the textbooks for the teaching of the Greek language best suit school students whose mother tongue is Greek and not the Muslim students of western Thrace, for whom Greek is a second language with little or no use at home or in their immediate environment. Sella-Mazē is among the few Greek scholars who have researched the Greek in use by the members of the western Thrace Muslim minority. Her research is mainly focused on Turkish-speaking Muslims.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn75-0265691412448044">75</xref></sup> She argues that the use of Greek by Turkish-speaking members of the minority depends on a number of factors, such as the environment in which they live and grow up, the working conditions of the teaching staff in the minority schools, the use of TV and the employment of the children in various agricultural activities. Sella-Mazē argues that the fact that the Turkish and Greek languages are quite different in terms of grammar, structure and vocabulary creates problems in the way that Greek is used as a second language.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn76-0265691412448044">76</xref></sup></p>
<p>Dragōna uses methodological tools from the fields of psychoanalysis and social psychology in order to analyse the reactions of the teachers to new and revisionary knowledge which they are supposed to have in order to accept the ethnically, culturally, religiously and linguistically different students of the region.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn77-0265691412448044">77</xref></sup> Dragōna’s findings are based on her research into the educational programme <italic>Ekpaideusē Mousoulmanopaidōn</italic> (Education of Muslim Children), which has been in operation in western Thrace since May 1997. The programme has been under the auspices of the Greek Ministry of Education and Religions and its aim is to promote a smooth integration of Muslim children into Greek society by improving their performance in Muslim schools as well as their command of the Greek language</p>

<sec id="sec11-0265691412448044" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>As elsewhere in the Balkans, since its establishment as an independent state, Greece has sought to justify its existence in the name of a national myth which rejected the Ottoman Empire as a non-Greek political entity which had placed Greeks under a long-time ‘yoke’, had interrupted the glorious moments of their historical past and deprived them of the benefits of cultural developments taking place in the ‘civilized’ world. The Ottoman Empire had condemned the Greeks to remain for a long time in cultural backwardness, which, since the time of their independence from Ottoman rule, they had sought to overcome, and to catch up with the cultural developments elsewhere in Europe – ‘Greece’s natural place’, as many modern Greeks have liked to call it due to the fact that modern European culture claims rights upon Greek antiquity, which they see as forming part of their cultural past.</p>
<p>The classification of Greece’s Ottoman heritage as non-Greek is mainly founded on the fact that the established religion in the Ottoman Empire was Islam, which has been viewed as an alien cultural element to modern Greek culture by the overwhelming majority of the country’s political and cultural elites since the foundation of Greece in the 1830s. All Greek constitutions have recognized Christian Orthodoxy as the established religion of the Greek state, while ‘Greekness’ has been defined in close relation to Orthodoxy, thus leaving little space for non-Orthodox people to be either seen or treated as Greeks.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn78-0265691412448044">78</xref></sup> Within this context, the Muslims of Greece have been viewed as second-class citizens by the Greek state and the majority of the Greek people and have been treated accordingly in both legal and practical terms. This is exemplified, among other things, by the 1923 Greek–Turkish obligatory population exchange, whereby Athens agreed to exchange most of the country’s Muslims for Orthodox people from the newly founded Republic of Turkey, who were regarded as Greek due to their religion.</p>
<p>The Greek academic elites have done little to change this view. The result is that the Muslims living in Greece have either been silenced or at best badly represented for most of Greece’s modern history. The history of Greece’s Muslims has to a great extent been distorted. We know little about the history of the Muslims who lived in the country prior to 1923, while of those who continued their lives in Greece after that year, the Muslims of western Thrace have monopolized academic interest. Until the beginning of the 1990s, and, to a lesser extent afterwards, this interest has been mainly expressed in close relation to the climate of Greek–Turkish relations. Publications have mainly followed periods of crisis in bilateral relations and their subjects of discussion have been approached and analysed within the narrow prism of Greek–Turkish relations.</p>
<p>This picture has started to change since the beginning of the 1990s with the publication of academic works often by younger scholars who have spent time undertaking academic research in US and West European universities. These scholars attempt either to emotionally detach their works from the contemporary political climate in Greek–Turkish relations, or, if taking part in it, try to do so in an academically dispassionate way and by using analytical tools which extend far beyond their personal experiences and desire to show that the Turkish territorial claims to western Thrace are misguided. This situation has also been helped by changing political circumstances in Greece, in the Balkan region and internationally, and by the activities of the NGOs which have been particularly active in the country since the end of the Cold War. However, there remains much to be done for a complete picture – a more objective story, to speak in the title’s terms – of the Muslims of Greece to be produced. There are fields and subjects which have been very little explored or left totally unexplored; and those which have been explored often lack a complete conceptual framework within which the reader can understand their analysis.</p>

This, among other things, defined the rights of Muslims in the occupied territories of Macedonia, Epirus and the Aegean islands, except Dodecanese, Gökçeada (in Greek Imvros) and Bozcaada (in Greek Tenedos), which Greece took from the Ottoman Empire during the Balkan wars of 1912–13. Finally, see the Treaty of Sèvres, by which Greece extended its territorial control over the regions of eastern Thrace and the district of Izmir (in Greek Smyrnē), and the 24 July 1923 Lausanne Treaty, which among other things determined the Greek–Turkish territorial borders after the Greek–Turkish war of 1919–1922, known also as the Anatolian war, and which also included clauses for the protection of the Muslim populations in areas controlled by Greece.</p></fn>

It is difficult to have a precise estimate of the numbers of western Thrace Muslims. This is regarded as a sensitive issue by the Greek authorities and there has been a lack of official data. The last time the Greek government published official data indicating the religious affiliation and mother tongue of the population of Greece was following the 1951 census, according to which Muslims constituted the largest religious minority in the country and were estimated to number 112,665 (or 1.4% of the entire population). They are divided into three categories, according to their descent: (a) Turkish origin (<italic>Tourkogeneis</italic>); (b) Slav-speaking (Pomaks); and (c) Roma (<italic>Tsigganoi, Athiganoi, Katsiveloi or Gyftoi</italic>). However, despite the mystification of the Greek state around this issue, there have occasionally been some approximate estimates of the number of Muslims living in western Thrace, including the one provided in this article. These figures are based on the very rarely broken secretiveness of some Greek officials on the issue.

However, it must be noted that, whilst the term ‘Turkish’ cannot be used to describe the members of the western Thrace Muslim minority as a group or any association and organization with reference to the minority, individual self-determination as ‘Turkish’, is, according to official statements, allowed.

<fn id="fn28-0265691412448044"><label>28</label><p>This was due to the fact that in the early years of the Cold War Bulgaria and not Turkey was seen as the country’s prime enemy. Greece and Bulgaria belonged to different and competing political and military camps: Bulgaria was a member of the communist block and a close ally of the Soviet Union, while Greece, together with Turkey, belonged to the Western camp, and both states became NATO members in 1952. Membership of NATO and the Western camp technically rendered Greece and Turkey allies, but aside from that, at the beginning of the Cold War Greek–Turkish relations were fairly good: the ethnic tensions in Cyprus which spoiled Greek–Turkish relations became a problem in later years and the Greek–Turkish treaty of friendship and non-aggression which the Greek Prime Minister, Eleftherios Venizelos, signed with the Turkish leader, Kemal Attatürk, in 1932 was still in force. Within this context, the Greek state authorities wanted to restrict any political, economic, cultural or other contacts between the Slavic speaking Muslims of western Thrace, known as Pomaks, and Bulgaria, and therefore thought it wiser to promote a policy of Turkification of the entire Muslim minority. Limiting any contacts of the Pomaks with the Bulgarian ‘motherland’ was thought to limit the threat of secessionist movements amongst the Pomaks that might be fostered by the Bulgarian state. At the same time, instilling a Turkish identity was thought to be a safer option, since at that time Greek–Turkish relations were amicable and could be improved even further through the policy of Turkification of the Pomaks. See Andreadēs, op. cit., 4; Christian Voss, ‘Language Ideology between Self-Identification and Ascription among the Slavic-Speakers in Greek Macedonia and Thrace’, in Klaus Steinke and Christian Voss (eds), <italic>The Pomaks in Greece and Bulgaria</italic> (Munich 2007), 177–92, 185. During this period the common religious background of the Pomaks with the other Muslim minority groups was overemphasized. They were encouraged to speak Turkish and to study in the minority schools whose curriculum provided only for the teaching of Turkish and Greek languages and the textbooks used for the Turkish language were printed in Turkey and imported and distributed to minority pupils following their approval by the Greek government. To a great extent, this policy continues to date. See Alexandrēs (Athens 1991), op. cit.</p></fn>
