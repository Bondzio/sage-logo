<p><italic>Objective</italic>. Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) promotes the regeneration of denervated nerves. The aim of this study was to evaluate the regeneration-facilitating effects of novel facial nerve decompression surgery using bFGF in a gelatin hydrogel in patients with severe Bell palsy.</p>
<p><italic>Study Design</italic>. Prospective clinical study.</p>
<p><italic>Setting</italic>. Tertiary referral center.</p>
<p><italic>Subjects and Methods</italic>. Twenty patients with Bell palsy after more than 2 weeks following the onset of severe paralysis were treated with the new procedure. The facial nerve was decompressed between tympanic and mastoid segments via the mastoid. A bFGF-impregnated biodegradable gelatin hydrogel was placed around the exposed nerve. Regeneration of the facial nerve was evaluated by the House-Brackmann (H-B) grading system. The outcomes were compared with the authors’ previous study, which reported outcomes of the patients who underwent conventional decompression surgery (n = 58) or conservative treatment (n = 43).</p>
<p><italic>Results</italic>. The complete recovery (H-B grade 1) rate of the novel surgery (75.0%) was significantly better than the rate of conventional surgery (44.8%) and conservative treatment (23.3%).

<p><italic>Conclusion</italic>. Advantages of this decompression surgery are low risk of complications and long effective period after onset of the paralysis. To the authors’ knowledge, this is the first clinical report of the efficacy of bFGF using a new drug delivery system in patients with severe Bell palsy.</p>

<body>
<p>Bell palsy is an idiopathic, peripheral, unilateral facial paralysis of sudden onset and is the most common cause of facial nerve paralysis. The natural course of this disease is generally favorable, and approximately 70% of patients recover completely without treatment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599811431661">1</xref></sup> The hypothetical pathogenesis of Bell palsy involves viral infection, such as reactivation of herpes simplex virus (HSV), with inflammatory change, secondary edema, and entrapment neuropathy in the narrow fallopian canal.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599811431661">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599811431661">3</xref></sup> Steroids and adjunctive antiviral agents are the treatment of choice.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599811431661">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0194599811431661">5</xref></sup> However, approximately 10% of patients do not respond to conservative treatment and experience profound denervation leading to severe sequelae such as synkinesis, contracture, and facial asymmetry.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0194599811431661">6</xref></sup> The treatment strategy for severe paralysis is acceleration of recovery by preventing further worsening of nerve degeneration in the early phase of the incident. Facial nerve decompression surgery is indicated in cases of Bell palsy suspected to have a poor prognosis,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0194599811431661">7</xref></sup> usually within 2 weeks of onset. Since Ballance and Duel<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0194599811431661">8</xref></sup> first reported decompression of the facial nerve at the distal mastoid segment in 1932, several treatment procedures have been proposed; however, randomized controlled trials providing high-quality evidence of the benefit of surgical intervention in Bell palsy are lacking.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0194599811431661">9</xref></sup> Currently, most patients are treated medically, and decompression surgery is rarely undertaken. Decompression more than 2 weeks after the onset of paralysis is particularly rare because the surgical procedure is unlikely to facilitate nerve regeneration.</p>
<p>Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) is known to promote nerve regeneration following denervation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0194599811431661">10</xref></sup> and is currently commercially available as a medication. Exogenous application of bFGF is not effective because the compound is short acting and must be applied constantly or intermittently to the lesion. To enhance and prolong the effect of bFGF, we developed a novel drug delivery system by embedding bFGF in a gelatin hydrogel that degrades slowly in the body.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0194599811431661">11</xref></sup> In an experimental study using guinea pigs, we found that bFGF-impregnated biodegradable gelatin hydrogel facilitated regeneration of the damaged facial nerve as a result of its sustained release.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0194599811431661">12</xref></sup> The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of facial nerve decompression using bFGF in a gelatin hydrogel (novel facial nerve decompression) in patients with severe Bell palsy by comparing their outcomes with those of patients who underwent surgical treatment without bFGF and patients who underwent medical treatment.</p>

<title>Patients and Protocol</title>
<p>Patients with Bell palsy were recruited from Ehime University Hospital between October 2006 and June 2010. The hospital institutional review board approved the trial design and treatment protocol. Bell palsy is an idiopathic, acute facial paralysis not caused by central nervous system disorders, otitis media, trauma, or Ramsay Hunt syndrome. Steroids have been shown to be effective in the treatment of Bell palsy, and most of the patients in our study had received steroids as a first-line treatment. The study included 20 patients who opted to have facial nerve decompression surgery and met the inclusion criteria. The inclusion criteria were (1) older than 16 years; (2) severe or complete facial paralysis corresponding to House-Brackmann (H-B) grade 5 or 6; (3) degree of denervation exceeding 95%, determined using electroneuronography (ENoG); (4) presenting between 2 weeks and 4 months after the onset of paralysis; (5) clinical follow-ups available for more than 12 months; (6) no accompanying systemic disease such as severe diabetes mellitus or neoplasms; and (7) informed consent obtained. We used the same criteria in a previous study that assessed the efficacy of conventional transmastoid decompression surgery in 58 patients compared with conservative treatment using steroids in 43 patients between April 1976 and March 1994.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0194599811431661">13</xref></sup> In the present study, we compared the outcomes of the novel facial nerve decompression, conventional facial nerve decompression, and the nonsurgical conservative treatment using steroids. All patients in the 3 groups were treated with steroids; prednisone 1 mg/kg per day was given within a week of onset and continued for 2 weeks. Patient characteristics in each treatment group are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0194599811431661"><bold>Table 1</bold></xref>. The H-B grading system was used to evaluate the severity of the facial paralysis; H-B grade 1 was regarded as complete recovery, and grade 1 or grade 2 with mild sequelae was defined as good recovery. All the patients were evaluated for the degree of paralysis after more than 1 year following the onset of paralysis.</p>

<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>The statistical analyses were performed using a Fisher exact test or χ<sup>2</sup> test. Fisher exact test was used only for the comparison between the time of decompression surgery after the onset of paralysis and treatment outcome.

<title>Surgical Procedure</title>
<p>The facial nerve was decompressed between the tympanic and mastoid segments via the transmastoid approach (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0194599811431661"><bold>Figure 1</bold></xref>). Following a mastoidectomy, a posterior hypotympanotomy was performed through a facial recess to obtain wide access to the tympanic segment. To prevent postoperative conductive hearing loss, all ossicles were left intact. The facial nerve was skeletonized from the tympanic segment to the mastoid segment by removing the bony wall of the fallopian canal using an electrical drill with diamond burrs (J. Morita MFG. Co., Kyoto, Japan). The thin remaining bony wall was carefully removed using a pick to prevent additional damage to the facial nerve. Half of the bony facial canal was thus uncapped, and then the nerve was decompressed from the tympanic segment to the stylomastoid foramen of the mastoid segment. The nerve sheath was not incised to avoid possible damage to the facial nerve. A bFGF-impregnated biodegradable gelatin hydrogel sheet was divided into 10 pieces, which were then placed around the exposed facial nerve.</p>

<title>Preparation of the bFGF-Impregnated Gelatin Hydrogel</title>
<p>A gelatin with an isoelectric point of 4.9 was obtained from bovine bone collagen using the alkaline treatment (Nitta Gelatin Co., Osaka, Japan). The gelatin was cross-linked with glutaraldehyde to make a hydrogel and was preserved in a freeze-dried condition until use in our laboratory. Many experimental studies conducted concerning safety of the hydrogel in the body showed that this material does not cause adverse effects when applied in the body.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0194599811431661">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0194599811431661">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0194599811431661">15</xref></sup> Human recombinant bFGF was developed and commercially available in Japan by approval as a wound-healing product called Fiblast Spray in 2001 (Kaken Pharmaceutical Co., Tokyo, Japan). The bFGF with an isoelectric point of 9.6 was applied to the gelatin hydrogel, and the solution was completely absorbed in 2 hours at room temperature. A gelatin hydrogel impregnated with 100 µg/100 µL of bFGF was placed on the exposed facial nerve. The degradation time of the hydrogel was 14 days<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0194599811431661">15</xref></sup>; thus, the bFGF was slowly released around the facial nerve.

<title>Results</title>
<p>The novel facial nerve decompression group consisted of 13 men and 7 women with a mean age of 45.9 years (range, 17-70 years). The conventional facial nerve decompression group consisted of 30 men and 28 women with a mean age of 43.9 years (range, 16-71 years). In the nonsurgery group, patients consisted of 21 men and 22 women with a mean age of 55.1 years (range, 16-84 years). The mean period from the onset of paralysis to surgery was 36.3 days (range, 15-99 days) in the novel surgery group and 38.8 days (range, 15-114 days) in the conventional surgery group. No significant differences were found in sex, age, or the severity of facial paralysis among the novel decompression surgery group (n = 20), conventional surgery group (n = 58), or conservative treatment group (n = 43; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0194599811431661"><bold>Table 1</bold></xref>). No complications such as postoperative bleeding, infection, or permanent hearing loss were observed following novel decompression surgery. Average decrease of air conduction hearing in the novel surgery group was 1.2 ± 3.8 dB for the pure-tone average at 0.5, 1, and 2 kHz.</p>
<p>The complete recovery (H-B grade 1) rates in the novel surgery, conventional surgery, and conservative treatment groups were 75.0%, 44.8%, and 23.3%, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0194599811431661"><bold>Figure 2</bold></xref>). All differences between groups were statistically significant.

<p>The outcomes of the novel and conventional decompression surgeries were further evaluated according to the time of surgery in relation to the onset of paralysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0194599811431661"><bold>Figure 4</bold></xref>). The best recovery rates were obtained in the patients who received surgery between 15 and 30 days after the onset of paralysis in both groups. The outcome of conventional surgery was poor when the operation was delayed, whereas the outcome of novel decompression surgery was superior to that of conventional surgery at all time intervals. Every patient in the novel decompression surgery group improved to H-B grade 2 or better even when undergone after 31 days from onset. Furthermore, 62.5% of the patients in the novel decompression surgery who were treated between 31 and 120 days after the onset of paralysis ultimately achieved H-B grade 1, compared with 32.4% of the patients in the conventional surgery group. Moreover, patients who received the novel decompression surgery 99 days after paralysis onset recovered completely by 6 months after the operation.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Conventional facial nerve decompression surgery for Bell palsy is effective only when it is performed during the acute phase of the paralysis, usually within 2 weeks after onset.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0194599811431661">16</xref></sup> The facial nerve may be swollen as the result of HSV reactivation and compressed in the narrow fallopian canal peripheral to the geniculate ganglion. At this point, further nerve degeneration may be prevented by decompressing the facial nerve. However, the efficacy of conventional decompression surgery from the mastoid segment to the geniculate ganglion via the transmastoid approach is not sufficient, even when the surgery is performed within 2 weeks of paralysis onset.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0194599811431661">17</xref></sup> At this stage, it is important to decompress the facial nerve at the labyrinth segment because significant edema occurs in the region of the meatal foramen, which is the proximal end of the labyrinth segment and the narrow part of the fallopian canal.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0194599811431661">18</xref></sup> In a prospective, multicenter trial of patients with Bell palsy, Gantz et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0194599811431661">19</xref></sup> reported that surgical decompression of the facial nerve through a middle cranial fossa exposure that included the tympanic segment, geniculate ganglion, labyrinth segment, and meatal foramen significantly improved the chances of good facial nerve function if the surgery was carried out within 2 weeks after onset of the severe paralysis. Middle fossa craniotomy has the risk of bleeding, infection, seizures, deafness, or leakage of cerebrospinal fluid, and this surgical approach cannot be routinely recommended to patients with acute Bell palsy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0194599811431661">20</xref></sup> Thus, the surgery is rarely performed during the acute phase of paralysis in most hospitals.</p>
<p>However, the efficacy of late decompression surgery is limited because it does not facilitate regeneration of a completely degenerated facial nerve. The results of our previous study showed that the surgical outcome was worse when the surgery was delayed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0194599811431661">13</xref></sup> As shown in the present study, the novel decompression surgery was effective even when carried out more than 1 month after the onset of paralysis. Local application of bFGF-impregnated hydrogel during facial nerve decompression has been shown to facilitate the recovery of nerve damage by promoting neuronal regrowth.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0194599811431661">12</xref></sup> With recent advances in molecular biology, bFGF is now recognized as a multifunctional growth factor that facilitates angiogenesis, dilates blood vessels,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0194599811431661">21</xref></sup> prevents neuronal cell death, and promotes neuronal sprouting.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0194599811431661">22</xref></sup> In the previous study using guinea pigs, we investigated the effect of exogenous bFGF by applying it to the lesion as either a one-shot application or as a continuous application using hydrogel.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0194599811431661">12</xref></sup> The results showed that the continuous application facilitated recovery of the facial paralysis, whereas the one-shot application did not. Gelatin hydrogel itself is biologically inactive and would not have contributed to the recovery process; thus, the recovery we observed was most likely the result of the sustained release of bFGF because the hydrogel degrades slowly in the body and acts as a drug delivery system.</p>
<p>The aim of this novel surgical procedure is not its degeneration-preventing effects but rather the regeneration-facilitating effects. The results of our study demonstrate that the segmental decompression, affecting only the mastoid and tympanic segments, and the application of sustained-release bFGF facilitated nerve regeneration. There are anatomically 2 narrow parts in the fallopian canal; one is at the meatal foramen in the labyrinth segment and the other at the stapedial portion in the tympanic segment. Bell palsy is thought to occur as a result of facial nerve swelling due to HSV reactivation, which starts at the geniculate ganglion and spreads gradually centrally and peripherally. As the entrapment neuropathy is believed to be more severe at the narrow parts, decompression of the facial canal at the periphery of the geniculate ganglion may be insufficient for the improvement of entrapment neuropathy in the long fallopian canal. However, as shown in the present study, the novel surgery proved effective in improving facial nerve function. This is probably because bFGF acts on the regenerating facial nerve that passed through the first narrow part in the labyrinth segment but was prevented to grow at the second narrow part in the tympanic segment. Although decompression of the 2 narrow parts would be ideal to get a better result, we decompressed only peripheral segments of the geniculate ganglion to minimize surgical intervention and to avoid possible complications. In our procedure, the nerve sheath, which is necessary for nerve regeneration,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0194599811431661">23</xref></sup> was not incised to avoid possible damage to the facial nerve. This minimally invasive surgery was completed in 2 hours using local anesthesia; thus, the patients did not experience complications such as postoperative bleeding, infection, or permanent hearing loss.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0194599811431661">24</xref></sup> The present therapeutic regimen may be applicable in the treatment of severe traumatic facial nerve paralysis and some cases of Ramsay Hunt syndrome. Although further clinical studies are necessary to fully evaluate the usefulness of this procedure, we believe that this novel surgery is advantageous for the treatment of the patients with Bell palsy after more than 2 weeks following the onset of severe paralysis.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This article describes the first reported study to show the efficacy of a bFGF-impregnated biodegradable hydrogel as a drug delivery system used in surgery for a paralyzed facial nerve. The advantages of this decompression surgery are the low risk of complications and efficacy in the cases of late decompression surgery. When decompression surgery of the facial nerve is needed, application of the bFGF hydrogel on the nerve might be a promising addition to improve the surgical outcomes.</p>
