<p>This section of <italic>Research on Social Work Practice</italic> is devoted to the practice of social work in Canada. Much like our country, the subject of Canadian social work is vast and wide-ranging. Diverse and multifaceted; yet, when I ask myself just what are the most important developments taking place in social work in this country right now, the very first thing that jumps to mind is the phenomenal growth and importance of research. This is a highly exciting trend. Evidence-based research is having a significant impact on social work practice in Canada. There now exists a vast amount of accessible and relevant research that can help inform social work practice and decision making by policy makers. This kind of research, which takes into account evidence of the effectiveness of practice, is an ongoing assessment of what has worked.</p>
<p>The distinctive feature of evidence-based research is the importance it places on collaboration. These days, as we increasingly develop and sustain global ties, the importance of collaboration has become widely recognized. But even still, the value of collaboration strikes me as particularly important to Canadians. In part, because of the sheer amount of space we inhabit. And it is equally important in a culturally diverse city like Toronto, where I live.</p>
<p>The four articles you will find here explore and illustrate the impact of evidence-based research in Canada today. Wes Shera and Katharine Dill describe efforts to promote evidence-informed practice in child welfare in Ontario. Traditionally practitioners have been separated from academic research. Today, practitioners are starting to use research to show them what is most effective. Child welfare practitioners and agencies are able to appraise research information and identify what needs to be done. Shera and Dill demonstrate the importance of using more inclusive evidence-informed research that embraces practitioner knowledge and client perspectives.</p>
<p>Ashley Towns and Karen Schwartz show how research can help us to understand the social worker’s role in the mental health field in Canada. Social workers, who have both a macro and micro perspective, can make a unique contribution. The authors point to the important role social workers play by incorporating the social context and how they help the treatment team goes beyond the purely biomedical perspective to include the larger issues of social inequities, while also helping individuals to address their particular situation.</p>
<p>Linda Leibenberg, Michael Ungar, and Fons Van de Vijver show that resilience, an individual’s capacity to overcome and do well in spite of significant adversity, needs to be understood as a multidimensional process. They emphasize that resilience is not a static state and point out that the interaction between the individual’s environment and assets must be taken into account. They describe the Child and Youth Resilience Measure (CYRM)-28, a 28-item measure of resilience developed for children and youth, which is helping to create a more inclusive understanding of resilience.</p>
<p>Rora Tam, Heather Coleman, and Kam-Wing Boey point to the need for understanding and defining professional suitability for social workers. Research is helping to assess professional suitability for social workers in a new light by identifying its underlying dimensions. The authors demonstrate the lack of well-defined suitability criteria, standards, policies, and practices. They show how research helps identify the underlying dimensions of professional suitability and recommend that more research be done. As we enter the second decade of the 21st century, I can proudly say that Canadian evidence-based research efforts like the ones described in these articles stand ready to make an important contribution to the practice of social work, both in Canada and around the world.</p>
