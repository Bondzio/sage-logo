<p>While the title of this slim volume suggests a stand-alone methods text, it instead presents a ‘psychosocial’ research study, comprising a step-by-step analysis of the narratives of a sexually abusive young man. Psychosocial research is part of a wider movement in Psychology, which adopts qualitative (instead of the dominant quantitative) methods and emerges out of debates in, and around, UK critical social psychology. Commonly this involves studying subjective lives and social worlds both together, after the ‘discursive turn’, drawing upon psychoanalytic or sociological traditions.</p>
<p>While the Introduction usefully describes this context and cutting-edge debates – covering paradigmatic, political, and ethical issues – the analysis itself is not informed by the aforementioned traditions. Of the different ‘flavours’ of narrative and discourse analysis, the one chosen by Emerson and Frosh is linguistic, with a dash of discursive psychology. They study ‘sense-making’ in ‘personal narratives’ by analysing linguistic structure and co-construction of interview interaction. Readers expecting a guide on how to conduct psychoanalytically informed research (or critical linguistics or critical discourse analysis) will be disappointed. But what they will find is a scholarly text comprising fine-grained analysis of portions of a single interview on a controversial social issue.</p>
<p>The book is a story about ‘Lance’ – a white, British, working-class ‘boy’ who has sexually abused other boys – as much as it is about narrative analysis. The authors are interested in the stories Lance ‘co-constructs’ with his interviewer and how he understands his abusive behaviours, masculinity and family relationships, and maintenance of the abuse. Working largely within a linguistic framework, the authors propose a strategic ‘psychosocial subject’ who chooses their narrative positioning (e.g. hegemonic and counter-hegemonic masculinities) and accounts, within a narrative constraint.</p>
<p>After the Introduction come four analytic chapters and a final chapter, which summarizes and justifies the style of narrative analysis conducted.</p>
<p>The detailed analysis explores the ‘macro’ and ‘micro’ dimensions of narratives. A structural approach informed by Labov’s and Gee’s linguistics is adopted. In Saussure’s words, the authors balance the analysis of ‘langue’ (grammatical structure) and ‘parole’ (speech). Attention is given to the ‘linguistic structures’ used (i.e. stanzas, strophes, parts), along with the ‘sentences’ (i.e. pitch glide, idea units, lines) delivered. For Gee, the psychological subject is a ‘grammatical’ subject, despite the fact that – as the authors acknowledge – people do not actually speak grammatically. The discursive psychological approach conversely assumes people perform actions with their words, rather than reproduce linguistic structures.</p>
<p>A risk of a structural linguistic analysis is that by imputing abstract structures into a text, the analyst may become distracted from the actions people perform through their words. Indeed this sometimes makes it difficult to identify what Lance is saying and doing. However, their detailed approach to transcription allows for a re-interpretation of some of the data, informed by a psychoanalytic discursive psychology.</p>
<p>Lance says that in some cases women are more ‘stubborn’ and in others they’re not. Whereas his mum and sister get to watch what they want on the ‘telly’, his dad has to ‘tape’ it and watch it later. But women are ‘a bit less stubborn’ about what they have for dinner. Usually Lance or his dad will be ‘asked more often’ by his mum what they want, rather than her ‘just going through and cooking something’.</p>
<p>The authors suggest that Lance is displaying his ambivalence towards hegemonic gendered social narratives and assumptions here (p. 150). But while women ‘usually get what they want’ according to Lance, it is accepted that the men in the family always get their dinners cooked for them. The concession makes Lance appear reasonable and not overly critical of his mum. But the accusation of ‘stubbornness’ distracts attention from the gendered power differential. The inequality of food preparation, in which Lance’s mum does all of the cooking, is taken for granted. His complaint might therefore be naturalizing patriarchy and performing an ideological, as well as repressive, function.</p>
<p>The structural linguistic analysis misses this interpretation, perhaps as a result of being more concerned with structure than action. But the analysis is nevertheless thought-provoking, and makes a distinctive contribution to psychosocial studies and qualitative research. The critical psychology of masculinity should interest advanced students of Psychology and Sociology. Critical criminologists should resonate with the anti- pathological understanding of ‘young offenders’. And it may help professional practitioners develop a complex understanding of their interactions with clients, especially in clinical and forensic settings.</p>
