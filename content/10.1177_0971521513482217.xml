<abstract>
<p>This article tries in a preliminary manner to establish links between sexual labour, the negotiations of everyday life and the reproduction of social relations. The context for this interrogation is the recent ban in 2005 on dancing in beer bars in the Indian city of Mumbai; the attempts by the state to legitimise its action amidst a range of national and international rhetoric on sexual labour, and the voices of women who were disenfranchised due to the state ban. Women’s interrogation of their role in sexual labour and their struggle for dignity and respect in the domain of work is discussed in the light of the negative discourse weighing against them, while also bringing in historical and contemporary accounts of other forms of ‘stigmatised’ labour. The attempt is to understand how notions of dignity and respectability are intertwined with shifts in gender, caste, class locations and the struggles of social movements. Significant in this discussion are various examples of how women choose to ‘move away’ in their constant search for livelihoods and survival. The article is an attempt to illuminate how an expanded notion of social reproduction could recognise labours of different kinds with the voices of those embodying these labours having a say in how justice and entitlements should devolve.</p>

<body>
<p>The entrenchment of the neo-liberal economic order with receding entitlements and justice for vast numbers of people who seek their own survival is a growing reality today. The Indian state, having embarked on structural adjustment policies over the last two decades, has relinquished, despite the rhetoric of safety nets, any attempt to provide security of livelihoods for significant sections of its citizens. The vast sections of marginalised groups who populate the ‘unorganised’ sector of labour eke out a living through whatever forms of livelihood they are able to access, depending on their potential to engage in these precarious labour markets.</p>
<p>This article attempts to reclaim a conceptual framework that places these negotiations in the everyday lives of people within an understanding of a larger dynamic. This dynamic presupposes a gendered world, where the labours that people seek to pursue in order to ensure survival are deeply imbricated in class, caste, race, ability, sexuality and other structural markers. These negotiations by people are also mediated by the state, civil society and social movements. One such instance is explored in this article: the ban by the government of Maharashtra in 2005 on women who danced in beer bars in the city of Mumbai and elsewhere in the state, and the responses by the union of the women dancers, some sections of the women’s movement(s), the media, the judiciary, and so on.</p>
<p>An attempt is made here to recover and expand the notion of social reproduction to capture not just how the many labours of women regenerate life within the household but also how the aspirations and labours of certain groups of people relate to attitudes and practices that offer or deny justice.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0971521513482217">1</xref></sup> While socialist feminists did social analysis using the concept of social reproduction in the 1960s and 1970s, struggling to ensure the recognition of women’s invisible labours that contributed to the enhancement of economic and social life, since that time the struggle to recognise women’s labours has spread to larger structures so that the concept needs overhauling today. And this overhauling is an exercise that is foregrounded in the terrain of articulation among social movements, specifically the women’s movements, in India.</p>
<p>In this article, sexual labour becomes the analytic to explore a contemporary feminist debate around women’s labour. The expansive frame of social reproduction is used to highlight the ‘web of connections that is too flexible, shifting, complex, and globally variable... in our concepts, theories, strategies, and alliances’ as Lisa Duggan (2009) puts it. The ban by the state on women dancing in beer bars mentioned earlier triggered this recent debate within Indian feminisms.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0971521513482217">2</xref></sup> The article attempts to see how achieving economic and sexual justice becomes a challenge in the context of the contemporary neo-liberal economic order.</p>
<p>Sexual labour sits on a continuum of labours that at one extreme is criminalised by the state and its legal apparatus, while at another extreme this labour is afforded a space and freedom that carries with it privileges of class, commodification and consumption. This is seen in the vulnerability of women from poor and marginalised communities who seek a way out of their disadvantage in contrast to an apparatus that gladly permits women from privileged groups to pursue careers in the glamour and entertainment industry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0971521513482217">Bhattacharjya, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0971521513482217">Sahni et al., 2008</xref>). But alongside this is the response of social movements and civil society that engage with this discourse. In the context of labour, this article attempts to address certain notions attached to labour that are embedded in caste, class and historical location, making it harder for particular groups to overcome the negative connotations and associations attached to their labour. Sexual labour then must struggle to straddle notions of dignity and self-respect, on the one hand, and respectability, on the other.</p>
<p>The first section of the article locates the state action within a range of national and international rhetoric on sexual labour. The second section foregrounds the voices of women who were disenfranchised due to the state ban. The third section places these voices and the struggle in the context of the negative discourse weighing against them in tandem with historical and contemporary accounts of other forms of ‘stigmatised’ labours. The attempt is to understand how notions of dignity and respectability are intertwined with shifts in gender, caste, class locations and the struggles of social movements. In conclusion, what is being illuminated is how an expanded notion of social reproduction could recognise labours of different kinds with the voices of those embodying these labours having some say in how justice and entitlements should devolve. This is not a matter that has attained resolution and hence the struggle continues to seek space through dialogue.</p>

<title>Between the Lines in the Rhetoric of Trafficking</title>
<p>The action of the state of Maharashtra in banning women dancing in dance bars has to be seen in the context of the discourse around the trafficking of women across the globe and especially in the global south. This also overlaps with the international debate on prostitution which has been deeply influencing the Indian debates and positions as well. Further, since the larger debate on trafficking in people, which is not just about women, refers to the movement of people in general and to the legal restrictions, the problems of national and regional borders and so forth, this has important implications for people who are migrating across diverse locations. These intersecting debates throw light on the dynamics of state actions and people’s volition in their daily lives.</p>
<p>The foregrounding of these overlaps with respect to the terms and frameworks of trafficking, prostitution and migration, helps to enlarge the space to explain and understand how these operate at the level of the individual life choices made by people (in this case women), and how these are framed by the intentions and actions of the state. The discourse on trafficking refers in general to the use of coercion and deceit in order to exploit the labour of an individual; however, internationally, trafficking has been increasingly reduced to a focus on women, and that too on women ‘trafficked for sex’. This reduction has fed into an abolitionist viewpoint whose argument is that prostitution is equivalent to violence against women. This discourse has not just paralleled but also clouded current discussions on migration, especially in Asia, Eastern Europe, Latin America and Africa, to the extent that all migrant workers are deemed to be trafficked for sex work and could not have been engaged in any other form of paid work. One of the fall-outs of these conflations is that actual estimates of trafficking are hard to come by (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0971521513482217">Shah, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>A recent review of literature on sex trafficking and sex work has revealed the persistence of polarised positions: the equation of trafficking with prostitution seen as violence against women reflecting the neo-abolitionist position at one end, and groups arguing for the express distinction and de-linking of trafficking from sex work at the other end (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0971521513482217">George et al., 2010</xref>). These polarised positions in fact render invisible the actual situations in which people, including women, live and make decisions about their lives. They further fix women who make choices within rigid categories such as victimhood, which renders them incapable of making any decisions with respect to their lives.</p>
<p>Organisations working for the rights of women in sex work and prostitution are emphatic that it is only through a political struggle to claim their human rights as workers that trafficking can be most effectively tackled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0971521513482217">George et al., 2010</xref>). In fact, this flips the discourse and turns the light onto what it is that pushes women into trafficking in the first place. Admitting to the lack of literature in India in terms of primary data and micro-level studies on the subject, some studies attempt to map the circumstances, and the vulnerabilities that form the backdrop for trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0971521513482217">Vindhya and Dev, 2011</xref>). The need to escape poverty by seeking out alternative economic opportunities for work places women in danger of trafficking. However, the situation of poverty is complicated by numerous other gendered discriminations, such as, child marriage, sexual exploitation within families, domestic violence, desertion and abandonment by husbands, denial of educational opportunities and customary family practices, among others. This web of economic deprivation and a culture of vulnerability make women migrate for their livelihood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0971521513482217">Sen and Nair, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0971521513482217">Vindhya and Dev, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Thus, while several factors induce women to migrate, it is the prospect of jobs, the imagination of a better life and a way out of their present deprivation that serve as factors pulling them out of their situations of despair in their state of vulnerability. These were the factors that influenced the women who worked in the dance bars of Mumbai. Nearly 80 per cent of the women working in bars in 2005 at the time of the ban by the state of Maharashtra were from outside the state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0971521513482217">RCWS and FAOW, 2006</xref>). A miniscule 1 per cent were from outside the country, putting paid to the state’s claim that foreigners were entering the country and posing a security threat. These assertions of the state have to be probed further within an international scenario of security and mobility.</p>
<p>The United States of America’s State Department’s Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons publishes an annual Trafficking in Persons Report which grades countries within a three-tier system according to the prosecutions to stop trafficking, which in turn is linked to non-humanitarian aid. In 2004, India was placed on the Tier 2 Watch List for its failure to show legal action in response to claims of the huge trafficking problem evident in Mumbai and Calcutta (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0971521513482217">Shah, 2006</xref>, pp. 271–272). The Trafficking in Persons Report of 2005 states that India was placed on the Tier 2 Watch List for the second consecutive year for its inability to show improved efforts to address such trafficking. It is in this context that we have to critically note the acknowledgement of an order in March 2005 by the Maharashtra state government, which especially mentioned the Home Minister closing down dance bars to combat an emerging new trend of trafficking perceived to be more sophisticated and hidden (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0971521513482217">RCWS and FAOW, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0971521513482217">US State Department, 2005</xref>). Thus, the state action against the dance bars which deprived lakhs of women of their livelihood, a majority of whom were internal migrants working there since many years, was induced more out of international, especially US, policies.</p>

<title>Voices of Women through their Everyday Existence</title>
<p>At the time of the ban enforced by the Maharashtra government, the only body representing the women in the dance bars, the Bharatiya Bar Girls Union, approached several women’s rights and human rights groups for help in seeking a way out of the impasse. One of the strategies was to impress upon public opinion the loss of livelihoods that lakhs of women experienced by holding rallies, as other marginalised working classes and peasants are wont to do (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0971521513482217">Agnes, 2005</xref>). Additionally, legal strategies were sought to be pursued to take on the state government’s ban. Women’s groups, in exposing the state’s motive in enforcing the ban, also brought to light the background and working conditions of the women working in the dance bars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0971521513482217">RCWS and FAOW, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Even as the state and international sources claimed that the dance bars in Mumbai were points of sex trafficking and were spaces where the moral corruption of youth took place, the women’s conditions of work and lives provided another glimpse into the everyday lives of women who tried to eke out a livelihood in an unstable labour market. About 76 per cent of the women came directly into the profession of dancing in the bars by migrating to the city through networks seeking opportunities. Nearly a quarter of the women moved into the bars after having worked as domestic workers, rag pickers and small time factory workers or doing piece work, working in sales jobs and so on (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0971521513482217">RCWS and FAOW, 2006</xref>). The precariousness and devalued nature of women’s work in the informal sector induces women to choose work that ensures high wages within the vulnerable and risky sphere in which the bars operate.</p>
<p>Eighty-three per cent of the women dancers came in from other states, indicative of the pull factor evident even now, illustrative of the generic character of Mumbai as a migratory haven for livelihood and employment. It is now part of commonsense that it is this characteristic that is threatened by the right-wing backlash unleashed time and again against migrants to the city by chauvinistic political outfits. A significant proportion (42 per cent) of the women belonged to communities where the lack of educational or livelihood opportunities had meant that women migrated to cities by eschewing caste-based occupations and relocating themselves in the absence of state or family support to acquire any other skill or vocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0971521513482217">Agrawal, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0971521513482217">RCWS and FAOW, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>One of the arguments put forth by those feminists who supported the ban on the women dancing in the bars in Mumbai was that it curbed and put an end to the sexual exploitation of women engendered by bar owners. Sexual exploitation is an extremely powerful trope that has divided not just feminists but large sections of society, so much so that those striving to fight for their rights to life and livelihood find it an uphill battle. In fact, it is this discourse that has made women’s lives vulnerable and put them into the trap of further sexual vulnerability. However, evidence from the lives and the working conditions of the women dancers prove that women try to shift the coordinates of such sexual access—as in the case of the Bedia women who migrated to the dance bars of Mumbai and were able to change the location of their work and free themselves from the direct control of their sexual labour by their families. In Mumbai it was possible to ensure greater individual control over conditions of work, and to widen the network of people who supported their work. The bar dancers who came from these communities found themselves in the company of other women who had worked before in a range of precarious occupations in the informal economy. Thus, dancing in bars was just one more type of work among a variety of labours in the informal economy. Just as other workers in the entertainment industry, their work was enhanced by a supportive network of people in the city, such as, taxi-drivers, garment makers, domestic helpers as well as bar owners, who provided the women some protection within the bars where they could work without harassment from the clients or the police. Most of all, they were able to turn the male gaze within a patriarchal society to their advantage as do women within the film, glamour and entertainment industry by adding this as value to their labour, thereby attempting to shift the coordinates of sexual access within the space of the dance bar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0971521513482217">Agrawal, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0971521513482217">FAOW, 2010</xref>, pp. 53–54).</p>
<p>Running parallel to the discourse of sexual exploitation is the practice of sexual regulation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0971521513482217">3</xref></sup> While sexual exploitation points to women’s vulnerability related to violence and coercion, sexual regulation, on the other hand, refers to control of women’s sexuality and the reproduction of caste through such regulation. Contemporary caste critique of female seclusion and control of female sexuality is limited to the analysis of control exercised on upper caste women. Lower caste women already have a public presence since their labour is necessary for social reproduction within feudal and patriarchal relations of production. But her stigmatised public presence on account of her caste status leads to the devaluation of her labour. Thus, women from lower castes have been trapped within the double bind of the devaluation of their labour along with sexual vulnerability.</p>
<p>Some schools of reformers in the early 20th century, by choosing marriage in the form of Satyashodhak marriages in Maharashtra or Self-respect marriages in Tamil Nadu, among others, challenged the social reproduction of caste, religious subjugation of communities and the sexual regulation of women in order to weaken Brahmanical power. Dalit critique shows that methods such as the Satyashodhak <italic>jalsa</italic> and the Satyashodhak marriage, among numerous other social practices, were challenges to the social reproduction of caste through the sexual regulation of women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0971521513482217">Rao, 2009</xref>, pp. 50–54). Even as male reformers led the struggles of untouchable communities for access to public places, documentation now exists of inspired articulations by women in these struggles both alongside their male comrades as well as in separate struggles representing their own interests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0971521513482217">Pawar and Moon, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0971521513482217">Rege, 2006</xref>). An outstanding example of Dalit women’s activism has been the central role played by women in the Ambedkarite movement. Women began autonomous articulations claiming the public sphere through organisations, conferences, resolutions and programmes of representation and struggle. It is in the Ambedkarite women’s public assertions that we see Dalit women’s insistence on their right to represent their own interests. For instance, significant among these autonomous articulations are the choices that women make, where following Ambedkar, they exercise the right to exit from their rigid caste ordained positions, to maintain a principled distance from those features, such as, the manner of clothing or wearing of certain jewellery that marked their distinct caste status within the gendered structure of caste, while also signifying their resistance to it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0971521513482217">Pawar and Moon, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0971521513482217">Rege, 2006</xref>). Both then and later, Dalit feminists have had numerous occasions to respond to complex situations. These articulations have contributed to the moment of maturity that Indian feminism finds itself in today.</p>
<p>The dance bar debate, reflecting one such complex situation, encompassing issues of both exploitation and regulation, has thrown up several voices, amongst whom the bar dancers’ voices needed to forge a space as yet another autonomous stream amidst the clamour of hegemonic voices. This search and struggle begins with seeking alliances with those willing to support them. It is also the case that the voices of women within sex work/prostitution have had to struggle for a considerable period of time before being able to assert their space within women’s movements. These efforts have been made by organisations of sex workers as well as those working with sex workers and a few feminist groups. This resulted in the participation of sex workers/women in prostitution for the first time in a women’s movements conference, at the 2006 conference of the autonomous women’s movements where a sub-theme session was organised to address issues related to women in prostitution/sex work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0971521513482217">FAOW, 2006</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section3-0971521513482217">
<title>Diverse Significations in the Realm of Caste, Labour and ‘Moving Away’</title>
<p>Women try to forge different meanings for labour associated with caste. For instance, the traditional midwife or <italic>dai</italic> is perceived differently by those who receive her services and by herself, while performing caste-based labour. The midwife has the exclusive right to cut the cord of the baby she has delivered, a potent act but seen as polluting by those who employ her for these services. But the <italic>dai</italic> maintains that she is dealing with the ‘dirt’ of childbirth which is not seen as polluting, thus distancing herself from the pollution of childbirth. She is able to distance herself from the stigma of childbirth in signifying it as dirt, therefore distinct from the caste-assigned view of childbirth as pollution which she refuses to attach to herself, focusing instead on the payment and other transactions that take place between herself and those who benefit from it. Monetary and other rewards provide her with a livelihood or at the least serve to free her from complete dependence on male kin, while also keeping notions of pollution in an ambiguous realm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0971521513482217">Pinto, 2006</xref>). In the different context of manual scavenging, women perform the most degrading and filthiest of tasks of carrying human excreta for disposal in semi-urban settlements and towns, within the division of labour to which some of the lowest of Dalit castes are condemned. Manual scavenging represents the worst expression of the ideology of pollution and untouchability, evident in the dehumanising conditions of work in this manual labour. Although it is women who participate in large numbers in campaigns, such as, the Safai Karamchari Andolan, to eradicate the pollution and stigma of manual scavenging, they also hope that within the division of sanitary labour women do not have to continue to attend to the most degrading aspects of the occupation. Sexual division of labour within manual scavenging makes women the most vulnerable, who hope that their daughters can escape the trap into which they themselves have been thrust. Within urban housing and habitation, manual scavenging persists due to the apathy and indifference of middle classes who turn a blind eye to eradication of this lowliest of caste-based labours, as long as there are people who continue to perform the cleaning of filth. Like the <italic>dai</italic> discussed earlier, it is an occupation that stands far removed from the modernisation and the technological development that it deserves, but which, on account of caste and class, had condemned sizable sections of people to such degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0971521513482217">Ramaswamy, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>In a similar vein, women performing different kinds of sexual labour, be it the devadasis of the early 20th century or Bedia women later, were/are able to assert a different existence and voice, however marginal. Muvalur Ramaamirthammal’s novel <italic>Dasigal Mosavalai</italic> foregrounds the multiple voices of the devadasis, some ‘reformed’, others seeking to reform, while several others continued within the devadasi system, wishing to retain spaces as artists and performers rather than as mere prostitutes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0971521513482217">Kannabiran and Kannabiran, 2003</xref>). The novel reflects the context in which the devadasi abolition debates were taking place between 1927 and 1930 reflecting the sharp polarisation between the Brahmin orthodox and non-Brahmin reformist positions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0971521513482217">Anandhi, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0971521513482217">Geetha and Rajadurai, 1998</xref>). The novel itself reflects the nuanced positions within the non-Brahmin Self Respecters. Noteworthy among these were the devadasis’ voices: significant among them were those who asserted that the abolition of the devadasi system would lead to tremendous loss of property and financial autonomy and who therefore sought to separate prostitution from the performance of religious services in the temples. For instance, Bangalore Nagarathnammal and Doraikannammal participated in the meeting in Georgetown, Chennai in 1927, where the issue of equating devadasi practice to prostitution was debated. The gathering passed resolutions ‘condemning the concerted attempts among some sections to discredit a group of women who lived their lives according to a widely respected religious tradition’. The women left no stone unturned to assert that doing away with the dedication ceremony would not end prostitution, and that reform was supported by men of their own caste to dispossess devadasis of their right to property and funeral honours. For these women, questions of chastity or sexual morality were not the issues at stake, rather the issue was the security of their rights tied to their identity as devadasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0971521513482217">Kannabiran and Kannabiran, 2003</xref>, pp. 30–31).</p>
<p>Bedia women breaking out of family patriarchy and migrating to cities altered not only their economic circumstances but also acquired the right to negotiate at their workplace, and make choices about their future. Prostitution as part of the family economy in the village was as casual an occupation as any other in the rural informal sector and males in the family lived off the women as their employment was only seasonal and irregular. Migration offered women opportunities in the bars and other options for a regular clientele which enabled them to remit earnings more or less regularly to their families. Higher earnings also gave the women bargaining power so that they could choose when and how much they would work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0971521513482217">Agrawal, 2008</xref>). It is through such distancing and several other strategies associated with migration that they attempt to shrug off some of the stigma associated with their work, but says Agrawal, ‘a comparable effort in trying to preserve or regain ‘respectability’ through giving up engagement in prostitution is unlikely to bear either economic or social fruits’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0971521513482217">Agrawal, 2008</xref>, p. 134). Women therefore try to negotiate stigma by negotiations around the stigmatised occupation.</p>
<p>In all these cases, while women were seeking alternatives to the caste-based occupation, they were also carving out new spaces—away from disrepute and stigma—while also retaining and illustrating their capacity for autonomous economic agency. Given the extremely fragile economic configurations within which they were able to operate, they offered resistance to the social reproduction of a particular type of (sexual) labour, and the social status associated with it.</p>
<p>I can now revert to the initial discussion flagged in relation to the discourse around trafficking, migration and movement of people out of their existing circumstances. In making meaning of their labours, as discussed earlier, women are doing multiple things: distancing stigma, establishing autonomy, reclaiming and asserting economic claims, engaging thereby with the structures of caste, class and patriarchy, making a break with these structures of oppression. In a way these are also attempts to democratise these occupational categories, as women push their way out into the realm of the modern, be it the <italic>dai</italic>, the manual scavenger or the Bedia woman and the devadasi. Rather than depend on the efforts of social movements, these women, whose occupations were caste and community based, sought to liberate themselves through their own agency with some degree of success.</p>
<p>A similar break is being made by women by leaving, ‘moving away’ from their homes and workplaces. A recent research study conducted by the Tarabai Shinde Women’s Studies Centre, Babasaheb Ambedkar Marathwada University, Aurangabad<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0971521513482217">4</xref></sup> at an industrial estate in Walunj near Aurangabad, was initiated following numerous newspaper reports of married women running away from their homes; they were dubbed as women of loose morals who were letting down their community. The study showed that the industrial estate set up in the 1980s had spawned, in an indiscriminate manner, multiple residential settlements. Among the migrant communities were: middle class residents working in the industrial estate, migrants working as construction workers in the unorganised sector, and other nomadic and Dalit communities, the poorest of the poor. The burden of adjustment and ensuring social reproduction in all three housing areas falls disproportionately on the women, who along with their domestic responsibilities also do informal work. Unplanned development by the state and changes in the landscape of industrial production create communities lacking social stability. Development is not reflected in the quality of life of the people who contribute to it. The burden of upkeep of moral values during a time of social flux then falls on women. In many cases, women choose to leave their existing circumstances and ‘run away’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0971521513482217">Sonalkar and Thosar, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>In the discussion of a specifically South Asian attempt at theorising exploitation as the need of the hour, caste has to be added to the structure of class, signifying the specificity of our context. Moreover, factors like sexuality and gender highlight the actual extraction of surplus that the most vulnerable and marginal working classes are subject to.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0971521513482217">5</xref></sup> Taking off from this point, I suggest that women who choose to ‘move away’ are making a break in this cycle of exploitation and surplus extraction, and are in fact creating a significant rupture in the social reproduction of class, caste and gender exploitation, albeit very marginal. History and literature are rife with examples of similar radical breaks made by women leaving home and family. Women recruited as indentured labour in the 19th century to the colonial province of Natal in South Africa or the colonial tea plantations of Assam in north-east India were often single women, despite the demand for women attached to families as labour in the plantations. Similarly, women migrated to the cities to seek work in mills and coalfields.</p>
<p>In the recruitment of indentured labour to Natal, women were able to secure for themselves both economic and emotional resources despite the patriarchal collusion between the colonialists and Indian men. The position of women was especially important in the distinctions that the recruiters wanted made between indentured labour and slavery; women would participate in both their productive and reproductive capacities in the colonies. However, most of the women recruited were single women from the most marginal castes recruited at Calcutta and Madras between 1860 and 1907, who were escaping precarious living situations created by famine or familial persecution. Within the colonies their resistance continued despite the arduous labour, in their desertion of abusive men or the withholding of labour from exploitative employers. Indenture ironically provided these women with the space for the rupture of the patriarchal family, where their traditional roles were reconfigured, with the seeking of divorces, release sought from bigamy, desertion or abuse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0971521513482217">Sheik, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Closer to home women migrated in large numbers to mills, mines and plantations in the colonial economy. Although a great deal of family migration took place in the 19th century in north India, solitary women migrants also came to signify the migrant to the city, typifying the female industrial worker. These women were often escaping impoverishment due to desertion, widowhood and oppressive families, to form new living arrangements on their own or with men in the cities. The working class neighbourhoods that these women resided in often became objects of elite contempt with the collapse of caste and gender hierarchies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0971521513482217">Sen, 2004</xref>). Thus, women’s agency and negotiating abilities engineered by and also engendering a social flux, often came to be looked down upon. With respect to the mines and plantations overseas and in India, single, married and widowed women travelled often without the consent of the men who controlled them. In the case of recruitment to the tea plantations, there were long-drawn-out disputes among authorities and recruiters over whether married women migrated voluntarily, or whether it was elopement, or enticement that led to their migration. It is evident that despite the possibilities opening up under the free recruitment system for single, uprooted and rejected women, the anxieties of the colonial state of the breakdown of the ideal family prevailed, enhancing controls over women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0971521513482217">Sen, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0971521513482217">Varma, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>As an ultimate instance of women’s movement away from their circumstances and of making meaning in a new space, I refer to the novels of Tamizhselvi, Kanmani Gunasekaran and Perumal Murugan, who detail the worlds of female labour, and of the Dalit labouring women’s world in particular. These are women who work to survive in a world of harsh labour with dignity, forage for survival in fields, grass stretches and salt pans. Women’s labour is described meticulously in settings where domesticity, childbirth and hard physical labour in the field are equally demanding. The novels also sketch in matter-of-fact detail, the unconventional choices women make, walking out of embattled conjugality, seeking new lives; the novels speak of the journeys that women undertake leaving their rural life as they go towards the town. The textile town is able to translate the woman’s labour into work of value, something that the village was unable to do. The town, by foregrounding her labour, enables her to live a life of far greater autonomy than she ever could have had in the village (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0971521513482217">Geetha, 2010</xref>). Women walk away from a male world rejecting it even as they forge some female comradeship in workplaces at their new destination. The novels imagine women’s lives where the ‘double bind of compulsory conjugality and choiceless labour may at times get unhinged, so that the freeing of the one bond creates the conditions for the slackening of the other’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0971521513482217">Geetha, 2010</xref>, p. 41).</p>
<p>These glimpses only serve to corroborate what women in present-day rural society experience when they choose to move out and away. It is hoped that these and other such empathetic narratives of women’s efforts to make choices to better their lives will underline the struggles of women who migrate. Running parallel to the discourses on trafficking and/or migration, such narratives will hopefully serve to frame these actions as drastic ruptures in the reproduction of existing labour, caste and gender relations.</p>
