<abstract>
<p>The authors propose that individuals transitioning to a novel environment will prefer upward comparisons, particularly those made with individuals who have experienced a similar transition. Such comparisons help to reduce uncertainty and demonstrate that future success is possible. Study 1 found that individuals facing transitions to unfamiliar situations seek upward comparisons as a result of their uncertainty. Study 2 demonstrated that individuals who perceive themselves to be making a significant life transition are especially motivated by upward comparisons. Study 3 provided evidence that upward comparisons are especially inspiring to individuals making a transition to a novel cultural environment. Study 4 provided experimental evidence that individuals in a novel cultural environment are particularly inspired by upward comparisons with other newcomers. These studies suggest that upward comparisons with individuals who have experienced a similar transition enhance individuals’ sense of control over future outcomes and play a key role during adjustment to novel environments.</p>

<p>A variety of past studies indicate that individuals prefer to compare themselves with others who are doing worse rather than better than themselves (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0146167212447234">Locke &amp; Nekich, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0146167212447234">Wheeler &amp; Miyake, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0146167212447234">Wood, Taylor, &amp; Lichtman, 1985</xref>). Finding out that one has outperformed another person is typically more gratifying and reassuring than finding out that one has been outperformed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0146167212447234">Wills, 1981</xref>). Nevertheless, under some conditions, individuals may actually prefer upward comparisons to downward comparisons. For example, people who are seeking a role model may compare their own abilities with those of a superior other to gain information on how to improve their own circumstances in the future. Although studies indicate that such positive outcomes from upward comparisons are possible (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0146167212447234">Lockwood &amp; Kunda, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0146167212447234">Lockwood, Wong, McShane, &amp; Dolderman, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0146167212447234">Taylor &amp; Lobel, 1989</xref>), research to date has not clearly established the circumstances under which individuals might choose the long-term self-improvement benefits of upward comparisons over the short-term gratification arising from downward comparisons. We propose that individuals may be especially inclined to make upward comparisons when they are dealing with unfamiliar situations. Under such conditions, a superior other offers information on how to reduce present uncertainty, take charge of one’s own life trajectory, and achieve future success. Individuals may therefore be willing to forgo the pleasure of a downward comparison in favor of a potentially stressful but more useful upward comparison.</p>
<p>In the present studies, we examined this possibility directly, focusing on comparisons made by individuals facing life transitions to unfamiliar environments. Although life transitions can provide people with opportunities for positive life change, as when individuals take on a new job or move to a new country, individuals may also face significant challenges in adapting to their new environment. Past research suggests that such challenges might result in an increased interest in comparisons with worse-off others: When individuals feel threatened, they typically prefer the reassurance of downward comparisons (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0146167212447234">Wheeler &amp; Miyake, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0146167212447234">Wills, 1981</xref>). However, although downward comparisons may offer some solace to those experiencing uncertainty, we nevertheless argue that upward comparisons confer special benefits to individuals during life transitions. Specifically, we propose that the self-improvement function of upward social comparisons is especially important for individuals in an unfamiliar environment. For example, individuals struggling to adjust to novel surroundings might seek inspiration in the example of a more established person who has successfully overcome similar adjustment difficulties. In the face of ongoing challenges, this example might encourage people to believe that they, too, can build stronger support networks, develop new skills, and maintain motivation to achieve success. Thus, for individuals experiencing a life transition, we expected a social comparison pattern characterized by a willingness to forgo the short-term self-evaluative gains of downward comparisons, to obtain the long-term inspirational gains offered by upward comparisons. Indeed, we expected that individuals would benefit from the inspiration provided by upward comparisons even when such comparisons posed a self-evaluative threat. This is the first research to examine the possibility that unfamiliar surroundings may activate this specific pattern of social comparison.</p>
<p>Although we are unaware of any studies that have directly examined the role of social comparison during the transition to a novel environment, there is some evidence that comparisons can help facilitate adjustment to significant life changes, such as those associated with aging or deteriorating health. For example, elderly adults may use comparisons with worse-off others to feel better about their own circumstances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0146167212447234">Frieswijk, Buunk, Steverink, &amp; Slaets, 2004</xref>). Similarly, studies in health-related domains (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0146167212447234">Bogart &amp; Helgeson, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0146167212447234">Helgeson &amp; Taylor, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0146167212447234">Stanton, Danoff-Burg, Cameron, Snider, &amp; Kirk, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0146167212447234">Wood et al., 1985</xref>) suggest that individuals engage in social comparisons that make them feel better about themselves and their situations, typically making downward comparisons to reassure themselves that their own circumstances are not so bad.</p>
<p>Unlike many elderly individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0146167212447234">Heckhausen, Dixon, &amp; Baltes, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0146167212447234">Heckhausen &amp; Krueger, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0146167212447234">Ryff, 1991</xref>) and individuals experiencing major health traumas, however, individuals transitioning to unfamiliar environments are often likely to expect significant improvement in their circumstances over time. For example, new college students may face challenges associated with their new academic and social environments, but may prefer to make comparisons with students who have made a successful transition so that they themselves can learn how to achieve success. Similarly, immigrants to a new culture, who have often sacrificed a great deal to begin their lives within the new society, may be willing to forgo self-enhancement to maximize their chances of success within the new culture. By engaging in upward comparisons, individuals transitioning to a new environment can effectively harness their own motivation to achieve desirable outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0146167212447234">Lockwood, Sadler, Fyman, &amp; Tuck, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>We have argued that upward comparisons will be especially inspiring for individuals who are facing unfamiliar situations. In addition, we argue that the most useful targets for comparison are those individuals who have gone through a similar experience. For individuals in a time of transition, an exemplar who has made a successful adjustment may enhance their perceived control over their own transition, providing evidence that they can adopt activities to improve their own adaptation to the new environment. This enhanced perception of control over skills required for transition may effectively boost motivation to improve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0146167212447234">Major, Testa, &amp; Bylsma, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0146167212447234">Testa and Major, 1990</xref>). Thus, we argue that the benefits of upward comparisons, and in particular comparisons with others who have gone through a similar transition, may result in part from individuals’ enhanced perceptions that they can control their own future outcomes. That is, they are not necessarily seeking reassurance through affiliation with others going through the same difficult process (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0146167212447234">Gump &amp; Kulik, 1997</xref>) but rather are seeking to draw inspiration from another individual, someone whom they may never actually meet, who has already gone through this process successfully, and who highlights the possibility that future success is indeed possible.</p>
<p>In sum, the present studies are the first to examine social comparison processes during significant life transitions. Past research would suggest that, to the extent that the uncertainties involved in making a transition to a novel situation are self-threatening, they will lead to a focus on downward comparisons (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0146167212447234">Wills, 1981</xref>). Instead, we propose that individuals undergoing such transitions will be especially likely to seek out and be inspired by upward comparisons. We further argue that the mechanism underlying the motivating impact of upward comparisons is an enhanced sense of control over future outcomes. Individuals who have achieved success demonstrate that it is possible to improve one’s circumstances in the future and escape from the uncertainties of the present. Finally, this enhanced control will be conferred only by successful others who have undergone a similar transition: Individuals experiencing a life transition may benefit from upward comparisons, but only to superior others who have followed a similar life trajectory.</p>

<title>Overview of Studies</title>
<p>We first examined comparison preferences among individuals dealing with a variety of familiar or unfamiliar situations to confirm that those in unfamiliar situations would be especially inspired by upward comparisons (Study 1). Next, we focused on the example of college students, examining whether the degree to which students feel that they are involved in a significant life transition would determine whether they would be motivated by upward relative to downward comparisons (Study 2). We then focused on a group that faces an extreme life transition: immigrants to a new culture. We examined their actual experiences to determine whether upward comparisons are indeed more frequent and motivating than downward comparisons, and, further, whether comparisons with other newcomers are most inspiring (Study 3). Finally, we examined whether individuals in a novel environment would be most inspired by upward comparisons with individuals who had made a similar transition in the past, because such comparisons would enhance perceptions that they could control their own future outcomes (Study 4). Across studies, we predicted that although upward comparisons may threaten self-evaluations, they would be particularly valuable to individuals in a novel context because they can motivate self-improvement aimed at making a successful transition. In addition, we predicted that comparisons with individuals who have successfully adjusted would be inspiring for individuals experiencing a life transition in part because such comparisons enhance individuals’ perceptions that they have control over their own future outcomes.</p>

<title>Study 1: Upward Comparisons Are Most Inspiring During Significant Life Transitions</title>
<p>In Study 1, we examined the degree to which individuals would find comparisons to be inspirational in situations varying in unfamiliarity. Participants contemplated upward and downward comparisons when making a transition to situations of either relatively high or low familiarity. We predicted that upward comparisons would be perceived as more inspiring in an unfamiliar context (a more significant life transition) than a more familiar context (a less significant life transition) and that this difference would be driven, at least in part, by the greater perceived uncertainty in the novel environment.</p>
<sec id="section3-0146167212447234">
<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section4-0146167212447234">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>Participants were 80 (41 males and 39 females) introductory psychology students (<italic>M</italic><sub>age</sub> = 19.64, <italic>SD</italic><sub>age</sub> = 2.56). Participants received course credit or Can$10 in compensation for their time.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0146167212447234">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>Participants were randomly assigned to either a high-familiarity condition or a low-familiarity condition, and were asked to imagine three scenarios. Participants in the low-familiarity condition were asked to imagine (a) beginning a new summer job, (b) spending a summer living in a different country where the language and customs were unfamiliar, and (c) beginning a program that is very different than their previous program and at a new university. Participants in the high-familiarity situation were asked to imagine (a) returning to a summer job, (b) spending a summer living in a different country where the language and customs were familiar, and (c) beginning a new program, similar to a previous one, at the same university.</p>
<p>After reading the brief description of each scenario, participants indicated along a 7-point scale how uncertain they would feel in that situation (1 = <italic>not at all uncertain</italic> and 7 = <italic>very uncertain</italic>). Next, participants were asked to consider comparisons made with individuals who were somewhat more experienced in the situation but who were either succeeding or failing. For example, for the summer job scenario, participants were asked to imagine a person who had started the same job a few months ago and had transitioned extremely successfully (an upward comparison), and they were also asked to imagine a person who had started the same job a few months ago and had experienced a lot of problems in the transition (a downward comparison). They then indicated how much that person would discourage or inspire them along a scale with endpoints labeled 1 (<italic>discouraging</italic>) and 7 (<italic>inspiring</italic>).</p>
</sec>

<sec id="section6-0146167212447234">
<title>Results and Discussion</title>
<p>Participant responses were collapsed across the three scenarios to create indices of uncertainty (Cronbach’s α = .77) and inspiration (UC Cronbach’s α = .78; DC Cronbach’s α = .65). Overall, the pattern of responses for these variables was similar across scenarios, with no significant deviations from the expected pattern.</p>
<sec id="section7-0146167212447234">
<title>Uncertainty</title>
<p>As expected, participants in the low-familiarity condition (<italic>M</italic> = 4.66, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.21) reported more uncertainty than those in the high-familiarity condition (<italic>M</italic> = 2.61, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.02), <italic>F</italic>(1, 78) = 67.46, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, η<sup>2</sup> = .46.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0146167212447234">
<title>Inspiration experienced after comparisons</title>
<p>A 2 (familiarity: low, high) × 2 (direction: upward, downward) ANOVA was performed with the last variable modeled as repeated. Results indicated a significant main effect of direction, <italic>F</italic>(1, 78) = 68.23, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, η<sup>2</sup> = .45,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0146167212447234">1</xref></sup> and a significant Familiarity × Direction interaction, <italic>F</italic>(1, 78) = 6.25, <italic>p</italic> = .02, η<sup>2</sup> = .04.</p>
<p>As expected, upward comparisons (<italic>M</italic> = 5.29, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.25) were more inspiring than downward comparisons (<italic>M</italic> = 3.68, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.15). This is consistent with past research indicating that upward targets can function as role models (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0146167212447234">Lockwood &amp; Kunda, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0146167212447234">Taylor &amp; Lobel, 1989</xref>). Nevertheless, the inspirational impact should be strongest for individuals who are in an unfamiliar situation. Indeed, as predicted, participants in the low-familiarity condition reported significantly more inspiration from an upward comparison target (<italic>M</italic> = 5.58, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.17) than did participants in the high-familiarity condition (<italic>M</italic> = 5.01, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.28, <italic>p</italic> = .04). In contrast, participants in the low-familiarity condition (<italic>M</italic> = 3.47, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.09) were somewhat less inspired by a downward comparison target than were participants in the high-familiarity condition (<italic>M</italic> = 3.88, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.17, <italic>p</italic> = .11), although this effect failed to reach significance. Overall, these results are consistent with our prediction that individuals are most likely to find upward comparisons inspiring when they are in an unfamiliar situation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0146167212447234">
<title>Mediation analysis</title>
<p>A mediation analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0146167212447234">Baron &amp; Kenny, 1986</xref>) was performed to further test our hypothesis that the uncertainty arising from unfamiliar circumstances leads to greater inspiration by upward comparison targets. To examine this possibility, we first regressed inspiration by upward comparison on the familiarity condition. Assignment to the low-familiarity condition predicted significantly greater inspiration by upward comparisons (<italic>B</italic> = 0.57, <italic>SE B</italic> = 0.27), <italic>t</italic>(79) = 2.09, <italic>p</italic> = .04, β = .23. A second regression revealed that assignment to the low-familiarity condition was associated with greater reported uncertainty (<italic>B</italic> = 2.04, <italic>SE B</italic> = 0.25), <italic>t</italic>(79) = 8.21, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, β = .68. Finally, we regressed inspiration by upward comparisons on both familiarity condition and reported situational uncertainty. This analysis revealed that increased situational uncertainty was associated with greater inspiration by upward comparisons (<italic>B</italic> = 0.37, <italic>SE B</italic> = 0.12), <italic>t</italic>(79) = 3.10, <italic>p</italic> =.003, β = .44, but the familiarity condition was no longer associated with inspiration (<italic>B</italic> = −0.18, <italic>SE B</italic> = 0.36), <italic>t</italic>(79) = − 0.50, <italic>p</italic> = .62, β = −.07. A Sobel test revealed that the indirect effect of familiarity condition on inspiration by upward comparison, through situational uncertainty, was significant, <italic>z</italic> = 2.90, <italic>p</italic> = .003. This is consistent with our hypothesis that individuals making a life transition experience a high degree of uncertainty, which in turn is associated with finding greater inspiration from upward comparisons. The more successful individual operates as a role model, an exemplar of how to resolve the uncertainty in one’s own situation and achieve success in the future.</p>

<sec id="section10-0146167212447234">
<title>Study 2: Social Comparisons During the Transition to College Life</title>
<p>In Study 1, participants were asked to consider hypothetical situations that varied in the degree to which they involved a life transition. In Study 2, participants were individuals who were actually experiencing a situation that they perceived to be either high or low in the degree of transition involved. Specifically, we examined how students who were finding the move to college to be either a relatively minor life transition or a major life transition would respond to the example of another student who had made a successful or unsuccessful transition. We predicted that participants who were themselves finding the move to college to be a significant transition would be more inspired by the upward comparison than would those not finding the move to be a significant transition. In contrast, we did not expect degree of life transition to influence responses to downward comparisons, which should be less inspiring overall.</p>
<p>We also used Study 2 to examine the mechanism through which upward comparisons may inspire individuals experiencing a life transition. Study 1 indicated that upward comparisons are especially inspiring when individuals feel uncertainty about their situation, but it is not clear how upward comparisons resolve this uncertainty. In Study 2, we focused on perceived control as the possible mechanism: We examined the possibility that upward comparisons would give participants a greater sense of control over their own future outcomes, making them feel like they would be able to negotiate this transition successfully. Downward comparisons, in contrast, might be associated with a temporary boost to self-esteem, but would not be associated with any enhanced sense of control over the process of making a transition. Thus, we predicted that whereas downward comparisons might boost self-evaluations, only upward comparisons would inspire individuals to engage in self-improvement; furthermore, we predicted this inspirational effect only for those participants going through a significant life transition, because only those participants would benefit from the enhanced sense of control engendered by exposure to the successful other.</p>
<sec id="section11-0146167212447234">
<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section12-0146167212447234">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>Participants were 28 male and 37 female introductory psychology students (<italic>M</italic><sub>age</sub> = 19, <italic>SD<sub>age</sub></italic> = 1.19) who took part in the study for course credit or Can$10. To rule out the possibility that participants were undergoing additional transitions as visiting students or recent immigrants, only individuals born in Canada were included in the study. Participants were told that the study concerned forming impressions of other students’ adjustment to university life. Three participants expressed suspicion about the purpose of the study during debriefing and were therefore excluded from the study. Altogether, 62 participants were included in the analyses.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0146167212447234">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>On arrival at the laboratory, participants were told that they would first be asked some questions about their own university experiences. Participants then completed a brief questionnaire in which was embedded a 5-item scale assessing participants’ perception that they were experiencing a significant life transition (e.g., “Coming to U of T has been a big transition for me” and “I’m currently going through a period of adjustment”). Ratings (α = .75) were made on an 11-point scale with endpoints ranging from 1 (<italic>not at all true</italic>) to 11 (<italic>very true</italic>).</p>
<p>Next, participants were told that the researchers were interested in “what sorts of factors students consider when they judge other students’ transitions to university life.” They then read a self-description, ostensibly provided by another student who had taken part in an earlier study. A brief cover sheet indicated that the target student was 22 years old, in the 4th year, and of the same gender as the participant. In the upward comparison condition, this student described making a successful social and academic transition, now feeling at home in the new environment. In the downward comparison condition, this student described making a poor social and academic transition, finding it difficult to adjust and fit in. In both conditions, the student commented on the challenges of making a life transition, but whereas the upward target described successfully overcoming these challenges, the downward target described being unable to do so.</p>
<p>After reading the self-description, participants were asked to rate the target on 12 items related to adjustment (e.g., “The student I read about has adjusted well to life at university”). Ratings were made on an 11-point scale (α = .98) with endpoints ranging from 1 (<italic>disagree</italic>) to 11 (<italic>agree</italic>). Next, participants were told that, because their own personality type, goals, and responses to the person they read about might influence their impression, they would also be asked some questions about themselves.</p>
<p>Participants then rated themselves on three items designed to tap the extent to which they found the person they read about to be motivating (α = .86; for example, “The person I read about motivated me to work harder”). They also rated themselves on two items indicating how this student affected their self-perceptions (for example, “This student made me feel like I am adjusting well”; <italic>r</italic> = .54). In addition, they rated themselves on three items indicating the degree to which the student influenced their sense of control over their own adjustment (α = .87; for example, “This student’s example made me feel like I can take charge of my own life”). All ratings were made on an 11-point scale with endpoints ranging from 1 (<italic>not at all true</italic>) to 11 (<italic>very true</italic>).</p>

<title>Results and Discussion</title>
<sec id="section15-0146167212447234">
<title>Target ratings</title>
<p>We first examined participants’ perceptions of the target’s adjustment. We regressed target ratings on participants’ state of life transition (centered) and comparison direction. As expected, there was a main effect of comparison direction: Participants rated the unsuccessful target as significantly less well adjusted (<italic>M</italic> = 2.27, <italic>SD</italic> =0.80) than the successful target (<italic>M</italic> = 9.8, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.85), <italic>F</italic>(1, 49) = 1057.24, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, η<sup>2</sup> = .95. Neither the main effect of participants’ state of transition nor the state of transition by comparison direction interaction was significant (both <italic>ps</italic> &gt; .31). Thus, participants viewed the successful target to be adjusting well and the unsuccessful target to be adjusting poorly, regardless of whether they themselves were going through a significant life transition.</p>

<title>Motivation ratings</title>
<p>We had predicted that individuals going through a significant life transition would be especially motivated by upward but not downward comparisons. Accordingly, we regressed motivation ratings on participants’ state of transition and comparison direction. As predicted, the interaction was significant (<italic>B =</italic> 1.04, <italic>SE B</italic> = 0.37), <italic>t</italic>(58) = 2.82, <italic>p</italic> = .01, β = 1.32. Among participants exposed to the unsuccessful target, state of transition was not significantly correlated with motivation, <italic>r</italic> = .20, <italic>p</italic> = .29. In contrast, among participants exposed to the successful target, state of transition significantly predicted motivation, <italic>r</italic> = .67, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001. Thus, participants going through a significant transition reported greater motivation following exposure to a target who had made a successful transition than did those not going through a significant transition. This pattern was absent following downward comparisons.</p>

<sec id="section17-0146167212447234">
<title>Perceived control</title>
<p>We next examined whether upward comparisons would give individuals making a significant life transition a greater sense of control over their future outcomes. We regressed participants’ perceptions that they had control over their own outcomes on state of transition and comparison direction. The transition by comparison direction interaction was marginally significant (<italic>B =</italic> 0.70, <italic>SE B</italic> = 0.40), <italic>t</italic>(58) = 1.77, <italic>p</italic> = .08, β = .88. Although the overall interaction did not reach significance, the pattern of results was consistent with our predictions: Participants’ state of transition was positively associated with perceived control following an upward (<italic>r</italic> = .64, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) but not a downward comparison (<italic>r</italic> = .23, <italic>p</italic> = .22). Thus, participants going through a greater transition were more likely to feel enhanced control following exposure to a target who had made a successful transition, but not to a target who had made an unsuccessful transition.</p>

<title>Mediation analysis</title>
<p>We had predicted that students going through a significant life transition would be more likely to be motivated by a student who had adjusted successfully than would those not experiencing such a transition, in part because the successful other would give them a greater sense of control over their own outcomes during a time of uncertainty. Accordingly, we examined whether perceived control would mediate the impact of life transition state on motivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0146167212447234">Baron &amp; Kenny, 1986</xref>). We first regressed motivation on state of transition; this effect was significant (<italic>B =</italic> 0.55, <italic>SE B</italic> = 0.21), <italic>t</italic>(60) =2.70, <italic>p</italic> = .01, β = .33. We next regressed perceived control on state of transition and obtained a significant effect (<italic>B =</italic> 0.18, <italic>SE B</italic> = 0.07), <italic>t</italic>(60) =2.46, <italic>p</italic> = .02, β = .30. Finally, we regressed motivation on state of transition and perceived control simultaneously. The effect of perceived control was significant (<italic>B =</italic> 0.77, <italic>SE B</italic> = 0.08), <italic>t</italic>(59) = 9.64, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, β = .78; however, as expected, the effect of state of transition was no longer significant, <italic>B =</italic> 0.16, <italic>SE B</italic> = 0.14, <italic>t</italic>(60) =1.18, <italic>p</italic> = .24, β = .10. A Sobel test revealed the indirect effect of state of transition, through perceived control, to be significant, <italic>z</italic> = 2.48, <italic>p</italic> = .01. Thus, our analysis is consistent with the possibility that individuals experiencing a significant life transition are especially motivated by an upward comparison, in part because that comparison enhances their belief that they can control their future success.</p>

<sec id="section19-0146167212447234">
<title>Self-evaluations</title>
<p>We had predicted that upward comparisons would make participants feel worse about themselves than downward comparisons. We regressed self-evaluations on participants’ state of transition and comparison direction. As predicted, the main effect of comparison direction was significant, <italic>B =</italic> −1.41, <italic>SE B</italic> = 0.55, <italic>t</italic>(60) =2.58, <italic>p</italic> = .01, β = −.33. Participants felt worse about their own adjustment after exposure to the upward (<italic>M</italic> = 7.94, <italic>SD</italic> = 2.15) than the downward target (<italic>M</italic> = 9.08, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.98). Neither the main effect of state of transition nor the transition by comparison direction interaction was significant (both <italic>ps</italic> &gt; .10).</p>
<p>Overall, Study 2 provides further support that upward comparisons are especially beneficial for individuals experiencing a life transition. Participants who were finding the move to university to be a significant life transition were especially likely to find the example of a successfully coping senior student to be motivating; the successful student boosted these individuals’ perceptions that they could control their own future outcomes. Although downward comparisons made participants feel better about their own adjustment, they did not motivate individuals to improve their own circumstances. It appears that although individuals experiencing a life transition might gain the short-term gratification of enhanced self-evaluations from a downward comparison, they are more motivated and inspired by the example of a successful other, who provides hope that they will be able to become similarly successful in the future.</p>

<title>Study 3: Social Comparison Processes Among Recent Immigrants</title>
<p>Both Studies 1 and 2 indicate that upward comparisons are especially likely to confer benefits among individuals dealing with significant life transitions. It is possible, however, that although upward comparisons can be inspiring, individuals will nevertheless prefer to seek out the short-term gratification offered by downward comparisons. In Study 3, we sought further evidence that people who are experiencing a life transition are especially likely to be inspired by upward comparisons and that they strategically seek out such comparisons to improve their current circumstances. We examined the kinds of social comparisons cultural newcomers reported using when adjusting to life in a new country, their reasons for making these comparisons, and the effects of these comparisons on self-evaluation and motivation. In contrast to the results of previous self-report studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0146167212447234">Heidrich &amp; Ryff, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0146167212447234">Locke &amp; Nekich, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0146167212447234">Wheeler &amp; Miyake, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0146167212447234">Wood et al., 1985</xref>), we expected that cultural newcomers would engage in more frequent upward than downward comparisons. That is, cultural newcomers should more often look for people who can provide them with information about how to fit in with and successfully negotiate the new cultural environment. We also used Study 3 to confirm that this finding would be replicated with a community sample. Whereas Studies 1 and 2 involved college students, typically a young and highly motivated group with very positive expectations for future success, Study 3 involved a sample of cultural newcomers drawn from the general population.</p>
<p>In addition, we examined whether this preference for upward comparisons might not hold for upward comparisons in general; more specifically, individuals experiencing a life transition may benefit only from those comparisons with individuals who have achieved success following a similar transition. Individuals may gain a sense of control over their own life trajectories only from those individuals who illustrate that such an upward trajectory is possible. We therefore predicted that newcomers would prefer to compare themselves with other cultural newcomers.</p>
<p>Although we argue that social comparisons are useful for newcomers who are adjusting to an unfamiliar environment, some researchers suggest that cultural background and related differences in self-construals are important variables to consider when examining how people use social comparison processes (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0146167212447234">Lockwood, Marshall, &amp; Sadler, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0146167212447234">White &amp; Lehman, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0146167212447234">White, Lehman, &amp; Cohen, 2006</xref>). We therefore collected data from three cultural groups—East Asian, Eastern European, and South Asian—to test whether newcomers of specific cultural backgrounds used social comparisons differently during cultural adjustment. However, cultural differences were not a primary focus of this study; rather, by examining our hypotheses using cultural newcomers from more than one cultural group, we hoped to confirm that immigrants from different cultural backgrounds would experience similar comparison outcomes.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section22-0146167212447234">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>Participants were 37 male and 34 female immigrants (<italic>M</italic><sub>age</sub> = 35.25, <italic>SD</italic><sub>age</sub> = 9.84) from the Greater Toronto Area who were recruited through an advertisement placed in several local newspapers. Of these participants, 23 reported East Asian ancestry (9 males and 14 females), 30 reported Eastern European ancestry (16 males and 14 females), and 18 reported South Asian ancestry (12 males and 6 females). There were no differences in age across cultural groups, <italic>F</italic>(2, 68) = 1.35, <italic>p</italic> = .27. Years lived in Canada ranged from less than 1 year to 8 years (<italic>M</italic> = 2.93, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.72) and did not differ significantly across cultural group, <italic>F</italic>(2, 68) = 1.08, <italic>p</italic> = .34. All participants were required to be sufficiently proficient in English so that they could complete the questionnaire without using a translator. Participants received CAN$25 in compensation for their time.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section23-0146167212447234">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>Participants first provided open-ended responses to two questions regarding the kinds of social comparisons they used during cross-cultural transition. They were asked to recount one occasion when they had compared themselves with someone doing better than themselves and one occasion when they had compared themselves with someone doing worse than themselves. For each occasion, participants were asked to provide the reason for making the comparison and to indicate how they had felt afterward.</p>
<p>Participants next completed a section of closed-ended questions based in part on a questionnaire used in previous research examining social comparison processes during adjustment to aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0146167212447234">Heidrich &amp; Ryff, 1993</xref>). This set of questions was designed to examine how recent immigrants use social comparisons during cultural adjustment within nine specific domains: English language ability, social adjustment, relationship with family members, romantic relationships, occupational success, physical appearance, financial resources, personality traits, and health. For each domain, participants first reported the importance of that domain to their lives on a 7-point scale with endpoints labeled 1 (<italic>not at all important</italic>) and 7 (<italic>very important</italic>).</p>
<p>For each of the nine domains, participants then provided information about the comparisons they engaged in with each of four different groups (presentation counterbalanced): (a) cultural newcomers who were better-off than themselves (<italic>UC Newcomers</italic>), (b) cultural newcomers who were worse-off than themselves (<italic>DC Newcomers</italic>), (c) Canadian-born people who were better-off than themselves (<italic>UC Canadian born</italic>), and (d) Canadian-born individuals who were worse-off than themselves (<italic>DC Canadian born).</italic></p>
<p>Participants responded to three questions for each of the four targets within each of the nine domains. Specifically, participants reported how frequently they compared themselves with members of the target group on a 7-point scale with endpoints labeled 1 (<italic>never</italic>) and 7 (<italic>frequently</italic>). They then indicated their motivation to improve themselves following comparisons with members of that target group on a scale ranging from 1 (<italic>not at all motivated</italic>) to 7 (<italic>very motivated</italic>). Finally, they reported how comparisons with that target group made them feel about themselves on a 7-point scale with endpoints labeled 1 (<italic>much worse about myself</italic>) and 7 (<italic>much better about myself</italic>). Thus, for each of the nine domains, participants responded to 12 questions regarding social comparisons (frequency, motivation, and self-evaluation questions for each target comparison group), in addition to the domain importance question.</p>
<p>Demographic items were included to collect information on participants’ age, gender, country of birth, residential status, and number of years lived in Canada.</p>

<title>Results and Discussion</title>
<sec id="section25-0146167212447234">
<title>Open-ended responses</title>
<p>We first examined participants’ specific accounts of an upward comparison and a downward comparison incident. Many participants noted that although comparisons with better-off others can be painful, they also have the potential to be highly motivating and can highlight opportunities for self-improvement. One participant described the effect of an upward comparison made with a classmate who spoke English as a second language as follows: “She was a perfect model, and I wanted to be like her. I put a great effort into upgrading my English skills in order to reach her. How I felt when I compared myself to her? Inferior!” Conversely, participants often reported that downward comparisons made them feel better, without necessarily motivating them. One participant noted, “I just feel satisfaction after I compare with him. He has already been here for four years, but he speaks English much worse than I do.”</p>
<p>Examples of upward and downward comparisons were coded for their impact on self-evaluations (positive impact, negative impact, or no self-evaluative impact stated). Raters agreed on 94% (Cohen’s κ = .90) of upward comparison cases and 89% (Cohen’s κ = .77) of downward comparison cases. Disagreement between the initial raters was resolved using the coding of a third rater. Responses were not provided for 3 upward and 10 downward comparison incidents and were therefore not analyzed.</p>
<p>As expected, a two-sample chi-square test indicated that a greater proportion of participants felt better after downward comparisons (30%) than felt better after upward comparisons (15%), χ<sup>2</sup> (1, <italic>N</italic> = 129) = 4.15, <italic>p</italic> = .04, Cramer’s <italic>V</italic> = .18. Conversely, a greater proportion of participants felt worse after upward comparisons (31%) relative to the proportion that felt worse after downward comparisons (8%), χ<sup>2</sup> (1, <italic>N</italic> = 129) = 10.28, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, Cramer’s <italic>V</italic> = .28.</p>
<p>Upward and downward comparison incidents were also coded for whether participants indicated that the comparison had motivated them to improve themselves. Raters agreed on 91% (Cohen’s κ = .82) of upward comparison cases and 100% (Cohen’s κ = 1.00) of downward comparison cases. A third rater determined the final coding in cases where the initial two raters disagreed. As expected, a greater proportion of participants (47%) indicated that upward comparisons were motivating relative to the proportion indicating that downward comparisons were motivating (10%), χ<sup>2</sup> (1, <italic>N</italic> = 129) = 21.44, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, Cramer’s <italic>V</italic> = .41.</p>
<p>In sum, upward comparisons had a negative impact on participants’ self-evaluations but were nevertheless inspiring. Downward comparisons boosted participants’ self-evaluations but offered fewer opportunities for self-improvement.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section26-0146167212447234">
<title>Domain evaluations</title>
<p>On average, participants reported that the nine domains were very important to their lives (<italic>M</italic> = 6.30, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.59), suggesting that the domains chosen for this study were indeed appropriate.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section27-0146167212447234">
<title>Frequency</title>
<p>The frequency of making social comparisons was collapsed across domains to form a single average frequency index for each target comparison group for every participant (UC Newcomers Cronbach’s α = .91; DC Newcomers Cronbach’s α = .89; UC Canadian-born Cronbach’s α = .91; DC Canadian-born Cronbach’s α = .88). Only participants involved in a romantic relationship completed that domain question set; individual index scores are therefore based only on the responses that participants provided.</p>
<p>To examine overall frequency of engaging in social comparisons with different target groups, we performed a 2 (direction: upward, downward) × 2 (status: newcomer, Canadian-born) ANOVA with both factors modeled as repeated. Results indicated main effects of direction, <italic>F</italic>(1, 70) = 58.99, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, η<sup>2</sup> = .35, and status, <italic>F</italic>(1, 70) = 13.48, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, η<sup>2</sup> = .03, which were qualified by a significant Direction × Status interaction, <italic>F</italic>(1, 70) = 6.12, <italic>p</italic> = .02, η<sup>2</sup> = .01. Upward comparisons (<italic>M</italic> = 4.50, <italic>SD =</italic> 1.50) were made more frequently than downward comparisons (<italic>M</italic> = 3.38, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.44), and comparisons with newcomers (<italic>M</italic> = 4.09, <italic>SD =</italic> 1.39) were made more frequently than those with Canadian-born individuals (<italic>M</italic> = 3.79, <italic>SD =</italic> 1.37). For downward comparisons, participants engaged in significantly more frequent comparisons with newcomers (<italic>M</italic> = 3.60, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.52) than with people born in Canada (<italic>M</italic> = 3.15, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.49, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). Participants also engaged in more frequent upward comparisons with newcomers (<italic>M</italic> = 4.58, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.53) than Canadian-born individuals (<italic>M</italic> = 4.42, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.58), although this effect was only marginally significant (<italic>p</italic> = .10).</p>
<p>The pattern of making more frequent upward comparisons contrasts with a variety of past studies indicating that individuals prefer to compare themselves with worse-off others (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0146167212447234">Locke &amp; Nekich, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0146167212447234">Wheeler &amp; Miyake, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0146167212447234">Wood et al., 1985</xref>), and even with the results obtained in a study using a very similar methodology to examine comparisons made by older adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0146167212447234">Heidrich &amp; Ryff, 1993</xref>). Although the changing life circumstances faced by older adults include some unfamiliar elements, these changes are gradual and, to some extent, predictable; older adults do not typically face the sudden changes and adjustments faced by individuals who uproot their lives and move to a new culture. Moreover, whereas cultural newcomers may perceive themselves to be on an upward trajectory with ever-improving life circumstances, older adults may have a more balanced perspective on their future outcomes, recognizing that their health, mobility, and independence may decline over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0146167212447234">Heckhausen et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0146167212447234">Heckhausen &amp; Krueger, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0146167212447234">Ryff, 1991</xref>). Accordingly, older adults may prefer the reassurance of downward comparisons. Newcomers, many of whom transition to a new culture primarily to achieve a better life for themselves and their families, are especially likely to perceive themselves on an upward trajectory. For them, upward comparisons provide the most useful and inspirational information regarding how to take charge of their lives and achieve a successful transition.</p>

<sec id="section28-0146167212447234">
<title>Motivation</title>
<p>Motivation ratings were collapsed across domains to create an index for each of the four target comparison groups (UC Newcomers Cronbach’s α = .89; DC Newcomers Cronbach’s α = .87; UC Canadian-born Cronbach’s α = .88; DC Canadian-born Cronbach’s α = .87). A 2 (direction: upward, downward) × 2 (status: newcomer, Canadian-born) ANOVA with both factors modeled as repeated was performed to test for differences in motivation after making social comparisons. Results indicated significant main effects of direction, <italic>F</italic>(1, 69) = 53.14, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, η<sup>2</sup> = .36, and status, <italic>F</italic>(1, 69) = 3.91, <italic>p</italic> = .05, η<sup>2</sup> = .01. As expected, participants were more motivated by upward (<italic>M</italic> = 5.01, <italic>SD =</italic> 1.33) than downward comparisons (<italic>M</italic> = 3.95, <italic>SD =</italic> 1.52). Furthermore, participants were more motivated by comparisons with newcomers (<italic>M</italic> = 4.56, <italic>SD =</italic> 1.28) than by comparisons with people born in Canada (<italic>M</italic> = 4.42, <italic>SD =</italic> 1.37).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section29-0146167212447234">
<title>Self-evaluation</title>
<p>Self-evaluation ratings were collapsed across domains (UC Newcomers Cronbach’s α = .92; DC Newcomers Cronbach’s α = .88; UC Canadian-born Cronbach’s α = .90; DC Canadian-born Cronbach’s α = .84). A 2 (direction: upward, downward) × 2 (status: newcomer, Canadian-born) ANOVA with both variables modeled as repeated was performed to test for differences in self-evaluation after social comparison.</p>
<p>Results indicated a significant main effect of direction, <italic>F</italic>(1, 69) = 30.90, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, η<sup>2</sup> = .27. Participants evaluated themselves more positively after downward comparisons (<italic>M</italic> = 4.81, <italic>SD =</italic> 1.07) than after upward comparisons (<italic>M</italic> = 4.05, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.11). There was no main effect of status; participants’ postcomparison self-evaluations did not depend on whether the comparison target was a newcomer or born in Canada. Whereas one may be most likely to be motivated by the example of cultural newcomers who illustrate that similar improvement is possible, self-enhancement can be activated by worse-off others regardless of whether they are cultural newcomers; any downward comparison target provides evidence of one’s superior standing.</p>
<p>More generally, this study found no evidence that cultural background exerted systematic influence on social comparison processes during cross-cultural adjustment. Culture was originally included as a variable in each of the three ANOVA models. Culture had no effect on frequency of comparison or on motivation following comparison; however, there was a significant Culture × Direction interaction observed for self-evaluations, <italic>F</italic>(2, 67) = 6.70, <italic>p</italic> = .002, η<sup>2</sup> = .11. The interaction was driven by the tendency for East Asians and Eastern Europeans to evaluate themselves more positively after downward than upward comparisons, whereas South Asians rated themselves equally positively after comparisons in either direction. Nevertheless, culture was excluded from the final ANOVA model because the finding was unexpected and peripheral to our questions of interest.</p>
<p>Past studies that have obtained differences in comparisons across cultural groups have examined outcomes in domains specific to achievement (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0146167212447234">Lockwood, Marshall, et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0146167212447234">White &amp; Lehman, 2005</xref>) and, in situations of established expertise, cultural background may indeed influence responses to comparisons. The present research, however, examined comparisons as they are used in the process of adjusting to novel situations. In such circumstances, individuals, regardless of cultural background, may more willingly accept their inferiority to others because they are focused on long-term rather than short-term goals. Consequently, they may see less value in downward comparisons: As new members of an unfamiliar society, they may expect to feel inferior in the present, while hoping for future improvement. Indeed, Studies 1 and 2 suggest that the obtained pattern of comparison preferences and outcomes may generalize beyond newcomers to other individuals transitioning to a novel environment. We note, however, that participants in Study 3, although less motivated by downward than upward comparisons, were nevertheless motivated by comparisons with worse-off others to some degree, and indeed, were more motivated by downward comparisons with other newcomers than to members of the host culture. This finding is in keeping with past results (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0146167212447234">Lockwood, Marshall, et al., 2005</xref>) suggesting that members of more collectivistic cultures, who tend to hold a more prevention-focused regulatory orientation than members of more individualistic cultures, may be motivated by downward comparisons because they are seeking to avoid a similarly negative outcome. The present study, however, focused on comparison frequency as well as comparison outcomes. Our findings are consistent with the possibility that, because individuals are seeking enhanced control in dealing with a novel situation, even individuals from more collectivistic cultures will prefer upward comparisons when dealing with a significant life transition.</p>
<p>Overall, the results of Study 3 provide strong support for our predictions. Participants engaged in more frequent upward than downward comparisons and reported that upward comparisons were more motivating, whereas downward comparisons were more self-enhancing. Despite the self-evaluative sting of upward comparisons, participants were more likely to compare themselves with better-off others to improve their own situations. Thus, participants appeared willing to accept short-term pain in the service of long-term gain. In addition, participants made more frequent comparisons with other newcomers, and they reported more motivation to improve following these comparisons; this was true regardless of comparison direction. Presumably, individuals can glean more information from others who have undergone a similar transition, even if that transition was not entirely successful. When considering the two main effects together, however, it is clear that newcomers are generally most motivated by other cultural newcomers who achieved a successful transition.</p>

<sec id="section30-0146167212447234">
<title>Study 4: Upward Comparisons With Other Newcomers Are Most Inspiring</title>
<p>In Study 4, we sought additional evidence for our hypothesis that individuals making a life transition would be most motivated by successful others who had themselves gone through a similar transition, because such individuals would provide them with a greater sense of control over their own outcomes. We argue that individuals experiencing a life transition will be motivated only by individuals who have successfully undergone a similar transition, because only such individuals will confer a greater sense of power over future outcomes. The example of someone who has successfully gone through the same process indicates to individuals making a transition not only that such a positive outcome is possible but also that they, too, can take steps to increase the likelihood of a successful transition. Thus, we predicted that individuals going through a life transition would be motivated by examples of successful others only if those others had undergone a similar transition, in part because such exemplars would boost their perceived control over their own future outcomes.</p>
<p>We also used Study 4 to provide additional evidence for our argument that upward comparisons are motivating for individuals in novel environments. Whereas Studies 1 to 3 assessed motivation through self-report, Study 4 used an experimental design to assess motivation after exposure to an upward comparison, without relying on participants’ perceptions of whether they had been motivated.</p>
<p>Participants were students who were cultural newcomers to Canada. They read about an individual who had made an extremely successful transition to university life and who was described either as a recent migrant or as an individual born in Canada. We predicted that participants would be more motivated by the recent migrant than by the Canadian-born role model. More specifically, we expected that the example of a successful cultural newcomer would boost newcomers’ perceived control over their own transition, which in turn would lead to enhanced motivation to succeed.</p>

One participant was excluded because, despite having lived outside the country, the individual was born in Canada. Three additional participants were excluded from the analyses because they received the study materials out of order. Altogether, 70 participants were included in the analyses.</p>

<sec id="section33-0146167212447234">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>Participants first read a bogus self-description, ostensibly written by a past participant in a study about the transition to university life. This target had either lived in Canada since birth or arrived in Canada just prior to starting university. In both cases, the self-description indicated that the target student had made a successful transition in domains such as academics and social adjustment (e.g., “When I started university . . . it was hard to meet people and fit in. Right now, I live in an apartment with two other people, and we are all good friends, and we socialize a lot”). The recent migrant target additionally noted that the transition involved adjusting to a new language and new customs (e.g., “I used to be afraid that I’d do something awkward or embarrassing because I didn’t always understand Canadian customs, but now I feel like I belong”).</p>
<p>After reading the article, participants rated the target on 13 items to assess their perceptions of this individual’s general ability to make transitions successfully (e.g., “This student will likely be successful after university”). Next, participants were told that because their own activities and beliefs might affect their perceptions of another person, they would be asked to provide some information about themselves. They then rated their motivation on 40 items from domains (e.g., social, academic, language) found in Study 3 to be important for newcomers (e.g., “I plan to expand my circle of friends,” “I plan to improve my English language skills”). Participants also completed a set of 23 items tapping their perceived control in domains relevant to cultural adaptation (e.g., “I am in control of my adjustment to life in Canada” and “I am in control of my social life”). Ratings for all scales were made on an 11-point scale with endpoints labeled 1 (<italic>not at all true</italic>) and 11 (<italic>very true</italic>).</p>
<p>A control group of participants rated themselves on the motivation and perceived control items without first reading about a target.</p>

<title>Perceptions of target</title>
<p>Target ratings were averaged into a single index (Cronbach’s α = .90).

<sec id="section36-0146167212447234">
<title>Motivation</title>
<p>The adjustment motivation items were averaged into a single index (Cronbach’s α = .93). A one-way ANOVA revealed a significant effect of target condition, <italic>F</italic>(2, 67) = 4.00, <italic>p</italic> = .02, η<sup>2</sup> = .11. Participants who read about a successful cultural newcomer planned to work harder to adjust (<italic>M</italic> = 8.66, <italic>SD</italic> = .98) than those who read about a successful member of the host culture (<italic>M</italic> = 7.68, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.41; <italic>p</italic> = .007) or those who did not read about a role model (<italic>M</italic> = 8.01, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.23; <italic>p</italic> = .07). Those who read about a host culture member did not differ in their motivation to adjust from those who read about no role model, <italic>p</italic> = .37.</p>

<sec id="section37-0146167212447234">
<title>Perceived control</title>
<p>The perceived control items were averaged into a single index (Cronbach’s α = .83). A one-way ANOVA revealed a significant effect of condition, <italic>F</italic>(2, 67) = 3.74, <italic>p</italic> = .03, η<sup>2</sup> = .10. Participants who read about a successful cultural newcomer perceived greater control over their cultural adjustment (<italic>M</italic> = 8.44, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.14) than did those who read about a member of the host culture (<italic>M</italic> = 7.59, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.00; <italic>p</italic> = .01) and those exposed to no role model (<italic>M</italic> = 7.75, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.30; <italic>p</italic> = .04).

<sec id="section38-0146167212447234">
<title>Mediation analysis</title>
<p>We had predicted that participants would find the example of a successful cultural newcomer to be especially inspiring because this individual would give them a sense of control over their future in an unfamiliar context. Accordingly, we examined whether perceived control would mediate the impact of target type on motivation. We first regressed motivation to adjust on target type, comparing participants in the newcomer target condition with those in the host culture target and control conditions combined; this effect was significant (<italic>B =</italic> 0.81, <italic>SE B</italic> = 0.30), <italic>t</italic>(69) =2.69, <italic>p</italic> = .009, β = .31. Assignment to the newcomer condition was associated with greater motivation to adjust. We next regressed perceived control over adjustment on target type and obtained a significant effect (<italic>B</italic> = 0.78, <italic>SE B</italic> = 0.29), <italic>t</italic>(69) = 2.71, <italic>p</italic> = 008, β = .31, indicating that greater perceived control was associated with exposure to the newcomer target. Finally, we regressed motivation to adjust on target type and perceived control simultaneously. The effect of perceived control was significant, controlling for target type (<italic>B</italic> = 0.53, <italic>SE B</italic> = 0.11), <italic>t</italic>(69) = 4.68, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, β = .50; however, as expected, the effect of target type was no longer significant (<italic>B</italic> = 0.41, <italic>SE B</italic> = 0.28), <italic>t</italic>(69) = 1.46, <italic>p</italic> = .15, β = .16. Moreover, a Sobel test revealed the indirect effect of target type on motivation, through perceived control, to be significant, <italic>z</italic> = 2.35 and <italic>p</italic> = .02. Thus, our analysis supports the hypothesis that the example of a successful cultural newcomer motivates other newcomers to make a successful adjustment in part by boosting their belief that they can control their adaptation to this unfamiliar situation.</p>

<title>General Discussion</title>
<p>The present studies provide compelling evidence regarding a unique pattern of social comparison preferences and outcomes among individuals adjusting to a significant life transition. Individuals making a transition to an unfamiliar context reported making more frequent upward than downward comparisons (Studies 1 and 3) and found upward comparisons to be especially motivating (Studies 2 and 3), even when such comparisons entailed a threat to self-evaluations (Studies 2 and 3). It appears that individuals transitioning to unfamiliar environments are willing to endure the short-term pain of recognizing their inferiority to another person in the service of the long-term gain of improving their own standing. This preference for upward comparisons appears to be driven at least in part by the desire to reduce uncertainty (Study 1) by enhancing perceptions of personal control (Studies 2 and 4). In addition, these studies suggest that the self-improvement value of these comparisons is greatest when the target has had similar life experiences: Exemplars of a successful transition boost newcomers’ perceived control over their ability to make a similarly successful adjustment (Study 4).</p>
<p>These studies are the first to examine the role of social comparisons in adjustment to life transitions. Past research suggests that individuals might choose to deal with a threat such as the uncertainty posed by the transition to a novel and uncertain environment by seeking out the self-evaluative gratification of comparisons with worse-off others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0146167212447234">Heidrich &amp; Ryff, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0146167212447234">Wheeler &amp; Miyake, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0146167212447234">Wills, 1981</xref>). The present studies, in contrast, suggest that although life transitions may to some extent be threatening, individuals in unfamiliar situations nevertheless find upward comparisons to be inspiring, enhancing their perceptions that they can control their own life trajectories and improve their life circumstances to become like the successful other in the future.</p>
<p>More generally, these studies add important new evidence to a growing body of literature emphasizing the potential benefits of upward comparisons (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0146167212447234">Lockwood, Chasteen, &amp; Wong, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0146167212447234">Lockwood &amp; Kunda, 1997</xref>). Whereas the literature on social comparison has historically highlighted the threat to self-esteem posed by upward comparisons (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0146167212447234">Brickman &amp; Bulman, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0146167212447234">Morse &amp; Gergen, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0146167212447234">Tesser, 1988</xref>), the present research provides key evidence that these comparisons can in fact be particularly beneficial for individuals in uncertain situations and, more specifically, for individuals negotiating a major life transition. The process of making a life transition appears to accentuate the self-improving function of upward comparisons; in such situations, superior others become especially inspiring. Further more, these studies provide new evidence regarding the importance of target similarity in determining comparison outcomes: Role models who have themselves faced obstacles before achieving success indicate that others can achieve similarly positive outcomes, boosting individuals’ perceived control over their destinies. These studies provide not only the first significant examination of social comparison processes among cultural newcomers, a socially relevant group for study, but also, as illustrated in Studies 1 and 2, suggest that similar processes may operate among individuals dealing with any novel context.</p>
<p>Overall, this research has important theoretical implications for social comparison theory, indicating that individuals facing the uncertainty of a major life transition may seek out and benefit from comparisons with superior others. These individuals are willing to forgo the possible short-term self-evaluative gains of downward comparisons to reap the potential long-term self-improvement benefits of upward comparisons. In addition, this research has important practical implications that are especially relevant for those countries with large immigrant populations. Our research suggests that cultural newcomers may benefit from exposure to positive role models with whom they share similar cultural transition experiences: Learning that other individuals have not only endured similar experiences but have thrived within the new milieu may be reassuring and inspiring for this population.</p>
<p>In a rapidly changing and increasingly connected global environment, the majority of the world population will, at some point, be exposed to an unfamiliar milieu regardless of whether they leave their country of birth. Although exposure to a dramatically changed environment can offer numerous rewards, adjustment to new circumstances can be difficult. Social comparison may provide a ready means through which individuals can motivate themselves to achieve a positive adjustment, thereby improving their prospects for a successful and rewarding transition.</p>
