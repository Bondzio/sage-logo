<abstract>
<p>This article considers Jussi Parikka’s <italic>Insect Media: An Archaeology of Animals and Technology</italic> and its place within the broader context of neomaterialist philosophy. The question of <italic>Insect Media</italic>, and indeed of neomaterialism more generally, can be summarized as follows: how might one open oneself to radically alien durations, while remaining politically sensitive to the concomitant risk of technocapitalist capture? Moving through the wide range of subjects engaged with by Parikka, from entomology and cinema to the most advanced forms of programming ecologies, I focus on Parikka’s organizing notion of insects as figuring the molecular disruption of the phantasmatic molar body. For Parikka, it is the <italic>swarm</italic> that serves as his privileged example, which he locates at the intersection of animal studies, posthumanism and media theory. After outlining Parikka’s important reworking of Bergson’s conception of instinct, understood as ‘intensities’, which functions equally well within the domain of new media, and some of its implications for neo-Darwinism, I then consider Parikka’s ‘melodic’ conception of both nature and technology. Such a conception, I suggest, is problematic in its conflation of nonhuman animals with, for example, software, technologies, viruses and parasites. This in turn puts into question Parikka’s ‘use’ of insects in relation to the claim, common to neomaterialism in general, to have moved beyond an anthropocentric viewpoint. Rather, I argue, such a conception rebuilds a humanist enclosure, albeit one in which, following Guattari, subjectivity can no longer be identified with the individual. Insofar as Parikka designates every nonhuman animal and every machine as beings prior to language and thus prior to intelligence, the non-unitary subject is as a result restricted to the experiencing <italic>human</italic> subject. This, as Eugene Thacker points out, has serious political implications as regards the attribution of value, or not, to this or that life. However, insofar as Parikka considers instinct as habitual rather than as predetermined and, moreover, extends it to technical beings, I suggest that such a placing of instinct as ‘prelinguistic’ cannot be maintained. By way of conclusion, I appeal for the opening of a dialogue between neomaterialism and deconstruction, with its focus upon language understood in a much broader sense.</p>

<body>
<p>The latest book in the influential <italic>Posthumanities </italic>series, Jussi Parikka’s <italic>Insect Media: An Archaeology of Animals and Technology</italic>, engages with a number of concerns within contemporary media theory by way of the ‘conceptual prism’ of insects. In an ambitious ‘neomaterialist’ project within the Deleuzian tradition, Parikka carefully constructs a series of transversal dialogues which range broadly across entomology, the history of cinema, game theory, biophilosophy, insect architecture, robots, emergent swarms and self-replicating automatons. Despite the wide variety of discourses explored, two related claims nonetheless ensure the ongoing focus of his project. On the one hand, Parikka writes, ‘media can be approached as intensive capabilities that are constitutive of worlds’ (p. xxvii) and, on the other, insects, with their bodily metamorphoses, serve to efficiently figure the disruption of the phantasmatic body of late modernity.</p>
<sec id="section1-1357034X12462253">
<title>Melodies and Mechanics</title>
<p>Parikka begins his ‘media archaeology’ of insects and technology in the 19th century, at the interface of the rise of modern biology, the emergence of modern media, and the appearance of a widespread interest in entomology. In this, Henri Bergson’s ‘biologically inspired’ philosophy constitutes a privileged nexus, transversally articulated both with the technological capture and division of motion, and with the concept of the ‘animal machine’ as it came to be understood within the popular reception of Darwin’s evolutionary theory. More specifically, through a reworking of Bergson’s concept of ‘instinct’ within current media theory, Parikka seeks both to contest the notion of mechanistic reduction and to open up theory to the necessity of thinking media by way of its nonhuman forces.</p>
<p>Whereas the focus of ‘domesticated Darwinism’ upon selection for fitness (in fact, the negative selection for extermination) depends upon an understanding of nature as predetermined and thus calculable, we should rather, argues Parikka, turn our attention to those inventive aberrations which more accurately characterize the emergence of relationally embodied entities. In contrast to their usual definition as closed automatic or mechanical loops, instincts, he suggests, rather function as <italic>intensities</italic>, that is, as ‘prelinguistic modes’ of intertwining the body with surrounding bodies, and as the resonance of their continuity and movement. Instinct as intensity, writes Parikka, marks only the ‘readiness for action, a threshold for interactions as affects’ (p. 24).</p>
<p>With instinct no longer reducible to preformulated patterns of response, Parikka thus argues that nonhuman animals, and in particular insects with their extraordinary powers of metamorphosis, can therefore serve as efficient figures ‘through which to question the notions of space, intensity, and affect and also the distribution of the body across a space that is intensive, a participatory space of affects’ (p. 100). Such a project, affirms Parikka, thus aligns itself with Rosi Braidotti’s nomadic philosophy, in that it too seeks to constitute something akin to a ‘cartography of new sensory realms beyond the visual’ (p. 244, n17).</p>
<p>In moving beyond the reductive mechanism of sociobiology, Parikka argues throughout for a reworked ethological approach which opposes any teleological vision of nature, stressing instead what he refers to as a ‘<italic>melodic</italic>’ conception of nature. Furthermore, he claims, it is just such a framework that ‘can be seen as applying to the nature of technics as well’ (p. 145). In order to better express this notion of a nonmechanistic ethology concerned with the lived dynamism of temporal relations, Parikka turns to the studies undertaken in the first decades of the 20th century by Jakob von Uexküll. The ethology of Uexküll – whose tick has become almost a staple of contemporary philosophy – proves exemplary for Parikka insofar as it demonstrates the intimate relation of life-worlds and technical media. This is because, he writes, the ‘framing of the human sensorium in relation to the designed spaces, rhythms, and intensities of technical media’ is very close to Uexküll’s framing of animal life-worlds (p. 110).</p>
<p>Indeed, what makes Uexküll’s approach particularly apposite is the emphasis he places on the role played by the specific organization of a body, both as regards perception and within the feedback loop between perception and action. In this, Uexküll’s studies constitute new cartographies of perception beyond the human being and, as such – as Braidotti contends in <italic>Transpositions: On Nomadic Ethics</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1357034X12462253">2006</xref>) – this enables one to view the world from a radically different perspective and yet without assuming a passivity of nature. Such a framing of the sensorium in its specific relationality is, argues Parikka, connected to the ‘broader philosophical task of understanding the human being as one singular way of contracting the world and as a specific capacity to signify, exchange, and communicate’ (p. 65).</p>
<p>As regards thinking with technical media <italic>and</italic> with nonhuman animals, all of this is both extremely important and increasingly urgent. Nonetheless, it is here that the weakness as well as the strength of Parikka’s book can be located, centred upon the Deleuzian-inspired notion of ‘animal worlds’ as ‘unfolding not unlike the temporality of music’ (p. 68). This is because, despite the admirable commitment to an ethology of lived relations, the dissolution of all ‘other’ beings within the melody of nature ultimately serves to reappropriate for the human animal an exceptional status in a traditional, all too human manner.</p>
<p>While I shall explore this in more detail in the final part of this review article, for the moment, however, let us leave Parikka’s nonhuman beings suspended within their endless and various becomings of sound and colour. Such becomings, as Parikka acutely contends, ‘are expressions not of any inner drive or physiological structure nor of a simple environmental pressure’, but rather of rhythms and counterpoints in the movement of territorialization (p. 80). Here, the emphasis on experimental probing and becoming rather than on evolution is indeed an important and necessary move, one for which Keith Ansell Pearson’s <italic>Viroid Life: Perspectives on Nietzsche and the Transhuman Condition</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1357034X12462253">1997</xref>) and <italic>Germinal Life: The Difference and Repetition of Deleuze</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1357034X12462253">1999</xref>) remain indispensable. My own concern, however, centres on the question of a romantic dissolution which might be said to both efface and deface the huge material diversity of ‘actual’ – <italic>individuated</italic> – insects within Parikka’s text.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1357034X12462253">
<title>Insect Technics</title>
<p>A media archaeology of insects and technology becomes possible, Parikka writes, only insofar as technology has increasingly shifted its focus away from stability and towards metamorphosis, to the extent that ‘the insect potential of transformation’ can now be said to characterize emergent technology (p. 147). For this reason, Parikka turns in the second half of <italic>Insect Media </italic>to consider contemporary advances in object-oriented programming ecologies. It is here, however, that it becomes increasingly clear that insects are not at all Parikka’s concern. This is not the same thing as saying, as Parikka does, that this book was never intended to be a history of insects in modernity. Rather, it is a question of whether Parikka considers insects in their lived specificity at all.</p>
<p>Indeed, one might consider the reduction of the huge diversity of insects under the general noun ‘the insect’ as symptomatic in this context. Again, this is not to say that Parikka somehow betrays his own project. Far from it. In fact, he states his intentions clearly: the <italic>concept</italic> of ‘the insect’ is to be employed ‘as a prism that allows us to understand certain aspects relating to biopolitics, the emergence of the term <italic>swarm</italic>, and the centrality of even the early entomology for our current media theoretical considerations’ (p. 251, n13). Parikka is concerned, in other words, not with nonhuman animals, or insects in particular, but rather with how they have come to be ‘deterritorialized and subsequently reterritorialized as part of media technical systems, design, and theory’ (p. 118). In these terms, moreover, <italic>Insect Media</italic> is indeed a very interesting and successful book. At the same time, however, this general approach is not without its problems. Consider, for example, Uexküll’s exemplary ethology. For Uexküll, focusing on the singular ways of being (or becoming) of specific animals, and thus upon the particular challenge this constitutes to any such notion of generic reduction, is of central importance.</p>
<p>Parikka, however, chooses here to follow Samuel Butler, and focus not on the specific ways of being this tick or being this locust, for example, but rather on how ‘the insect’ might serve to afford technology ‘ways of modulating movements, perception, and affection’ (p. 77). In an assemblage, writes Parikka, ‘anything can be captured as an instrument and technology’ (p. 77). In this way, technology thus ‘becomes deterritorialized from (1) a specific material form and (2) the human body as the primal locus of technological organization’ (p. 77). This is by no means to suggest, however, that Parikka is thus offering an apology for technocapitalist instrumentalization and exploitation of both animals and earth. By contrast, Parikka’s carefully nuanced and reflexive understanding of technology, an approach that he shares with Braidotti’s feminist nomadic ethics, constitutes a particularly strong point of this book.</p>
<p>Insects serve Parikka then, as they do Braidotti, as particularly efficient concepts of cultural analysis insofar as their very ‘alienness’ challenges the normative figurations of the male human body. They do so, moreover, in the context of temporal bodily metamorphoses which are opposed to both tropes and meanings (p. xxxiii). Somewhat paradoxically therefore, the insect is a <italic>figure</italic> of the molecular, a conceptual metaphor signifying a transversal movement. Hence insects, writes Parikka, ‘among other figures, creep into the supposedly intact but in fact crack-filled phantasm of the body of late modernity, revealing the distributed and assembled nature of any body taken to be natural’ (p. xxxiii).</p>
<p>The question which imposes itself, however, concerns how – indeed if – this notion of the insect, understood as a figure of that which is opposed to figures, in fact moves thinking beyond a traditional anthropocentric confinement, as Parikka claims. The related question that Parikka sets himself is crucial here: given a continuous reality of relations, how might one ‘tune oneself so that a part of that radical difference, the experiences that overwhelm us, would be able to enter our registers of experience?’ (p. 73). How, that is to say, might a (human) body open itself to radically other durations, be they those of insects, stones or technologies? Can one, in other words, exceed the limits of the human in moving towards ‘the horizon of the unliveable and the inhuman forces and nonhuman material intensities and rhythms’ (p. 74)?</p>
<p>It is this question that, for Parikka, opens an important transversal dialogue between philosophy, ethology, politics and the arts, one that also draws explicitly on the work of Elizabeth Grosz. More specifically, such an excavation of ‘insect media’ as Parikka undertakes must, he makes clear, be sensitive to transformations of sensoria <italic>and </italic>to their potential capture by technocapitalism. Such an approach, says Parikka, demands an insect-<italic>like</italic> compound vision as well as ‘the alternative senses of the cultural analyst’ (p. 206).</p>
<p>However, Parikka’s conflation of ‘insect’ and ‘technology’ or ‘media’ within an organizing analogy or parallelism causes problems here. Indeed, speaking of parallels, one could point similarly to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1357034X12462253">Braidotti’s (2006</xref>: 122) palimpsest of nonhuman animals, foetuses, viruses and parasites, all of whom occupy the ‘same’ position of ‘generative in-between’ possessing neither self nor other. Take, for example, the basic claim of <italic>Insect Media </italic>that the 19th-century fascination with insect worlds paralleled emerging new technologies because both ‘included forces that were imperceptible in themselves, for example, electricity or insects’ wing movements, but whose effects could be traced and brought as part of the human sensorium and regimes of knowledge’ (pp. 118–19). Such a parallel or analogy between (an insect) <italic>movement</italic> and (a technological) <italic>force</italic> simply does not hold, however. Whereas electricity is indeed imperceptible in itself and thus experienced only by its effects, the wings of an insect in flight by no means constitute an immaterial and thus imperceptible force. Rather, the latter is imperceptible only from a restricted anthropocentric perspective – and a perspective, moreover, which affords primacy precisely to the visual. Similarly, one could question whether either such forces or movements thereafter do become part of the human sensorium, or whether these are better understood as stammering, incomplete and erroneous translations into absolutely discontinuous media. As, for example, in the reductive shift from an individuated insect ‘life-world’ to a stuttering series of single frames, or from ‘the logic of algorithms, calculations, and voltages unreachable in itself’ to a punctuated series of mediated effects (p. 119).</p>
<p>Hence, insofar as the insect–technics parallel remains under-theorized, Parikka’s founding claim that the ‘nonhuman nature of technology can be easily connected to the nonhuman worlds of animals’ (p. 119) remains still to be demonstrated. Indeed, while the notion of indissociable feedback loops between ‘living’ and ‘technicity’ constitutes a particularly rich vein of thought today, in this instance it is difficult to see how Parikka’s approach escapes those very economies of metaphor and anthropomorphism to which Nietzsche drew our attention so long ago. Moreover, it becomes less clear as a result as to why the figure of ‘the insect’ should thus be privileged above any other within this schema.</p>
<p>This does not undermine Parikka’s posited aim of exploring ‘how insect ethology can hint at temporal ontologies and cultural analysis of affects’ (p. 56), that is, how they may <italic>translate</italic> into unpredictable configurations. It does, however, put into question his claim to exceed both metaphor and the human.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1357034X12462253">
<title>Songs of Swarming and Emergence</title>
<p>It is the temporality of <italic>swarms</italic> which, as Parikka argues throughout, constitutes the key terrain for exploring the cultural analysis of affects. This is because swarming, like flocking, is ‘not so much a form as a mode of individuation’ and, as such, exemplifies ‘the future forms of diagrammatic control in bioinformatic networks’ (p. 203). Moreover, Parikka maintains, insofar as this individuation is common to hives, collectives and social networks, the terrain of swarming can thus be located at the intersection of animal studies, media theory and posthumanism.</p>
<p>More specifically, Parikka argues that insect colonies are ‘like’ software because both function as an ‘emergent layering’, and both:<disp-quote>
<p>recall the nonhuman forces at play in the technical media culture of the Internet age, something governed by high-technological layerings of various kinds … and of conceptual figures that are created to tap into the complex ecological relationality of such layers. (p. 179) </p>
</disp-quote>For these reasons, therefore, insects are hugely important for our current era of technical media. Again, however, this presumed importance depends entirely upon this notion of ‘alike-ness’. It is a likeness, moreover, be it parallelism or analogy, not only between software and insect colonies or between hives and social networks but also between a beehive and a swarm of army ants, for example, or between a boiling cloud of flies and a racing swarm of locusts. A likeness even, between a swarm of meteorites and a flock of migrating starlings. We are thus returned yet again to a conceptual figure, one which as such inevitably simplifies complexity, unable to do anything other than reduce the singular aberrations of individuation and emergence. What gets lost in this positing of ‘alike-ness’, in other words, is the temporal ontologies of <italic>singular </italic>emergences.</p>
<p>This does not constitute a straightforward criticism, however, insofar as such a simplifying movement is in fact inevitable. Indeed, it is an inevitability which at other times Parikka seeks to engage with directly, as evidenced by his concern with how one might ‘tune oneself’ towards radical difference. The problem is thus not so much with conceptual reduction as with the suggestion that such a reduction might at times be avoided. It is for this reason that the notion of ‘swarming’ constitutes both the strength and weakness of Parikka’s book. On the one hand, for example, Parikka’s analysis of swarming in opposition to the mechanism of neo-Darwinism should be considered as required reading within a wide variety of disciplines today. Of particular importance, underlined by Parikka, is the ‘new ontological realization’ that swarming and flocking must be understood rather as <italic>emergent aftereffects</italic> of lived relations – a realization with profound consequences for the vision of nature as blind watchmaker (p. 163).</p>
<p>On the other hand, however, the question of figures and their necessary sedimentation remains in suspension. Indeed, a similar tendency can be located within neomaterialism in general (although it should be noted that both Braidotti and Grosz do pay more attention to the enormous variety and disparity among insects, along with relations of sexual difference and genderization). While this stems in part from philosophical heritage and in part from a stated commitment to move beyond the so-called ‘linguistic turn’, the weakness of this position must still be located, as we shall see, in the tension between the notion of <italic>expression </italic>in contrast to <italic>sense </italic>or language in its broadest sense.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1357034X12462253">
<title>Capitalist Capture: Instrumentalizing Life’s Melody</title>
<p>It is nonetheless this same philosophical heritage that informs Parikka’s sustained engagement with postindustrial capitalism, and that proves a high point of his intricate analysis. Central here is the argument that the relation of ‘insect technics’ to technocapitalist capture cannot be reduced to a simple dualism between intensive bodies and their vampiric capture. Instead, argues Parikka, this relation must be understood in terms of feedback loops, both positive and negative, moving back and forth between current research into animal bodies and the potentiality disclosed therein.</p>
<p>Indeed, it is here that Parikka insists that we take into account the nature of translations pointed to above, reminding us of the great distance separating insect worlds from digital culture when dealing with such things as <italic>swarm</italic> or <italic>hive </italic>understood ‘as concepts and figures of scientific and philosophical thought, and we should be aware of the continuous translations and territorializations they are going through’ (p. 167). Nevertheless, this warning against isomorphism remains confined within the specifically human domain, insofar as Parikka restricts his caution solely to the use of ‘swarm software’ in the attempt to understand such processes as involve large populations, be they human or software. Here, then, Parikka engages the problem of translation among human concerns, pointing out the convenience of the swarm as an <italic>image </italic>of the technical object, but falls prey to just that isomorphic parallel when encountering nonhuman animals.</p>
<p>It is from within this anthropo-centred context that Parikka seeks to demonstrate the feedback loop between ethological becomings and bio- and technocapitalist capture. He thus shows how the notion of swarming, as his privileged example, has become a primary focus for capture just as much as for flight, a capture which aims at an understanding of such processes, which exceed both the individual and the general idealized type. As a result, writes Parikka, ‘difference and process become comprehensible and hence controllable’ (p. 167). Indeed, it is perhaps in this sense that one can best understand Steven Shapiro’s assertion, cited by Parikka, that insects represent the ‘totem animal’ of postmodernity.</p>
<p>The concern of capitalism, of course, is not with insects but with profit, and Parikka clearly demonstrates why ‘the contact with capitalism and the diagrammatics of biopower cannot be neglected’ (p. 205). In this, <italic>Insect Media </italic>offers a timely and acute analysis, beginning with the contextualization of 19th-century mechanical animals within the emerging factory system (p. 130) and concluding with a focus on aberrations, modulations and intensifications within animal bodies which today constitute a ‘crucial motor’ for a variety of practices ranging from biotechnology to new media (p. 205). However, what concerns me here is that Parikka’s discourse in fact feeds directly into capitalist concerns insofar as he too bypasses actual insects. As a result, whereas a more rigorous ethological relatedness would stress the individuation rather than the generalization of the huge variety and practices of insects, Parikka remains caught within a movement of translation rather than of metamorphosis, and in large part because the anthropocentric exception of language and subjectivity remains implicitly intact.</p>
<p>Hence, while Parikka insists that the complexity of <italic>software</italic> should not be downplayed, with emphasis being placed on the singularities of ‘emergent behaviour… framed through well-specified diagrammatics’ (p. 204), at the same time he neglects those singularities of emergent behaviour insofar as they concern the <italic>wetware</italic> of nonhuman animal bodies. He neglects, in other words, a reflexive sensitivity to the necessary limits of his own diagrammatic framing. Here, I can do no better than to reiterate Parikka’s own warning: that ‘any critical ethos of difference and ecosophy’ must ‘keep a focussed eye on the wider ecological and ethological connections of their discourse and practices as they move on the same ground as the capitalist wish to tap into reformulations of desires, bodies, and politics of relationality’ (pp. 204–5).</p>
<p>In short then, only the metamorphosis of the human being is important for Parikka, ‘the animal’ being understood only as ‘a concept and vector of affectivity’ residing in the human being (p. 203). In this, he remains loyal to the schizo-analysis of Félix Guattari which, insofar as it stresses the ‘non-human’ parts of human subjectivity, is therefore, as Braidotti points out, ‘not an anti-humanist position but merely an acknowledgement that subjectivity does not and need not coincide with either the notion of the individual or that of the person’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1357034X12462253">2006</xref>: 125). Whereas Braidotti claims that, although ‘the human still gets preferential treatment… this is a matter of habit, not of values’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1357034X12462253">2006</xref>: 110), this would not appear to be the case with Parikka.</p>
<p>To put this more bluntly, the question centres upon whether Parikka here affirms, by way of a refusal of anthropocentrism which appropriates the non-unitary subject of poststructuralism, a resurgent doctrine of humanism. Such a question, moreover, can be posed to contemporary neomaterialist philosophy in general, not excluding that of Deleuze and Guattari. Prior to exploring this further, it is perhaps helpful to recall here the initial definition of humanism offered by Gilbert Simondon, whose ‘biophilosophy’ is of particular importance both to Parikka and to any contemporary engagement with technology. Humanism, he writes, simply is ‘a doctrine according to which the reality [<italic>réalité</italic>] of the human is in no way comparable to any other being in nature’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1357034X12462253">2004</xref>: 35).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1357034X12462253">
<title>Senses of Expression</title>
<p>This question of human comparability centres on the one hand upon insects and, on the other, on expression or language. These two are, moreover, indissociable: insofar as Parikka does not think with insects, he does not therefore need to engage with the problem of language for another affective disposition. Indeed, as regards insects generally, it is perhaps not incidental that within the frame of the book Parikka admits to not particularly ‘enjoying’ them, a lack of enjoyment which he then further specifies as hatred (pp. vii–viii). While this of course in no way presumes an organizing anthropocentrism, Parikka’s rhetoric – insects are described, for example, as ‘primitive’ and ‘dumb’ – nonetheless suggests an implicit hierarchy of beings. At the same time, these twinned attributes recall us to the question of language, insofar as to lack language is indeed, within the Occidental tradition, to be <italic>dumb</italic> and thus <italic>primitive</italic>. It is, in other words, to lack the language of the Master.</p>
<p>To understand this, let us return to the reworking of Bergson’s instinct with which Parikka begins. Instincts, as we have seen, cease to be simple predetermined reactions, and function instead as ‘prelinguistic modes’ marking a ‘readiness for action’ and ‘a threshold for interactions as affects’ (p. 24). The lack of language among nonhuman beings can thus be seen as directly related to instinct, insofar as the latter refers to prelinguistic modes common to all other animals, that is, as beings prior to language. But what might it mean for the ‘prelinguistic’ to function here as ‘a threshold for interactions <italic>as</italic> affects’?</p>
<p>In this regard Parikka makes a crucial point: rather than an automated reflex, instinct can instead be ‘historicized as a tendency, a potentiality that is not exhausted as a predetermined capacity’ (p. 24). Such a historicized <italic>tendency</italic>, that is, the tendency towards reiteration, is thus presumably another way of saying that instincts are not predetermined but are rather <italic>habitual</italic>. In this way, Parikka frees nonhuman animals from their traditional confinement as both naturally reactive machines and the constitutive outside of the responsive and socially responsible human animal. In exactly the same moment, however, Parikka then reinstalls or, better, re<italic>places</italic> the very same opposition in defining animal instinct as being prior to language. Insofar as Bergson’s instinct is ‘the marker of the pre-intelligent’, he writes, it is thus ‘an apt concept to take into account the pre- and nonhuman modulations of milieu’ (p. 201).</p>
<p>In other words, and despite its reworking, Parikka continues to reserve instinct for the pre-intelligent and prelinguistic nonhuman animal, whereas the human animal, by contrast, receives <italic>in addition </italic>the incomparable complement – and compliment – of language and intelligence. This has profound consequences, insofar as only the human is privileged with access to the symbolic, and thus to consciousness and subjectivity, however non-unitary it may be. By contrast and as a result, nonhuman animals can thus be equated with machines and software, even with viruses, without any apparent loss.</p>
<p>This, however, cuts both ways. Machines too are subject to the same reworked instinct: ‘Information is never only a passive recording in the brain matter of a living being or a machine but rather works as a “preference for a particular response”’ (p. 135). Information, here indistinguishable from instinct, is thus habitual, with such habits being understood as tendencies sedimented over time, which suggests in turn a radical nonhuman historicity. This broadening of the notion of instinct to incorporate both ‘living’ and ‘machinic’ habit is an astute and provocative insight. However, Parikka then jumps to the conclusion that both machines and nonhuman animals – as prelinguistic instinctual beings – ‘live in the connections that are not modelled as recognitions or representations’ (p. 135).</p>
<p>The question thus becomes, <italic>can</italic> something be both habitual <italic>and</italic> unrecognized? Habit of course requires no <italic>conscious </italic>recognition and, indeed, functions more efficiently without it. But for a habit to function, does that not require some form of recognition of that which evokes or provokes the habitual response? Do not all bodies do this all the time, and indeed, is this not the time, the <italic>historicity</italic> of such bodies? This is a question which the ‘deconstructive’ strand of contemporary philosophy sets itself to explore in depth, and in so doing rapidly moves beyond the restrictive notion of language as referring only to human verbal language, as evidenced by Jacques Derrida’s early shift away from ‘signification’ to thinking in terms of ‘trace’, ‘mark’ and ‘iterability’.</p>
<p><italic>Insect Media</italic>, however, as part of a neomaterialist attempt to move beyond the ‘linguistic turn’, inevitably neglects this discourse, which could in fact contribute to a particularly rich transversal dialogue, which is not to say a consensus, between the two philosophical strands which are all too frequently and erroneously represented as diametrically opposed. An opposition which has been created, above all, by the respective partisans of each group precisely in order to deny or exclude the possibility of just such an encounter. Indeed, Parikka could be said to exemplify, albeit politely, just this position in his curiously (and perhaps symptomatically) formulated polemic which, while acknowledging Derrida’s work on nonhuman animals, nonetheless claims that it is ‘more often writers coming from Deleuzian or Whiteheadian traditions who have been able to grasp the vibrant materiality of the animality’ (p. xxvi).</p>
<p>Despite this, there are clear points of potential contact. For example, the attempt by ‘the neo-materialist mode’ of cultural analysis to get rid of the ‘stagnant conception’ which places a fixed reality in opposition to dynamic language is indeed of central importance (p. 254, n48). However, insofar as Parikka here presupposes a restricted conception of language based upon a Saussurian-Lacanian notion of the symbolic, it is with just such an attempt that he in fact comes closest to the concerns of deconstruction. Derrida's ‘quasi-concept’ of iterability, for example, is intimately bound up with bodily habituations in which, as Parikka says, both human and instinctual beings – and thus without such a distinction being able to hold – ‘live through temporal relations in which networked nerve relations [are] continuously renewed’ (p. 135). Or again, Uexküll’s stress on the organization of bodies and their corresponding life-worlds strongly resonates with an understanding of perception as constitutive language. Similarly, the preoccupation of deconstruction with the impossibility of demarcation between reaction and response, between code and writing, between memory and sense, and between signal and language has much to offer here.</p>
<p>Generally, however, Parikka leaves such distinctions unchallenged, and does so in order to posit the possibility of ‘nonrepresentational accounts’ while at the same time arguing that bodies are memory, and are thus <italic>inscribed</italic> in material configurations. Take, for example, Parikka’s contention that animals constitute worlds ‘formed of the constant interactional sensing, movement, and memory of their surroundings’ (p. xxvii). It is this refused challenge, moreover, that enables Parikka to suggest that perception is communication, and to write of language enacting ‘perceptions, movement, and actions in which the division between “intelligent” self-guiding users of language and instinctual, passive, mechanistic followers of signals was bridged’ (p. 137), and yet without risking the privilege of the human animal in the process. Parikka, in other words, remains insistent that this bridge is only ever one-way.</p>
<p>In the end then, the non-unitary subject of <italic>Insect Media </italic>remains that of a living, experiencing <italic>human</italic> subject, with the result that, as Eugene Thacker points out in his recent book, ‘life becomes a humancentric concern. Life in this sense really means life-for-me, or life-for-us. This has clear political implications. Life is the privilege of designation and the status that designation accords’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1357034X12462253">2010</xref>: 5). In this way, some lives become worth more than others, with life itself even becoming a form of power. By contrast, as Thacker contends, ‘if life is not exclusive to the human, or a privilege of the human, then the question becomes: can there be a politics of life in terms of the nonhuman or the inhuman?’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1357034X12462253">2010</xref>: 5). It is this question, implicit in <italic>Insect Media</italic>, that is nonetheless placed in suspension by Parikka.</p>
<p>As a consequence, and in common with the most conservative of philosophical traditions, nonhuman animals are thus once again constituted as prelinguistic, nonintelligent beings forever dissolved in non-sensed and thus senseless becomings, indistinguishable from foetuses, parasites, machines, software and viruses. In contrast, I would suggest that it is only by opening itself to a dialogue with discourses thus far excluded, albeit without ever aiming for consensus, that the import and urgency of Parikka’s fundamental claim that ‘we do not so much <italic>have </italic>media as we <italic>are </italic>media and <italic>of </italic>media’ (p. xxvii) will be better understood.</p>
