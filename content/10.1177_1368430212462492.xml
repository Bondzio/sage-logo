<abstract>
<p>This paper examines how attitudes toward violence against women (VAW)—in terms of justification—influence the behavioral intentions of Afghan police officers when dealing with a case of intimate partner violence (IPV). An experimental study was carried out with 108 Afghan police officers who took part in a training course at the NATO Training Mission in Afghanistan (NTM-A) bases in Herat and Kandahar. Participants read an extract of a police intervention for an IPV case. They were faced with honor-related attitudes and possible actions to be taken to help victims and arrest perpetrators. In the experimental condition, in the questionnaire provided to police officers, there was reference to the victim admitting to an affair with another man. No such reference was present in the control condition. Results showed that admitting an infidelity produced more lenient attitudes toward the violence against the woman, which in turn reduced police officers’ intention to intervene by arresting the man and providing support to the victim. Results are discussed in terms of the role and function of the so-called culture of (masculine) honor and the rule of law and its implications.</p>

<p><italic>Honor</italic> can be understood in two ways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1368430212462492">Stewart, 1994</xref>). Honor as a <italic>virtue</italic> refers to the importance of moral integrity, altruism, pride, and respect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1368430212462492">Pitt-Rivers, 1966</xref>). This aspect of honor is valued by both women and men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1368430212462492">Rodriguez Mosquera, Manstead, &amp; Fisher, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1368430212462492">2002a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1368430212462492">2002b</xref>). Honor also has a second, potentially negative side. In this case, honor has to do with status, with reputation, and is based on a person’s (usually a man’s) strength and power to enforce his will on others or to command deferential treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1368430212462492">Nisbett &amp; Cohen, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1368430212462492">Vandello &amp; Cohen, 2003</xref>). This view of honor holds true in some cultures more than in others, in cultures where honor codes are formal and codified, even incorporated in the law (see what follows for details about the phenomenon of honor killing). In these cultures, there is a great concern for a man’s reputation based on his capacity and power to protect his family and possessions and to have this honor maintained and respected at any costs, especially with regard to gender normative roles. In such cultures, women’s divergence from expected and defined roles can be seen as infringing on both their own and on men’s reputations. As a consequence, women are sometimes punished in the name of honor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1368430212462492">Vandello &amp; Cohen, 2003</xref>). In this paper, we examine how masculine honor affects attitudes toward intimate partner violence (IPV) among Afghan police officers.</p>

<title>Honor Across Cultures</title>
<p>The existence and relevance of <italic>honor</italic> has initially been studied by anthropologists in Middle Eastern, North African, and Mediterranean cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1368430212462492">Gilmore, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1368430212462492">Peristiany, 1965</xref>) but it has also been identified in many other cultures, including Western ones, thanks to the work of social psychologists who showed that the concept of honor is rooted also in Western cultures and plays an important role in defining and influencing attitudes and behaviors. Honor is an important value in circum-Mediterranean regions, Arabic, and Latin American countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1368430212462492">Caro Baroja, 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1368430212462492">Fischer, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1368430212462492">Johnson &amp; Lipsett-Rivera, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1368430212462492">Nisbett &amp; Cohen, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1368430212462492">Peristiany, 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1368430212462492">Pitt-Rivers, 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1368430212462492">Rodriguez Mosquera et al., 2002a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1368430212462492">2002b</xref>). In these countries, honor is considered to be a positive moral standard and reason for pride, related to one’s perception of worth and to other people’s respect. Honor, in this instance, is a value deeply rooted in each people’s social world to the extent that people behave, create their relationships, and shape their personalities in order to build and maintain their honor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1368430212462492">IJzerman &amp; Cohen, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1368430212462492">Nisbett &amp; Cohen, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1368430212462492">Rodriguez Mosquera, Fischer, Manstead, &amp; Zaalberg, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1368430212462492">Rodriguez Mosquera et al., 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1368430212462492">2002a</xref>, 2000b; Uskul, Cross, Sunbay, Gercek-Swing, &amp; Ataca, 2011).</p>
<p>Furthermore, honor is also important in the south of the United States. In this culture of honor, maintaining a high level of <italic>masculine</italic> honor can result in insults, aggression, and even violence among White, non-Hispanic males, behaviors that are more frequent in this part of the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1368430212462492">Blok, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1368430212462492">Cohen, Nisbett, Bowdle, &amp; Schwartz, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1368430212462492">Cohen, Vandello, &amp; Rantilla, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1368430212462492">IJzerman, van Dijk, &amp; Gallucci, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1368430212462492">Nisbett &amp; Cohen, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1368430212462492">Vandello &amp; Cohen, 2004</xref>). This research on masculine honor in the south of the USA has also shown that when masculine honor “rules” prevail, nothing is written, equal, guaranteed, or predictable: Honor, reputation and respect come first. In contrast to this cultural prevalence of masculine honor “rules,” societies with strong principles based on the rule of law have a system of rules designed to keep us safe, to solve disputes, and to help us prosper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1368430212462492">Agrast, Botero, &amp; Ponce, 2011</xref>). The rule of law affects us in everyday life: It is relevant not only to law enforcement but to every person in a society because it constitutes and guarantees a society’s freedom and democracy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1368430212462492">Bingham, 2010</xref>). This is especially true when seen in the context of two of the rule of law indexes: the implementation of the law and the victims’ access to justice and protection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1368430212462492">Agrast et al., 2011</xref>). In cultures where masculine honor “rules” prevail, the protection of female victims may be compromised if the issues involved do not conform to expected normative roles or masculine honor-based values.</p>

<title>Masculine Honor, Sexism and Violence Against Women</title>
<p>When referring to honor cultures based on the regulation of male and female roles, the honor being referred to in particular is masculine honor. Masculine honor is created and maintained by female fidelity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1368430212462492">Vandello &amp; Cohen, 2003</xref>). Its violation constitutes, in contrast, male dishonor, or even a crime, as can be seen in the case of Afghanistan.</p>
<p>To better understand this construct and how violence against women (VAW), even in its extreme form, killing, is perceived, minimized, or even justified if it is committed in name of the maintenance of masculine honor, it is helpful to place it in a framework of gender roles and sexism. In particular in what has been defined as <italic>ambivalent sexism</italic>. Ambivalent sexism has been described as having two aspects: “hostile” and “benevolent” sexism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1368430212462492">Glick &amp; Fiske, 1996</xref>). <italic>Hostile sexism</italic> is defined by its negative equivalents of domination, degradation, and hostility, and implies also jealousy and possession (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1368430212462492">Glick &amp; Fiske, 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1368430212462492">2001</xref>). It consists of antipathy towards women who are viewed as usurping male power and not conforming to gender-determined roles characterized by silence, obedience, and submission. In contrast, <italic>benevolent sexism</italic> is defined as subjectively positive attitudes of protection, idealization, and affection towards women in traditional roles, but it is a more subtle form of discrimination. These two concepts apparently can coexist, though; as indicated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1368430212462492">Barreto and Ellemer (2005)</xref>, the public does not normally recognize benevolent sexism as true sexism, and this fact influences many of the gender inequalities that still exist in society today. If women conform to a patriarchal submissive status quo, they might be rewarded, or simply “respected” and not punished (i.e., by using violence against them). If women do not conform to these “benevolent” sexist ideologies and commit, for instance, infidelity (real or simply assumed) or sexual immodesty, their subordinate status can be reestablished through violent means, in the name of jealousy, or, perhaps more aptly termed, possession and control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1368430212462492">Viki, Abrams, &amp; Masser, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1368430212462492">Viki et al. (2004)</xref> found that a woman who was assaulted while cheating on her husband received more blame than a nonmarried victim. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1368430212462492">Abrams, Viki, Masser, and Bohner (2003)</xref> also reported that acquaintance rape victims are blamed because they are seen as having violated traditional gender roles and benevolent sexism status.</p>
<p>Violence against women—in particular, intimate partner violence (IPV)—is universal: It occurs in all parts of the globe, is transnational, can affect anyone from all ages and cultures, and can occur even in countries with a strong rule of law and “equality” between men and women (e.g., Canada, the UK, the Netherlands, the United States). However, IPV is explained in different ways in different cultures. In masculine honor cultures, sexists beliefs that regulate female (and male) behaviors have such a strong influence on attitudes towards VAW that this kind of violence can be regarded as not as a severe crime as it should be, as the law imposes—but as more acceptable or even justified. Male honor-based beliefs are reflected in these reactions by the criminal justice system and by law enforcement in general, and also in public opinion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1368430212462492">Baldry, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1368430212462492">Baldry &amp; Winkel, 2008</xref>; for a broader review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1368430212462492">Kilpatrick, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1368430212462492">Thompson et al., 2006</xref>). IPV is justified, minimized or even accepted when it is committed in the name of masculine honor to maintain or reestablish the masculine status quo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1368430212462492">Baldry &amp; Winkel, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1368430212462492">Vandello &amp; Cohen, 2003</xref>). When women do not conform to gender roles’ expectations and do not conform to what is eliciting benevolent sexism, hostile sexism prevails for the reestablishment of role supremacy, leading sometimes to violence.</p>
<p>Violence against women in intimate relationships serves to reestablish control when masculine honor has been perceived as violated. This can even result in femicide, or a so-called honor killing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1368430212462492">Radford &amp; Russell, 1992</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1368430212462492">
<title>Honor Killing</title>
<p>Honor killing is an extreme response to the belief that a woman or girl has violated her family’s honor, usually because of perceptions of sexual impropriety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1368430212462492">Mojab, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1368430212462492">Sev’er &amp; Yurdakul, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1368430212462492">van Eck, 2003</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1368430212462492">Van Eck (2003)</xref>, studying honor killings in Turkey, explained that these murders are carried out to “purify tarnished honor.” The honor in question is <italic>namus</italic>. Both men and women possess <italic>namus</italic>.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>For women and girls, <italic>namus</italic> means chastity, while for men it means having chaste female family members. A man is therefore dependent for his <italic>namus</italic> on the conduct of the womenfolk in his family. This means that women and girls must not have illicit contact with a member of the opposite sex and must avoid becoming the subject of gossip, since gossip alone can impugn <italic>namus</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1368430212462492">van Eck, 2003</xref>, p. 9)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The same holds true in those countries where if a man kills a woman (usually a family member) in order to reestablish honor violated by the woman’s infidelity or nonconformity to gender roles. The punishment is much more lenient than for first-degree murder or even manslaughter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1368430212462492">Shalhoub-Kevorkian, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1368430212462492">van Eck, 2003</xref>). Data on honor killing around the globe are not systematic. Nowadays, even in those countries where legislatures no longer deliberate on honor killing (see, e.g., a case in Italy<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1368430212462492">1</xref></sup>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1368430212462492">Baldry &amp; Ferraro, 2010</xref>), femicides often take place to reestablish men’s honor and reputation in their own and the eyes of others. Femicide, as well as less extreme forms of violence like IPV take place in the name of jealousy, or “passion,” demonstrating a sense of possession and control. If those few cases involving psychopaths or people with other mental health problems are excluded, in most Western countries, killings of women by their partners or former partners, even though this conception of honor has been rejected in these societies, are almost always cases of murders committed by completely aware men who kill in the name of an ancient male code. In this patriarchal view of “values,” women are possessions, and when they do not conform to normative benevolent sexism rules, they threaten male honor. These rules are broken when women leave their partners, have another relationship, or do not accept a submissive status to the men characterized by constant control and stalking.</p>

<sec id="section4-1368430212462492">
<title>The Case of Afghanistan</title>
<p>Afghanistan represents an excellent setting for studying the dynamics of masculine honor, because people, mostly in rural areas, practice this tradition and act in the name of honor, rather than in the name of the law. The law itself, with regard to the position of women and moral behavior, reflects a culture of masculine honor; indeed, some gender-based roles and behaviors are considered against the law though VAW is sanctioned by the Afghan Islamic Republic’s elimination of the violence against women law (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1368430212462492">Republic of Afghanistan, 2009</xref>). Adultery, for instance, when connected to the murder of a woman, in the name of honor, reduces the offender’s legal responsibility to a maximum of 2 years of imprisonment. Adultery, per se, is still a crime in Afghanistan (punishable with a sentence of up to 2 years).</p>
<p>Afghan women and girls are victims of numerous violent behaviors committed by men and their family members: forced marriages, rape, educational deprivation, IPV, inducement to self-immolation, acidification, and killing, among others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1368430212462492">Brodsky, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Though the social status of women in post-Taliban Afghanistan has improved and currently women serve as cabinet ministers, members of parliament, teachers, artists, and traders, according to a 2010 UN report, child marriages, forced marriages, and honor killings are still taking place (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1368430212462492">UNWOMEN, 2010</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1368430212462492">2</xref></sup> Although there are no systematic statistics about the prevalence and nature of VAW in Afghanistan, a report released by the Human Rights Department of the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan in December 2010 described VAW as widespread. A total of 2,765 cases of violence against women and girls were reported to the rights watchdog from different parts of the country, Afghanistan’s Independent Human Rights Commission (AIHRC) official Latifa Sultani told Pajhwok Afghan News, in 2010. The incidents included 144 self-immolations, 261 attempted suicides, 237 forced marriages, 538 beatings, and 45 murder cases. The self-immolation attempts left 75 dead and 20 others disabled.</p>
<p>In 2006, the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UNIFEM) conducted a study looking at police and hospital referral cases, police stations, and women’s services in Afghanistan. Results showed that violence affects women of all ages regardless of their marital status, education, or employment. VAW begins at an early stage, it takes several forms, and it is estimated that it affects 87% of all women in Afghanistan. VAW is committed by persons within the family in 90% of cases. Most reported forms of violence are physical attacks (22%), forced marriages (16%), and, in 9% of the cases, women filed complaints of abuse in terms of basic support to sustain their livelihood. Verbal abuse, forced engagements, and threats of a violent action represent 21% of all reported cases. Forced marriage and engagement viewed together account for 23% of the cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1368430212462492">UNIFEM, 2006</xref>). All these behaviors are against the law in the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan. In 2009, the Decree on Endorsement of Law on Elimination of Violence against Women (EVAW) No. 91 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1368430212462492">Republic of Afghanistan, 2009</xref>) established new definitions of VAW. This law is a complete revolution on the topic and defines those behaviors that are considered against the law. In Article 4 which law enforcement officials are required to enforce, there is a description of the different acts constituting VAW.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1368430212462492">3</xref></sup> In the context of the legal regulation of sexuality, adultery, as mentioned, is considered a crime in Afghanistan, punished with the same severity as cases of honor killing. Adultery and honor killing, from the point of view of the law, are considered on the same level of severity. Laws are a reflection of norms regulating society and its culture and principles: Afghanistan can be considered, in many aspects, as a country where the rule of law is set aside when it conflicts with male honor values or principles. The value of a woman’s life is comparable to the dishonor of a man. The role of Islam and of the Quran has been overemphasized as an explanation of honor killing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1368430212462492">Chesler, 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1368430212462492">2010</xref>), as in the case of Afghanistan. This explanation that honor killing or VAW has anything to do with Islam derives more from popular beliefs, even in cases where women have dishonored their husbands (e.g., in the case of adultery). In Islam, the Sharia law is the moral code and religious law of Islam, with the Quran being the main source. Sharia deals with several topics addressed by secular law, among which are crime, politics and economics, as well as personal matters such as sexual intercourse, hygiene, diet, prayer, and fasting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1368430212462492">Ritter, 2005</xref>). Though interpretations of Sharia vary between cultures, in its strictest definition it is considered the infallible law of God, as opposed to the human interpretation of the laws. This is often the reason why people follow the Sharia and uphold its principles as if these are in contrast with what the governmental law declares. However, nothing like the acceptability of honor killing is mentioned or accepted, even in the broader view of the Sharia law (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1368430212462492">Korteweg &amp; Yurdakul, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1368430212462492">Mojab, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1368430212462492">Sev’er &amp; Yurdakul, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1368430212462492">van Eck, 2003</xref>). Nevertheless, masculine honor-based cultures can infringe upon the rule of law, leading law enforcement to minimize or justify VAW and provide less assistance to victims, when they know that a woman has violated male honor and the norms of female reputation. Thus it is important to examine how adultery influences even law enforcement (e.g., the police) in dealing with VAW. Given that both adultery and VAW are crimes, police officers would be expected to have negative response to anyone who commits either adultery and or IPV.</p>

<sec id="section5-1368430212462492">
<title>The Present Research</title>
<p>In the present research, we aimed at investigating the role that masculine honor plays when police officers make decisions with regard to help and support to victims of IPV. Police officers, according to their role, should protect people and adhere to the law (i.e., act in the name of the rule of law) and not be influenced by any distorted masculine-based attitudes. This study was accomplished in two parts: First, we examined whether police officers’ attitudes towards VAW, in particular <italic>justification of VAW</italic> (which we used as a specific proxy for adherence to masculine honor beliefs) affected their intention to provide support to women beaten by their husbands and to arrest the husbands. Second, we examined whether contextual cues—namely, a woman’s admission of infidelity to her abusive husband (see also, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1368430212462492">Viki &amp; Abrams, 2002</xref>)—would negatively influence the decision to take protective actions in favor of the victim (e.g., arrest the perpetrator).</p>
<p>As described before, there are two existing sets of rules in Afghanistan: the rule of law and the “informal” rule of masculine honor; so we decided to manipulate <italic>adultery</italic> (present or absent) to elicit evidence of this coexistence. Given that both adultery and IPV are crimes in Afghanistan, if police officers are guided by the rule of law, they should report a negative attitude towards someone who commits adultery <italic>and</italic> someone who commits IPV. Thus, they should intervene in favor of the victim. On the contrary, if police officers are guided by the “informal” masculine honor code, they should report a negative attitude towards someone who commits adultery, but they should be more lenient toward the perpetrator. Based on this rationale, we hypothesized that in cases where a woman is beaten up by her husband and also admits to having had an affair with another man, more lenient attitudes towards VAW will be present, <italic>justification of VAW</italic> will increase among police officers handling such a case when they have received a call for help (Hypothesis 1a). In addition, these cases will reduce the willingness of the officers to take actions in favor of the victim (Hypothesis 1b). We further anticipated that such an adherence to more lenient attitudes would mediate the effect of contextual cues on police officers’ willingness to help the victim or, in general, to take and promote actions in favor of the victim (Hypothesis 2).</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section7-1368430212462492">
<title>Design and participants</title>
<p>Between April 2010 and July 2011, the first author was in charge of training Afghan police officers and police trainers on gender-based violence for NATO Training Mission in Afghanistan, International Security Assistance Force (NTM-A, ISAF) in different provinces of Afghanistan. Police officers, as part of their basic and advanced training, had to undergo a 2-day seminar on this topic. A questionnaire and a case description was presented to a sample of 108 police officers (nine females, 99 males; <italic>M age</italic> = 31.00 <italic>SD</italic> = 4.50) and presented as part of the course. Approximately 25 police officers participated in each training class, so the complete sample was gathered in five different training groups.</p>
<p>In all cases, in order to neither influence police responses nor to enhance socially desirable answers, questionnaires were filled in on the first day at the beginning of the training. Police officers were recruited at the Combined Training Advisory Group-Police of NATO (CTAG-P) training bases in Kandahar and Herat during the first semester of 2011. Participants were randomly assigned to one of two conditions stemming from the manipulation between participants of behavior of the IPV victim (condition: admitting infidelity vs. no mention to infidelity), as described in what follows.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1368430212462492">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>The questionnaires were translated from English into Dari and Pastu by professional translators working for NTM-A. Participants were asked to anonymously answer a paper-and-pencil questionnaire which also contained sociodemographical questions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1368430212462492">
<title>Presentation of the IPV episode and manipulation of the victim’s behavior</title>
<p>Participants were then asked to read an extract of a police intervention in an IPV case. The script was taken from a real Afghan police case of “family disputes” dealt with by the Family Response Unit (FRU).</p>
<p>The case was about a phone call the police received by the mother of an alleged victim asking police to intervene because her son-in-law was severely beating her daughter and she was afraid about what he could do to her. Once the police arrived at the home address, they found the daughter crying, with clear signs of severe physical abuse on different parts of her body. She was covered with blood and bruises. The alleged perpetrator minimized what had being going on and told the police to leave his home because those were private matters. The script went on describing that the police brought the woman into another room and asked her what had happened. She told the officers that her husband was furious because she came back home later than usual, and he accused her of having dishonored him and of committing adultery and started beating her up with his hands and feet and by throwing a chair at her. The woman also told the police that her husband was a very jealous person and that he had threatened to kill her due to the honor he had to protect and his strong suspicions about her behavior.</p>
<p>Next, the victim’s behavior was manipulated between subjects. Half of the participants randomly read that the victim then admitted to the police that she had an affair with another man (admitting infidelity condition) while the other half of the participants did not receive this additional information (not admitting infidelity condition). This manipulation was verbally checked at the end of the compilation of the questionnaire. Participants were asked individually to recall whether the victim had admitted or not to an affair with another man and provided their answers using the options <italic>Yes, No</italic>, or <italic>I don’t remember</italic>. All participants remembered well the victim’s behavior. Our manipulation was understood as we designed it.</p>
<p>Respondents were then asked to evaluate this episode in terms of severity, in order to subsequently control for their own a priori evaluations of this episode. Thus, they were asked to indicate to what extent they considered the depicted episode severe on a scale ranging from 1 (<italic>absolutely not</italic>) to 9 (<italic>absolutely</italic>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1368430212462492">
<title>Dependent variables</title>
<p>Participant’s <italic>attitude towards VAW</italic>, measured as <italic>justification of VAW</italic>, was assessed by means of two items. Participants were asked to express their agreement with the following sentences: “If a woman betrays her husband, he is right to beat her,” and “I can understand that a man wants to kill his wife if she commits adultery,” on a scale ranging from 1 (a<italic>bsolutely not</italic>) to 9 (<italic>absolutely</italic>). The mean of the two items was considered as a measure of participant’s justification of VAW (<italic>r</italic> = .43; <italic>p</italic>  &lt;.001), so that the higher the score, the more IPV is justified due to the woman’s not complying to her role. Given the content of the items, it is reasonable to consider this measure as a proxy of adherence to masculine honor beliefs.</p>
<p>Next the willingness of police to intervene in support of the victim was assessed by asking them to indicate to what extent they would themselves engage in each of three specific intervention actions (“Arrest the alleged perpetrator,” “Tell the victim to report what happed to the police,” and “Look for more legal evidence to help the victim”; alpha = .60), on a scale ranging from 1 (<italic>not at all</italic>) to 9 (<italic>absolutely</italic>). Responses were averaged to construct a single measure indicating officers’ willingness to intervene in favor of the victim.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<sec id="section12-1368430212462492">
<title>Preliminary analyses</title>
<p>No significant gender differences emerged, due to small female sample size. Data were therefore collapsed across gender in all the subsequent analyses. Analyses conducted, excluding from the sample the few police women, did not show significant differences. Therefore we retained the female participants in the subsequent analyses.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1368430212462492">
<title>Data analyses</title>
<p>In order to ascertain whether the admission (vs. no admission) of infidelity influences police officers’ justification of VAW, as well as their willingness to intervene in favor of the victim of the IPV episode, we carried out two analyses of covariance (ANCOVA), with condition varying between participants. Participants’ a priori evaluation of the IPV episode in terms of judgment of severity was covaried out, in order to control for individual differences.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1368430212462492">
<title>Justification of VAW</title>
<p>The ANCOVA showed a significant effect of condition, <italic>F</italic>(1, 104) = 5.78, <italic>p</italic> = .02, <sub>partial</sub>η<sup>2</sup> = .05. Inspection of means indicates that participants have more lenient attitudes towards VAW, justifying IPV in infidelity cases in the condition where the victim had admitted adultery (<italic>M</italic> = 6.89; <italic>SD</italic> = 1.52) than when she had not admitted it (<italic>M</italic> = 6.20; <italic>SD</italic> = 1.85).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-1368430212462492">
<title>Willingness to intervene in favor of the victim</title>
<p>Similarly, the ANCOVA showed a significant effect of condition on the willingness of police to intervene in favor of the victim, <italic>F</italic>(1, 104) = 5.78, <italic>p</italic> = .02, <sub>partial</sub>η<sup>2</sup> = .05. Participants were more willing to intervene in favor of the victim in the no-infidelity condition (<italic>M</italic> = 3.38; <italic>SD</italic> = 2.22) than in the infidelity condition (<italic>M</italic> = 2.51; <italic>SD</italic> = 1.66).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-1368430212462492">
<title>Mediation analysis</title>
<p>In order to test whether police’s willingness to intervene in favor of the victim of IPV was mediated by justification of VAW attitudes, we adopted the regression approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1368430212462492">Baron &amp; Kenny, 1986</xref>). The model is depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1368430212462492">Figure 1</xref>. Whether or not the victim had admitted her infidelity significantly strengthened participants’ justification of VAW, and reduced their willingness to intervene in favor of the victim. Justification of VAW predicted the willingness of the Afghan police to intervene in favor of the victim as well. Moreover, when condition and justification of VAW were entered simultaneously as predictors, the effect of justification of VAW remained significant, while the direct effect of condition was no longer reliable. A Sobel test (<italic>z</italic> = 1.86, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) confirmed that the reduction in the direct effect via justification of VAW was reliable.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In the current study we looked at how masculine honor beliefs influence attitudes towards violence against women providing several advances in the research field of masculine honor and violence, sexism, and intimate partner violence. In particular, we measured the effect adultery has in the development of more lenient attitudes about IPV among Afghan police officers, reducing their willingness to act according to what they are expected to do with reference to the legislation and their duties, meaning helping the victims and arresting the perpetrator.</p>
<p>The present findings showed that admission of adultery increases adherence to masculine honor beliefs: Police officers reported higher justification of intimate partner violence in terms of acceptance of violence when a woman betrayed her husband. Though police officers were confronted, in the experimental condition, with two types of crimes (adultery and IPV), one could expect, under Afghan law, that higher acceptance of VAW would be due to the victims’ violation of the norm (i.e., committing adultery), but if this was the case, police officers should have reported in such condition also higher negative attitudes towards the man who committed IPV (who also committed the crime), which is not what we found. The latter did not turn out to be true.</p>
<p>This lenient attitude towards intimate partner violence—that is, justifying the violence against the victim if her behavior did not conform to her gender role—reduced the reported willingness to intervene in favor of the IPV victim (e.g., by arresting the perpetrator of IPV or by helping the victim to report what had happed to the police or to further investigate the case and collect evidence against the perpetrator).</p>
<p>With the present study, we confirmed that the rule of law (i.e., punishment according to the crime committed) is subject to the influence of the masculine honor beliefs when female behaviors threaten masculine honor. To restore masculine honor, IPV is still seen as an acceptable mean. Though we are inclined to consider IPV as universal, it finds a more fertile terrain in male-based cultures of honor for being applied and justified even by those who are charged with enforcement of the official law of the state, that is, the police.</p>
<p>These results are unique and explain the role of masculine honor in facilitating, justifying, or even causing IPV or femicide and shed light on the influence of masculine culture of honoring and expectations of female roles. Results are in line with what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1368430212462492">van Eck (2003)</xref> explains about honor killings: that if a woman’s behavior and attitudes “offend” her husband, then the norm of masculine honor prevails over the law and its rules, to the extent that police themselves will refrain from carrying out their functions and make biased decisions. In Afghan legislative provisions, honor killing is not legal as such, but it is dealt with as a much less severe crime compared to any other murder. The maximum a man can be sentenced is 2 years in prison (Article 398, Afghan Penal Code 1376; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1368430212462492">Republic of Afghanistan, 1976</xref>). This is a reflection of a reality in a country where gender roles are still based on a strong male-based culture of honor where two “laws” seem to exist: the rule of law based on what the criminal code states and which the police should conform to and the informal masculine honor code, which affects the attitudes and responses of those in charge of providing help and support to victims.</p>
<p>This study shows that even the rule of law can be shaped and influenced by a “supreme” value such as honor, but in the case being described, it is masculine honor, which exists for the sake of self-serving male status and the use of power, control and violence to put women back in their status quo place. If a woman does not comply with a cultural and socially submissive role, her resistance can even be seen as <italic>authorizing</italic> a man who holds condemning attitudes about adultery to use or accept the use of violence.</p>
<p>This study has further shown that masculine honor beliefs, measured as lenient attitudes towards VAW, are not only emotional reactions to honor violation (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1368430212462492">Rodriguez Mosquera et al., 2002b</xref>), but they can even be used as an excuse to justify—or at least, not to condemn—violence in an intimate relationship. Women are considered as property and have no power or control over their lives: “punishment” through violence is the only acceptable outcome (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1368430212462492">Vandello &amp; Cohen, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>The relevance of the present study is not only about understanding the role of masculine honor in cases of intimate partner violence. It also relies on the fact that this experimental study has been conducted in Afghanistan, where masculine honor has a relevant function in defining the roles of women, and we have proven that this still is true among police officers whose role should be independent of the influence of any cultural, stereotypical beliefs that are in conflict with the law. The function of the rule of law and its relevance for the democracy of a country is undermined explicitly and overtly; this can be inferred also from the fact that even the police subvert the law because of these male honor-based norms.</p>
<p>The present study has some limitations, one being that to measure masculine honor culture we could have used a more extensive and direct measure. We decided, instead, to use a proxy, such as attitudes towards VAW in terms of justification of violence, in order to slightly circumvent socially desirability effects. Future studies should be designed to more directly assess masculine honor beliefs. In addition, it would have been of interest to look at gender differences, but this was a very difficult sample to recruit, given that the presence of women in Afghan police forces is around 5%.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding these possible limitations, these findings are valuable for any prevention strategies of IPV and ultimately of honor killings. Respect for religion, traditions, and differences is essential, but the challenging path is that of reestablishing the function and meaning of the rule of law for the sake of democracy and human rights. IPV committed in the name of masculine honor needs to be considered a misogynist attitude used to reaffirm male supremacy in a male-dominated society.</p>
<p>We consider the nature of the sample examined (i.e., real police officers), the setting in which it was examined (i.e., Afghanistan) and the realistic nature of the focal situation (i.e., using a real Afghan police case in which police had to decide whether or not to intervene in favor of a victim of IPV) as strong points of this research. Compared to many laboratory simulations, the format and the real, applied context in which participants completed these measures make the results highly relevant and shed further light on the understanding of IPV and prevention strategies. It would be of great interest, in future studies, to compare these results with ones obtained from police in the West, to see whether masculine honor-based cultures are in fact linked to the southern culture of honor of the USA and to Afghan culture, where the masculine honor code prevails over the rule of law, or whether sexism, IPV, and the modern forms of honor killing (also called “passion crimes or crimes of jealousy”) have to do with manhood regardless of cultures and latitudes. Social, cultural, or even religious contexts, as well as individual characteristics, might influence the occurrence and recidivism of IPV, but when it comes to gender roles and sexism, women are and will still be expected to conform to their roles. Not conforming to these roles and sexism expectations has a price. Men and women are affected by what education, culture, and values pass on, and this enables the maintenance of submissive women’s roles. Why is it that the code of masculine honor, which is so old, is still so deeply penetrating many aspects of our societies and relationships? A lot still remains to be done, meaning that the problem of IPV and femicide is much more rooted in all cultures than what we might expect or admit. It has to be confronted and dealt with in the contexts of mass media, education, health, and law enforcement.</p>
