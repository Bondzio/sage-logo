<abstract>
<p>We performed a cross-sectional study in 450 nonreferred preschool children aged 4 to 6 years to assess the association between hyperactivity/inattention with adiposity and lifestyle characteristics. Measurements included scores of hyperactivity/inattention, adiposity, objectively measured physical activity, television viewing, and eating habits. Higher scores of hyperactivity/inattention were associated with lower percentage body fat, higher levels of physical activity, and less time spent in sedentary activity (all <italic>P </italic>≤ .01). However, higher scores of hyperactivity/inattention were also associated with more television viewing and less healthy eating habits (all <italic>P </italic>≤ .04). Except for some selected eating habits (<italic>P </italic>≥ .07), those relationships remained significant after adjustment for age, sex, and sociodemographic confounders. To conclude, higher scores of hyperactivity/inattention are linked to different lifestyle characteristics that may in part contribute to a future development of overweight/obesity. Precise mechanisms explaining these associations and possible preventive approaches should be further investigated.</p>

<body>
<p>Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common mental disorders in children<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0883073811428009">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0883073811428009">2</xref>
</sup> and is characterized by persistent patterns of inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity that cause impairment in at least 2 settings (eg, school and home).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0883073811428009">3</xref>
</sup> While ADHD is usually diagnosed in school-aged children, increasing awareness has led to its diagnosis in preschoolers as well, and surprisingly, it was even found that younger children had higher ADHD severity.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0883073811428009">4</xref>
</sup> Nearly 70% of the children in this large study had comorbidities, more commonly oppositional defiant disorder, communication disorders, and anxiety disorders, demonstrating a significant burden already at this young age.</p>
<p>Several studies in school-aged children with ADHD found a higher prevalence of overweight/obesity compared with the general population<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0883073811428009">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0883073811428009">6</xref>
</sup> especially when nonmedicated.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0883073811428009">7</xref>
</sup> It has been suggested that impulsivity in terms of poor self-regulation and increased reward sensitivity may lead to overeating, and to an increased consumption of fatty and sweet foods that have a great rewarding value.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0883073811428009">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0883073811428009">9</xref>
</sup> This, in turn, could increase the risk for overweight/obesity in children with ADHD.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0883073811428009">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0883073811428009">10</xref>
</sup> However, only a few studies had specifically assessed the scores of hyperactivity/inattention with other eating habits such as soft drinks, fruit, and vegetables.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0883073811428009">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0883073811428009">11</xref>
</sup> Moreover, data regarding preschool children are scarce.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0883073811428009">12</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Alongside nutritional behavior and eating habits related to impulsivity, other aspects of adiposity-related lifestyle characteristics include physical activity and television viewing. Although hyperactivity represents one of the major criteria for diagnosis of ADHD, empirical evidence regarding their physical activity is scarce and hardly any studies have investigated their physical activity with objective measures. There is only one previous study, in 24 boys aged 6 to 12 years, demonstrating higher levels of physical activity in those with ADHD compared with controls, but the study did not investigate if these children presented with different physical activity patterns or intensities.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0883073811428009">13</xref>
</sup> Furthermore, cross-sectional and longitudinal studies found that higher television watching at preschool age was associated with higher levels of ADHD symptoms,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0883073811428009">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0883073811428009">15</xref>
</sup> while studies in older children and adolescents did not show such associations.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0883073811428009">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0883073811428009">17</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>To our knowledge, no single study has investigated the association between hyperactivity/inattention with adiposity and different lifestyle characteristics in younger children. Therefore, our objective was to assess the relationship between scores of hyperactivity/inattention and adiposity measures such as body mass index (BMI) and body fat, as well as objectively measured physical activity, television viewing, and various eating habits in nonreferred preschool children.</p>

<title>Design and Participants</title>
<p>Baseline data from the Ballabeina study (clinicaltrials.gov NCT00674544) were collected in late summer of 2008 and used for this current analysis. The study randomly selected 40 preschool classes from adjacent residential areas, with a high migrant prevalence (ie, ≥ 40.0%), in 2 Swiss cantons representing the French and German part of Switzerland. The detailed methodological process had been reported previously.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0883073811428009">18</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Of the initial 727 preschool children, 655 consented (participation rate: 90.1%). Of those, 450 children had complete data for all variables studied and were included in the current analysis. Children with and without complete data differed in the prevalence of migrant parents (69.3% vs 82.3%, respectively, <italic>P</italic> = .001) and low-educated parents (35.6% vs 47.9%, respectively, <italic>P</italic> = .01) as well as in hyperactivity/inattention scores (3.2 ± 2.0 vs 3.6 ± 2.1, respectively, <italic>P</italic> = .04) but not in age, sex, and BMI (all <italic>P</italic> ≥ .08).</p>

</sup> According to their place of birth, we grouped migrant parents into the five following regions: Portugal, former Yugoslavia, rest of Europe (Germany, France, Spain, Italy, and Turkey), Africa, and rest of the world. Parents were defined as “migrants” if at least 1 of them was born outside of Switzerland<sup>

<title>Adiposity</title>
<p>Adiposity measures included BMI and percentage body fat. Standing height was determined using a mobile scale and body weight was measured using an electronic scale (Seca, Basel, Switzerland; accuracy 0.05 kg) to calculate BMI. The participants' weight status was then established by the Swiss national percentiles,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0883073811428009">26</xref>
</sup> as national percentiles are known to be more sensitive than the international ones.<sup>

</sup> According to the Swiss national percentiles, normal weight was defined as BMI &lt;90th percentile for age and sex, and overweight/obesity was defined as BMI ≥90th and obesity as BMI ≥97th percentile for age and sex. Percentage body fat was used as measure of body fat, and was measured by a 4-polar single-frequency bioelectrical impedance device (Model 101A; RJL Systems, Detroit, Michigan), based on a formula previously validated in a comparable population: Lean mass = [(0.77 × gender) + (0.46 × age) + (0.32 × weight) + (0.41 × height<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0883073811428009">2</xref>

</sup> This interval was shown to be adequate to detect the spontaneous activities of preschool children.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0883073811428009">29</xref>
</sup> Participants were instructed to wear the accelerometers around the hip during 5 consecutive days. Validity was defined as at least 3 days of recording (2 weekdays and 1 day on the weekend),<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0883073811428009">30</xref>
</sup> with a minimum of 6 hours per day. The validity of wearing the accelerometer for 6 hours per day was highly correlated with 10-hour validity in this population (n = 502, <italic>r</italic> = .92, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001, unpublished observations). Data from monitored days were extrapolated to get a daily average by weighing weekdays and weekends [(5 + 2)/7]. Sequences of at least 10 minutes of consecutive zero values were removed and interpreted as accelerometer not worn.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0883073811428009">31</xref>
</sup> Total physical activity was expressed as counts per minute, divided by mean daily wearing time of 10.8 ± 1.2 hours. Time spent in moderate-vigorous, vigorous, and sedentary activity was defined as the number of epochs (15-second intervals) per hour spent in activities of ≥420 counts, ≥842 counts, and ≤25 counts, respectively.<sup>

<p>Eating habits were assessed using a semiqualitative food frequency questionnaire, validated in an identical population within the same study regions.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0883073811428009">19</xref>
</sup> For the analysis of the questionnaire, all the response options were recoded as daily frequencies, and the answers to the respective items were summed up to correspond to the 5 recommendations and their components, as developed by the Swiss Society of Nutrition.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0883073811428009">33</xref>
</sup> These 5 recommendations were based on factors implicated in childhood obesity: (1) “Drink water” (aimed at drinking water and decreasing sweetened drinks), (2) “Eat fruit and vegetables” (aimed at increasing eating fruits and vegetables), (3) “Eat regularly” (aimed at eating meals regularly), (4) “Make clever choices” (aimed at reducing fatty and sweet foods), and (5) “Turn your screen off when you eat” (aimed at reducing the intake of meals and snacks in front of television).</p>

<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>Statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS version 16.0 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, Illinois) and Stata 10.1 (Statacorp, College Station, Texas). Data were summarized as mean ± standard deviation (SD) for normally distributed variables and as median (interquartile range) for skewed variables. Differences between children with and without complete data were calculated using linear or logistic regression analyses with preschool class (cluster) as random factor. Linear regression analyses were performed with adiposity, physical activity, television viewing, and eating habits as the outcome and scores of hyperactivity/inattention as the predictor variables and with preschool class as random factor. Differences in scores of hyperactivity/inattention between normal weight and overweight/obese children were tested by mixed linear regressions. Analyses were also adjusted for sex, age, sociolinguistic region (French and German part of Switzerland), and parental migrant status and educational level as potential confounders. For children and parents, both sexes were pooled for simplicity. Interaction between levels of hyperactivity/inattention and age and sex was also tested.

<title>Hyperactivity/Inattention and Adiposity and Lifestyle Characteristics</title>
<p>Higher scores of hyperactivity/inattention were not associated with BMI and these scores did not differ between normal weight, overweight, and obese children (<italic>P</italic> = .980, data not shown). However, higher scores of hyperactivity/inattention were associated with lower percentage body fat, higher levels of total physical activity, more time spent in moderate-vigorous and vigorous activity, and less time spent in sedentary activity (all <italic>P</italic> ≤ .01, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0883073811428009">Table 2</xref>). The association between scores of hyperactivity/inattention and percentage body fat was attenuated after adjustment for levels of total physical activity (β coefficient, –0.25; 95% confidence interval [CI], –0.47 to –0.04; <italic>P</italic> = .02). Concerning physical activity, an increase of 1 in the score of hyperactivity/inattention was associated with a mean increase in 9 counts per minute. For example, the mean levels of total physical activity were 698.9 ± 163.2 counts per minute in children presenting the lowest scores (scores 0-2) and were 732.2 ± 193.6 counts per minute in children presenting the highest scores (scores 8-10). Higher scores of hyperactivity/inattention were also associated with more television viewing and less healthy eating habits, such as lower fruit and vegetables consumption and more frequent snacking in front of television (all <italic>P</italic> ≤ .04). After adjustment for age, sex, sociolinguistic region, and parental migrant status and educational level, all differences remained significant, except those for consumption of fruit and vegetables (both <italic>P</italic> ≥ .07). No interactions were found between scores of hyperactivity/inattention and age or sex.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study examined the association between scores of hyperactivity/inattention and adiposity, objectively measured physical activity, television viewing, and selected eating habits in a population of nonreferred preschool-aged children. Our results demonstrate a continuous association between scores of hyperactivity/inattention and several lifestyle characteristics in this relatively unstudied population. They also provide important information that can assist in minimizing adverse lifestyle habits in children with ADHD.</p>
<p>With respect to the hyperactivity/inattention questionnaire scores, the mean scores seen in our study were similar to those reported in other nonreferred samples of older children and adolescents<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0883073811428009">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0883073811428009">35</xref>
</sup> but lower than those reported in clinical samples.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0883073811428009">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0883073811428009">37</xref>
</sup> This is somewhat in contrast to previous observations that ADHD symptoms are more severe in younger children,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0883073811428009">4</xref>
</sup> but the use of different assessment tools prohibits a direct comparison.</p>
<p>Higher scores of hyperactivity/inattention were not associated with either BMI or weight status, but with lower percentage body fat. These findings are in contrast to those of 2 studies<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0883073811428009">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0883073811428009">6</xref>
</sup> in older children with ADHD that show a higher prevalence of overweight/obesity but in agreement with others.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0883073811428009">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0883073811428009">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0883073811428009">39</xref>
</sup> A possible reason for the discrepancies between these former studies is that specific lifestyle characteristics that influence body weight and composition were not assessed. Our results are nevertheless in accordance with those of a previous study on children aged 3 to 5 years that demonstrated a similar prevalence of overweight in children with ADHD compared with the general population.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0883073811428009">12</xref>
</sup> Regarding body composition, our findings are also similar to those from a former study in 7-year-old boys that showed lower levels of skinfold thickness in hyperactive compared with nonhyperactive boys.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0883073811428009">40</xref>
</sup> Another important issue is that the children in our study were nonmedicated and were thus unaffected by the potential adverse effects of common stimulant medications such as weight loss and reduced appetite.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0883073811428009">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0883073811428009">42</xref>
</sup> Therefore, the lower percentage body fat could be partly explained by the higher levels of physical activity of children with higher scores of hyperactivity/inattention. Indeed, the association identified between scores of hyperactivity/inattention and percentage body fat was attenuated after adjustment for levels of total physical activity. Additional longitudinal studies could help define the role of physical activity in the relationship between ADHD and body composition. The identified association between scores of hyperactivity/inattention and levels of activity in our study confirms data from a prior research in 24 boys aged 6 to 12 years, where boys with ADHD were objectively more active than controls.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0883073811428009">13</xref>
</sup> Therefore, it appears that hyperactivity does not only involve an increase in fidgeting movements, but it is also associated with increased general, large-scale motor activity. Our study population was much larger in size and included both boys and girls. Concordant with our findings, resting energy expenditure of 69 boys aged 8 to 14 years was greater in those with ADHD compared with controls.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0883073811428009">6</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Regarding physical inactivity and sedentary behavior, higher scores of hyperactivity/inattention were also associated with higher television viewing time. This is in agreement with a previous cross-sectional research in preschool children, where television watching was associated with levels of ADHD symptoms<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0883073811428009">15</xref>
</sup> while such an association was not found in older children.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0883073811428009">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0883073811428009">17</xref>
</sup> A longitudinal study reported that hours of television viewed per day at ages 1 and 3 years were associated with higher levels of ADHD symptoms at age 7.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0883073811428009">14</xref>
</sup> This may indicate that elevated levels of television may contribute to attention problems—or a reverse causality, where young children with ADHD symptoms favor television viewing. Indeed, watching television may occupy children with ADHD, and parents may therefore be more prone to allow it for longer periods of time.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0883073811428009">16</xref>
</sup> Television viewing is frequently used as a marker of sedentary behavior. However, in the current study using objective measures of sedentary activity, higher scores of hyperactivity/inattention were associated with less time spent in sedentary activity. Therefore, care should be taken when using television time as a general surrogate for sedentary behavior in this specific population. This discrepancy between television watching time and sedentarism measurements can be explained by the frequent observations that young children with ADHD symptoms might be less calm and continuously fidget during television watching.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0883073811428009">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0883073811428009">43</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>The only independent association between scores of hyperactivity/inattention and eating habits was found for snacking in front of television. Higher total television viewing time could partially explain this relationship. When snacking in front of television, mostly palatable food is consumed.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0883073811428009">44</xref>
</sup> These usually fatty and sweet foods can also have a rewarding value.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0883073811428009">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0883073811428009">9</xref>
</sup> It has been suggested that impulsivity in terms of poor self-regulation and increased reward sensitivity may indeed lead to an increased consumption of fatty and sweet foods.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0883073811428009">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0883073811428009">9</xref>
</sup> However, when specifically investigating the intake of fatty and sweet foods, we did not find a direct association with scores of hyperactivity/inattention in our young children. The identified association between higher scores of hyperactivity/inattention with lower consumption of fruit and vegetables was mediated by parental education. It is known that parental education contributes to children’s food choices<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0883073811428009">45</xref>
</sup> and that ADHD is more common in children of parents with low education.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0883073811428009">46</xref>
</sup> It is possible that in preschool children impulsivity does not yet affect food choices as they are mainly under parental control. It could also be that at this age differences in food choices are too small to clearly detect such an influence. This is in part confirmed by a prior study in preschool boys that found no differences in nutrient intake between children with and without ADHD<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0883073811428009">47</xref>
</sup> and could also explain the lack of increase in adiposity in this age group.</p>
<p>The present work has some limitations. First, its cross-sectional design limits the assessment of cause-effect relationships. Second, the SDQ inattention/hyperactivity subscale cannot establish a formal diagnosis of ADHD. Nevertheless, it is a brief and validated screening tool to assess levels of hyperactivity/inattention, with a high sensitivity prediction for diagnosis of any hyperkinetic disorder (ICD-10) or ADHD (<italic>DSM-IV</italic>) in 5- to 10-year-old children.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0883073811428009">25</xref>
</sup> A third limitation is that the subscale was completed only by the parents/legal representatives, who have few opportunities to observe their child within the classroom. Indeed, it has been shown that the SDQ prediction works best when it has been completed by both parents/legal representatives and teachers.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0883073811428009">25</xref>
</sup> However, most previous studies in young children have only used parental/legal representatives’ reports to define scores of hyperactivity/inattention.</p>
<p>The main strengths of this study include a comprehensive assessment of adiposity and lifestyle characteristics and their relationship to scores of hyperactivity/inattention, in a relatively large general population of unselected and nonmedicated preschool children from both sexes. It also adds knowledge about different physical activity patterns according to scores of hyperactivity/inattention in young children. Another strength is the adjustment for sociodemographic confounders, which have not been controlled for in many previous studies.</p>
<p>In conclusion, this study showed that higher scores of hyperactivity/inattention in preschoolers were not associated with BMI or weight status but did correlate with lower percentage body fat. They were also associated with higher levels of total and more time spent in intense physical activity, less time spent in sedentary activity, higher television viewing time, lower fruit and vegetables intake, and more frequent snacking in front of the television. Thus, we found that higher scores of hyperactivity/inattention are linked to different lifestyle characteristics that work in opposite directions of weight gain or loss. The future development of overweight/obesity in an individual child could be dependent, at least in part, on whichever factors that prevail. The precise mechanisms of rewarding that may explain the continuous association between scores of hyperactivity/inattention, levels of physical activity, television viewing and eating habits, as well as possible preventive approaches should be further investigated.</p>
