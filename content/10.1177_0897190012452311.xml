<abstract>
<p>Objective: The purpose of this study was to conduct a random continuing professional development (CPD) portfolio audit to assess the portfolios of pharmacists who completed CPD training in the state of North Carolina and reported adopting it in place of the annual 15-hour continuing education (CE) requirement when applying for re-licensure. Methods: The NC Board of Pharmacy (NCBOP) staff randomly selected 30 pharmacists to provide CPD portfolio documentation to the Board electronically or in paper format. This documentation included their completed learning plan, a learning activity worksheet for each completed activity, and the Accreditation Council on Pharmacy Education (ACPE) universal activity number for the CPD training program attended. The Task Force used a multicomponent audit tool to assess each portfolio. Results: Eighty percent of portfolios had at least 15 hours of learning reported. Portfolio assessments indicated an average of 5 learning objectives per individual. Based on the scale of 1 to 5, the <italic>Measurable</italic> and <italic>Specific</italic> sections of the objectives scored the lowest with an average score of 3 on both sections. An overall assessment of “adequate” or “comprehensive” was noted for 60% of the portfolios. Conclusion: Pharmacists completing CPD training are capable of following the CPD process with some potential challenges in documentation. Information submitted to the board of pharmacy is considered sufficient for license renewal purposes.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Health professionals must maintain their competence in today’s environment of ever-emerging data, improved knowledge of disease states, and advancing technology. The nearly universal requirement for some form of continuing education (CE) across the health professions is evidence of the importance of maintaining current knowledge and skills. In the past two decades, the ability of the status quo, in the form of CE, to accomplish this goal has come into question.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0897190012452311">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0897190012452311"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0897190012452311">3</xref>
</sup> While the CE model has value, continuing professional development (CPD), a more proactive means of maintaining competence based on self-identified learning needs and goals, has greater potential to advance the knowledge and skills practitioners apply in caring for their patients.</p>
<p>Within the profession of pharmacy, the current CPD model stems from a framework described by Rouse in his article, “Continuing professional development in pharmacy.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0897190012452311">4</xref>
</sup> Importantly, while CPD represents an approach to maintaining currency and progressing pharmacy practice, it is not mutually exclusive of traditional CE, as CE is inclusive within the CPD model.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0897190012452311">4</xref>
</sup> CPD places significant responsibility on the individual practitioner to focus their CE and other learning activities.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0897190012452311">4</xref>
</sup> In his seminal publication, Rouse writes, “CPD is designed to be self-directed, practitioner-centered, and outcomes-based to meet the specific goals and objectives of individual pharmacists, ultimately improving patient and public health outcomes.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0897190012452311">4</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>The 4 stages, <italic>reflect</italic>, <italic>plan</italic>, <italic>act</italic>, and <italic>evaluate</italic>, make up the CPD cycle. The additional process of <italic>documentation</italic>, in the form of a professional portfolio, links these 4 stages.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0897190012452311">4</xref>
</sup>
<sup>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0897190012452311">5</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>A recent study evaluating the impact of a CPD approach adopted by pharmacists for 10 months suggests that the CPD approach may result in increased positive changes to patient care due to educational activities when compared to the traditional CE approach.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0897190012452311">6</xref>
</sup> Additionally, pharmacists who were randomized to the CPD intervention were significantly more likely to report that educational activities undertaken within the 10-month period “enhanced professional knowledge” or “enhanced professional skills.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0897190012452311">6</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Other countries have formally adopted the CPD framework as a condition for re-registration or re-licensure.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0897190012452311">7</xref>
</sup> The Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain (RPSGB) first experimented with the CPD model in 1998, and now utilizes a mandatory “Plan and Record” framework. All pharmacists must keep an electronic or hard copy CPD portfolio.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0897190012452311">7</xref>
</sup>
<sup>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0897190012452311">8</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>New Zealand also experimented with a voluntary CPD pilot program in 2001. CPD was broadly implemented on a volunteer basis in 2005 and became mandatory in 2006.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0897190012452311">7</xref>
</sup> The Pharmaceutical Society of New Zealand (PSNZ) CPD program (ENHANCE) is unique in that credits are not allocated on the traditional hours of activity. Instead, pharmacists obtain credit for CPD activities by responding to a series of questions within a “CPD Record.” Questions are divided into 4 sections: reflection, planning, action, and outcomes. These sections address each of the major components of the CPD cycle, including documentation of goals, intended activities, completed activities, achievement of goals, areas for further improvement, and impact on practice.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0897190012452311">9</xref>
</sup> Credits are based on the outcome an educational experience had on a pharmacist’s practice. A scale rubric with guidelines assists pharmacists in assigning credits to educational experiences.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0897190012452311">7</xref>
</sup> The <italic>Outcome Credit Scale</italic> created by the Pharmacy Council of New Zealand (PCNZ) assigns ENHANCE CPD credits based on relevance, application to practice, benefits to patients, and evidence of implementation.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0897190012452311">10</xref>
</sup> Every year, the PCNZ audits 20% of its registered pharmacists. Selected pharmacists submit to the PCNZ their CPD record sheets for the 3-year period prior to the audit date.</p>
<p>Following the framework of the ENHANCE program and PSNZ requirements, the New Zealand Defense Force (NZDF) Pharmaceutical Management Group (PMG) has developed a standard operating procedure for peer auditing of pharmacist portfolios. In addition to complying with all ENHANCE program requirements, NZDF pharmacists select 2 peers and to whom they submit their CPD documentation. By following a CPD audit process algorithm, peer reviewers evaluate the individual pharmacist’s CPD record. Record evaluation involves briefly addressing each of the 9 questions which focus on relevance to practice, achievement of learning outcomes, incorporation into practice, and broad applicability. Reviewers who find a pharmacist’s documentation to be complete and appropriate return the record sheets with their endorsement and assignment of specific outcome credits. If documentation is deficient, reviewers recommend changes to be made and request resubmission for additional review (written electronic personal communication, NZDF, July 2011).</p>
<p>Australia adopted the CPD model in pharmacy practice in July 2010. The Pharmacy Board of Australia defines CPD as, “the means by which members of the profession continue to maintain, improve and broaden their knowledge, expertise and competence, and develop the personal and professional qualities required throughout their professional lives.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0897190012452311">11</xref>
</sup> The Australian CPD process and credit system is very similar to the New Zealand process, with an objective method of quantifying multiple means of professional education and skill development.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0897190012452311">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0897190012452311">13</xref>
</sup> The Australian model is based on documented, incremental “building blocks,” with 1 CPD credit/hour obtained for accessing information without assessment, 2 credits/hour for improved knowledge or skill with assessment, and 3 credits/hour for facilitating and documenting quality or practice improvement. The initial requirement during 2011 is 20 credits, but planning is in place to increase the requirement to 40 credits by 2013.</p>
<p>Ontario, Canada, also has adopted a CPD framework for pharmacists. Pharmacists are classified according to whether or not they are active in direct patient care (providing pharmacy services directly to the public with a minimum of 600 working hours in the last 3 years). Regardless of classification, all pharmacists are required to maintain a portfolio that demonstrates lifelong learning.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0897190012452311">7</xref>
</sup> This portfolio can be requested for review at any time by the Ontario College of Pharmacists.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0897190012452311">14</xref>
</sup> Pharmacists classified as active in direct patient care must participate in a practice review process at least once every 5 years.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0897190012452311">14</xref>
</sup> The practice review process involves reporting of CE activities completed within the CPD framework and a self-assessment of learning needs. A smaller portion of pharmacists within the practice review process are required to take an open book test of clinical knowledge, participate in standardized patient interviews, and attend an hour-long course on CPD and the professional portfolio.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0897190012452311">14</xref>
</sup> If pharmacists receive an unsatisfactory score during the practice review process, they receive remedial assistance and are reassessed.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0897190012452311">14</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Currently, within the United States, all 50 state boards of pharmacy have set minimum CE hour requirements which must be met for pharmacists to maintain the licensure. The requirements vary from state to state and commonly include further restrictions on activity format or mandatory content requirements.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0897190012452311">15</xref>
</sup> While the CPD model has not yet been widely implemented within the country, it has garnered significant support from pharmacy’s professional organizations.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0897190012452311">16</xref>
</sup> Also, pharmacy educators, strongly encouraged by the Accreditation Council on Pharmacy Education (ACPE), have widely adopted the tenets of CPD and require its application by faculty and preceptors.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0897190012452311">17</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>In 2006, Indiana, Iowa, North Carolina, Washington, and Wisconsin enrolled small cohorts of pharmacists in a voluntary CPD pilot project. The study demonstrated that pharmacists who adopted a CPD approach were more likely to identify strengths and weaknesses through the use of a structured self-assessment tool, development of SMART (specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, timed) goals, and participation in CE activities that helped achieve a predetermined objective.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0897190012452311">16</xref>
</sup> Study results also indicated that increased time requirements for the CPD model may be a significant hindrance to model implementation.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0897190012452311">6</xref>
</sup>
<sup>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0897190012452311">18</xref>
</sup> To offset this, a condensed training model was designed and adopted to help train pharmacists in North Carolina and throughout the United States.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0897190012452311">19</xref>
</sup> In 2009, North Carolina adopted the CPD model as an option to the traditional 15-hour per year CE requirement necessary for license renewal.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0897190012452311">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0897190012452311">21</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>A recent literature search of the pharmacy literature showed a paucity of information regarding methods of evaluation of pharmacists’ CPD portfolios. A gap exists regarding the evaluation of pharmacists’ abilities to meet the goals of the CPD model for purposes of board license renewal.</p>
<sec id="section2-0897190012452311">
<title>Objective</title>
<p>The purpose of this study was to conduct a random CPD portfolio audit to assess the portfolios of pharmacists who completed CPD training in the state of North Carolina and reported adopting it in place of the annual 15-hour CE requirement when applying for re-licensure. Our specific aim was to learn on how well the end user was utilizing the information obtained during the training process in documenting their personal CPD.</p>

<sec id="section3-0897190012452311" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>Two years after extensive training, promotion, and implementation of the CPD option for satisfying the education requirements for pharmacist license renewal(<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0897190012452311">Appendix A</xref>), the NC Board of Pharmacy (NCBOP) approved this project and appointed a 3-member audit team to review submitted portfolios of randomly selected pharmacists. All 3 reviewers are registered pharmacists in North Carolina and clinical faculty at the University of North Carolina Eshelman School of Pharmacy. Two of the reviewers received CPD training by attending a 2006 live workshop for pilot state representatives hosted by the American College of Pharmacy Education in Chicago, Illinois. The third reviewer joined the CPD NC task force team after the CPD training had been completed and serves as the director of CE at the School. The goal was to accomplish a random sampling process similar to the entire state CE audit (2% of total pharmacists). All members of the audit team were very familiar with the CPD process. The team’s specific role was to compare the CPD participants’ compliance with the 4-step documentation method taught in the training program and secondarily to compare participants’ learning activities to the standard 15-hour required norm in the state of North Carolina.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0897190012452311">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0897190012452311"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0897190012452311">22</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Of the approximately 200 pharmacists selecting the CPD license renewal option for the 2010 calendar year, the NCBOP staff randomly selected 30 and requested that they provide their CPD portfolio documentation to the Board electronically or in paper format (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app2-0897190012452311">Appendix B</xref>).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0897190012452311">23</xref>
</sup> This documentation included their completed learning plan, a learning activity worksheet for each completed activity, and the ACPE universal activity number for the CPD training program attended.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0897190012452311">22</xref>
</sup> The NCBOP staff then presented these records to the CPD audit team.</p>
<p>The NC CPD task force used a multicomponent audit tool to assess each portfolio. One component was the previously published grading rubric applied during the pilot program to evaluate pharmacists’ learning objectives.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0897190012452311">24</xref>
</sup> Other components of the audit tool were adapted with permission from the Alberta College of Pharmacists and previously published.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0897190012452311">25</xref>
</sup> The audit team reviewed individual educational plans for learning goals, SMART learning objectives, learning activities utilized, resources used (home study, live workshop), begin and end dates, completion of goal, and quantity of hours engaged in the process. Each learning activity required completion of a learning activity worksheet documentation in the portfolio of what the individual learned, pertinence of the learning activity to an educational goal, and learning stimulus for the activity (Appendix B). The audit team rated learning objectives as <italic>satisfactory</italic> (5), <italic>work in progress</italic> (3), or <italic>unacceptable</italic> (1). Educational action plans were reviewed and scored on a 4-point scale: <italic>comprehensive</italic> (3), <italic>adequate</italic> (2), <italic>insufficient</italic> (1), or <italic>incomplete</italic> (0).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0897190012452311">25</xref>
</sup> The team also recorded the total number of hours spent in learning activities.</p>
<p>The audit team members assembled to assess the portfolios with plans to divide them equally for individual review, followed by group discussion to generate a consensus score. As the review began, each reviewer had multiple questions about each portfolio. The team decided to change the process to a group review of each portfolio. The team projected each portfolio on a large wall screen and assessed and scored each one simultaneously, while 1 reviewer recorded the scoring and comments. This new process proved more efficient, as it reduced the amount of time spent by each individual on a portfolio and allowed all reviewers to simultaneously question, comment, and agree on a final score. Upon completion of the team-based review, questions arose that required contacting the NCBOP to obtain further data. The team needed further information regarding whether or not the pharmacists had reported sufficient learning to warrant license renewal and if prior CPD training was completed. After incorporating these data into the scoring process, the team prepared an audit summary letter to be sent by the Board to each pharmacist, providing individualized feedback on the portfolio.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0897190012452311">
<title>Results</title>
<p>Out of the 30 randomly selected and audited individuals who reported using CPD in their license renewal, only 10 actually did so. These 10 pharmacists submitted their portfolios for audit team review. All except one of the participants in the audit had completed the required CPD training.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0897190012452311">22</xref>
</sup> One hundred percent (100%) of the submitted portfolios had at least 10 hours of learning reported to the Board and 80% had more than15 hours. Though from the cumulative portfolio and Board data it is difficult to determine the total number of learning hours for some individuals, the Board did not require any pharmacists to submit additional information. Based on the overall portfolio assessment, 60% had an overall assessment of “adequate” or “comprehensive” from the CPD audit standpoint (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0897190012452311">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<p>In this first year of CPD portfolio review in North Carolina, over 60% of pharmacists’ portfolios were judged “adequate” or “comprehensive.” In their report of a 5-year review of the combination CPD and direct assessment model within Ontario province, Austin and colleagues reported that “86% of practicing pharmacists were able to self-direct their professional development, while 14% required peer assistance.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0897190012452311">14</xref>
</sup> We cannot make direct comparisons between Ontario’s experience and ours; however, it would be interesting to see comparative data from their first year alone.</p>
<p>At this time, the NCBOP process involves a voluntary use of the CPD process. Our use of portfolios is also similar to the CPD process in Australia, Great Britain, and Canada. However, Ontario province remains unique in requiring randomly selected pharmacist from among those chosen for the annual practice review process to take an open book test of clinical knowledge, participate in standardized patient interviews, and attend an hour-long course on CPD and the professional portfolio.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0897190012452311">14</xref>
</sup> Though this practice likely provides a motivational stimulus for the province’s pharmacists to remain up to date, North Carolina did not adopt the same process, given the early stage of introducing CPD in the state and nation overall. Hopefully, introducing the concept and practice without the fear of negative consequence will garner interest and participation of an increasing number of pharmacists.</p>
<p>The North Carolina CPD process does not have an hourly requirement, though the NCBOP judged all 2010 selected participants to have met the state’s minimum CE requirements. The New Zealand and Australian models, both of which allocate credits depending on the type of activities undertaken and their potential impact, require documented evidence of learning and application. Our review process was similar to that of the NZDF, in that portfolios are reviewed by peers, but different as North Carolina pharmacists did not get to choose their reviewers. Our process also differed in that it focused on the pharmacist’s ability to follow the CPD process; writing SMART objectives, ability to act upon their plan and evaluate their learning, and, finally, provide evidence to substantiate the documented learning. During our audit process, the team mutually agreed upon each portfolio’s final assessment, recorded their findings, and submitted them to the NCBOP. This is similar to the NZDF PMG process, where peer reviewers evaluate each pharmacist’s submitted documentation, reach consensus, and record their results in the individual pharmacist’s portfolio. The 2 reviewers also sign the portfolios and submit them to the PCNZ as required for maintaining licensure.</p>
<p>Like in New Zealand and Australia, the North Carolina CPD process encourages pharmacists to utilize both accredited and nonaccredited learning opportunities to accomplish their goals. Unlike Australia, however, our process does not require a higher standard of documentation to show that the activities meet appropriate standards for CPD.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0897190012452311">12</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Lessons learned from voluntary pilot programs similar to ours may lead to widespread, mandatory CPD implementation within the profession of pharmacy. While the United States is far from mandatory CPD, future CPD portfolio audits in North Carolina will incorporate the lessons learned from this project into future training and policy statements. After reviewing the results of the audit project and CPD pilot project, the executive director of the NCBOP commented that “those pharmacists participating in the program were well trained in the program’s objectives and methods, had thoughtfully executed CPD plans, and benefitted substantially from participation.” These results further reinforced to the Board of Pharmacy that “CPD is a viable, and desirable, alternative to traditional continuing education programs.”</p>
<sec id="section6-0897190012452311">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>This project exposed several limitations to expanding CPD in North Carolina. The NCBOP CPD Web tool does not yet interface with the Board’s database and is not yet capable of hosting a large amount of documentation to support evidence of learning. This limited the amount of documents that participants could post for the review process, and as such, we had to rely on both electronic and paper documents for some of the reviews. The review process would have been easier if we had all documents for each participant in a particular format. Another limitation is that the total number of participants was small, though representative of a higher percentage of the usual random sampling process for the entire state CE audit (2% of total pharmacists).</p>
</sec>

<sec id="section7-0897190012452311">
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Pharmacists completing CPD training are capable of following the CPD process with some potential challenges in the documentation aspect. A system that will make submission of learning evidence is essential to continued success. Plans include an audit and more detailed instructions for the pharmacist who may be audited in the future.</p>
<p>The Australian and New Zealand models are admirable, as they require documented learning that positively impacts practice and ultimately, patient care, the goal of professional lifelong learning. Implementing a similar model in North Carolina would require significant change to its present model and likely increase cost of the process. However, such a change is worth careful consideration—our patients deserve it.</p>
