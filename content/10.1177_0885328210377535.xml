<abstract>
<p>The response of biomaterial surfaces when exposed to blood is in part dependent upon the nature and composition of the adsorbed layer of proteins. Surfaces passivated with albumin have been shown to reduce platelet adhesion and activation. In an attempt to develop surfaces that can selectively and specifically bind albumin, silicon-based surfaces were functionalized with linear peptides and chemical ligands that displayed an affinity for albumin. Peptide functionalized surfaces were observed to preferentially bind albumin when compared to human immunoglobulin and human fibrinogen, which possess low densities of surface adsorbed platelets. The platelet morphology was noted to be discoid on the peptide modified surface. Both the unmodified control and SCL functionalized surfaces had high densities of surface adhered platelets with spread out morphology. The peptide and SCL functionalized surfaces were noted to have no impact on PTT and PT clotting times, indicating that the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways were unperturbed by the surfaces generated.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0885328210377535" sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title>
<p>Contact of blood with a foreign surface triggers the activation of the coagulation cascade, and usually terminates with the formation of fibrous clots [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0885328210377535">1</xref>]. Various strategies have been developed to improve the blood compatibility and anti-thrombotic properties of implantable materials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0885328210377535">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0885328210377535">3</xref>]. The adsorption of plasma proteins are in part responsible for the transformation of the inert polymer to an active surface that initiates surface-induced thrombosis, which to a large extent depends on the properties and composition of the outer few atomic layers of a material [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0885328210377535">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0885328210377535">8</xref>]. The successful design of materials requires correlating the molecular events that occur at the interface with the underlying chemistry and hemocompatibility of the biomaterial. Fundamental progress resulting in the design of materials with improved hemocompatibility will be determined by understanding the interfacial phenomena, mainly the interaction of proteins and platelets with surfaces.</p>
<p>The exposure of biomaterial surfaces to blood often results in the competitive adsorption of plasma proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0885328210377535">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0885328210377535">10</xref>]. While higher levels of the surface adsorbed fibrinogen has been shown to correlate with the adhesion and aggregation of platelets on biomaterial surfaces, albuminated surfaces have been shown to minimize the adhesion of platelets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0885328210377535">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0885328210377535">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0885328210377535">17</xref>]. Thus, surface modification strategies to yield surface-coated or surface-adsorbed albumin have been developed to take advantage of the surface passivation effects of albumin coatings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0885328210377535">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0885328210377535">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0885328210377535">19</xref>]. Previous work has used straight chain 16- or 18-carbon alkyl chains, dextran, dextran-cibacron blue (CB) dye conjugate, and monoclonal antibodies specific to albumin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0885328210377535">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0885328210377535">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0885328210377535">20</xref>] to generate albumin-binding surfaces. In the present study, biomaterial surfaces displaying specific albumin-binding peptides or small chemical ligands were generated to confer <italic>in situ</italic> albumin-binding properties. These functionalized surfaces were shown to specifically interact with albumin over other serum proteins and possessed minimal adsorbed fibrinogen, as determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) and two-dimensional gel analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0885328210377535">21</xref>]. The focus of this article was to further evaluate the cellular and acellular aspects of the hemocompatibility of surfaces with <italic>in situ</italic> albumin-binding affinities. The impact of surface modification on the coagulation cascade was assessed via prothrombin time (PT), partial thromboplastin time (PTT), and thrombin time (TT) assays that measure relative contributions of the intrinsic and the extrinsic phase, respectively. Additionally, the adhesion of platelets to the surfaces prepared in this study was also determined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assays.</p>

<sec id="sec3-0885328210377535"><title>Reagents</title>
<p>Silicon (100) wafers, p-type, 2 inch diameter, one side polished with resistivity &lt; 0.01 was purchased from Polishing Corporation of America, (Santa Clara, CA). Hydrofluoric acid (ACS grade, 48–51%), nitric acid (NF grade, 20–70%), ethanol (ACS grade, 200 proof), methanol (anhydrous, 99.8%), isopropyl alcohol (molecular biology grade, &gt;99%), toluene (anhydrous, 99.8%), dimethylsulfoxide (molecular biology grade, ≥99.9%), 2,4,6-Tris (dimethylaminomethyl) phenol (denoted as SCL), and 1,4-Butanediyl diglycidyl ether (denoted as BUDGE) were obtained from Sigma (St. Louis, MO) and used as received. A Teflon beaker was used for all HF treatments. All rinsing steps in the experiments utilized deionized water with resistivity 18 MΩ-cm. 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES) was obtained from Gelest, Inc. (Morrisville, PA).</p>
<p>The peptides, denoted as LP1 (AEGTGDFWFCDRIAWYPQHLCEFLDPEGGGK) and LP2 (DRIAWYPQHLGGGK), were custom made from Sigma - Genosys (Spring, TX). 1-Ethyl-3-[3-dimethylaminopropyl]carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) and <italic>N</italic>-hydroxysulfosuccinimide (NHSS) were used to crosslink peptides to surface and were obtained from Pierce (Rockford, IL).</p>
<p>Human serum albumin (HAS) (A9511), <italic>In Vitro</italic> Toxicology Assay Kit: Lactic Dehydrogenase based (TOX 7) were purchased from Sigma (St.Louis, MO). Human serum was obtained from EquitechBio. Inc. (Kerrville, TX). Human blood was purchased in acid-citrate-dextrose (ACD) from Research Blood Component (Brighton, MA). Coagulation assay kits – Pacific Hemostasis PT reagents and Pacific Hemostasis Fibrinogen Assay reagents were obtained from Thermo Scientific (Waltham, MA). For PTT, rabbit brain cephalin purchased from Innovative Research (Novi, MI). A 0.025 M CaCl<sub>2</sub> was prepared to reverse the anticoagulant effect of ACD.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-0885328210377535"><title>Buffers</title>
<p>2-(<italic>N</italic>-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid (MES) buffer (100 mM MES, 500 mM NaCl, pH 6.0) was used to anchor peptides. Phosphate buffer (10 mM Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, 20 mM NaCl, pH 6.2) was used as exchange buffer for dialyzing human serum. The exchange buffer without salt was used as sample incubation buffer (IB) when indicated. Prepared surfaces were stored in 1 × phosphate buffer saline (PBS) with 0.01% NaN<sub>3</sub> until use. Platelet suspension buffer (PSB) (134 mM NaCl, 12 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 2.9 mM KCl, 0.34 mM Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, 1.0 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.8 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 10.0 mM Hepes, 5 mM glucose, 0.3 g/100 mL BSA) was used to re-suspend platelets after separation from blood. BSA and Glucose were added in the warmed solution prior to use of PSB.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-0885328210377535"><title>Surface Preparation</title>
<p>Silicon wafers (cut into 1 cm × 1 cm) were first etched with diluted HF for 5 min followed by oxidation with HNO<sub>3</sub>-500 ppm HF acid mixture at 80°C for 15 min to generate hydroxyl groups on the surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0885328210377535">Figure 1</xref>). The method is described in our previous publication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0885328210377535">22</xref>]. Hydroxylated silicon wafers were then exposed to anhydrous toluene containing 2 vol.% APTES for 30 min at room temperature under constant stirring and nitrogen purging. Surfaces were then sonicated and rinsed in (1) toluene, (2) toluene–methanol mixtures (1 : 1 v/v), and (3) methanol sequentially for 2 min each and then dried in nitrogen atmosphere. Three different ligands were used to functionalize the surfaces generated in this study: a 31-amino acid long linear peptide denoted as LP1 (AEGTGDFWFCDRIAWYPQHLCEFLDPEGGGK), a 14-amino acid long linear peptide denoted as LP2 (DRIAWYPQHLGGGK) and a small chemical ligand denoted as SCL (2,4,6-Tris (dimethylaminomethyl) phenol). Untreated wafers were rinsed in ethanol, followed by sonication and rinsing in DI water and stored under similar conditions. These acted as control surfaces (C).
<fig id="fig1-0885328210377535" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Schematic representation of the surface functionalization strategy. Silicon wafers were first hydroxylated followed by silanization with APTES to yield functional groups with terminal –NH<sub>2</sub> moieties, which were further reacted with either linear peptides (LP1, LP2) or small chemical ligand (SCL) with albumin binding affinities to yield functionalized surfaces. An unmodified surface (C) was used as control throughout the experiments.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0885328210377535-fig1.tif"/></fig></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-0885328210377535"><title>Coupling of Peptides to APTES Functionalized Surfaces</title>
<p>For the coupling of peptides to APTES-derivatized surfaces, silanized surfaces were first equilibrated in MES buffer for 30 min. Peptides were dissolved in a minimal volume of DMSO and stored on ice. EDC (≈ 2 mM) and NHSS (≈ 5 mM) were dissolved in MES buffer and then the solution was added to DMSO containing peptide. MES buffer was rinsed off the equilibrated surfaces and the peptide solution was added on the surfaces. The reaction was allowed to take place for 12 h at 4°C on a shaker (50 rpm). After peptide coupling, surfaces were washed gently with copious amounts of MES buffer.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-0885328210377535"><title>Coupling of SCL to APTES Functionalized Surfaces</title>
<p>For SCL coupling, silanized surfaces were equilibrated with isopropyl alcohol (IPA) for 30 min. 1,4-Butanediyl diglycidyl ether (BUDGE) was dissolved in IPA and mixed well. IPA was rinsed off the equilibrated surfaces and BUDGE containing IPA was poured on the surfaces. The reaction was carried out for 8 h at room temperature on a shaker (50 rpm). SCL (at 6:1 ratio, BUDGE: SCL) was dissolved in slightly basic medium. After BUDGE incubation, the surface was washed gently with IPA and DI water sequentially. SCL solution was added on the surfaces and allowed to incubate for 24 h at room temperature on a shaker (50 rpm). At the end of incubation, surfaces were washed with DI water.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-0885328210377535"><title>Platelet Poor Plasma and Washed Platelet Preparation</title>
<p>Human blood in ACD was centrifuged at 200 × <italic>g</italic> for 20 min at room temperature and platelet-rich plasma (PRP) was carefully pipetted out. PRP was further centrifuged at 2000 × <italic>g</italic> for 12 min at room temperature and platelet-poor plasma (PPP) was collected from the supernatant. Platelet pellets were re-suspended in PSB to make a suspension of washed platelets and the concentration was estimated using an Advia 2120 Multispecies Hematology Analyzer at Physicians Laboratory Services, Lincoln, NE.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec9-0885328210377535"><title>Protein Incubation</title>
<p>Three 1 × 1 cm<sup>2</sup> surfaces per well were placed in a six-well TCP plate washed with IB. One set of surfaces was directly incubated with human serum for 6 h at room temperature. The other set of surfaces was incubated first with a 1 mg/mL solution of HSA for 1 h at room temperature, washed with IB copiously and then incubated with human serum as mentioned earlier. All surfaces were washed and used immediately in subsequent experiments.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec10-0885328210377535"><title>Incubation of Surface with Washed Platelets</title>
<p>Collagen-coated plates that served as positive controls and test surfaces (LP1, LP2, SCL, and C) were prehydrated with PSB buffer for 3 h at 37°C in TCP plates. Next, the buffer was aspirated from the surface and platelet suspension (∼1 × 10<sup>8</sup> platelets/mL PSB) was added. Upon incubation for 1 h at 37°C under static conditions, the platelet suspension was removed and the surfaces were rinsed with PSB before proceeding with the characterization steps.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec11-0885328210377535"><title>Lactate Dehydrogenase Assay</title>
<p>Several dilutions were made from the stock platelet suspensions with PSB, and an LDH assay analysis (<italic>In Vitro</italic> Toxicology Assay Kit: Lactic Dehydrogenase based, Sigma, St. Louis, MO) was undertaken according to the manufacturer’s protocol to make a standard curve. The calibration curve was made of LDH activity versus platelet number based on the Hematology Analyzer measurement of the original stock platelet suspension in cells per milliliters.</p>
<p>At the completion of the incubation step of test surfaces with platelets, the surfaces were washed and transferred to a new TCP plate and lysis buffer (100 µL for 1 cm<sup>2</sup> surface) was added to release the platelets. The concentration of platelets was measured as detailed earlier and the calibration curve was used to quantify the number of adhered platelets.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec12-0885328210377535"><title>Scanning Electron Microscopy Analysis</title>
<p>Surfaces with adhered platelets were fixed with 2% glutaraldehyde for 1 h and sequentially dehydrated with ethanol solutions and dried overnight. The bottom part of the collagen coated plate was cut for viewing. All surfaces were sputter-coated with gold and examined under a Hitachi S4700 Field-Emission SEM at the Center of Biotechnology, University of Nebraska Lincoln.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec13-0885328210377535"><title>Hemolysis Assay</title>
<p>An assay procedure that is detailed elsewhere was followed with appropriate positive and negative controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0885328210377535">23</xref>]. Briefly, surfaces were first equilibrated with a 0.9% NaCl solution at 37°C for 30 min and then exposed to blood that was diluted with 0.9% NaCl solution at a ratio of 4 : 5 for 3 h at 37°C in an incubator shaker (50 rpm). In a separate experiment, surfaces were pre-exposed to a 1.0 mg/mL solution of pure HSA and exposed to saline diluted blood. The supernatants from the test surfaces and controls were centrifuged at 700 g for 10 min and the absorbance was measured at 545 nm using an ELx 800 microplate reader, BioTek Instruments, VT. The hemolysis ratio can be calculated from: % Hemolysis ratio = [<italic>X</italic><sup>t</sup>−<italic>X</italic><sup>−</sup>]/[<italic>X</italic><sup>+</sup>−<italic>X</italic><sup>−</sup>] where <italic>X</italic><sup>+</sup>, <italic>X</italic><sup>−</sup>, <italic>X</italic><sup>t</sup> were the absorbance of positive, negative, and test samples.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec14-0885328210377535"><title><italic>In Vitro</italic> Coagulation Assays</title>
<p>Two independent sets of test and control surfaces were examined in triplicates. One set of samples were directly incubated with freshly prepared PPP for 30 min in TCP plates at 37°C whereas the other set was first exposed to 1 mg/mL HSA for 1 h at room temperature, rinsed, and then incubated with PPP for 30 min at 37°C. Upon the completion of the incubation step, the PPP sample was carefully removed and analyzed in a semi-automated hemostasis analyzer (Stago Diagnostica, Parsippany, NJ). All coagulation assays were conducted at 37°C. A glass surface served as the positive control (PC) and assay buffer was considered as the negative control (NC) for the coagulation assays.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec15-0885328210377535"><title>Partial Thromboplastin Time</title>
<p>100 µL of PPP was removed from the test and control surfaces and transferred to the test cuvette and warmed at 37°C for 3 min. A 3% (w/v) rabbit brain cephalin suspension solution was prepared in 0.9% saline and 100 µL of the cephalin suspension was added to 100 µL of PPP and incubated for 1 min, followed by the addition of 100 µL of 25 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>. The time taken for clot formation was measured (<italic>n</italic> = 6). The upper limit of the machine was set to 200 s.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec16-0885328210377535"><title>Prothrombin Time</title>
<p>100 µL of the thromboplastin reagent was added to 100 µL of PPP that was removed from the test surfaces and the time of the clot formation was measured (<italic>n</italic> = 6). The upper limit of the machine was set to 25 s.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec17-0885328210377535"><title>Thrombin Time</title>
<p>To determine the effect of the surfaces on clotting time, 100 µL of the bovine thrombin reagent was added to a 200 µL PPP test sample and the respective clotting time was recorded (<italic>n</italic> = 6). The upper limit of the machine was set to 50 s.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec18-0885328210377535"><title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>All coagulation assays were performed with one batch of freshly prepared PPP. For the coagulation assay, data was expressed as mean value ± standard deviation (SD). The coefficient of variation is 100 times the SD divided by mean. Any significant difference was measured using two sample <italic>t</italic>-tests assuming unequal variance. A characterization of the methods were evaluated as excellent (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0005), good (0.0005 &lt; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.005), moderate (0.005 &lt; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05), and bad (<italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.5). A Pearson correlation coefficient was calculated to correlate assays.</p>

<sec id="sec19-0885328210377535"><title>RESULTS</title>
<p>Functionalized surfaces displaying peptides and chemical ligands with albumin-binding affinities were designed to specifically and selectively bind albumin over other plasma proteins. While all the ligand modified surfaces were observed to bind albumin over other serum proteins, upon exposure to human serum, the following order of specificity was observed: LP1 &gt; LP2 &gt; SCL &gt; C and summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0885328210377535">Table 1</xref> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0885328210377535">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0885328210377535">24</xref>].

<p>To investigate the response of platelets to the test and control surfaces (C), surfaces were directly exposed to human serum, followed by incubation with washed platelets, or in separate experiments were exposed to washed platelets after pre-exposing the surfaces to pure HSA and human serum, respectively. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0885328210377535">Figure 2</xref> shows the number of adhered platelets on the test surfaces evaluated (in platelets/cm<sup>2</sup>).

A platelet density of ∼ 3.4 × 10<sup>5</sup> platelets/cm<sup>2</sup> was noted for LP1 derivatized surfaces that were directly exposed to human serum prior to incubation with washed platelets. Surfaces that were pre-exposed to HSA were found to significantly reduce the adhered platelet density to 1.0 × 10<sup>5</sup> platelets/cm<sup>2</sup> (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0005). A similar trend was found for LP2 derivatized surfaces.

In panel (a), test and control surfaces were incubated with human serum, rinsed, and exposed to washed platelets, and the resulting morphologies of surface-adhered platelets are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0885328210377535">Figure 3</xref> at two magnifications (500× and 8.0 k×). LP1 derivatized surfaces exhibited a lower adhesion of platelets with no aggregate or platelet microparticle (PMP) formation (Panel A). Additionally, the adhered platelets on LP1 derivatized surfaces showed a disc shaped platelet with no pseudopodia formation. Although the platelet density of surfaces functionalized with LP2 were two fold higher when compared to LP1 functionalized surfaces, similar morphologies were observed (Panel A). In contrast, surfaces functionalized with SCL or C had a dense adherence of platelets. Clear pseudopodial formation and PMP were also observed (Panel A). Pre-exposure of test and control surfaces to HSA had no visible impact on platelet morphology (panel (b); <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0885328210377535">Figure 3</xref>). The dense adherence of platelets on surfaces functionalized with SCL or C were further supported by the higher values of platelet densities reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0885328210377535">Figure 2</xref>.

<p>The hemolysis value (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0885328210377535">Figure 4</xref>) for the test and control surfaces prepared in this study was less than 10%, a reported standard value [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0885328210377535">23</xref>]. The effect of the possible biomaterial-induced delay on the clotting process, <italic>in vitro</italic>, was measured by the PTT assay and shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0885328210377535">Figure 5</xref>. The clotting time (∼92 s) measured for the glass surface, which served as a positive control, was significantly lower when compared to the test surfaces. The clotting time for the negative control was not within the upper limit of the machine, which was 200 s. The average value of PTT for the entire test surfaces evaluated was significantly different from the positive and negative control. However, a wide range of PTT values were obtained with no apparent statistical difference among the test surfaces. The average PT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0885328210377535">Figure 6</xref>) measured on the test, positive, and negative control surfaces were similar, with an average coefficient of variation of 15%.

Clotting times obtained for test and control surfaces were similar and not statistically different from negative control. On an average, the coefficient of variation in the clotting time was 21%.

<sec id="sec23-0885328210377535"><title>DISCUSSION</title>
<p>Albuminated surfaces have been reported to lower platelet adherence as well as cellular and bacterial adhesion, in contrast to surfaces with adsorbed immunoglobulin (IgG) and fibrinogen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0885328210377535">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0885328210377535">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0885328210377535">25</xref>]. Mainly, peptides (LP1, LP2) were chosen because of their specific affinity interaction with HSA at selected pH whereas SCL binds HSA via mixed mode interaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0885328210377535">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0885328210377535">27</xref>]. For example, LP1 and LP2 have disassociation constants (K<sub>D</sub>) of 0.950 µM and 125 µM, respectively and the SCL was noted to have a K<sub>D</sub> of 10 µM.</p>
<p>We have shown that surfaces functionalized with albumin-binding linear peptides preferentially adsorb HSA with an undetectable amount of human fibrinogen (HFib) under static conditions. However, surfaces derivatized with SCL, a small chemical ligand with albumin-binding properties or control surfaces have noticeable amounts of adsorbed fibrinogen (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0885328210377535">Table 1</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0885328210377535">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0885328210377535">24</xref>].In an effort to evaluate platelet responses to surfaces with <italic>in situ</italic> albumin-binding affinity, surfaces were exposed to serum directly or after a pre-exposure to HSA. To avoid any basal LDH activity resulting from the preparation of PRP, the surfaces were only exposed to washed platelets and evaluated with an LDH assay and SEM. Surface adsorbed fibrinogen was known to activate anchor platelets via GPIIb/IIIa membrane receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0885328210377535">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0885328210377535">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0885328210377535">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0885328210377535">26</xref>]. The lower adherent platelet density on LP1 and LP2 surface can be correlated with trace or undetectable amounts of HFib noted on these surfaces. Pre-exposure of LP1 and LP2 with HSA reduced the number of adherent platelets and was likely due to the saturation of the surface with albumin in the pre-exposure step. On the other hand, the high adherent platelet densities were found on SCL and control surfaces that can be correlated to the higher amounts of surface adsorbed human immunohlobulin (HIgG) and HFib in the adsorbed protein layer. The platelet adherent data obtained with human blood in the current work resembled the previous experiments with bovine blood and demonstrated reproducibility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0885328210377535">24</xref>].</p>
<p>The reduced adhesion and activation of platelets on the LP1 derivatized surface was due to the adsorption of albumin either from direct serum or pure HSA. An increased amount of adhered but not activated platelets on the LP2 derivatized surface can be attributed to lower amounts of adsorbed HSA. It has been reported elsewhere that a minimum of 5 ng/cm<sup>2</sup> of surface adsorbed fibrinogen was sufficient to cause the adhesion and activation of platelets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0885328210377535">27</xref>]. Hence, it is likely that the surface adsorbed amounts of HFib on the LP1 and LP2 derivatized surfaces is less than the critical amount required for activation and is supported by ELISA results listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0885328210377535">Table 1</xref>. However the amounts of surface adsorbed HFib on the SCL and control surface and their possible conformation in the adsorbed layer was sufficient enough to cause platelet spreading.</p>
<p>The low hemolytic values obtained for test and control surfaces indicate that surfaces, including unmodified silicon surfaces, were nonhemolytic under the conditions evaluated in this study. In the current work, the responses of surfaces with <italic>in situ</italic> albumin affinities were evaluated with standard coagulation assay procedures. Adsorption of factor XII or in combination with autoactivated factor XIIa on biomaterials has been reported to activate the intrinsic coagulation pathway, and the PTT assay is an indirect measure of the surface mediated activation of factor XII [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0885328210377535">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0885328210377535">29</xref>]. Interestingly, the unmodified silicon surfaces and the test surfaces prepared were noted to have statistically indifferent PTT clotting times, indicating that the intrinsic pathway was not significantly impacted. Perhaps the concentrations of surface adsorbed factor XII or XIIa were lower than the threshold needed to activate the intrinsic pathways.</p>
<p>However, the glass surface which was included as a positive control yielded PTT clotting times that were statistically different from either of the unmodified silicon surfaces or test surfaces. It is plausible that the glass surface was able to provide the negatively charged surface needed for the adsorption of factor XII. Thus, the PTT values obtained correlated with the notion that the unmodified silicon and test surfaces prepared in this study failed to either provide the extent of negative charge or the distribution of the negative charges needed to affect the adsorption of Factor XII. Based on the PTT assay results, it appears that the peptide or SCL derivatized surfaces prepared will not likely provide the needed fibrin network via the intrinsic pathway to grow the plug. Of course, platelet surfaces can act as a catalytic site for the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0885328210377535">17</xref>].</p>
<p>Recent research has proposed the possible activation of extrinsic coagulation or disseminated intravascular coagulation by biomaterials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0885328210377535">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0885328210377535">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0885328210377535">31</xref>]. This process is facilitated by leukocytes and thereby connects it to the biomaterial-induced coagulation process. The PT assay was carried out to evaluate if the <italic>in situ</italic> albumin-binding surfaces or controls increase the use of clotting factors and impact the extrinsic pathway. Differences in the PT and TT values between test surfaces and controls were determined to be insignificant, which leads us to conclude that the extrinsic pathway was not perturbed at any detectable level.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec24-0885328210377535"><title>CONCLUSION</title>
<p>The surfaces that were derivatized with peptides, having albumin-binding affinities, were noted to passivate the surfaces; yielding lower platelet adherence and preserving the normal discoid shape of the platelets. The response of platelets correlated with the amount of surface adsorbed HSA and the ratio of surface adsorbed HSA to surface adsorbed HIgG and HFib ([HSA]/[HFib + HIgG]). However, PTT, PT, and TT were indecisive in establishing a trend similar to that noted with platelet responses on various test surfaces. An analysis of the correlation coefficient was undertaken to establish a relationship between clotting times obtained from the PTT, PT, and TT. The closeness of the fit was most convincing between the PTT and TT. The LP1 and LP2 derivatized surfaces showed longer delay in coagulation time compared to the SCL derivatized and unmodified surfaces.</p>
