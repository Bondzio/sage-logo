<abstract>
<p>This study examines visual and spatial working memory skills in 35 third to fifth graders with both mathematics learning disabilities (MLD) and poor problem-solving skills and 35 of their peers with typical development (TD) on tasks involving both low and high attentional control. Results revealed that children with MLD, relative to TD children, failed spatial working memory tasks that had either low or high attentional demands but did not fail the visual tasks. In addition, children with MLD made more intrusion errors in the spatial working memory tasks requiring high attentional control than did their TD peers. Finally, as a post hoc analysis the sample of MLD was divided in two: children with severe MLD and children with low mathematical achievement. Results showed that only children with severe MLD failed in spatial working memory (WM) tasks if compared with children with low mathematical achievement and TD. The findings are discussed on the basis of their theoretical and clinical implications, in particular considering that children with MLD can benefit from spatial WM processes to solve arithmetic word problems, which involves the ability to both maintain and manipulate relevant information.</p>

<body>
<p>The main aim of the present study is to examine how children with mathematical learning disabilities (MLD) with poor problem-solving skills perform on visual and spatial working memory (WM) tasks involving high and low levels of controlled attention.</p>
<p>Baddeley’s WM model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022219411400746">1986</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022219411400746">2000</xref>) identifies the central executive (a system responsible for a range of regulatory functions, including attention, control of action, and problem solving) plus two slave systems. These latter systems consist of the phonological loop, which holds material in a phonological code, and the visuospatial sketchpad (or visuospatial working memory [VSWM], the term more recently adopted; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022219411400746">Logie, 1995</xref>), which holds and manipulates visual and spatial information. In turn, this latter component was split by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022219411400746">Logie (1995)</xref> into the <italic>visual cache</italic>, which temporarily stores visual information (i.e., memory for shape and color), and the <italic>inner scribe</italic>, for the rehearsal of motor spatial sequences. An additional relatively new component, the episodic buffer, is responsible for binding information across informational domains and memory subsystems into integrated chunks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022219411400746">Baddeley, 2000</xref>). In the present study we focus on the processes of VSWM, distinguishing between visual and spatial components.</p>
<p>In addition, recent research has pinpointed the importance of attention control in performing standard types of WM tasks involving separate storage and processing components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022219411400746">Cowan, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022219411400746">Kane et al., 2004</xref>). For example, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022219411400746">Engle, Tuholski, Laughlin, and Conway (1999)</xref>, WM is a hierarchically organized system in which short-term memory storage components subserve a domain-free, limited-capacity, controlled attention (also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022219411400746">Cowan, 1995</xref>). Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022219411400746">Cornoldi and Vecchi (2003)</xref> assumed the existence of two dimensions: a horizontal continuum referring to different types of material (e.g., verbal, visual, and spatial) and a vertical continuum referring to a distinction between passive storage (requiring participants to recall information in a previously presented format) and active processing (requiring ability to integrate and process previous information). In the tasks administered in the current study, therefore, we manipulated the level of controlled attention by considering simple span (i.e., “passive” or low level of controlled attention) versus complex span (i.e., “active” or high level of controlled attention) tasks.</p>
<p>The association of learning disabilities with impairments in WM has been demonstrated in a number of studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0022219411400746">Passolunghi &amp; Siegel, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0022219411400746">Pickering, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0022219411400746">Schuchardt, Maehler, &amp; Hasselhorn, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0022219411400746">Swanson, 2006</xref>). However, in reference to children with MLD, the nature of this relationship is still not well understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0022219411400746">Passolunghi, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0022219411400746">Raghubar, Barnes, &amp; Hecht, 2010</xref>). The central executive seems to be particularly impaired (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022219411400746">Geary, Brown, &amp; Samaranayake, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022219411400746">Geary, Hamson, &amp; Hoard, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022219411400746">Geary, Hoard, &amp; Hamson, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022219411400746">Hitch &amp; McAuley, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0022219411400746">McLean &amp; Hitch, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0022219411400746">Passolunghi &amp; Siegel, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0022219411400746">Siegel &amp; Ryan, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0022219411400746">Swanson, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0022219411400746">Swanson &amp; Sachse-Lee, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0022219411400746">Wilson &amp; Swanson, 2001</xref>), whereas there is conflicting evidence about the role of the phonological loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022219411400746">Geary et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0022219411400746">Swanson &amp; Sachse-Lee, 2001</xref>). In fact, no evidence of its impairment has been found, especially when difference in reading was controlled for (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022219411400746">Bull &amp; Johnston, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0022219411400746">McLean &amp; Hitch, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0022219411400746">Passolunghi &amp; Siegel, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0022219411400746">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0022219411400746">Schuchardt et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>The role of VSWM in mathematics reasoning and word problem solving is less clear and still under debate. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0022219411400746">McLean and Hitch (1999)</xref> found that 9-year-old children with MLD performed less well than did a control group on a VSWM task, whereas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0022219411400746">Reuhkala (2001)</xref> found that performance on a visuospatial task (e.g., visual matrix pattern task) and a mental rotation task correlated with mathematics test scores in young adolescents.</p>
<p>In studies investigating the influence of WM components in mathematics school achievement, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022219411400746">Holmes and Adams (2006)</xref> showed that VSWM and central executive scores predicted curriculum-based mathematical abilities in children aged 8 and 9 years. In particular, their findings indicated a stronger role for VSWM in the mathematics performance of younger children (also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022219411400746">Holmes, Adams, &amp; Hamilton, 2008</xref>). Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022219411400746">Jarvis and Gathercole (2003)</xref> showed that both verbal and visuospatial WM are important predictors of national curriculum mathematics test scores in children aged 11 and 14 years. Recently, in a longitudinal study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022219411400746">Bull, Epsy, and Wiebe (2008)</xref> found that visuospatial short-term memory predicted mathematics achievement at the end of first and third grades, whereas executive function skills predicted academic achievement in general rather than in a specific domain. In contrast, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022219411400746">Bull, Johnston, and Roy (1999)</xref> found that 7-year-old children of high and low mathematics ability did not differ on a spatial WM task, when assessed using the forward Corsi block task. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022219411400746">Geary et al. (2000)</xref> described children with MLD and typically developing (TD) peers as having comparable outcomes on measures of visual and spatial memory. The discrepancy in these latter results could be in part the result of developmental changes related to the participants’ ages but also the different manners of selecting groups. Moreover, only a few studies to date have distinguished between visual and spatial WM components, most previous work having considered VSWM as a whole (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0022219411400746">Passolunghi &amp; Mammarella, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0022219411400746">Schuchardt et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section1-0022219411400746">
<title>Visual and Spatial WM Processes in Cognition and Problem Solving</title>
<p>The distinction between visual and spatial WM components is supported by considerable empirical evidence derived from studies using the dual-task paradigm, neuropsychological research, and investigations of the visual system in primates. Studies using the dual-task paradigm have shown that retention of either visual shapes or colors is disrupted by the presentation of irrelevant pictures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022219411400746">Logie &amp; Marchetti, 1991</xref>) or by dynamic visual noise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0022219411400746">Quinn &amp; McConnell, 1996</xref>). Instead, retention of location is disturbed by spatial tracking tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022219411400746">Baddeley &amp; Lieberman, 1980</xref>), spatial tapping tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022219411400746">Della Sala, Gray, Baddeley, Allamano, &amp; Wilson, 1999</xref>), and eye movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0022219411400746">Postle, Idzikowski, Della Sala, Logie, &amp; Baddeley, 2006</xref>). The subdivision into visual and spatial WM components is also corroborated by neuropsychological evidence from patients showing a selective deficit in the performance of either visual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022219411400746">Carlesimo, Perri, Turriziani, Tomaiuolo, &amp; Caltagirone, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022219411400746">Farah, Hammond, Levine, &amp; Calvanio, 1988</xref>) or spatial WM tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022219411400746">Hanley, Young, &amp; Pearson, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0022219411400746">Luzzatti, Vecchi, Agazzi, Cesa-Bianchi, &amp; Vergani, 1998</xref>) and by studies of the visual system in primates (the <italic>where system</italic> for processing spatial information and the <italic>what system</italic> for visual processing; for a review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0022219411400746">Smith &amp; Jonides, 1999</xref>). Furthermore, double dissociation between visual and spatial WM has been observed in disabled children: A visual memory impairment was observed in children with spina bifida (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0022219411400746">N. Mammarella, Cornoldi, &amp; Donadello, 2003</xref>), whereas a spatial memory impairment was found in children with Williams syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0022219411400746">Vicari, Bellucci, &amp; Carlesimo, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0022219411400746">2006</xref>).</p>
<p>However, it is worth noting that there is very little empirical evidence of the dissociation between visual and spatial WM in relation to mathematics, especially as in regard to arithmetic word problems. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022219411400746">Hegarty and Kozhevnikov (1999)</xref> hypothesized that the visualizer’s cognitive style involves two subtypes of cognitive styles able to solve arithmetic problems in different ways. People who present a schematic representation primarily encode the spatial relations described in a problem, whereas people who have a pictorial representation primarily encode the visual appearance of the objects described. The authors demonstrated that the schematic (i.e., spatial) representation is positively related to success in arithmetic word problems, whereas the pictorial (i.e., visual) representation is negatively related to good performance in arithmetic word problems. However, in the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022219411400746">Hegarty and Kozhevnikov (1999)</xref> study, the influence of visual and spatial WM on word problems was not taken into account. This aspect was investigated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0022219411400746">Passolunghi and Mammarella (2010)</xref>, who compared the performances of groups of poor problem solvers and TD children, showing that poor problem solvers were specifically impaired on spatial but not visual WM tasks. However, a possible criticism of their study is that spatial WM tasks may be highly associated with central executive processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0022219411400746">Miyake, Friedman, Rettinger, Shah, &amp; Hegarty, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0022219411400746">Rudkin, Pearson, &amp; Logie, 2007</xref>). The difference between the groups in spatial WM tasks may therefore be in particular the result of an involvement of central executive processes in spatial WM tasks and not specific impairment in the ability to process and remember spatial information.</p>
<p>In the present research our aim was to generalize and extend previous findings, demonstrating an impairment in spatial but not visual WM tasks in a group of children with MLD failing in problem solving. To this purpose, we carried out an experiment targeting the VSWM abilities of two groups of children: one with MLD and severe difficulties in arithmetic word problem solving, the other showing typical development. To test VSWM we used two spatial and two visual WM tasks: complex span tasks (i.e., “active”), involving a high level of controlled attention, and simple span tasks (i.e., “passive”), involving a low level of controlled attention. The tasks used for measuring <italic>spatial</italic> WM were thus the simple matrix-span task and the complex matrix-span task (derived from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0022219411400746">I. C. Mammarella &amp; Cornoldi, 2005</xref>), whereas the tasks employed for assessing <italic>visual</italic> WM were the simple house-recognition test (adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0022219411400746">N. Mammarella et al., 2003</xref>) and the complex house-recognition test (developed specifically for this study).</p>
<p>We expected to find impaired performance of children with MLD only on spatial tasks, if it is true that children with MLD are impaired more in spatial than in visual WM tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0022219411400746">Passolunghi &amp; Mammarella, 2010</xref>). In particular, we hypothesized that children with MLD would be impaired on both simple and complex spatial WM tasks. In contrast, for the simple and complex visual WM tasks, we did not expect lower performances of children with MLD compared to TD children.</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>All children from 16 different classes of four different elementary schools in the northeast of Italy were invited to participate in our study. Of these, 95% (<italic>N</italic> = 320) responded, parental consent being given in each case. On the basis of school records children with either intellectual or learning disabilities were excluded from the study (4 children, around 1%). Participants had no documented brain injury, sociocultural disadvantage, or behavioral problems.</p>
<p>The operational criteria for the MLD group with severe difficulties in arithmetic word problem solving were (a) normal intelligence on the basis of the measure of Vocabulary subtest of the <italic>Primary Mental Abilities</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0022219411400746">Thurstone &amp; Thurstone, 1963</xref>), (b) performance below the 25th percentile on an Italian standardized mathematics test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022219411400746">Amoretti, Bazzini, Pesci, &amp; Reggiani, 1994</xref>), and (c) teacher reports of having severe and persistent (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0022219411400746">Murphy, Mazzocco, Hanich, &amp; Early, 2007</xref>) arithmetic difficulties and impairment in arithmetic word problem solving but not impaired reading skills.</p>
<p>The operational criteria for the TD group were (a) as above, normal intelligence on the basis of the Vocabulary subtest of the <italic>Primary Mental Abilities</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0022219411400746">Thurstone &amp; Thurstone, 1963</xref>), (b) mean performance between the 40th and 75th percentiles on the standardized mathematics test (as above) of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022219411400746">Amoretti et al. (1994)</xref>, and (c) teacher reports of performing at grade level in arithmetic and reading ability.</p>
<p>All of the criteria had to be satisfied to be part of a group. Only a few children were excluded for failing to meet just one of the three criteria (i.e., 1 child of the MLD group was not identified by teachers and 3 were selected by teachers but did not fail on the standardized mathematics test). The use of these strict criteria limited the occurrence of false positive cases.</p>
<p>On the basis of these criteria, from an initial sample of 320 children (148 males, 172 females) attending third, fourth, and fifth grades of primary school, with a mean age of 116.63 months (<italic>SD</italic> = 10.65), we selected a group of 35 MLD and poor problem solving skills and a group of 35 TD children. The two groups of children (MLD and TD) were matched for age, <italic>F</italic>(1, 68) &lt; 1, gender (MLD group = 15 males and 20 females; TD group = 14 males and 21 females), school level, and performance on the Vocabulary subtest of the <italic>Primary Mental Abilities</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0022219411400746">Thurstone &amp; Thurstone, 1963</xref>), <italic>F</italic>(1, 68) = 2.47, <italic>MSE</italic> = 56.51, <italic>p</italic> = .12. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0022219411400746">Table 1</xref> summarizes the characteristics of the two groups.</p>

<p>The Vocabulary subtest of the <italic>Primary Mental Abilities</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0022219411400746">Thurstone &amp; Thurstone, 1963</xref>) was administered to estimate children’s verbal IQ.</p>
<p>The standardized mathematics test of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022219411400746">Amoretti et al. (1994)</xref> consisted of 12 items: 8 written arithmetic word problems and 4 questions examining the manipulation of Arabic and verbal numerals (e.g., putting a series of Arabic numbers in ascending order; writing the Arabic numeral that corresponds to a verbal numeral). A typical problem was “This Saturday Robert goes with his mother to the supermarket. His mother buys 400 grams of ham and spends 6.80 euros. What is the cost of 100 grams of ham?”</p>

<title>Materials and Procedure</title>
<p>Children were presented with spatial and visual WM tasks distinguished in simple and complex span tasks. These were administered in a quiet school room in single individual sessions; presentation order was counterbalanced according to a randomized Latin square. Before starting the experiment, the children spent a few minutes practicing, to familiarize themselves with the mouse and ensure they were clear about how to give their responses.</p>

<title>Simple matrix task</title>
<p>In this task, children had to recall an increasing series of positions (e.g., dots) in 4 × 4 matrices following presentation order. The level of complexity was defined as the number of positions to be recalled (from two to five). Initially, two positions were presented sequentially and had to be memorized, then three positions had to be recalled, and so on up to five. Each level of complexity involved three trials, such that three trials required recall of two positions, three trials required recall of three positions, and so on. Children were given two practice trials before starting the task.</p>
<p>Positions (dots) were presented on 4 × 4 matrices. The middle of the matrix was presented in the center of the computer screen. All matrix lines were black against a white background. The cells involved in the task were indicated by black dots that appeared in the middle of the cell. The series presented had the following properties: Each dot was presented for 1,000 ms and was separated by an empty matrix that was shown for 1,000 ms. When a series ended, participants had to indicate the locations presented on an empty matrix. Responses were given using the mouse. The mean proportions of correct responses were used for scoring.</p>

<title>Complex matrix task</title>
<p>For the complex matrix task (adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0022219411400746">I. C. Mammarella &amp; Cornoldi, 2005</xref>), children were involved in a double task: For the primary task, they had to recall the last position (e.g., last dot) of a sequence of three positions in a matrix; for the secondary task, they had to press the space bar every time a position was given (a dot appeared) in a gray cell. The level of complexity was defined as the number of last positions to be recalled (from two to five). Each level of complexity involved two trials. Children were given two practice trials before starting the task.</p>
<p>Positions (dots) were presented on 4 × 4 matrices. The middle of the matrix was presented in the center of the computer screen. All matrix lines were black against a white background. The cells involved in the task were indicated by black dots that appeared in the middle of the cell. Every matrix had one row and one column colored in gray. Within each series, the colored row and column remained the same. A random procedure was used to decide which row and column to color gray.</p>
<p>The series of matrices had the following properties: Each dot was presented for 1,000 ms and was separated by an empty matrix that was shown for 1,000 ms (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022219411400746">Figure 1</xref>). When a series ended, participants had to indicate the last locations presented, on an empty matrix. Responses were given using the mouse.</p>

<p>The mean proportions of correct responses were used for scoring, and in addition two different kinds of error were noted: (a) “intrusion” if the response was an irrelevant location that had in fact just been presented (i.e., the recall of a nonfinal position within the same level) and (b) “invention” if a response was a location never actually presented in that particular level of matrices (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0022219411400746">I.

<title>Simple house-recognition test</title>
<p>For the simple house-recognition test (adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0022219411400746">Mammarella et al., 2003</xref>; also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0022219411400746">Passolunghi &amp; Mammarella, 2010</xref>), children had to recognize an increasing number of houses. The level of complexity was defined as the number of houses to be recognized (from two to five). Each level of complexity involved three trials; thus, three trials required recognition of two houses, three trials required recognition of three houses, and so on. Children were given two practice trials before starting the task.</p>
<p>The stimuli were schematic drawings of houses viewed from the front and were presented in the center of the computer screen. Initially, three sets of two houses were shown. Immediately after presentation, the participant had to recognize the target house from a set comprising four stimuli indicating the target houses. Three sets of three houses were then presented for the same length of time, and the participant had to recognize them, again from a total of six houses. Continuing in a similar way, four sets of three houses had to be recognized from eight houses, and finally three sets of five houses from ten. Thus, the number of distractors was twice that of the target houses.</p>
<p>The stimuli were then presented for 3,000 ms, followed by an empty screen for 500 ms. After this a fixation point was presented for 1,000 ms, and the target and distractor stimuli remained on the screen until the response was given, by selecting the target houses using the mouse. The mean proportions of correct responses were used for scoring.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0022219411400746">
<title>Complex house-recognition test</title>
<p>Children were involved in a double task: In the secondary task they had to judge if two presented houses were the same, pressing one of two different keys, whereas in the primary task they had to remember the last house of each sequence of two houses and then recognize an increasing number of houses from a set comprising a double number of stimuli. The level of complexity was defined as the number of houses to be recognized (from two to five). Each level of complexity involved two trials. Children were given two practice trials before starting the task.</p>
<p>The stimuli were schematic houses, as before. In the secondary tasks, two houses were presented sequentially and appeared on the computer screen. Participants had to judge if the two presented houses were the same or not, pressing one of two different keys in response. In the primary task the child had to recall the last presented house of the same or different task; thus, initially the child had to recognize two houses from a set comprising four stimuli, then the child had to recognize three houses from a set of six stimuli, and so on up to five out of ten.</p>
<p>The two houses were presented sequentially for 1,500 ms each, followed by an empty screen for 500 ms. Afterward, a response screen appeared with the words “same/different,” and participants had to judge if the two presented houses were the same or not, pressing one of two different keys in response (M = same, Z = different). The response screen remained until the response was given. This sequence was repeated an increasing number of times (from two to five). At the end, after a blank of 1,000 ms, the distractor stimuli appeared and remained on the screen until the child gave a response, selecting the last house of each sequence of two houses using the mouse. The number of distractors was twice that of the target houses. The mean proportions of correct responses were used for scoring.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Previous studies have demonstrated that number representation can be spatially organized. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022219411400746">Dehaene (1992)</xref> postulated an analog code, where numbers are represented as variable distributions of local activation along a mental number line. Moreover, from examination of the literature on neuropsychological deficits in adults, there is clear evidence that spatial abilities are relevant for mathematics performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022219411400746">Granà, Hofer, &amp; Semenza, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0022219411400746">Zorzi, Priftis, &amp; Umiltà, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022219411400746">Hegarty and Kozhevnikov (1999</xref>; also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022219411400746">Kozhevnikov, Hegarty, &amp; Mayer, 2002</xref>) showed use of schematic spatial representations to be associated with success in mathematics problem solving but use of pictorial (i.e., visual) representations to be negatively correlated with this success. However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022219411400746">Hegarty and Kozhevnikov (1999)</xref> did not take VSWM tasks into account. In a recent study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0022219411400746">Passolunghi and Mammarella (2010)</xref> found that poor problem solvers specifically failed in spatial but not in visual WM tasks; however, their study cannot exclude the involvement of the central executive component since this variable was not controlled for.</p>
<p>In the current study, using a different sample, a group of children with MLD showing difficulties in arithmetic word problems was compared to a group of TD children. The two groups were tested not only on tasks distinguished on the basis of their presentation format (i.e., visual vs. spatial) but also on tasks involving different levels of controlled attention (i.e., simple vs. complex span tasks). Specifically, two versions of both visual and spatial tasks were devised: simple span tasks, in which only recall of previously presented information was required, and complex span tasks, in which processing and manipulation of information were also involved. The main aim of the research was to investigate whether children with MLD specifically failed in spatial WM tasks, as demonstrated in a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0022219411400746">Passolunghi &amp; Mammarella, 2010</xref>) and whether or not the failure was related to involvement of central executive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022219411400746">Baddeley, 1986</xref>) or level of controlled attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022219411400746">Cowan, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022219411400746">Engle et al., 1999</xref>). Previous studies have in fact demonstrated that central executive processes, related to suppression of irrelevant information, are deficient in children with poor problem-solving abilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0022219411400746">Passolunghi, Cornoldi, &amp; De Liberto, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0022219411400746">Passolunghi &amp; Siegel, 2001</xref>) and that central executive measures contributed unique variance to word problem-solving performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0022219411400746">Swanson &amp; Beebe-Frankenberger, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0022219411400746">Swanson &amp; Sachse-Lee, 2001</xref>). Moreover, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0022219411400746">Swanson and Beebe-Frankenberger (2004</xref>; also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0022219411400746">Swanson, Jerman, &amp; Zheng, 2008</xref>), the central executive system explains a significant portion of variance to individual differences in word problem-solving performances.</p>
<p>Our data showed a specificity of the to-be-processed information: Results revealed that children with MLD failed in simple and complex spatial WM tasks but had similar results to TD children in visual WM tasks. Hence, only children with MLD showed an effect related to the level of controlled attention, that is, these children performed poorly on complex span tasks, whereas TD children performance did not differ on simple and complex span tasks.</p>
<p>Moreover, following the methodology used by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022219411400746">Geary et al. (2007)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0022219411400746">Murphy et al. (2007)</xref>, the sample of children with MLD was split in two: a groups showing severe MLD (&lt;10th percentile) and a group with LMA (11th–25th percentiles). The same analyses were performed considering three (i.e., severe MLD vs. LMA vs. TD) instead of two groups. The pattern of results did not change, but it is worth noting that only children with a severe MLD failed in both complex WM tasks and spatial WM tasks if compared with LMA and TD groups. In other words, children with LMA did not differ from TD and children with severe MLD differed from LMA. Most importantly, if we look at the effect sizes of the analyses, it is clear that the division into three groups offers a better explanation in terms of Cohen’s <italic>d</italic> coefficients. In general, Cohen’s <italic>d</italic>s were bigger when analyses were performed considering three instead of two groups. Moreover, in the analyses considering three groups of children, the coefficients were always bigger when severe MLD versus TD children than when severe MLD versus LMA children were compared. Thus, our results are in agreement with those of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0022219411400746">Murphy et al. (2007)</xref>, in which comparisons between severe MLD and LMA groups revealed distinct profiles not only on mathematics but also on math-related skills, such as WM.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that in our study both the severe MLD and LMA groups had a higher number of intrusion errors in a spatial WM task than TD children. The high number of intrusion errors in the WM tasks suggests that both children with severe MLD and those with LMA held (kept available in memory) information that had initially to be processed but then had to be ignored. This result extends previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0022219411400746">Passolunghi &amp; Siegel, 2001</xref>) showing that children with MLD made a higher number of intrusion errors than TD children in verbal WM tasks. However, it must be highlighted that in our study children with severe MLD made more intrusion errors than children with LMA and TD children. Hence, inhibitory deficit related to an inability to control and ignore no-longer-relevant information seems be more pronounced in children with severe MLD.</p>
<p>As previously mentioned, the main findings of the current study are that children with severe MLD failed on spatial WM tasks and that their performances were more impaired in complex than in simple span tasks. These results can be interpreted in two different but complementary ways: (a) previous studies have shown that both spatial short-term memory and WM tasks are highly associated with central executive processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0022219411400746">Miyake et al., 2001</xref>), and (b) according to the continuity model proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022219411400746">Cornoldi and Vecchi (2003)</xref>, tasks requiring high attentional control partially (but not completely) lose their modality specificity and the distance between similar components is reduced.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the present research disentangles the failures of children with severe MLD in VSWM and stresses the importance of considering two subgroups of children with different degrees of mathematics impairments (i.e., severe vs. moderate) to control for the influence of separate profiles in math-related skills. In the present research, the separation between severe MLD and LMA was done only as a post hoc hypothesis, but also if the number of children in the two groups was not exactly the same, important results emerged.</p>
<p>Finally, the present study has both theoretical, educational and clinical implications: Clarifying the role of VSWM in arithmetic word problems is important for theoretical reasons since it helps cast light on the WM architecture and specific underlying processes. In particular, the present study showed that a tightened modular model is not fully able to explain our results and that models considering both presentation format and level of controlled attention involved in each task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022219411400746">Cowan, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022219411400746">Engle et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022219411400746">Cornoldi &amp; Vecchi, 2003</xref>) might be more successful in explaining our data. Moreover, determining the role of visual and spatial WM in MLD with difficulties in arithmetic word problems is relevant from an educational viewpoint since it enables the key skills associated with good arithmetic learning to be identified. Our findings therefore also have practical clinical implications: Children with severe MLD who fail on arithmetic word problems should be trained in creating spatial—rather than pictorial (i.e., visual)—representation of arithmetic problems, starting from tasks involving a low level of controlled attention since they also showed difficulties in maintaining spatial information, not just in manipulating and processing it. It should therefore be possible to develop targeted training to develop skills specifically connected with good ability in solving arithmetic word problems.</p>
<p>In summary, our findings demonstrate that both presentation format and level of controlled attention distinguished between children with severe MLD from LMA and TD children; in fact, children with severe MLD failed on spatial WM tasks involving either a low or high level of controlled attention but did not fail on visual WM memory tasks, whereas children with LMA had a performance similar to that of TD children. Children with LMA and severe MLD showed poor inhibitory processes related to suppression of irrelevant information, but children with severe MLD had an higher number of intrusion errors compared to the other groups.</p>
