<abstract>
<p>This article, based on an ethnomethodological study in a Finnish regional emergency social work service, focuses on emergency social workers’ interview accounts regarding case recording. In this context, the IT-based case recording and transferring of information and responsibilities between the actors are emphasized. By means of analysis it is shown how social workers account for and prefer recording information which they call ‘factual’. They also account for the distinguishing of facts from other information, without clear explication of what facts actually are. However, there is also negotiation of the norm of ‘fact-based’ case recording in terms of the things that are not yet certain, but which are important for further understanding and handling of the client’s case. The analysis leads to the conclusion that awareness of the constructive and negotiable nature of facts should be taken into account and the apparently obvious nature of ‘facts’ regarding the production, recording, reading and transferring of a case, particularly in the context of regional emergency social work, should be challenged and studied in yet more detail.</p>

<p>Rhetorical and narrative skills are said to be constitutive of the social workers’ expertise when they are presenting and ‘telling the case’ to their colleagues, superiors or students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1473325011400482">Pithouse and Atkinson, 1988</xref>: 198). Case recording is one of the institutional requirements in social work and one of the professional resources that social workers use to build and manage their client relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1473325011400482">Hall et al., 2006</xref>: 90). By means of case records, social workers demonstrate accountability to their agencies, clients and profession, for instance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1473325011400482">Kagle and Kopels, 2008</xref>: 1). In this article, I examine emergency social workers’ interview accounts on case recording: how they describe case recording as part of their work and how they explain, justify and make sense of it in the interview situation. In the context of regional emergency social work services, the recording of client information takes the form of IT-based case files, and the retrieval and transferring of information and responsibilities between organizations and practitioners are emphasized. This is why I find it important to explicate in more detail how the social workers themselves talk about case recording in this particular context.</p>
<p>The analysis focuses on such instances in interviews where social workers describe what kind of case records they should produce and what are the criteria of good case recording. I name this kind of talk the ‘norm talk’ of good case recording, this being the interviewees’ descriptions of shared and normal ways of doing case records and of complying with them. I pay attention to and demonstrate how this kind of norm talk is produced and to the ways it is deviated, negotiated and accounted for (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1473325011400482">Garfinkel, 1967</xref>: 1, 35; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1473325011400482">Heritage, 1984</xref>: 103, 116). Above all, the emergency social workers’ norm talk emphasizes the importance of recording ‘facts’ and distinguishing these facts from other information, which are interesting with regard the ethnomethodological view that facts are constructed and accomplished in talk and action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1473325011400482">de Montigny, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1473325011400482">Garfinkel, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1473325011400482">Jayyusi, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1473325011400482">Smith, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1473325011400482">Zimmerman, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1473325011400482">1974</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1473325011400482">Zimmerman (1969</xref>: 325) points out that in welfare institutions, the case record provides a bureaucratic transformation of the applicant’s story into a factual and objective account, but the process of assembling a case record goes through a series of steps. Several studies relating to social and healthcare services show that the accomplishment and production of a ‘factual’ case are extremely diverse and context-bound processes and usually include various negotiations between the client, the worker and other professionals (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1473325011400482">Hall et al., 2006</xref>: 15–34, 53–70; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1473325011400482">Holbrook, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1473325011400482">Pithouse and Atkinson, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1473325011400482">Taylor, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1473325011400482">Taylor and White, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>There are some important issues currently under discussion in social and healthcare research concerning the IT-based case files and their influence on recording and transferring client cases. Certain studies show that, in practice, the creation of knowledge is deeply embedded in various face-to-face encounters and that tensions emerge when this knowledge needs to be summarized, edited and encoded to suit information systems and other forms of electronic writing (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1473325011400482">Hall et al., 2006</xref>: 105–6; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1473325011400482">Hardstone et al., 2004</xref>: 146–9; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1473325011400482">Leung, 2009</xref>: 705; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1473325011400482">Parton, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1473325011400482">Webb, 2006</xref>: 142; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1473325011400482">White et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1473325011400482">White, 2002</xref>: 431). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1473325011400482">Parton (2008</xref>: 254) notices that currently the key focus in social work activity seems increasingly to be on the gathering, sharing and monitoring of information. He (2008: 261–5) notes that the use of narratives in social work is not disappearing, but that they are increasingly framed by the logic of databases and that these electronic forms influence the nature of what is recorded: knowledge becomes information,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1473325011400482">1</xref></sup> so that it is easier to store, transfer and modify, while less space is left for narratives and discourses for the case at hand (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1473325011400482">Franko Aas, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1473325011400482">Lash, 2002</xref>). In recent studies it has been noticed that, despite IT-based, occasionally prescriptive forms of case recording, social workers still vary in the ways they practice, record or understand cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1473325011400482">Shaw et al., 2009</xref>: 623). There is also evidence that the relational work still remains at the core of professional identities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1473325011400482">Peckover et al., 2008</xref>: 379; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1473325011400482">Pithouse et al., 2009</xref>: 607–10). At the end of the article, I will reflect on my findings in relation to these recent debates concerning the context of IT-based case recording.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec2-1473325011400482"><title>The context of case recording</title>
<p>In recent years, the development of emergency social work as well as regional cooperation in the provision of social services has been topical in Finland.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1473325011400482">2</xref></sup> The context of my study is a regional emergency social work service started a few years ago as a collaborative project between ten municipalities and a fairly large city in Finland. In practice, this means that outside office hours, the emergency social work agency, located in the city, is mandated to deal with severe and critical cases (such as those concerned with child protection) that normally fall under the mandate of the social services of each municipality. The agency in question has long been a part of the city services, but due to the regional cooperation the service was extended to cover ten adjacent municipalities. The agency may be notified, for example, of a child in need of help and support. In this instance two emergency social workers working as a team on duty, will generally visit the child’s home to look into the matter and later record the case in the IT-based case files. The next working day the information related to the case is transferred to the client’s home municipality, which takes over responsibility and continues to work on the case during office hours.</p>
<p>Since the emergency social work agency and the municipal social services work different hours and are located at a distance from each other, the IT-based case recording, transfer and retrieval of information between the actors assume an important role. At the beginning of the regional cooperation various practices of information transfer and recording were planned and implemented between the partner municipalities and the agency. Six of the partner municipalities and the agency adopted the joint use of IT-based client information systems, which enable the emergency information to be recorded directly to the case files of the relevant partner municipality. Moreover, as needed and as allowed by legislation, the emergency social workers may review information previously recorded on a client, such as the existence of plans, decisions or information on the person’s social network, directly through the IT-based client information system of the client’s home municipality (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1473325011400482">Räsänen, 2010</xref>). The regional cooperation also includes four municipalities with which the joint use of IT-based client information systems is not possible, but even in this case the emergency social workers record client information in electronic format. Furthermore, there are other ways to transfer and retrieve information between the actors, such as forms on paper, telephone, fax and email, but in this article I concentrate on recording as it concerns the IT-based case files.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec3-1473325011400482"><title>Research data</title>
<p>My empirical study is based on interviews with seven emergency social workers.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1473325011400482">3</xref></sup> The interviews are semi-structured thematic interviews that deal not only with case recording, but also with other themes related to information and communication technology (ICT) in regional emergency social work. The other themes are as follows: the use of different ICT tools (such as computer, phone and fax) and systems (such as the client information system and email), the advantages and disadvantages of ICT, the training and ability to use ICT and the role of tacit and experiential knowledge in the regional emergency social work. Although the themes and the questions related to them are predetermined, the questions are mainly open-ended and I, as the researcher and interviewer, also use other questions to clarify points that I feel should be gone into more deeply.</p>
<p>The interviews form a part of a set of ethnographic data (observations, video recordings and photographs) gathered on the planning and activity of the regional emergency social work during the years 2006 and 2007.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1473325011400482">4</xref></sup> The data as a whole constitutes the background to understanding the institutional context of the matter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1473325011400482">Maynard, 1989</xref>). This study was conducted in full accordance with the existing research ethical principles in Finland (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1473325011400482">National Advisory Board on Research Ethics, 2002</xref>: 19). I received the official consent of the organization and the consent of each research subject for gathering and using the data in my research. During the research process, several joint discussions and negotiations were also arranged with the informants about the progress of the study and the data gathering. The anonymity of the research subjects was guaranteed by removing all names and other identification data from the research data.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec4-1473325011400482"><title>Analysing interview accounts</title>
<p>Ethnomethodologists are concerned with examining the indexical expressions and actions as ongoing contingent accomplishments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1473325011400482">Garfinkel, 1967</xref>: 11) in any given site in the social world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1473325011400482">Baker, 2003</xref>: 396). When analysing the interview data, I apply ideas and concepts based on ethnomethodology. This means that, I treat the interview answers as accounts and consider information to be produced in the interaction between the interview participants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1473325011400482">Baker, 2003</xref>: 396, 399). I regard accounting in a quite broad sense as a process through which the interview participants describe, explain, justify, or otherwise make sense of the various events and courses of actions they talk about (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1473325011400482">Baker, 2003</xref>: 399; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1473325011400482">Banks, 2004</xref>: 150; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1473325011400482">Buttny, 1993</xref>: 1). Thus, accounting is more than responding or reporting, it is a way of arranging and producing variable versions of how things are or could be (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1473325011400482">Baker, 2003</xref>: 399; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1473325011400482">Gilbert and Mulkay, 1984</xref>: 10–13; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1473325011400482">Smith, 1978</xref>). I chose to pay attention to accounting, since accountability is an inherent part of the social work profession and because social workers often have to explain and justify their professional action and identity in different directions (to clients, employers or colleagues, or in relation to legislation) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1473325011400482">Banks, 2004</xref>: 150; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1473325011400482">Hall et al., 2006</xref>: 16–7; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1473325011400482">Juhila, 2009</xref>). It has been noticed that accounting is also common within interviews (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1473325011400482">Baker, 2003</xref>: 399). Given that my purpose is to increase the cultural understanding of how the social workers themselves talk and produce the case recording as part of their work, an interview is an excellent tool, for in the actual case files the descriptions, explanations and justifications for what is recorded and how are not present. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1473325011400482">Baker (2003</xref>: 401) also notes that the interviews are not ‘time-out’ from the social worlds, but rather they are reflexive descriptions of the worlds the participants are talking about (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1473325011400482">Silverman, 1993</xref>: 108). So, when the professionals are accounting for something, they are at the same time making visible their institutional task and the problems in achieving it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1473325011400482">Juhila et al., 2010</xref>: 75).</p>
<p>The analysis in this article focuses on the sections of the interviews where the social workers are asked to talk about case recording and IT-based case files as part of their work. In my empirical analysis, I seek to find answers to the following questions: 1) How do the emergency social workers describe the case recording in their interview accounts? 2) How do they explain, justify and make sense of case recording? In the first phase of analysis, I was interested in finding out how social workers describe and talk about case recording as part of their everyday work. I identified an easily observable feature of the interview talk concerning the recording of facts and the distinguishing of facts from other information, such as assessments, reflections and hunches about the case. I began to regard this talk as norm talk of good case recording, which I consider to be the interviewees’ descriptions and justifications of normal and shared ways of doing case records, which cannot be deviated from without moral sanctions and without a situation of accountability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1473325011400482">Garfinkel, 1967</xref>: 1, 35; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1473325011400482">Heritage, 1984</xref>: 103, 116). I proceeded to explicate in detail the methods that were used in the production and negotiation of such norm talk (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1473325011400482">Francis and Hester, 2004</xref>: 25–26). In this article I pay attention to and demonstrate the results of this second phase of analysis.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec5-1473325011400482"><title>Accounting for and negotiating fact-based case recording</title>
<p>For a more detailed analysis, I have separated the four most illustrative extracts from the interviews. The first extract represents accounting for accurate and fact-based case recording. The following two extracts represent accounting for the distinguishing of facts from other information in the case records. The final extract represents a momentary negotiation on recording facts, after which the talk moves on to accounting for accurate case recording.</p>
<sec id="sec6-1473325011400482"><title>Accounting for Accurate and Fact-based Case Recording</title>
<p>In the first extract,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1473325011400482">5</xref></sup> I demonstrate how an emergency social worker produces norm talk of accurate and fact-based case recording and how she justifies her talk through her institutional tasks.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p><bold>Extract 1</bold></p>
<p>1 I: In general what is it like the case recording in the client information system I</p>
<p>2 mean, do you have to be really accurate or does it sort of depend on the case (1.5)</p>
<p>3 like</p>
<p>4 E: Well it is, it is fairly accurate, though of course it depends on [the case</p>
<p>5 I: [Mm</p>
<p>6 E: (2.5) mm, but that (2) for us it is sort of more accurate (I: mm) since we don’t</p>
<p>7 know the clients (I: mm) and we’ve got to get the information to their own social</p>
<p>8 worker (I: mm) so that’s why we do a pretty accurate recording. [Another</p>
<p>9 I: [Yes</p>
<p>10 E: reason why we record things in detail is, that since those documents may end up</p>
<p>11 <underline>in court</underline> at some point so it’s really very important, because there again they’ll be</p>
<p>12 strangers reading them, so you have to have detailed records of matters and also</p>
<p>13 accurate in the sense that what’s recorded are <underline>facts</underline>, not any (2) stuff that we feel</p>
<p>14 might be so, so er you see what I mean er (2) so comments like the client</p>
<p>15 appeared intoxicated well they a::ren’t all that (I: mm) all that (2.5) I mean, you</p>
<p>16 should record <underline>in what way</underline> appeared intoxicated, whether they were, did they not</p>
<p>17 know the time or was their speech slurred or like er so in that, that way accurate as</p>
<p>18 well. (I: mm, mm). So you just put in exactly what happened.</p>
<p>19 I: I see. (5) ((Interviewer continues with the next question))</p></disp-quote>The interviewer first asks an open question concerning the general nature of case recording in the client information system, after which, however, she specifies her question as follows: ‘do you have to be really accurate or does it sort of depend on the case (…)?’. The question activates institutional and normative talk on what recording cases in the client information systems is like in the interviewee’s organization. The question is also loaded, as it partly evokes talk about accurate case recording. In her response, the interviewee explains the need for accurate case recording by the special nature of her institutional tasks. She places some distance between herself and the activity and speaks on behalf of her organization: ‘for us’ (for ‘we’ – talk as a characteristic of institutional interaction, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1473325011400482">Drew and Heritage, 1992</xref>: 30; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1473325011400482">Maynard, 1989</xref>: 140). She explains how the emergency social workers are not previously familiar with the clients and how the information gathered on emergency duty has to be got to the client’s own social worker. She continues to explain that the documents recorded in the emergency agency can end up having another audience (court) that is unfamiliar with the case. She also stresses that facts should be recorded and they have to be distinguished from the workers’ feelings. Thus, she produces her institutional tasks and different ‘audiences’ of the case records as justifications for accurate, detailed and fact-based recording.</p>
<p>The worker also gives an example of a recording (on lines 14–15) which deviates from the normal way of doing fact-based case records: ‘so comments like the client appeared intoxicated well they a::ren’t (…) all that (2.5) (…)’. The worker evaluates the appropriateness of the records of this type and analyses case recording according to how it should be: ‘I mean you should say in what way appeared intoxicated’. Thus, she is accounting for the appropriate way of doing case records, which cannot be deviated from without moral sanctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1473325011400482">Heritage, 1984</xref>: 103). The worker does not really define or analyse what generally constitutes a factual case record, whereas she does give an example of formulations that go against fact-based case recording. She also categorizes facts as something different from what she describes as ‘what we feel might be so’ and gives them a different value (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1473325011400482">Atkinson, 2004</xref>: 18).</p></sec>
<sec id="sec7-1473325011400482"><title>Distinguishing Facts from Other Information</title>
<p>In the following two extracts, I demonstrate how emergency social workers are producing norm talk for distinguishing facts from other information within the case records. In the first extract to follow, a worker talks about not mixing facts with reflection. She also describes and explains how facts should and should not be formulated.<disp-quote>
<p><bold>Extract 2</bold></p>
<p>1 I: (…) So the recording, is it based more on facts then?</p>
<p>2 E: Yes, because you can’t actually put in anything but facts, except <underline>assessments</underline> [then,</p>
<p>3 I: [Yes</p>
<p>4 E: that has to be clearly, it must be seen, that I as a social worker (I: mm) assess</p>
<p>5 or a question like this occurred to me or something made me consider or something, but</p>
<p>6 yes, facts and what you might call reflection mustn’t get mixed together.</p>
<p>7 I: Oh yes, quite, that’s true, yes (5) oh yes (1.5).</p>
<p>8 E: But, perhaps as a small example [only</p>
<p>9 I: [Mm?</p>
<p>10 E: I could say that we get, we work a lot on the phone (I: yes)</p>
<p>11 here, like someone phones us and I think this person sounds as if they were drunk, (I:</p>
<p>12 mm)</p>
<p>13 then I can’t put in, that the person phoned and was <underline>drunk</underline> [but,</p>
<p>14 I: [Yes</p>
<p>15 E: I have to put in, that on the phone it sounded in [my opinion</p>

In her question, the interviewer takes facts as given and does not explicate in any detail what should be regarded as a fact. The question also allows the conclusion that the interviewee’s ‘world’ is not unfamiliar to the interviewer (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1473325011400482">Baker, 2003</xref>: 397). The interviewee replies that in case records one can only record facts, except for worker’s assessments which have to be distinguished from facts. The worker explains that if such assessments and considerations are recorded, it must be clearly shown that they are the worker’s personal reflections, not facts. On line seven, the interviewer accepts the response.</p>
<p>Beginning on line eight and on lines 23–27 the interviewee describes two examples of recording that comply with the norm talk of not mixing facts with reflections. In her examples, the worker describes the recording based on a phone conversation with a person who sounds as if they were drunk. To begin with, she notes that on the basis of a phone conversation she cannot record as a fact that the caller was drunk. Moreover, she explains that if such a formulation was used, the person who made the assessment would not be visible in the text. At these points on lines 16 and 18, the interviewer strengthens the worker’s response. The interviewee goes on to explain that to categorize someone as drunken within the case record more facts on the matter are required. In her response (on line 23), to the interviewer’s clarifying question about recording one’s own views, the worker sets factual information in a different position in relation to her reflections, and says that the latter are to be distinguished from facts. On lines 24–27, the interviewee describes another way of formulating the matter: ‘the caller’s speech <underline>was slurred</underline> and leave it at that’ without explicating why it might have been so. The topic of the talk, categorizing someone as drunken, and a little laughter on line 17, both reflect the delicacy of the matter (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1473325011400482">Suoninen, 1999</xref>). Throughout her response, the worker uses several formulations such as ‘can’t actually put in’, ‘mustn’t get mixed’, ‘I have to put in’, ‘It’s got to be’, which all represent and make visible the normative character of the talk on case recording.</p>
<p>In the following extract an interviewee describes the importance of recording facts and feelings alike concerning a client case. However, she also produces the norm talk of distinguishing feelings from facts, things that are ‘definitely so’.<disp-quote>
<p><bold>Extract 3</bold></p>
<p>1 I: Well, mm, what about case recording, er, what do you think the case recording of</p>
<p>2 client work should be like? (3)</p>
<p>3 E: Er, mm, it should of course be, this is what <underline>I</underline> think, that it should be fairly, because it</p>
<p>4 can <underline>never</underline> be completely objective, [but</p>
<p>5 I: [Mm</p>
<p>6 E: so anyway fairly, like fairly matter-of-fact is what I think and, (I: mm)</p>

<p>12 work there is this tacit knowledge and your personal (I: mm) your personal hunches</p>
<p>13 and (I: mm) the sort of feelings you get, when you work with the clients, then how to</p>

<p>21 I: [mm</p>
<p>22 E: [that this is not fact, something that’s, like, definitely so [but</p>
<p>23 I: [Mm</p>
<p>24 E: that this is my assessment of this situation (I: mm)</p></disp-quote>With her question, the interviewer calls forth the interviewee’s opinion on what case recording should be like. The question is different from those in the two previous extracts, in which the interviewer’s formulations were clearly more restricting and evoked more institutional talk. In her response, the worker begins to analyse the situation from her own viewpoint: ‘this is what <underline>I</underline> think (…)’. She first analyses the situation with a negative expression of how recording can never be completely objective, but nevertheless continues that it must be matter-of-fact. She describes the records as including ‘a fairly factual part’ which consists of things that have been agreed about, facts and concerns related to the particular situation. Starting on line 11, however, the worker begins to talk of a different type of information, which is ‘always talked about’ in social work. She calls this tacit knowledge it being based on ‘personal hunches’ and feelings that come up when working with clients. The worker describes that recording knowledge of this kind is enormously difficult. Nevertheless, she stresses the importance of including ‘some sort of basic feeling’ about the situation within the case records in addition to facts.</p>
<p>On line 20, the worker’s talk reflects the norm talk of case recording to the effect that the feelings and hunches she just mentioned should be clearly distinguished from facts. The worker also explains and corrects herself by saying: ‘I don’t mean you’d put in every hunch (…)’. This correction is a possible reference to an assessment of the moral appropriateness of her previous account (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1473325011400482">Nikander, 2002</xref>: 178). However, she continues to say that it would be good to convey ‘some of your feelings as well’, which again reflects the difficulty of assessing what are the appropriate feelings to be recorded concerning a client situation. In her talk, the worker makes the difference between personal feelings and facts by saying that facts are something which are ‘definitely so’, which leads to the conclusion that personal feelings are something else.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec8-1473325011400482"><title>Momentary Negotiation of Fact-based Case Recording</title>
<p>The final example illustrates how the norm of fact-based case recording is preferable, but as it can be subjected to negotiation it cannot be subscribed to as the only way of recording.<disp-quote>
<p><bold>Extract 4</bold></p>
<p>1 I: Well now, about the case recording, what do you think the case recording of client</p>
<p>2 work should be like? (5)</p>
<p>3 E: Now that’s something that has been talked about so much. Well, first of all, it should,</p>
<p>4 I mean, I think it should be, well, clear in words and er based on facts, that is factual</p>
<p>5 information. Though I don’t mean that you couldn’t sometimes put that you felt that the</p>

<p>8 (I: mm) but I mean it should be fairly accurate, fairly accurate and then I think the main</p>
<p>9 thing is if you make agreements, that the <underline>agreements</underline>, what’s been <underline>agreed</underline>, that all that</p>
<p>10 is put down clearly, so that, when the next person reads it, at the emergency</p>
<p>11 agency for example, when the next one on duty reads it <underline>or</underline> when it’s transferred (…)</p></disp-quote>Also in this extract, the interviewer elicits the interviewee’s opinion on what case recording should be like. After the question, the worker mentions that case recording has been talked about a lot, which suggests that the theme is topical. The worker then replies to the question by describing what she thinks case recording should be like. She describes how records should be clear in expression and based on facts, which reflects the normative character of talk about case recording. Immediately afterwards she corrects herself by saying: ‘though I don’t mean that you couldn’t sometimes put that you felt that the mother was tired or something like that (…). I also feel it is silly to say that the mother was tired. Well, maybe you can say it directly like that’. So in a way, in her talk, the interviewee momentarily negotiates the normative character of fact-based case recording that she just presented. Her talk reflects that the principle of only including facts in case records cannot be applied consistently, for sometimes it is possible to record something that is not quite a fact, such as a feeling about the case. Thus, she prefers to record cases in a way that brings in the author and his or her feelings about the case. Nevertheless, she continues that it is possible to record without reference to the author.</p>
<p>After her momentary negotiation of how to record cases, however, the worker begins to describe and emphasize how the recording should be accurate and clearly state all that has been agreed on. She justifies this with the special nature of emergency social work: the need to pass on information on what has been agreed to the next person concerned with the case. However, the worker does not account for the need to distinguish facts from other information, as was the case in the two previous extracts.</p></sec></sec>
<sec id="sec9-1473325011400482" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title>
<p>In this article I have demonstrated how the talk of fact-based case recording is produced in interviews with emergency social workers as ‘norm talk of good case recording’. Interviewees account for the shared and normal ways of doing case records and of complying with them (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1473325011400482">Garfinkel, 1967</xref>: 1, 35; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1473325011400482">Heritage, 1984</xref>: 103, 116). The interview participants are tied to talk of this kind. They mainly describe how to formulate and ‘show’ facts in a way that does not involve reference to the author or the author is effaced from view (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1473325011400482">Taylor, 2008</xref>: 31). However, the nature of facts is hardly explicated. As a result, the facts are taken for granted. Interviewees’ talk reflects criteria according to which the feelings, reflections and assessments generated in client situations should not be recorded at all, or, if they are recorded, they must be distinguished from facts. Consequently, facts are separated and placed in a different position in relation to the workers’ assessments and reflections about the case. Similarly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1473325011400482">Atkinson (2004</xref>: 18) observes in the context of medical practice, that physicians separate facts from opinions and actions and do not weigh them equally.</p>
<p>If the interview accounts are studied as expressions of culturally available accounts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1473325011400482">Gilbert and Mulkay, 1984</xref>), it could be useful to consider whether the norm talk of fact-based case recording can be seen as evidence of a professional account (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1473325011400482">Hall et al., 2006</xref>: 16–7, 20); this is how the emergency social workers are expected to record cases and justify their actions as professionals. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1473325011400482">Pithouse and Atkinson (1988</xref>: 185) notice: “ ‘good’ work is observed when the worker provides a ‘good account’ ”. In their interview talk, emergency social workers explain and justify the fact-based case recording and how they distinguish facts from other information through the particular nature of their work. They point out that they do not know their clients from before and that recorded information is usually transferred to other contexts, audiences and responsibilities. These obviously have an effect on the ways case records are formulated (for the effect of ‘audiences’ on case records, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1473325011400482">Askeland and Payne, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1473325011400482">Garfinkel, 1967</xref>: 200–1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1473325011400482">Hall et al., 2006</xref>: 89–106; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1473325011400482">Hardstone et al., 2004</xref>: 145–6, 149; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1473325011400482">Taylor, 2008</xref>: 37). The norm talk also reflects the context in which the talk was generated: as an institutional interaction, an interview can call forth a certain type of reporting by which the interviewee wants to justify his or her professional and personal identity to the interviewer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1473325011400482">Baker, 2003</xref>: 399; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1473325011400482">Hall et al., 2006</xref>: 16–7, 38; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1473325011400482">Juhila, 1995</xref>: 47). In addition, there are various laws and guidelines that regulate case recording in social work, which are, at least to some extent, reflected in the norm talk (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1473325011400482">Hall et al., 2006</xref>: 92).</p>
<p>The ‘facts’, mentioned by the interview participants, can be regarded as a kind of ‘information’ that is easy to transfer and store electronically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1473325011400482">Parton, 2008</xref>: 262). Thus the emergency social workers’ reflections, assessments and feelings can be regarded as ‘knowledge’ that is more difficult to put into words and record; things that are not yet certain but presumably important for the further understanding and handling of the case. However, my interpretations support the observations, that despite the (electronic) forms of writing, practitioners make their own decisions about how they record and present cases (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1473325011400482">Gubrium et al., 1989</xref>: 197; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1473325011400482">Peckover et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1473325011400482">Pithouse et al., 2009</xref>: 607–10; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1473325011400482">Shaw et al., 2009</xref>: 623; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1473325011400482">White, 2002</xref>: 431; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1473325011400482">White et al., 2009</xref>). As I illustrated, the norm talk of fact-based case recording may be subjected to negotiation, particularly when the emergency social workers consider recording their reflections, feelings and assessments regarding a case. I identified these as breaches of the normal way, which furthermore make the norm talk of fact-based case recording even more visible and reflect the moral assessments of non-compliant case recording.</p>
<p>Altogether, what constitutes a factual case is a complex issue, because different conflicting realities and the meanings and experiences brought by people to the social work encounters create challenges to knowing the ‘truth’ in each situation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1473325011400482">Trevithick, 2005</xref>: 24). The norm talk of fact-based case recording and distinguishing of facts from other information is interesting regarding the ethnomethodological idea of fact as something produced and accomplished in talk and action and not as a spatial, distinguished entity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1473325011400482">Garfinkel, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1473325011400482">Jayyusi, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1473325011400482">Zimmerman, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1473325011400482">1974</xref>). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1473325011400482">Smith (1978</xref>: 35) illustrates, the actual events are not facts, but ‘it is the use of proper procedure for categorizing events which transforms them into facts’. When applying ethnomethodological thinking in the practices of social work, it requires leaving behind the idea of a ‘fact world’ and allows the redirection of attention to the actual practices where the forms of knowledge are produced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1473325011400482">de Montigny, 2007</xref>: 113).</p>
<p>My purpose in this article is not to dictate how social workers should produce case records. Rather, my purpose is to show how fact-based case recording is produced as something preferred and taken for granted in the interview talk. Given that the case records are treated as ‘plain fact’ or true, my purpose is to increase an awareness of the selective and negotiable nature of accomplishing and recording ‘factual’ cases (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1473325011400482">Holbrook, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1473325011400482">Taylor, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1473325011400482">Taylor and White, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1473325011400482">Zimmerman, 1969</xref>: 338–45; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1473325011400482">1974</xref>). The interview talk reveals and reflects the multifaceted and ambiguous nature of emergency social work which creates tensions and challenges for constructing a factual case within case records. Particularly in the context of regional emergency social work services, there arises the question of how the actors can make sense of and reach a shared understanding about a case being ‘factual’, when the recording of and reading about the case shifts between different contexts (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1473325011400482">Bowker and Star, 1999</xref>: 290–3). Consequently, on the basis of my study, I suggest that in future we should challenge and study in yet more detail the apparently obvious nature of ‘facts’ regarding the production, recording, reading and transferring of a case.</p></sec>
