<abstract>
<p>This essay focuses on the mutations of a place. It looks at some small disappearances involved in large urban transformations by examining how a notable New York place called ‘Richmond Hill’, an estate centered in an 18th-century Georgian-style mansion and the hill on which it stood, was embroiled over its lifetime in commodifying or monetizing practices. These practices worked their way through it over time via certain transformative (and potentially transformative) situations, acts, events and personal financial difficulties. The essay looks, in particular, at the role of Aaron Burr, a key resident of the house, in this process; it considers the objectification of his personalized social values in the place and tensions for him between holding Richmond Hill intact and extracting its wealth in the form of monetary value by releasing it or parts of it to others. However, the discussion is concerned more generally with place-change. Examining change along three complex dimensions – a place’s material-sensual features/qualities, identity and location – it explores how commodifications came to decimate Richmond Hill’s primary mode of existence as a place. An old question about sameness and difference arises: when, for those who have known a place, does it become a different place? In concluding, the essay considers how the problematics emerging in place-change are recast as a spatiotemporal disturbance in the consciousness of two partly fictive New Yorkers attempting to revisit the place about 1830.</p>

<p>This essay focuses on the mutations of a place; it looks at some small disappearances involved in large urban transformations by examining the operation of certain commodifying or monetizing practices on a notable New York place called ‘Richmond Hill’, an estate centered in an 18th-century Georgian-style mansion and the low hill on which it stood (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1463499613483406">Figure 1</xref>). Initially located on Manhattan’s west side, just south of Greenwich (later Greenwich Village), in a rural landscape about a mile and a half above the city (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1463499613483406">Figure 2</xref>), the mansion originated before the Revolution, when wealthy New York elites such as merchants and government officials (among others), concerned with developing a refined lifestyle of social distinction, were building ‘country seats’ on Manhattan'’s east and west coasts. As the historian <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1463499613483406">Richard Bushman (1993: 25)</xref> notes for American houses of the time: ‘[a house was] a system of personal culture, as well as wealth and taste, giving … mansions the power to set apart some of the population as refined, polite and learned.’ These mansions were part of larger concerns with rank and aristocracy persisting in tension with democratic ideals after the revolution.

<p>The location of ‘Richmond Hill’ is marked by the name of the builder and first lessee of the land, Abraham Mortier. The southernmost portion of the map shows the built-up city of the time. Except for some of the city margins, the area north of the city consists of rural farms and estates, wooded areas, hills, salt meadows and streams.

</fig></p>
<p>Richmond Hill was named by one Abraham Mortier, paymaster general in the British army, who built the mansion about 1767 on a high point in some 26 acres of land obtained on a 99 year lease from Trinity Church. Little is known of what actually happened to Mortier, who may have died before or early in the Revolution. Set adrift from its primary leaseholder, but reverting to the control of Trinity Church, Richmond Hill survived occupancy by Washington and then British officers during the Revolution and, lacking any continuous family identity, travelled on through different leaseholders into early post-colonial and 19th-century worlds.</p>
<p>Anthropological studies of residential houses, despite their diversity of perspectives, have tended (with exceptions, e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1463499613483406">Herzfeld 1991</xref>) to examine houses as parts of larger problems in transgenerational inheritance, kinship and descent, or more generally, in connection with the constitution and perpetuation of social groupings (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1463499613483406">Bahloul 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1463499613483406">Carsten and Hugh-Jones 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1463499613483406">Goody 1962</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1463499613483406">Levi-Strauss 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1463499613483406">Joyce and Gillespie 2000</xref>). However, Richmond Hill offers an opportunity to consider how a place – by which I mean here Richmond Hill in its largest sense, including the house as the residential center of the estate, the closely linked hill on which it stood, and the more inclusive estate lands – was embroiled over its lifetime in monetizing acts, and impacted by certain practices making up the wider socio-economic fields of these acts. Crucial agents channeling this ongoing commodifying process into Richmond Hill were Aaron Burr and John Jacob Astor. I look in detail at Burr, the transitional figure, because in his case we can consider the objectification of his personalized social values in the place, and tensions for him between holding Richmond Hill intact and extracting its wealth in the form of monetary value by releasing it or parts of it to others.</p>
<p>Over time, diverse kinds of commodifications yielded fundamental changes to Richmond Hill along three critical dimensions composing a place’s mode of existence: <italic>material-sensual form</italic>, <italic>identity</italic>, and <italic>location</italic>. Here, I can merely note some specifics of each, to exemplify critical elements through which the changes are rung. Change itself, as we will see, performs its own temporal work, yielding at the minimum certain befores and afters, older-absent and newer aspects, which may derive from changes experienced in all or any of the place’s dimensions.</p>
<p>The <italic>material-sensual</italic> or <italic>aesthetic form</italic> of the place consists of features like a hill, house, street, trees, and so forth; and qualities, which I take to be elementary, diffuse aspects of one or more features. I view features as well as their noted qualities as manifestations of positive or negative aesthetic and socio-aesthetic values, but qualities make explicit just what, from the situated perspective of some subject, the relevant aesthetic or socio-aesthetic values of features are felt to be.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1463499613483406">1</xref></sup> The term ‘aesthetic’ is used here in its broad sense to pertain to the sensual (here, tangible/material) forms of things, places and processes. In the present essay, it refers to the way places are configured and given detail, texture, shape and other modes of substantiation in people’s experience and imagination. We will find that some qualities synthesize aesthetic with social value. The hill, for instance, was typically selected out as a positively valued, distinctive feature of the place, characterized by key qualitative, socio-aesthetic values such as ‘commanding’, ‘noble’ or ‘high’, while a ‘flat plain’ was noted by one observer as a disturbing, negative transformation of the ‘noble hill’.</p>
<p>Also exemplified in the case of Richmond Hill are certain relatively general or abstract kinds of positive qualities, such as ‘elegant’ or ‘beautiful’ (as conveyed, for instance, in the expression ‘nature’s beauties’). I suggest that qualities like these (or their negative counterparts)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1463499613483406">2</xref></sup> are meta-aesthetic: rather than being sensuous qualitative values characterizing specific features, they are appraisals, overt assertions that whatever they qualify has positive or negative aesthetic value. Such qualities in themselves ‘leave unspecified’, as the philosopher Alan Goldman (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1463499613483406">1990</xref>: 23) points out, what it is about the features or range of features they qualify that evokes their appraisals. Yet to the extent that qualities in general are aesthetic values, they too necessarily entail some element of evaluation; and sometimes the line between these ordinary qualities and the more abstract meta-aesthetic kinds is ambiguous. One can argue, nonetheless, that in the former, the act of evaluation is largely submerged in the sensuous quality, while the act of characterization is more overt and focal.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1463499613483406">3</xref></sup> So, for instance, the greenness of ‘verdant groves’ (Text 4) is a qualitative value which implicitly evaluates the groves positively, but does not in itself overtly assert this, as would the meta-aesthetic ascription of ‘beauty’.</p>
<p>Finally, it is important to note that qualities and features cannot be considered as isolates only. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1463499613483406">John Dewey (1958: 120)</xref> has pointed out in a different context: Qualities are ‘interacting not … simple and separate entities’. We will see diverse qualitative values with their features working together in larger spatial arrays – for instance, in brief descriptions by two different observers of the landscape stretching out from Richmond Hill, but also in other contexts. Such descriptions linger over the place attending to details; at their richest they unfold a texture saturated with features and qualities that give ‘perceptual vividness’ to the place, evoking felt experience of it (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1463499613483406">Thornton and Thornton 1962</xref>: 1, 2, 21 <italic>passim</italic>). Close viewings may also configure change – for example, by showing qualitative differences between ‘now’ and ‘then’ or by characterizing the motion of change itself as well as critical changes it has produced (see Texts 4, 5).</p>
<p>Turning now to <italic>identity</italic>. I take this dimension to include, on the one hand, different social categories or types of social use, such as (in the case of buildings) a ‘country mansion’ in contrast, say, to a ‘tavern’, each involving distinctive kinds of habitation and expectable activities. On the other hand, key inhabitants or proprietors particularize and animate the identity of a place. A place may in turn become integral to its inhabitants’ own identities, so that it manifests something of them (including their personal qualities) to others. But when inhabitants move away from a place, its particular identity (and sometimes a categorical identity) is altered. The particularized level of a place’s identity can also include a name like ‘Richmond Hill’, and at times a given name may be incorporated into a new name, even when a key inhabitant moves out – one way in which an older identity echoes in a new one.</p>
<p>Thirdly, the vexed concept of <italic>location</italic>. I distinguish here two aspects of a place’s location: on the one hand, its physical ‘position’ or ‘emplacement’; on the other, location in the sense of its variable spatial relations (near, far, north of, etc.) with other places (or relevant reference points), which can serve in a given case to specify a place’s whereabouts, relating it to the wider placeworld, within and by means of which it can be ‘located’. These two aspects of location obviously operate together, since to define where a given place is relative to some places or reference points beyond it at a given time presupposes its physical emplacement and that of places through which it is being located.</p>
<p>However, an aspect of a place’s location in the sense of its whereabouts may change without its emplacement changing if some other relevant place or places in the neighborhood materially move/disappear, or change identity and some different configuration emerges. When a place changes its identity, this is closely linked to physical movement, since it entails the departure of current key residents. Any stable place nearby is then no longer located near the same place, and if, for instance, a new business moves in afterwards, then the stable place is now located near this business. Moreover, if people locate a given place far outside the city in a rural landscape, but later new city buildings are built closer to it, then relative to the city at large, the stable place has changed aspects of its location, while remaining in the same position: it can now be located nearer the city’s edge, or near this or that city building or street that was not there before. And here as in other less comprehensive changes, absences have, of course, been created, since other places or features and qualities of the stable place’s surroundings have disappeared. However, we will later see both the physical mobilization of Richmond Hill altering its own emplacement and location, and also the mobilization, i.e. growth, of city streets and the construction of new buildings around it; all together, these moves radically alter Richmond Hill’s location vis-à-vis the built-up city as a whole.</p>
<p>In sum, the mutability of places may emerge in all three dimensions of a place I have discussed, aspects of which can be variously altered at different times or in connection with each other as the dynamics of place-change work themselves out. What we tend to experience or think of as the unity of any given place at some moment of its existence can become unsealed: something or someone goes missing; key departures and new entries effect one or another aspect of identity changes and these can then alter a place’s form; locative relations shift, crucial features and qualities disappear and so on. An old question about changes, sameness and difference (posed here in terms of place) arises: when, for those who have known a place, does it become a different place?<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1463499613483406">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>The main part of this essay is a narrative of changes: it considers how commodifications came to decimate Richmond Hill’s primary mode of existence as a place, by examining certain transformative and potentially transformative situations, acts, events and personal financial problems, which worked their way through it over time. Such changes do not, of course, merely operate in time; they also give time a specific form – in general, making absences and new pasts, as they make new forms of the present and, consequently, alter future potentials. I can only briefly note some of these temporalizations in passing. In the final section, however, decimating changes in Richmond Hill are viewed through the prism of a partly fictionalized encounter about 1830 by two New Yorkers trying to re-articulate their present with their past experiences of the place. Here, the problematics of place-change, involving disturbances in the three dimensions of place I have outlined, are recast as a spatiotemporal disturbance in consciousness – a break in the field of union between self and place (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1463499613483406">Bauman 1991</xref>: 75), requiring efforts at rectification through the protagonists’ actions and verbal narrations.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-1463499613483406"><title>II</title>
<p>The land of Richmond Hill began as a certain type of commodity, a long-term leasehold on which the mansion, considered as an ‘improvement’ to the land, was built by the leaseholder. As builder, the leaseholder’s control over the house was differentiated from that over the land. Blackmar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1463499613483406">1989</xref>: 9–10, 30) characterizes this control, which included the builder’s right to remove a house from the land at the end of his lease, as that of ‘ownership’. No explicit use of the term ‘ownership’, or the equivalent, is made in Trinity’s lease with Mortier, but I infer that the right of removal stated there, directing the house towards the builder and away from the land at the time when the land reverts to the possession of its owner(Trinity), marks out the ownership rights of each party to different resources.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1463499613483406">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>In his study of the making of the New York landscape, David Scobey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1463499613483406">2002</xref>: 107–8) points out that for land to become a ‘financial commodity’ required a process of habituation reformulating earlier entrenched emphases on the ‘stable proprietorship of land’. We can see the increasing elaboration of leasing practices in the latter half of the 18th century as part of a larger process involving alterations in the relations between monetary profits and land, which contributed to this change. Blackmar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1463499613483406">1989</xref>: 24ss.) has pointed out that land was shifting away from the more typical colonial pattern in which it was valued primarily as a medium for storing profits and manifesting wealth; for obtaining credit or transferring wealth to others; and importantly, for intergenerational, familial transmission. Becoming itself a source of monetary profit, land was, in effect, increasingly assuming the ‘money form’ in landowners’ imaginations, as an income-producing commodity. After the Revolution this direction was intensified, taking hold in such related financial practices as rampant land speculation and the division of large landholdings into lots for sale or leasing. Land was being filled with monetizing potentials and expectations, becoming more and more, as Eagleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1463499613483406">1990</xref>: 208) has put it in discussing Marx’s views of the commodity, ‘eccentric’ to itself.</p>
<p>Leases turned land into money for the landowner, who retained ownership while ‘conveying his right of possession to a tenant for a fixed term’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1463499613483406">McCurdy 2001</xref>: 22), in return for annual monetary payments. For instance, Mortier’s lease required payment to Trinity Church of an annual ground rent of £2 per acre for 33 years, with increases of £1 for each of the next two periods, on a 99 year lease of something over 26 acres. Of most interest here, however, are the tempting monetary potentials Trinity leases were embedding in land for the long-term leaseholder, who by Mortier’s time had the right to sub-lease or sell his lease in the same way that, as Blackmar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1463499613483406">1989</xref>: 32) puts it, he ‘could sell a title to land in fee’. However, the new leaseholder then paid annual rent to the owner, to whom the land would revert at the end of the lease. The builder’s right to let or sell the house would presumably have derived from his ‘ownership’. In the case of Richmond Hill, Trinity Church apparently transferred this right along with the lease, since the land with the house that Mortier had built on it reverted from Mortier to Trinity before the end of its term or Mortier’s sale of the lease. In any case, the next holder of Mortier’s lease could sell the house and the lease on the land. In these respects, the whole place was being infused with possibilities for future transaction to others beyond the original leaseholder and house builder. These monetizing potentials had a significant effect on Richmond Hill, as we shall see.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-1463499613483406"><title>III</title>
<p>But first a look at the place and its surroundings as shown in a more or less plenary, post-revolutionary state.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1463499613483406">6</xref></sup> I consider two descriptions, written at different times and from distinct perspectives, each of which invests the estate with related key qualitative values and features. The first (Text 1) is part of an historical overview by the 19th-century New York merchant Prosper Wetmore. Writing long after the place’s disappearance, Wetmore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1463499613483406">1872</xref>: 4–5) was familiar with the ‘memories clustering around … [this] spot’ of elderly people of his time; as well as with its ‘living traditions’; with Abigail Adams’ letters (see Text 2) about it and, probably, with Bryant et al. (see Text 5). He himself also remembers Richmond Hill as far back as 1813, a time when he says the mansion was still well preserved (1872: 9).</p>
<p>Wetmore (Text 1) presents a romantic description of the one-time landscape and extent of the ‘princely estate’ as originally stretching from the hill down through ‘groves of ancient trees’ out to the Hudson River. Just as the name of the house reflects its hilltop position, so the house’s own ‘imposing’ quality echoes the hill's ‘commanding’ or ‘conspicuous eminence’, and the house’s ‘spaciousness’ parallels the ample spread of the landscape within which house and hill are located. An earlier 19th-century account, with which Wetmore may have been familiar, similarly characterizes the house itself as ‘eminently conspicuous’, ‘an elevated … commanding sight’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1463499613483406">Francis 1858</xref>: 16, 17). We gain an image of the house and its inhabitants immersed in both a ripening natural and cultivated landscape of ‘tasteful’, ‘luxurious’ gardens in the style of English estates, displaying the care of Mortier, the original leaseholder, who had generously expended his fortune to ‘improve and ornament its grounds’. Thus Mortier’s own self-cultivation or ‘taste’ is displayed. This view of Richmond Hill invests it with what might be called a ‘status aesthetics’. Qualities of princeliness, ancientness, commanding eminence, tasteful cultivation and others mingle to form a brief but dense reiteration of noble or aristocratic qualities and features – the form of a particular felt place in which differentiated but coherent socio-aesthetic values spread a unitary feeling tone over the landscape.</p>
<p>If the house on the hill was a ‘commanding sight’, so also did the place command a fine view spreading out from the hilltop. We know this from Abigail Adams’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1463499613483406">1848</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1463499613483406">1947</xref>) late 18th-century descriptions in her well-known letters from Richmond Hill, where she and John Adams lived from 1789–90, when he was vice-president and the national government was lodged in New York. Made vivid in a letter (Text 2a, b) written early in her residence there is her experience of the house/hill as the center of a scenic world – a land she sees in its differentiated qualities as overflowing with plenty – radiating from and around her and the residents of the house. It is as if, along with the viewer, the house itself (which faces the river) becomes the pivot from which its surroundings are displayed in each direction: west, along the ‘noble Hudson’, boats carry produce to the city’s busy commerce from the Jersey countryside, which presents ‘to our view’ a ‘golden harvest’ across the river; ‘the right [north]’ … presents us with a view of [green] fields’; ‘On the left [south]’, ‘the city opens upon us’ partly concealed by the natural world – trees and a rise in the ground – ‘heightening the beauty of the scene’. Back of the house, she adds, surrounded by a hedge and ‘handsome trees’, is a ‘large flower garden’ which, she notes elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1463499613483406">Adams 1947</xref> [1789]: 13), has ‘a Broad gravel walk’.</p>
<p>Adams lays out the surroundings of her New York home as a unified picture in a shifting panorama of different ‘views’. Her description reflects habits of viewing and configuring ‘views’ familiar from late 18th-century English pictorializing landscape practices. This point can be confirmed in a poetic quotation appended to her account: ‘each step [as one ‘roves’ around] /Shall wake fresh beauties; each last point present/ A different picture…’. The reference here and in Adams’ preliminary comment (Text 2a) to nature’s ‘beauties’ recurs, we will find, in a much later letter by Aaron Burr’s daughter who saw the ‘beauties’, which for Adams had been so ‘lavishly displayed’, ‘daily’ disappearing from Richmond Hill.</p>
<p>Neither Adams nor Burr’s daughter specifies to what particular features and qualities they were applying the term ‘beauties’. However, looking for a moment beyond Richmond Hill to the writing of another 18th-century woman (quoted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1463499613483406">Bushman 1993</xref>: 132–3) visiting a southern ‘great house’, we can gain an idea of how this meta-aesthetic quality could be used to assert the aesthetic value of selected diverse particulars observed as one walks along: ‘As you draw nearer [the house] new beauties discover themselves, first the fruitful vine mantleing up the wall … next a spatious bason in the midst of a large green presents itself’. The qualities of these features – fruitfulness, spaciousness, largeness and greenness –display particular values which constitute the ‘beauties’ coming into her view. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1463499613483406">Bushman (1993)</xref> notes that ‘visitors [like this woman] to great houses [and their gardens] described them as if composing a picture’. Since space is pictorialized here in terms of a narrated walk, it is being shaped in a deictic, moving form centered in the walker; and here too, it would seem, each step ‘wake[s] fresh beauties’, as it does in the passage that Adams cites in describing the attractions of Richmond Hill.</p>
<p>Except for observing the uncared-for aspect (a lack of ‘perfect order’) of the trees lining the avenue to the Richmond Hill house – due, Adams says, to Mortier’s death some years before – Adams is unconcerned with manifestations of loss from Richmond Hill’s past. The Richmond Hill landscape world is revealed in its ‘here-nowness’, its presence as an engrossing aesthetic whole, including not just the place itself but the view that could be gained from the hill – showing Richmond Hill’s integrity with the wild and rural locale of that time. And in another letter Adams (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1463499613483406">1848</xref>: 346) writes lovingly of the ‘venerable oaks’ surrounding her and the ‘birds that serenade her’, which she tries to protect from the depredations of local boys.</p>

<sec id="sec4-1463499613483406"><title>IV</title>
<p>Yet the fracturing of this apparently seamless whole is not far off. Aaron Burr, as Richmond Hill’s long-term leaseholder from 1797 to 1803, and a resident in the house since 1793 (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1463499613483406">Isenberg 2007</xref>: 158, 456 n.83), activates the tensions in the place’s mode of existence between its value form as a refined, and wealthy family residence – through which desired socio-moral and economic status could be displayed – and its potentials for conversions into monetary value. Burr, we shall see, puts these commodifying potentials into motion in attempts to pay off debts resulting in part from his own involvements in land speculation – debts that haunted him, not unlike other men of standing of his time.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1463499613483406">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>Social networks of credit and debt are the circulatory routes that thrust land speculation and other sources of his many debts into Burr’s relation to Richmond Hill. Networks are notoriously sensitive to ripple effects: One person’s failure or inability to pay a specific debt might force him to call in debts from others, who in turn might have to call in their own debts, thus activating multiple creditor-debtor responsibilities. Burr was embedded in networks in which creditors and debtors might also be personal friends or kin, as well as professional acquaintances; friendships also seem to have been both reinforced and threatened within debt-credit relations. According to Nancy Isenberg (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1463499613483406">2007</xref>: 158), Burr’s most recent biographer: ‘Friends’ finances were interconnected; sometimes the tension, in letters, between a lender’s willingness to sacrifice and his anticipation of trouble was … powerfully felt by both parties.’ Moreover, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1463499613483406">Bruce Mann (2002: 7 <italic>passim</italic>)</xref> has discussed in his study of credit-debt relations in the late 18th-century social worlds of men like Burr, a man’s reputation was a crucial ‘nonfinancial’ element in his ability to obtain credit: credit and reputation were ‘inseparable’. In practical terms, one’s ability to borrow depended in part on a good reputation, which could in turn be tarnished by failure to pay one’s debts. A crisis was reached when creditors finally made claims in court against you, sending you to debtor’s prison, no matter your social status.</p>
<p>These kinds of credit-debt relations could be described as constituting a ‘moral economy’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1463499613483406">Mann 2002</xref>: 2, 258), but towards the end of the 18th century the synthesis of the sense of moral obligation with economic risk-taking was noticeably being fractured in the ‘frenzy’ of speculation (in government securities and bank stock, as well as in land), fraud and the expanding financial failures of the 1790s. Even wealthy, reputable individuals succumbed to the ‘addictive lure of speculative profits’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1463499613483406">Mann 2002</xref>: 192, <italic>passim</italic>).</p>
<p>The impact on Richmond Hill of Burr’s embroilment in a nexus of credit-debt relations can be illustrated by a simplified version of a case discussed in detail by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1463499613483406">Isenberg (2007: 155–7)</xref>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1463499613483406">8</xref></sup> The problem begins with Burr’s speculative purchase in 1796 of a share in a land tract in upper-state New York owned by John Angerstein, an English investor. This purchase involved him with a member of a company of Philadelphia land speculators, in particular a young merchant named James Greenleaf (apparently a previous professional acquaintance), with whom he joined in this purchase and for whom he also co-signed a bond as security. However, unbeknownst, it seems, to Burr, Greenleaf was corrupt, and had already embroiled his Philadelphia partners in attempts to fend off the effects of his dishonesty on their own debts and company finances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1463499613483406">Mann 2002</xref>: 199ss). After Greenleaf mortgaged his and Burr’s Angerstein tract to pay off his own debts, Burr became responsible for paying Greenleaf’s as well as his own share in the tract, plus the non-payment penalty on the bond he had co-signed for Greenleaf.</p>
<p>But some of Burr’s own long-term friends were caught up in the Angerstein speculation, which introduced further difficulties for him. Burr’s friend from the Revolution, John Lamb, had endorsed the promissory note Burr made out for his own share in the Angerstein property and had also loaned money to Burr at different times in the early 1790s. Now, just when Burr needed to call on him again, Lamb had his own problems: as the New York Customs Collector, he had become legally responsible for a corrupt subordinate’s theft of Customs money (although he himself was innocent), and he appealed to Burr to pay what he owed him. Also in Burr’s credit-debt network was another friend from the Revolution who had signed a bond enabling Lamb to assume his post; involved in Lamb’s debt, he had to call in an outstanding earlier debt from Burr. These debts from different times and sources now piled onto Burr at one time. In an effort to pay off some of his debts to Lamb, Burr at first offered him the Richmond Hill house, but Lamb (<italic>BP</italic> 3/29/1797), asking for full payment in some other way, wrote: ‘However desirable it might be to me to have your house on the terms you propose, yet if it will … enable you to settle with the holder of one of your notes, I consent to release you from your offer.’ Upset by Lamb’s problems and some added aggravations in their relation, Burr (in <italic>BP</italic> 5/4/1797) later wrote to Lamb that he had offered him ‘any part of my property which my debts might not absorb … for … neither Time nor injuries can diminish [my friendship].’ Here we see how monetary debts can entail intensely felt moral responsibilities – in tension, in this case, with Burr’s inability to repay. And Burr’s reputation was also affected, as gossip about his financial problems circulated in the Senate (of which he was then a member). As one Senator wrote of Burr’s debts at the time: ‘it is whispered that his money engagements are embarassing to him’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1463499613483406">Troup 1797</xref> in King 1894–1900: 136). In the following year, Burr was rumored to be ‘irretrievably ruined by speculation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1463499613483406">Sedgewick 1798</xref> in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1463499613483406">King 1894–1900</xref>: 311).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1463499613483406">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>Just after obtaining the long-term lease for Richmond Hill, Burr mortgaged the estate to secure title to land in a lower ward of the city, which he then sold to help pay Lamb and others. He also leased four lots of land from the Richmond Hill farmland, which he had recently had surveyed and mapped into lots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1463499613483406">Kline 1983</xref> [I]: 296). I will say more later about the spatio-economic implications of these practices of land segmentation; for the moment note that pieces of Richmond Hill land are now being sliced off (in lots) from the larger estate, as the problems posed for Burr by his cascading debts are shifting his attention from the place itself to its potential monetary value: Richmond Hill is becoming caught up in the credit-debt moral economy in which he is involved.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1463499613483406"><title>V</title>
<p>Consider then the impact on the house interior: many of Burr’s furnishings are now to be sold. The buyer, the British Consul, John Temple, may also have let the house from Burr – if so, whenever he moved out, the furniture presumably went with him, emptying the house.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1463499613483406">10</xref></sup> What we know about the furnishings comes from Burr’s (in <italic>BP</italic>, June 1797) inventory accompanying the deed of sale. The inventory lists items in two columns according to the named room where they are placed, but the relative location of the rooms to each other is not entirely clear.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1463499613483406">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>However, a glance at the rooms’ listed furnishings suggests many qualities and features that display Burr’s refinement and give us an idea of his sense of self as a ‘gentleman’. For instance, some items in rooms where visitors would have been entertained are characterized by the socio-aesthetic quality ‘elegant’: in the ‘Blue or Drawing Room’ were an ‘Elegant Turkey carpet’, ‘Elegant Brass Andirons’ and ‘Elegant Tea China’; other elite items in this room were, for instance, a ‘Large Looking Glass’, ‘Inlaid card Tables’ (card playing was a fashionable enjoyment of the time), and ‘Mahogany chairs [with] Hair bottoms &amp; Chintz covers’. In the ‘Dining Room’ there was another large looking glass and other fine items such as ‘Rush Bottom Chairs’ and a ‘Marble Side Table’. Assuredly, Burr fashioned his country house not only for his family but also for his reputation in the eyes of distinguished visitors.</p>
<p>As Pierre Bourdieu (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1463499613483406">1984</xref>: 77) has pointed out, ‘Every [house] interior expresses in its own language the present and even the past state of its inhabitants.’ But the inventory shows us Burr’s interior furnishings in transit to John Temple – a commodifying moment reflecting Burr’s present and past financial state, one which is detaching qualitative values from both mansion and self. The divestment reveals a fiction in the house’s interior: Burr’s elegant, wealthy material show is underlaid with indebtedness. In short, the ‘moral economy’ of credit and debt entangling Burr shows up not only in the severance of land but also in the house, which comes to embody this socio-economic field as a loss or absence of valued furniture with its contribution to the display of Burr’s status.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-1463499613483406"><title>VI</title>
<p>Leaving these disintegrative processes for a moment, consider the house interior as the location of key practices through which a mansion’s fame was made. The ‘fame’ of a mansion and its resident proprietor spread when it became known for its elegant dinner parties with notable guests whose names might be recalled in stereotypic legends of a house. For instance, one commentator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1463499613483406">Janvier 2000 [1894]</xref>: 204) remarks that in Mortier’s time, ‘[Richmond Hill] gained a reputation for liberal hospitality’. Among those hosted there, he notes, was Sir Jeffrey Amherst, after his defeat of the French in America. Looking back to the times of a previous generation, the late 19th-century writer John Mines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1463499613483406">1893</xref>: 179) characterizes Richmond Hill as a ‘famous house’ about whose ‘ancient glories I have heard from my grandmother, who had been a guest within its walls when it was the seat of culture and refinement’. Joining displays of refinement to what Catherine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1463499613483406">Allgor (2000)</xref> has called ‘parlor politics’, such parties opened the interior of a house to a larger sociopolitical world. The reputation of the proprietor and the house was, one might say, fed along with the visitors by these dinners.</p>
<p>Despite Burr’s ongoing difficulties with debt, Richmond Hill became known for his entertainment there of distinguished visitors. Nineteenth-century writers frequently mention Burr’s dinners with French dignitaries such as the Comte de Volney and Talleyrand, who probably discussed political issues of mutual concern with Burr; Hamilton and other national figures were also entertained there and so too the then famous Mohawk Indian chief Joseph Brant, a distant marital connection of Burr’s (see Isenberg <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1463499613483406">2007</xref>: 94; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1463499613483406">Parton 1858</xref>: 154).</p>
<p>Just before the escalation of his problems with debt, Burr had invited the needy young painter John Vanderlyn to stay at Richmond Hill (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1463499613483406">Oedel 1981</xref>). From Philadelphia, Burr wrote a letter, probably to Vanderlyn, introducing Brant, who was travelling to New York (Text 3). The letter establishes Brant’s lifestyle as manifested in his ‘elegant’, English-style house and the ‘hospitality’ and ‘taste’ characterizing his life there. Qualities of Brant’s house are also qualities of Brant, for the house is the material place-form both enabling and displaying his lifestyle – the way he lives (with taste and hospitality) and the house he lives in (‘elegant’, in Burr’s appraisal of its qualities), which mutually shape and reflect each other. Burr also points out that Brant has been received by English nobility and is ‘well-informed’. Brant is thus put in a class of gentry, evocative of ‘aristocracy’. Showing the juncture of a man’s self and his house, the letter portrays a refined lifestyle which makes Brant an appropriate visitor and opens up to him the hospitality of Burr’s own mansion.</p>
<p>Burr (in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1463499613483406">Stone 1872</xref>: 416) also wrote a letter for Brant to his daughter, Theodosia. Burr’s wife had died some years before, and at age 14 Theodosia became known as the brilliant hostess of his parties during Burr’s fulfillment of his senatorial duties in Philadelphia. In this letter, Burr refers to Brant as ‘much renowned’. With polished courtesy towards Brant, he emphasizes his perfect English and wide foreign travels, instructing Theodosia to receive him ‘with respect and hospitality’. Burr’s hospitality to Vanderlyn at Richmond Hill, and the visits there of Brant and others, rebound to the favorable reputation of both house and proprietor – mingling in a contradictory way with the financial distress which was beginning to penetrate the place and presage still further monetary predations on it.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-1463499613483406"><title>VII</title>
<p>In 1799, Burr (5/22/1799: 24) put an ad in the <italic>Mercantile Advertiser</italic> to let the house with its gardens and any amount of surrounding acreage. Whether or not the place was then rented, its commodity potential was now being foregrounded. As Burr’s finances press ever more insistently, they yield an increasingly rapid tempo of efforts to create the means to pay. In 1801, when he was vice-president, he writes Theodosia, now married and living in South Carolina, that he is seeking to sell Richmond Hill, and excitedly following up a possibility. But after much negotiation the deal is ‘blown up at the moment of counting the money’ (Burr 11/20/1801, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1463499613483406">Davis 1837</xref> vol. 2: 159–160).</p>
<p>Despite these and other efforts during this time to sell or otherwise press money out of Richmond Hill, in the summer of 1802 Burr turns his attention to the place as his personal residence. Writing to Theodosia as he expects her imminent arrival for a visit in New York: ‘All your friends here are well … We are all in the bustle of moving [presumably from Burr’s town quarters?]. Heighho! for Richmond Hill’ (Burr 8/08/1802 in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1463499613483406">Davis 1837</xref> vol. 2: 210). In these years after Theodosia’s marriage, Richmond Hill has been emptied of family, except for the occasional visit. Earlier the same summer, Burr writes poignantly to his adopted daughter Nathalie, who had grown up with Theodosia and was soon to be married, that although he will be visiting both her and Theodosia in the future in South Carolina: ‘We should not, however, abandon New York. I will have you both here, if possible, every year and at Richmond Hill you shall renew the happy hours of your childhood’ (7/05/1802 in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1463499613483406">Davis 1837</xref> vol. 2: 205). For a rare moment we see Burr investing Richmond Hill with emotional attachment and pleasure rather than with monetary needs. Significantly, this expression is made by referring to Natalie’s and Theodosia’s childhood instead of his own feelings apart from these family bonds– thus he seems to have made his own emotional identifications with Richmond Hill through its vivification by his family’s presence. For the house emptied of this vitality had led him to write Theodosia just after her marriage: ‘I approached home as I would approach the sepulchre of all my friends. Dreary, solitary, comfortless. It was no longer home’ (3/29/1801 in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1463499613483406">Davis 1837</xref> vol. 2: 385). But this summer he is thinking ahead optimistically to summers of returns by both daughters to New York. If only for a moment he thinks of Richmond Hill as the place where they would all be together again in the future, as in the past. Only a little ring of uncertainty echoes in the phrase in his letter to Nathalie – ‘if possible’,</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-1463499613483406"><title>VIII</title>
<p>Nonetheless, in 1803 Burr sells most of the Richmond Hill leasehold to the merchant and land speculator John Jacob Astor. This includes what is now described in the lease geometrically as the ‘parallelogram’ of land with the house on it, but a separate agreement is then made for this section along with some adjoining lots laid out in the larger sale. However, Burr’s residence in the house is not yet ended. Special financial arrangements with Astor for the house and these lands enabled him to live there and regain this part of the property in five years, barring default on interest and annual payments to Astor.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1463499613483406">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>Perhaps Burr is looking optimistically ahead to this re-acquisition when soon after the sale he writes Theodosia for her opinion on ‘exchanging’ Richmond Hill with four acres for ‘Roger Morris’s place, the large handsome house on the height [in northern Manhattan overlooking the Harlem River]’ (Burr 11/22/1803 in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1463499613483406">Davis 1837</xref> vol. 2: 246).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-1463499613483406">13</xref></sup> Theodosia (12/10/1803, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1463499613483406">Davis 1837</xref> vol. 2: 252–3) responds that Richmond Hill may currently be worth more in monetary value, but that it ‘has lost many of its beauties, and is daily losing more.’ (Recall Abigail Adams’ allusion to Richmond Hill’s landscape features as the place’s ‘beauties’.) ‘If you [wish to retain it as your residence but] sell part’, she goes on, ‘you deprive it of every beauty save the mere view.’ We get a sense of the estate with its desirable qualitative values shrunk to the immediate surroundings of the house. Morris’s, on the other hand, has the island’s ‘most commanding view’ and is said to be ‘indescribably beautiful’. Theodosia envisions ‘how many delightful walks can be made on one hundred and thirty acres! How much of ‘your [Burr’s] taste displayed! … There is to me something stylish, elegant, respectable and suitable to you in having a handsome country seat. ‘The qualities of the Morris place (its ‘beauty,’ ‘handsomeness,’ ‘commanding view’ and vast acreage) would display Burr's elegant, stylish tastes. Richmond Hill, in contrast, is beginning to become wanting.</p>
<p>One imagines that Burr’s ‘taste’ could also be tangibly revealed to visitors as they walked around with their host. Possession of such a country seat provides an expansive space for the display of self to others, giving Burr qualities of gentlemanliness that Theodosia admiringly thinks he already has, but should also have reflected back on him from an appropriate habitation. As we have seen in Burr’s own view of Brant, such tangible displays fashion one’s identity in a medium manifest to others outside of one’s bodily person. The paradox is that Richmond Hill, which displayed Burr’s reputation as a gentleman, was mortgaged, fragmented, and now sold largely to help save Burr and his reputation from the economic and moral degradations of debt.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec9-1463499613483406"><title>IX</title>
<p>But it is not debt that abruptly wrenches Burr from Richmond Hill a year after the place’s sale to Astor, although his reputation was, indeed, at stake. It is, rather, the famous duel with Hamilton, which involved what the historian Joanne Freeman (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1463499613483406">2002</xref>: xix, xxi <italic>passim</italic>) describes as a ‘personal form of politics’ with ‘reputation at … [its] heart’. In the era’s national politics, she argues, a ‘culture of honor’ fueled by gossip, underlaid duels among political elites. Politicians spread propaganda attacks on each other through letters to friends (who spread them further) or sometimes through published gossip; becoming too slanderous, such gossip could strike at a man’s ‘honor’, and the pain of ‘character inquisition’ inflicted on the victim could trigger a duel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1463499613483406">Freeman 2002</xref>: 131). Before the duel, Burr’s friend and second (cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1463499613483406">Knapp 1835</xref>: 99) wrote in response to a letter from Hamilton: ‘Colonel Burr can only reply that secret whispers, traducing his fame, and impeaching his honour are … equally injurious with slanders publicly uttered … [and Hamilton had] no … right to use any such … expression.’ In this context we can understand Burr’s bequest to his son-in-law in a letter written the night before the duel: ‘I commit to you all that is most dear to me – my reputation and my daughter’ (cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1463499613483406">Parton 1858</xref>: 351). Burr held his public name, like his most immediate family, as a treasured aspect of himself.</p>
<p>It was from Richmond Hill that Burr went out for the duel to New Jersey (duels being illegal in New York at the time) and to which he returned afterwards, not realizing that Hamilton was dying. After a few days closeted at Richmond Hill – prompting rumors among the aroused populace that he had closed himself off there and was ‘transacting business with all the unconcern possible’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-1463499613483406">14</xref></sup> – Burr fled New York. This vision of the house as a secretive enclosure of Burr’s supposed insouciance in the face of tragedy reverses its role as a place of hospitality and desirable reputation.</p>
<p>A few months later, even more strapped financially, Burr sold the remaining land from the estate to Astor. Although he returned to New York some years later, attempting unsuccessfully to re-appropriate the place, Burr never again lived at Richmond Hill. In the aftermath of his departure, the house started to become unhinged from its original identity as a private residence. As one commentary put it, looking back on this event from the end of the century: The duel ‘terminated … [Burr’s] career and with it ended the fame of Richmond Hill’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1463499613483406">Hill and Waring 1897</xref>: 231). Severed from Burr's personal ruin and his contradictions, the house and hill now take off on their own separate roads to ruin.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec10-1463499613483406"><title>X</title>
<p>Burr’s sale of Richmond Hill to Astor was a watershed in its career, not simply because of the change of hands but because of the hands into which it was changed. Astor occupied a different socio-economic niche from Burr’s in New York’s changing socio-economic world. Neither New York gentry nor with family roots in an old, prestigious family, like Burr, and not part of the national political scene, Astor was by origin a German who had arrived in the city after the Revolution and with some prior help from a British relative sought to make a living on his own. Deriving his initial capital from money amassed in the fur and overseas China trades, he then turned to land speculation, soon regularly investing part of his considerable profits in speculating on Manhattan land. A shrewd merchant capitalist and far-seeing speculator who developed his important financial connections as a part of his business ventures, he did not, unlike Burr, who lacked this kind of self-productive capital, have to rely financially on external networks of kin and personal friendships to help pay his debts and aid his speculation. Nor did he purchase the Richmond Hill leasehold for his own residence – the place never became part of his personal or familial identity. Rather, he saw his purchase of Burr’s leasehold strictly in terms of its financial futures: his aim was to turn the land into money not only through resale of long-term leases on the lots purchased from Burr but also through rentals that further provided a repetitive means of annually yielding money for him on the same land in the future (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1463499613483406">Haeger 1991</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1463499613483406">Porter 1931</xref> on Astor’s business practices). Astor early foresaw the increasing value over time of land north of the city: he was, in effect, the wave of the future in New York. Richmond Hill, as we shall soon see, would be laid hold of by his practices and tangibly transformed.</p>
<p>Underpinning this transformation, however, was the place’s changing location relative to the city: streets were expanding northward and Greenwich Village growing south in the two decades following Burr’s sale to Astor. In 1803, Astor was engaging in long -term speculation on the city’s northward trend. Although in 1811 the city was still located almost a mile south of Richmond Hill, by 1820 building was reaching into the Richmond Hill area. This urbanizing motion transformed the land itself, destroying the rural landscape, moving on ‘runners’, one might say, of lots and streets, often first prefigured in plans by individual owners (or leaseholders like Burr) seeking to subdivide their lands for maximally profitable sale or lease.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-1463499613483406">15</xref></sup> After 1811, when the grid plan for all streets north of Houston (then North Street) was adopted, the city was empowered to regulate all new streets; these included those below the southern limits of the city’s plan as in the area of Richmond Hill, some already planned by individuals. Leveled streets, and land segmented into repetitive, angular building lots lined along them, themselves laid the geometrized shape-aesthetic of commodification and expectations of commodifiability, hence of speculation and development, into the land, which in this way took on the form of monetary circulation (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1463499613483406">Scobey 2002</xref>: 126).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec11-1463499613483406"><title>XI</title>
<p>Between 1806 and 1820, when Richmond Hill was becoming relocated nearer and nearer this incoming urbanscape, but still lay within a more rural topography, Astor advertised it for let at different times (see below). The place now shifts from being a house with a resident leaseholder in whom its identity is anchored, to being one occupied by short-term rentals who do not enduringly give their identities to the place. John <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1463499613483406">Randel (1864)</xref>, who traversed Manhattan surveying it for the city’s grid plan, remembers many years later his walks from the city to his office in Greenwich Village between 1808 and 1810: ‘I followed a … path … from the city to the then village of Greenwich, passing over open and partly fenced lots and fields … remote from any dwelling … except Col. Aaron Burr’s former country seat on … Richmond Hill … then … a place of refreshment for gentlemen taking a drive from the city.’ This ‘place of refreshment’ was likely the ‘tavern and [public] garden’ of Anthony Bowrosan, who rented Richmond Hill about this time (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1463499613483406">Garrett 1978</xref>: 498–9), but Randel, recognizing that Burr was no longer resident at this time, nonetheless still had Burr's name fixed in his mind as its last memorable inhabitant. Bowrosan himself (cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1463499613483406">Garrett 1978</xref>: 498–9), in advertising his move to Richmond Hill refers to it as ‘the spatious, airy house … lately occupied by A. Burr’, thus attempting to carry over the gentrifying aura of its previous personal identity for his business.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-1463499613483406">16</xref></sup> Burr’s recent connection with the place is drawn to mind by the ad: his identity re-enters the house as its recent past, forming a mnemonic continuity within the disarticulation of change itself.</p>
<p>Bowrosan’s tavern and garden marked the emergence of another kind of house on Richmond Hill, one serving the gentry ‘Dinners, Relishes, [and] Coffee’, according to the ad. For the first time, those who came to eat and drink at Richmond Hill were paying visitors. The label ‘garden’ is significant: it refers here to a ‘pleasure garden’, a public house with an outdoor garden where entertainments were often held. The ‘garden’ of a commercial establishment carries over a sense of the private garden, here of a country seat. The conversion of identity into that of a commercial establishment is now beginning to enter Richmond Hill, but not yet entirely: Astor still offered the house for let to private, ‘genteel’ families between the time of Bowrosan’s and 1820. In 1811 Dewitt Clinton (then New York’s governor) lived in the house, but in 1812 and again in 1814 Astor (12-09-1814: [4]) advertised it for rent. In 1814, for instance, he offered the ‘beautiful Villa Richmond Hill, with … land and outhouses … garden and sufficient grass for a cow and a pair of horses’ with low rent for a ‘genteel family’. In this ad, however, we find the house identified with land cut in size, probably to about seven acres (as stated in Astor’s previous 1812 ad). As this and other ads suggest, ‘The premises [were] diminished in size and attraction’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1463499613483406">Wetmore 1872</xref>: 9).</p>
<p>We have seen that Wetmore recalls the mansion itself as still well-preserved in 1813. He remembers its ‘tall columns’ supporting the porch at an ‘imposing height’ over its ‘broad entrance’; the balconies fronting the [second storey] rooms … and … [its] distinction altogether beyond the ordinary … dwellings of that day’. Still standing also was a ‘spacious gateway … between … ornamented columns’ at the outer entrance [northeast of the house]. Yet ‘the grounds … reduced in size, by the interposing barriers of newly opened streets … no longer extended to the river’ (1872: 9). The increasing dismemberment of its lands contradicts the preservation of features and architectural qualities of height and breadth, which along with the spacious, columnar gateway (reiterating these qualities), give the house ‘distinction’. The house remains unmoved from its old position but is becoming out of sync with its wider, now fragmenting location, showing it comes from another time, an earlier landscape. So also its singular elite identity, as we have just seen, is being overtaken by the transiency of renters – at least one of them commercial. Remarking on the house’s rentals in this era, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1463499613483406">Wetmore (1872: 9)</xref> says: ‘And thus as time passed on, the fortunes of Richmond Hill declined.’</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec12-1463499613483406"><title>XII</title>
<p>Decline they did – quite literally. By 1819 street development was about to envelop the hill. The City commissioners leveled Varick Street to a grade much lower than the hill’s elevation. The hill was ‘dug away from under [the house]’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1463499613483406">Bryant et al.: 1830</xref> II: 342). In 1820, Astor had the house lowered from the hill. According to the mover’s notice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1463499613483406">Brown 12/27/1820</xref>: [3]), ‘it was removed … 55 feet [south] ‘with chimnies standing’, and 30 feet down to what later became the corner of Charleton and Varick streets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1463499613483406">Garrett 1978</xref>: 500). One contemporary writes: the house was ‘rested on a cradle or sliding-ways, and launched to the desired locality and grade’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1463499613483406">Haswell 1896</xref>: 97–8). Absence is concretized in Wetmore’s mournful vision (Text 4) of the relocated house sitting sadly engulfed in the leveled, ‘noisey’ world of ‘streets and avenues’, with ‘all its grandeur’ shorn away, ‘stripped’ and ‘despoiled’ of what Abigail Adams called its natural ‘beauties’ – crucial qualities of its original status aesthetic. Now commodification practices in the shape of multiple business ventures, featuring forms of public entertainment, come to repeatedly inhabit the house, taking over its identity. A business called ‘Richmond Hill Garden’ was first announced as opening there. A newspaper notice (cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1463499613483406">Garrett 1978</xref>: 500) advertised ‘that beautiful House which so recently attracted thousands to see lowered from the top of what was called Richmond Hill’. Also announced was the laying out of a ‘spacious … handsome [‘enclosed’] garden … for … grand-gala Exhibitions of Fireworks [and] Concerts’; the house itself would ‘be fitted up for … genteel company, with Music room, Reading room … [and high quality] Wine[s]’. As a commercial enterprise within which money circulates for the purchase of its entertainments and other commodities, the house with its new garden now has to make its own living: in effect, it takes on and internalizes monetizing transactions as its own. As the container of these transactions, which has been refashioned to their required socio-aesthetic form, the place has to be understood as a special kind of commodity with a locative structure, one which collects certain other commodity forms and monetizing practices within it.</p>
<p>Obviously, the ad was intended to attach the aura of Richmond Hill to its new commodity form. Set up as a public pleasure garden, the old place’s identity is drawn forward in name into the new form and identity. The announcement evokes connections and separations reminding the reader of the house’s removal from its hill in a popular event which involved the ‘beautiful’ house in motion, taking on a new position and mode of being, while the hill (with its landscape),the house’s one-time position, recedes into its past. The house is configured in a range of ambiguities that connect while differentiating the new and the old: the ‘spatious’ garden echoes the old garden (but with an enclosure, and very different enjoyments); the ‘genteel’ company to be attracted to the house echoes the elite visitors; the old name of Richmond Hill joins the term ‘Garden’ to form the new name. In this way the advertisement ghosts certain desirable elements from the immediate past into the place, giving them an aspect of presence, while absence is being shown. The place is spatiotemporally and mnemonically reconstructed.</p>
<p>Richmond Hill Garden lasted a year under this name, with a new proprietor adding more varied garden entertainments, one week presenting, for example, singers, conjurers, trained dogs, and ‘the well bred Elephant Columbus’, and another week, operas, ballets, etc. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1463499613483406">Garrett 1978</xref>: 508). Still failing to earn its keep, the house was empty again for five years. In 1828 it was occupied by a public house and boarding house called ‘Richmond Hill House’, which we will have reason to note again later. During its seven-year tenure, a theatre for operas and musicals (called the ‘Richmond Hill Theatre’) was attached to the house or built on its grounds – this construct with its new identity further altered the material form of the place.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-1463499613483406">17</xref></sup> Although opened with fanfare, the theatre lasted a mere six years, outliving the ‘Richmond Hill House’ by two years. The nominal connection to Richmond Hill now becomes murky and then vanishes. In 1840, the place becomes the ‘Tivoli Saloon and Garden’, the phrase ‘late Richmond Hill’ being occasionally appended; with the garden and ‘some building’ (probably the 1831 theatre according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1463499613483406">Garrett 1978</xref>: 514) refurbished into a saloon, the whole place under this name lasted with new management and further refashioning for three years. Following a period of emptiness, a circus, a theatre and an opera house, each with its own name, sequentially occupied the theatre (perhaps by this time become the whole house?) through 1847. And then the place was empty again (for these changes see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1463499613483406">Garrett 1978</xref>: 513<italic>ss</italic>). So over time the connection of the place to its primary identity blurs in the circulation of successive, failed establishments and vacancies, until finally the house ends, as John Mines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1463499613483406">1893</xref>: 279) recalled, as an abandoned ruin. In 1849 (a year after Astor’s death), the lease having reverted from Astor to Trinity Church, the house was torn down and the land segmented into lots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1463499613483406">Garrett 1978</xref><italic>:</italic> 521ff.); the house and remaining grounds, as earlier the hill and the larger estate with its landscape, disappeared into the city streets and lots, leaving empty sites for future development.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-1463499613483406">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>In this last phase of its life, the old house entered into the rapid shifts of identity and fleeting commodity shapes, the disappearances and yielding-up of space to potentials for something new, often identified with capitalist modernity – as in Marx and Engels’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1463499613483406">1962</xref>: 16) famous expression ‘all that is solid melts into air’ and the conservative economist Schumpeter’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1463499613483406">1947</xref> [1942]: 83) notion of capitalism as an ongoing process of ‘destroying the old … creating … [the] new’; or Berman’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1463499613483406">1988</xref>: 98–99<italic>ss</italic>) interpretation of Marx and Engels’ concept of the solid world disappearing – ‘innovative self-destruction’, figuratively, ‘everything that bourgeois society builds is built to be torn down’. The commodifying mutations afflicting Richmond Hill were only one version of a larger processual pattern of change from the 1820s or ’30s, catching up elite private residences in the lower city south of Richmond Hill. As wealthy families moved out of the downtown, escaping the growing population and commercialization, their old homes were not necessarily torn down but, typically, as with Richmond Hill, a new identity was created inside the old house, tangibly altering the old into the new. Old residences commonly became multi-tenant boarding houses, then with further material alterations might change into warehouses, and finally be torn down (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1463499613483406">Munn 2004</xref>). Whatever the commodifying mode or sequence, any given place identity was only, as one journalist put it, a ‘migratory state’ (<italic>The Evening Post</italic> 1/7/1845). The spatiotemporal quality of the rapidity of change was the leitmotif of this sense of places as always being on the way to something else.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec13-1463499613483406"><title>XIII</title>
<p>I turn now from this trajectory of commodifications to look back at change as it appears in an encounter with the mansion about 1831 when the place was probably ‘The Richmond Hill House’, the boarding house mentioned above. Unlike Adams’ first-time experience of Richmond Hill as an engrossing presence in 1789, this encounter problematizes the actors’ experience of what is manifest to them in the present: it asks in effect: ‘Can this be the same place as the one encountered when we were here before?’</p>
<p>The story (Text 5) is partly fictional. Developed from the writers’ actual ramblings around New York and their discussions of the old places they encountered, it is presented as the experience of two imagined protagonists: the aristocratic representative of the previous generation, ‘Mr. De Viellecour’ (whom I call Mr. V.)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-1463499613483406">19</xref></sup> and the story’s younger narrator, ‘Mr. Herbert’, a pseudonym for the author-editors of <italic>The Talisman</italic>, where the essay appeared (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1463499613483406">Godwin 1883</xref>, v. 1: 237–241). Their city walk conveys the authors’ concern with the loss of old houses and landscapes in New York where ‘alterations … [are] so rapid that a few years … sweep away both the memory and the external vestiges of the generation that precedes us’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1463499613483406">Bryant et al. 1830</xref> (2): 338).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-1463499613483406">20</xref></sup> The stereotypic trope, ‘sweep away’, condenses the sense of a space being fast emptied of the configuring power of the past (whether in history, memory or tangible forms). Although New Yorkers were generally pleased and excited by many of their city’s changes, a sense of generational discontinuity and disturbances of memory are underlying themes in the experience of rapid place-change in New York in the antebellum era (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1463499613483406">Munn 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>In Text 5 Mr. Herbert and his elderly friend, Mr. V., are out on a city walk during the latter’s last visit to the city where both men had spent their youth. The houses and leveled streets they now traverse [5a] are unfamiliar to the walkers, who remember a topography of ‘hills … marshes and rivulets’ where Mr. V. used to hunt birds (cf. Adams’ worries about the birds, above) and Mr. Herbert later played. Although nothing present ‘awaken[s] a recollection’ of that previous landscape, the men know that where they are now is the same spot where they engaged in these activities. But the features of that prior world have been ‘found missing’ (to use Heidegger’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1463499613483406">1962</xref>: 105) phrase), so that their remembrances are skewed relative to what shows itself ‘here’ and ‘now.’ Leveling and building have not just reconfigured the area but also the relation between it and the walkers, giving them a sense of displacement.</p>
<p>It is as if the place has lost its temporal depth, becoming divided into separate two-dimensional frames: the place currently being encountered and the one encountered in the past are connected only by the walkers’ certainty that they themselves are positioned where the features and qualities of the older place once were; they should be able to apprehend one place with temporal depth but they can’t quite do so. Since present and past have fallen away from each other in the spot where the returnees are, recognition is not self-evidently given but problematized in the encounter.</p>
<p>[5b] The case of the mansion is different. The old house itself is not ‘missing’; rather, appearing unlike the buildings around it, it seems wrongly located, out-of-place, as it were. Its architecture implies it comes from an earlier world. The house reminds Mr. V. of one he ‘remember[s]’ although he is not sure he recognizes it as <italic>this</italic> house, given its spatial confinement in a ‘little gravelly courtyard’ and the impoverished qualities of the trees around it, in contrast to the oak-shaded lawn and woods he remembers; above all, this house is not on a ‘noble hill’ with commanding views but is now located on ‘a flat plain’. Whether the house is really the one he once knew is problematic yet, apart from the missing hill and landscape location, the house seems to him to resemble ‘exactly’ the one he thinks it is. His present experience is now coming together with his memories, but it is still a bad fit: he notes this-and-that difference from his recollections, as if feeling his way around the question of whether he knows the place or not.</p>
<p>[5c] Only after entering the house does he claim certainty about its identity. Confirming this recognition, he finds he knows his way around the house interior, climbing the ‘wide staircase’ distinguished by a ‘mahogany railing’ with an ‘accustomed’ air. Mr. V.’s memory of the house and his present encounter with it are now joined in bodily movement, a non-verbal recognition showing that not only his recollections but also his expectations of spatial relations, features and directions sedimented in his memory are becoming reliably re-embodied in the present encounter. There is, in Edward Casey’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1463499613483406">1987</xref>: 149) words, an ‘active immanence of the past in the body’. This sense of reconnection evokes historical reminiscence as the second floor is reached. Mr. V. says: ‘Here, was the dining room’, and proceeds to a vivid description of the seating arrangement and the eminent guests’ identities and elegant clothing during a state dinner in the time of Vice-President Adams’ residency. Claiming to have been there, he includes his own seating among the guests and verifies his humorous tale about the French ambassador’s presentation, by attesting to the pâté’s ‘excellence’. Not surprisingly, it is the recognition of the old dining room in the present public house which has effloresced into a lively reminiscence of a long-past dinner there.</p>
<p>[5d] After evoking the house’s historic past, the old man walks out on the balcony only to find that the expected view is not there; in this present reality, his memories and expectations seem to have no place. Instead of this view, he sees city buildings and ragged boys playing on sidewalks. The scenic view once spread out from the house, and giving it control over an extended space, has disappeared. Although now accepting this as the remembered house, he is uncertain how it got ‘so much lower than formerly’. His younger friend has to explain the city’s role in ‘abasing’ the house to the topographical and social level of its current more humble neighbors. In short, missing is the mansion’s earlier hilltop position with its external features and their qualities. The older man’s moment of immediate recognition, which occurs inside the house, is bracketed by moments outside it in which his puzzlement is foregrounded. His companion’s explanation, relating the changes to city-enforced leveling, may rationally explain what has happened, but Mr. V. responds [5e] by reproaching New Yorkers for ‘defacing’ the house by removing it from its ‘eminence’, its ‘old situation’. In effect, this displacement has also moved it out of its proper temporality: for only if emplaced as before would its present ‘aspect’, in Mr. V’s view, have evoked its historic past.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec14-1463499613483406"><title>XIV</title>
<p>To sum up the problem posed in this encounter: I conclude that Mr. V. is having the sort of unsettling experience at Richmond Hill House which Gelder and Jacobs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1463499613483406">1998</xref>: 22) – drawing, in another context, on Freud’s well-known concept of the experience of a familiar place rendered unfamiliar – have characterized as one of ‘being in place and “out of place” simultaneously’. However, Mr. V’s experience is not due, of course, to repression, as in the Freudian theory of the familiar becoming unfamiliar, but to the fact that the place itself is ‘out of place’ and this is what creates the ambiguity in consciousness.</p>
<p>For Mr. V. the old ‘aristocrat’, the loss of the hill with the qualitative values it embodied for him is key. What happened to the hill symbolically condenses the loss of sensual qualities of landscape, connected back to the country placeworld of an 18th-century gentry (including its post-colonial version), together with the emergence of the new features and qualities into which this elite world with its ‘beauties’ was disappearing: a placeworld of leveled streets and building lots portending a densely built-up cityscape that, as I have suggested, was laying the qualitative shape of monetary circulation onto the land. But it also points to the shifting away towards another era in New York in which elite status, epitomized by wealth in land, was changing its medium into one epitomized by circulating financial wealth. Richmond Hill began its life as part of the early phase of these changes and condensed the process of transitioning into itself.</p>
<p>In closing, I return to the query raised in my initial comments on mutability: when does a particular place, which changes piecemeal over time, become for those who knew it (or knew about it) at some earlier time a different place? There is, of course, no single answer to this question, which we may presume varies not only for different individuals but also in different contexts and from different cultural perspectives (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1463499613483406">Sahlins 2002</xref>: 9–11). But in the case of Mr. V’s and his friend’s visit to Richmond Hill, the question is reconfigured: the issue of sameness and difference is explored in an experience-based form in which Mr. V is trying to determine whether this is or is not the same place as the one known before. Recognizability is the pivot on which the question of the unity or disunity of past and present turns, and Mr. V’s movement through space is the journey through which the responses shift as he moves from outside the house to the interior, upstairs to the dining room, and outside again to the balcony. Each position in his journey alters the relation between his memory of the past and his present encounter – can past and present be fully joined into one or not? It is to this perplexity entering into the experience of a changed place, in which the place, I have suggested, is both familiar and unfamiliar and the subject ‘both in and out of place’ at once, that Mr. V’s experience of Richmond Hill draws our attention.</p>
<p>Nor is Mr. V. alone. In fact, in the next decades, one can find the experience of the multiplicity of place-changes in New York figured in terms of tropes that convey the undoing of familiarity and the problematization of recognition of the changing, growing city as a whole: in the extreme, coming back to New York after many years may even be imagined as like being a total stranger ‘dropped from a balloon’ into the foreign city of London where one has never been before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1463499613483406">Lyon 1984</xref>: 6)This trope portrays a New York with so many places transformed or gone, that it has verily become a different place and the returnee a stranger–yet he is not a stranger, he has been here before.</p>

In Goldman’s formulation, ‘base properties’ like color, for example, are not aesthetic values but rather, the ‘objective components of evaluative properties’ like elegance, or beauty. Contrary to Goldman’s distinction, I take whatever material-sensual qualities (his ‘properties’) are attended to in a given case to be aesthetic values in themselves and consequently to entail some element of evaluation in this sense. Goldman’s model, I would add, emerged in the context of a long, complex conversation between analytic philosophers of art, which goes beyond my concerns here.</p></fn>

<fn id="fn9-1463499613483406"><label>9</label><p>The link between the provision of monetary aid and maintaining the reputation of a friend, the recipient, who is in need of the money to pay his debts, is made explicit in a letter to Burr from a friend, Peter Van Gaasbeck. There had been some problem in the transmission of certain promised money to Burr. In his apologetic explanation, Van Gaasbeck (1 Feb 1797, <italic>BP</italic>, Reel 4) wrote: ‘I would sooner sacrifice every farthing than to wound the reputation of so deserving a Friend.’</p></fn>
<fn id="fn10-1463499613483406"><label>10</label><p>Burr did not sell all his furnishings to Temple. It is well known that he excluded at least his precious collection of library books, for which he and the house were renowned, and his fine wines. On Temple’s sublet at this time see Parmet and Hecht (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1463499613483406">1967</xref>: 20), and for his residence there in 1797 see Wetmore (1876: 6). However, an advertisement Burr placed in the Mercantile Advertiser (16 May 1799) indicates Burr was attempting to let the Richmond Hill house some two years later; this suggests that even if Temple had been letting the place (which is not entirely certain) he had now left or was planning to leave by this time.</p></fn>
<fn id="fn11-1463499613483406"><label>11</label><p>To my knowledge, there is no satisfactory account of the layout of the rooms, and their use by Burr; nor, to my knowledge, is there a surviving builder’s plan of the house. A rudimentary description of the interior is given by Abigail Adams in an early letter (1946: 17–18): ‘You enter under a piazza into a Hall &amp; turning to the right Hand ascend a stair case which lands you in an other [hall?] of equal dimensions of which I make a drawing Room. It has a Glass door which opens into a gallery the whole Front of the house.… The Chambers are on each side.’ This plan conforms broadly to a Georgian or so-called ‘Palladian’ style laid out along large halls in both the upstairs and downstairs. The stairwells to the upper storeys were important routes of passage bringing visitors up into rooms for their entertainment. The parlor, however, was usually downstairs according to Bushman’s (1993) descriptions, but may perhaps have been upstairs in Burr’s house, along with the dining room (cf. Adams’ account with Bryant et al., Text 5 below).</p></fn>

<fn id="fn13-1463499613483406"><label>13</label><p>This refers to the Roger Morris mansion (currently known as the Morris-Jumel mansion), which still survives. The practice of arranging an exchange instead of a sale was not uncommon at the time, as suggested by various real estate advertisements. Burr did not continue to explore the possibility of an exchange, but ironically, the house later came into the hands of Madam Jumel to whom Burr was briefly married much later in his life.</p></fn>

Other anecdotes about Burr’s actions in the house at this time resonate with this view, and also with one of James Cheetham’s widely circulated attacks on Burr – both in an earlier context and after the killing of Hamilton – as being wrapped up in himself’ (cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1463499613483406">Nolan 1980</xref>: 53, 59).</p></fn>
<fn id="fn15-1463499613483406"><label>15</label><p>Consider the difference between the description of land in Mortier’s lease from Trinity Church (1767) and Burr’s sale of his lease to Astor. The former lays out the land in terms of natural markers, topographic features and bordering landowners’ names; apart from ‘Greenwich Road’, which bounds a northwest sector of the land, the only other bounding road is a ‘new road’, unnamed at the time. The lease begins, for instance, ‘at a large marked Chestnut tree against the land of Nicholas Bayard and running… south… [and westward]… to a new road laid out within a chain of Leonard Lispenard’s meadow. But by the time of Burr’s sale to Astor the land is marked out primarily by streets such as Greenwich and Brannon (later renamed ‘Spring’) and segmented into a long list of numbered lots which Burr had mapped out. All that remains of the landscape markers is ‘the old marked Chesnut Tree which was the place of beginning of the land formerly granted to Abraham Mortier’ (Aaron Burr to John Jacob Astor, Assignment and Trinity Church Lease of Richmond Hill Farm, <italic>BP</italic> 1983: 10/1803).</p></fn>

<fn id="fn17-1463499613483406"><label>17</label><p>Early sources mentioning the theatre vary regarding its location relative to the house (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1463499613483406">Garrett 1978</xref>: 508 for his evaluation of each view). One view was that the theatre was attached to the back of the house, another that it was on the grounds; still another regarded the house itself as altered with the theatre taking over the house. An undated picture (in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1463499613483406">Homberger 2002</xref>: 77, Fig.18) shows the front of the house expanded for the theatre. However, Garrett (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1463499613483406">1978</xref>: 508) points to evidence that in 1831 the house was being run as a ‘hotel’ (called a ‘pub’ and ‘boarding house’ in the cited ad). Furthermore, Prosper <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1463499613483406">Wetmore (1872)</xref>,who was present as an invited guest at the formal opening of the theatre (initially an attempt to attract an elitist audience to the area), says ‘About the year 1831… a new building [was] constructed in the rear, connected with the principal edifice and running back… to form… The Richmond Hill Theatre.’ Perhaps the enlargement of the house occurred later on, when the theatre took over all the entertainment, apparently absorbing the place’s entire offerings. In any case, I follow Wetmore’s and Garrett’s assessment regarding the initial theatre.</p></fn>
<fn id="fn18-1463499613483406"><label>18</label><p>There is one ghostly re-appearance. During the reconstruction of Varick Street and the excavation of the Seventh Avenue subway in 1913,the destruction of old houses on the street led to the brief emergence of a mural fragment said by some of the oldest residents to be from the stage of the Richmond Hill Theatre. According to one resident these ‘faded murals’ were in a stable fronting on Varick street, which the owner used to say was a part of the theatre ‘as altered from Aaron Burr’s residence’. Unconcerned, <italic>The Times</italic> remarked that workers would soon be excavating the Seventh Avenue subway under the garden and ‘handsome trees’ admired by Mrs John Adams (Anon, <italic>New York Times</italic>, 12/11/1913 electronic edition).</p></fn>

<p><bold>1.</bold> This princely estate, so well known to our elderly citizens [was] situated on a commanding eminence, surrounded by groves of ancient trees [and] extended, through intervening vales to the shores washed by the waters of the Hudson. The hand of art and the guidance of taste had adorned its broad expanse of cultivated grounds with the luxuriance of gardens, arbors and shrubberies; while Nature lent to the perfection of the landscape … the ripening influences of her beneficence…</p>
<p>… [Mortier] erected on [this] conspicuous eminence, a spatious and imposing edifice to which he gave the designation ‘Richmond Hill’. He speedily commenced … on a scale of generous expenditure [using ‘no small part of his fortune’] to improve and ornament its grounds. (Prosper <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1463499613483406">Wetmore 1872</xref> Appendix II: 8–9 in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1463499613483406">Stone 1872</xref>).</p>
<p><bold>2[2a]</bold> I write you, my dear sister … from the peaceful borders of the Hudson … where the hand of nature has so lavishly displayed her beauties, that she has left scarcely any thing for her handmaiden, art, to perform.</p>
<p><bold>[2b]</bold> The house in which we reside is situated upon a hill, the avenue to which is inter-spersed with forest trees, under which a shrubbery rather too luxurious and wild, has taken shelter, owing to its having been deprived, by death, some years since of its original proprietor, who kept it in perfect order.</p>
<p><bold>[2c]</bold> In front of the house the noble Hudson rolls its majestic waves, bearing upon his bosom … innumerable small vessels, which are constantly forwarding the rich products of the neighboring soil to the busy hand of a more extensive commerce. Beyond the Hudson rises to our view the fertile country of the Jerseys, covered with a golden harvest. … On the right hand [northward], an extensive plain presents us with a view of fields, covered with verdure, and pastures full of cattle. On the left [southward], the city [New York] opens upon us, intercepted only by clumps of trees, and some rising ground, which serves to heighten the beauty of the scene, by appearing to conceal a part. In the background [at the back of the house] is a large flower garden, enclosed with a hedge, and some very handsome trees. On one side of it a grove of pines and oaks … (Abigail Adams, 27 September 1789. In: A. Adams (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1463499613483406">1848</xref>: 343–4). [The garden is described in an earlier letter (12 July 1789) as having ‘a Hawthorne hedge and Rows of Trees with a Broad Gravel Walk’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1463499613483406">Adams 1947</xref>: 18)].</p>
<p><bold>3.</bold> Yesterday dined with me, the King of the Mohawks, Colonel Brandt [<italic>sic</italic>] – he has left town [for New York] this morning with a letter of introduction to Theodosia. … Colonel Brandt has an elegant house in the English style in the midst of his nation … and lives with great taste and hospitality.’ [Burr also notes Brant’s association during his visit in England with ‘nobility and gentry’] … you may ask him to breakfast with you, if he accepts, let Theodosia ask … [Burr names two respectable New York residents] to be of the party. … They will be pleased to meet so well informed…an indian’ (Burr to [John Vanderlyn?], 2/26/1797, Burr Family Collection, Ms.Grp.#303, Yale University Library; in Burr Papers, reel 4).</p>
<p><bold>4.</bold> The ‘premises followed the fortunes of other localities; the street commissioner made his influence felt; streets and avenues were opened; … hills disappeared … until at length the old Richmond Hill mansion found itself shorn of all its grandeur, stripped of its verdant groves, despoiled of its gardens and lawns, sitting sadly far beneath its former altitude, at the noisey and somewhat unsavoury corner of Charleton and Varick Streets. Its stately portals no longer opened wide to welcome the entrance of distinguished guests from foreign lands. (Prosper <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1463499613483406">Wetmore 1872</xref>: 9–10, appendix)</p>
<p><bold>5. [5a]</bold> [We] took a walk … over what I recollected as the [boyhood] playground of myself and my companions … and what Mr. De Viellecour remembered as the spot where his contemporaries at an early period used to shoot quails and wood-cocks. We passed over a part of the city which in my time had been hills, hollows, marshes and rivulets without having observed anything to awaken … a recollection of what the place was before the surface had been levelled and the houses erected, until, arriving at the corner of Charlton and Varick streets, we came to an edifice utterly dissimilar to anything around it. [It was] a wooden building … with a [lofty] portico supported by ionic columns … [and] its [whole] appearance distinguished by that Palladian character of … ornament, which indicated … it had been built about the middle of the last century. [We both stopped involuntarily before it.]</p>
<p><bold>[5b]</bold> ‘If I did not see that house on a flat plain,’ said Mr. De Viellecour, ‘penned in by this little gravelly courtyard, and surrounded by these starveling catalpas and horse-chestnuts, I should say at once that it was a mansion which I [very] well remember, where in my youth I passed many pleasant hours in the society of its hospitable owner. … That house resembled this exactly, but then it was upon a noble hill, several hundred feet* in height, commanding a view of the river and the Jersey shore. There was a … fine rich lawn around it, shaded by … venerable oaks … and skirted on every side by a … natural wood of … [many] acres.</p>
<p><bold>[5c]</bold> … Perceiving it to be a house of public entertainment, [we entered it] [and] … went into a spacious hall opening up to a more spacious room, with a small room on each side, opening to more spacious apartments beyond. ‘Yes,’ said Mr. Viellecour, ‘this is certainly the house I spoke of.’ … With the air of a man accustomed to the building, [he] opened a side door … and began to ascend a wide stair-case with a heavy mahogany railing. … [Going into a large second-storey room:] ‘Yes’, said my friend, here was the dining room. There, in the center of the table sat Vice President Adams, in full dress … his hair frizzed out each side of his face, as you see in Stuart’s older pictures of him. [There follow details of the eminent guests, their elaborate clothing and their seating position at the table, including Viellecour’s own seating. A central figure in this tale is the French ambassador ‘in his red-heeled shoes and ear-rings’ who, declining ‘all the luxuries of the table … from the roast beef down to the lobsters’ distributed to the guests instead his own specially prepared ‘warm pie of truffles and game.’] … I can attest to the truth of the story, and the excellence of the <italic>pate</italic> [said Mr Viellecour].</p>
<p><bold>[5d]</bold> [After suggesting that they] go, and look at the fine view from the balcony, [Mr Viellecour] seemed disappointed at finding the view he spoke of confined to the opposite side of Varick street, built up with two story brick houses, while … ragged boys were playing marbles on the side walks. ‘Well,’ said he, ‘the view is gone, that is clear enough; but I cannot … understand how the house has got so much lower than formerly.’</p>
<p>I [Mr Herbert] explained to my friend the omnipotence of the [City] Corporation, by which every high hill has been brought low … and by which … this house had been abased to a level with its humbler neighbors. …</p>
<p><bold>[5e]</bold> ‘This is wrong,’ said the old gentleman, ‘These New-Yorkers seem to take a pleasure in defacing the monuments of the good old times … depriving themselves of all venerable and patriotic associations. This house should have been continued in its old situation, on its own original … eminence, where its very aspect would have suggested its history (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1463499613483406">Bryant et al. 1830</xref>: 338–342).</p>
