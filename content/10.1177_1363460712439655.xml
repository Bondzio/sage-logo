<p>This article traces the ways in which masturbation has been studied and subsequently regulated through sexology and sex education in western contexts as a way to manage the sexuality of people with intellectual disabilities. Masturbation training in sexology and sex education represents one of the few sanctioned approaches for individuals with intellectual disabilities, and similar approaches to masturbation emerge in prisons, nursing homes, military bases, and residential institutions. The complicated relationship between HIV and masturbation also plays an important role in this discussion. The discourse around disease and infection prevention at times reinforces masturbation as a suitable expression of sexuality. In exploring how and why masturbation is either promoted as an appropriate expression of sexuality or as a sign of deviant sexuality for people with intellectual disabilities, a larger analysis is required in order to connect the organizational, political, and spatial contexts of masturbation training for individuals with intellectual disabilities. How is masturbation as well as other forms of sexual expression regulated?</p>
<p>Sex education materials for individuals with intellectual disabilities generally promote appropriate sexuality as nonreproductive, solitary, yet oriented toward the opposite sex. Expectations of pleasure and desire are absent from sex education, perhaps because educators’ discomfort with disabled sexuality results in limited promotion of sexual expression. Neoconservative ideologies of family, reproduction, and disease masquerade as discourses of prevention, while dictating specific kinship structures for individuals with intellectual disabilities. Reflecting these educational ideologies and methods, masturbation training in the case of individuals with intellectual disabilities reveals similar assumptions about nonnormative sexuality, discipline, and surveillance. Masturbation training teaches individuals how to masturbate in safe, appropriate, and effective ways.</p>
<p>Using as a point of departure two scenes from a 1975 American film, <italic>The ABCs of Sex Education for Trainables</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1363460712439655">Brecher, 1975</xref>), in which two people are either praised or reprimanded for masturbating, I show how sexuality for individuals with intellectual disabilities is simultaneously programmed, restricted, and professionalized by different training methods for the purpose of curbing public masturbation. The assumption that individuals with intellectual disabilities ought not to masturbate publicly or with multiple partners underscores most discussions. Generally, denying individuals the ability to consent to mutual or more public forms of masturbation results in the promotion of masturbation as a private, solitary act. Eugenic thinking – that the reproduction of generations of people with intellectual disabilities is against social evolution – also influences the discussion. Finally, expectations of appropriate sex/gender roles influence discourses about how to practice ‘appropriate’ masturbation. The restrictive binaries of good and bad, appropriate and inappropriate dominate discussions of sexuality for people with intellectual disabilities, and they demand explanation and critique. In the end, the paradoxical question arises: Where can one masturbate in private, when one is incarcerated in a facility that denies, disallows, and prohibits privacy? Obtaining privacy to express sexuality as an extension of personhood becomes a necessity for individuals with intellectual disabilities. Masturbation and the promotion of the training for individuals with intellectual disabilities provide, I argue, a unique vantage point to discuss how the sexuality of institutionalized groups such as prisoners, people in group homes and other types of residential institution falls under regulation and restriction in everyday life and reveals underlying assumptions of sexuality as grounds for institutionalization.</p>
<sec id="sec1-1363460712439655"><title>The ABCs of sex education: Masturbation as sex</title>
<p>Events in the 1970s changed public perceptions of sexuality and reproduction in the USA. These events are commonly called ‘The Sexual Revolution’. Lieblum and Rosen describe the 1970s as displaying a ‘burgeoning of enthusiasm for all things sexual – from ‘masturbation training groups’ to Sexual Attitude Reassessment seminars, from ‘sex shoppes’ and California hot tubs to ‘swinging clubs’, from ‘open marriage’ to the flourishing of casual and anonymous sex’ (1988: 1). <italic>Roe</italic> v. <italic>Wade</italic> legislated a woman’s right to choose an abortion to end a pregnancy in the first trimester, even while the Hyde Amendment restricted federal funding for these abortions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1363460712439655">Nelson, 2003</xref>), the result being that even with legal abortion, women of color still were subjected to reproductive control and sterilization abuses in the USA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1363460712439655">Roberts, 1997</xref>). Half the states in the USA removed sodomy statues from their laws, and in 1974 homosexuality was no longer seen as a mental disorder by the American Psychiatric Association (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1363460712439655">D’Emilio and Freedman, 1997</xref>: 324). Pornography was also highly visible, with ‘thousands of movie houses featuring triple-X rated films’ and adult bookstores selling ‘hard-core sex magazines and paperbacks’ throughout the USA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1363460712439655">D’Emilio and Freedman, 1997</xref>: 327–328).</p>
<p>This redefinition of sexual practices and norms was made partly possible through the development of a market for sex, pornography, sex therapy, and other things related to sexuality. With this new market came consumers with their purchasing power. Simultaneously, many in the USA also saw individuals with intellectual disabilities living in deplorable conditions, particularly because of Geraldo Rivera’s investigative reporting about Willowbrook State School. Carey (2009) describes how during the 1970s additional focus was given on the sexual needs of individuals with intellectual disabilities.</p>
<p>Accordingly, attitudes toward masturbation and individuals with intellectual disabilities softened in the 1970s. For example, professionals advocated the use of lemon juice as opposed to electric shock therapy to ‘correct’ masturbation behavioral issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1363460712439655">Cook et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1363460712439655">Tarnai, 2006</xref>: 153). In one such intervention, parents and teachers would carry portable containers of lemon juice that would be squirted into an individuals’ mouth when he masturbated in a public location (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1363460712439655">Cook et al., 1978</xref>: 132). The use of lemon juice was also used when an individual would masturbate ‘excessively’. Cook and colleagues conclude that lemon juice as a masturbatory deterrent is both effective and more humane that subjecting individuals to electric shock therapy.</p>
<p>In 1975, Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania helped produce a film titled, <italic>The ABCs of Sex Education for Trainables</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1363460712439655">Brecher, 1975</xref>). <italic>The ABCs</italic> acts as a training film – training staff members about sex education while also providing content to teach. The film is narrated by an older white professional man, Richard Dix, a semi-popular television actor from the 1970s and 1980s. At the beginning of the film the A, B, and C of sex education are explained as: A – awareness of bodies and feelings, B – the mechanics of reproduction, and C – training in responsibilities and social behavior. The 20-minute film is divided into three sections, often cutting back to the narrator in between re-enactments of professionals teaching and individuals with intellectual disabilities learning about sex.</p>
<p>The film currently has a fairly significant cult following. For example the movie can be viewed online on websites such as Google Video or YouTube. Additionally, there is a group dedicated to the film on Facebook. This international attention fueled by internet technology is not largely of individuals with intellectual disabilities, but rather of nondisabled individuals who are interested in the film for its content. Much in the same way that the movie <italic>Reefer Madness</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1363460712439655">Gasnier, 1936</xref>) is viewed and openly mocked for its portrayal of the harmful effects of Marijuana usage, <italic>The ABCs</italic> is likewise mocked for showing the sexuality of intellectually disabled individuals.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1363460712439655">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>The internet response to the film displays how the sexuality of people with intellectual disabilities is received in this age of globalized sexual identities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1363460712439655">Altman, 2001</xref>). One of the better-known scenes in the film involves a female teacher asking a group of co-ed students with disabilities the various names for penis. The students shout out the following: Prick, Peter, Cock, Rod, Dick, Meat, Ding Dong, Wand, Wiener, Tool, and Joint. The film recommends this naming activity as an appropriate and effective training technique to reduce apparent stigma around the male sex organ. However, many people in the internet communities referenced earlier find this scene pejoratively hilarious, thus pointing to one way in which the sexuality (or sexual knowledge) of intellectually disabled individuals is ridiculed by the larger public. These comments are often layered with discriminatory and hateful language based on ableism and male superiority that not only sees sexual knowledge as objectionable but also evoke historical sentiments about sterilization and elimination as effective ways to manage the sexuality of people with intellectual disabilities.</p>
<p>In one of the re-enactments in the film, there is a younger looking white man, perhaps in his middle to late teens, lying alone on his bed with his blanket covering all of his body except his face. The boy, identified as Ricky, is clearly masturbating, although the viewers only see the blanket rise and fall around his waist. The scene does not actually ‘show’ Ricky masturbating; however, the implication that he is doing so is clear. As Ricky is masturbating, his mother suddenly appears from behind the closed door to his room. His mother tells Ricky that she saw what he was doing and that she knows it feels good. She then tells him that it is respectable that he is doing it in the privacy of his own room and that she will knock next time before she enters the room. As a whole, the scene is reminiscent of many younger males’ experiences of being discovered masturbating; however, since Ricky’s mother walked in on him masturbating, the mood is especially embarrassing. It is Ricky’s mother who of course is not acting appropriately in this scene, but she uses her violation of personal privacy as an opportunity to teach a lesson that is already known.</p>
<p>This scene contrasts with a later scene in the film in which a group of individuals with intellectual disabilities are drawing. As the group is drawing pictures of their choosing, one individual, Sandy, a white woman is touching her genital area on top of her clothes while seated at the table with the other people drawing. Sandy is told by the professional overseeing the drawing activity that her behavior is not appropriate in this public setting. Sandy ignores the prompting of the professional and resumes touching her clothed genital area. At this moment, the narrator explains that sometimes individuals need to be removed from public settings for displaying sexual activities. The film <italic>Dealing with Sexually Inappropriate Behavior: Masturbation and Sexually Provocative Behavior</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1363460712439655">Stevens, 1996</xref>) promotes a similar type of management for public masturbation in nursing homes. While the film explains that expression of sexuality is a need, it also encourages nursing home staff to send residents who masturbate publicly to their rooms. The film also discusses how residents have little to no privacy in the nursing home, thus effectively making private masturbation more difficult because nursing staff have unrestricted access to patient rooms. Moreover, one nursing supervisor in the film comments that nurses have observed male patients urinating and quickly assumed the patients were masturbating, suggesting that some staff members are always on the lookout for ‘inappropriate’ sexual expression. Much like disabled people’s sexuality, older people also face discriminatory views from various professionals as well as the general public about their sexuality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1363460712439655">Bauer 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1363460712439655">Walker and Ephross, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1363460712439655">Walz 2002</xref>). Barriers to sexuality for elderly persons, especially in nursing homes and assisted living facilities include lack of privacy, lack of information, and staff oversight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1363460712439655">Bauer 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1363460712439655">Bauer, Nay and McAuliffe 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>In <italic>The ABCs</italic> Sandy is represented as inappropriately sexual, while Ricky is displaying his sexuality properly. The presence of other people and the spatial difference between Ricky’s bedroom and Sandy’s workshop are important factors in determining the appropriateness of masturbation highlighted in the film. In addition, the combination of female gender with intellectual disability frequently results in intellectually disabled women being seen as exceedingly sexual, thus recalling histories of eugenic regulation of sexuality for this population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1363460712439655">Garland-Thomson, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1363460712439655">Razack, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1363460712439655">Snyder and Mitchell, 2005</xref>), whereas physically disabled women often report being seen as asexual.</p>
<p>These two scenes in the film highlight a binary between ‘good’ and ‘bad’ expressions of sexuality within a limited parameter of masturbation. While good sexuality happens in private, individuals are not always afforded privacy even when they are in their own rooms. There is no guarantee that mothers, nurses, roommates, and staff will not enter your room. A lack of privacy reflects an individual’s status as disabled where ‘professionalization hinges on being able to invade privacy while divorcing that invasion for its sexual associations’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1363460712439655">Siebers, 2008</xref>: 145). In certain locations, including nursing and group homes, the relationship between sexuality and privacy is directly related to assessments about professionalization and ability as well as competence and dangerousness. Even benign activity has the potential to be considered as sexual. Touching of the genitals is seen as sexual regardless of the intent. Even if the touching is sexual in nature, often individuals are removed to their rooms without an explanation of why the activity is inappropriate. The binaries of good and bad, appropriate and inappropriate, private and public point to the contested terrains in which many individuals with intellectual disabilities negotiate their sexuality.</p>

<sec id="sec2-1363460712439655"><title>Masturbation frequency for prisons, militaries, and intellectual disability</title>
<p>Masturbation issues, including frequency and location, are often discussed in the professional literature. While <italic>The ABCs</italic> does not address how to teach individuals masturbation techniques, masturbation training has a long history in sexology in general and intellectual disabilities in particular.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1363460712439655">2</xref></sup> Regulating masturbation becomes a tangible way to secure good health and prevent ‘degeneration’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1363460712439655">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Havelock Ellis, a sexologist in the early 20th century, thought that when women masturbate they experience ‘marital aversion’, and thus eventually upset gender roles for men and women by making women not dependent on men for marriage, support, and ultimately sexual gratification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1363460712439655">Ellis, 1942</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1363460712439655">McGaughey and Tewksbury, 2002</xref>: 138–139). In contemporary sex therapy, it has been hypothesized that teaching women how to masturbate to orgasm could be an effective way to counter hypoactive sexual desire disorder, which indicates low desire for engaging in sexual activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1363460712439655">Zamboni and Crawford, 2002</xref>: 124–125, 138–139). Sexologists caution that masturbation training can ‘lead to consistent orgasms, which could increase sexual desire’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1363460712439655">Zamboni and Crawford, 2002</xref>: 125). Consistent orgasms are believed to stimulate consistent sexual interest while mitigating low sexual desire. The underlying belief is that sexual desire is normal and low desire is a condition that needs to be corrected with sex therapy. While historically masturbation was thought to cause degeneracy and mental illness, it ‘continued to be a morally fraught, much thought-about arena of human sexuality – indeed a critical component of what came to be understood as ‘sexuality’ – long after it stopped being regarded as a cause of real physical harm’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1363460712439655">Laqueur, 2003</xref>: 16). The meaning behind masturbation fluctuates based on historical situations. The rhetoric of masturbation as beneficial or harmful works as covert and overt mechanisms for controlling sexuality in western civilization throughout the 20th century (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1363460712439655">Laqueur, 2003</xref>). This historical context is important to underscore when thinking about how masturbation practices for certain populations of people, including those with intellectual disabilities becomes monitored. Why are the masturbatory practices of certain groups of individuals consistently scrutinized?</p>
<p>When it comes to frequency of masturbation, Kinsey and his associates determined that 92% of men and 62% of women interviewed had masturbated at some point in their lives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1363460712439655">Kinsey, 1948</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1363460712439655">1953</xref>). The Hite Report in 1976 found that 82% of females interviewed masturbated, while the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1363460712439655">Janus Report of 1993</xref> found that 55% of males and 38% of females were regular masturbators, meaning daily to monthly masturbation. Additional studies completed in the 1990s found that a significant percentage of men and women masturbated on a frequent basis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1363460712439655">Michael et al., 1994</xref>). These studies confirm that masturbation has been a conventional practice for the US public historically, and also a constantly monitored and recorded practice as a central part of sexuality.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1363460712439655">4</xref></sup> As Soble notes, ‘we [the US public] advertise our marriages and brag about our affairs, but keep our masturbatory fantasies to ourselves. The masturbatory closet remains shut’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1363460712439655">Soble, 1996</xref> cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1363460712439655">McGaughey and Tewksbury, 2002</xref>: 60). Even if the majority of people masturbate, they rarely talk about it.</p>
<p>These studies seek to confirm that individuals masturbate with some frequency; however, regularity does not necessarily foster open communication. Rather, silence about sexuality operates to confirm a ‘psychic disavowal’ where ‘power acts to cover over anomalous forms of sexuality, it serves to generate a resistance that transforms the discourse in general’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1363460712439655">Shildrick, 2007</xref>: 56). Shildrick argues that efforts to guarantee sexual citizenship, particularly citizenship for disabled people, in line with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1363460712439655">Foucault (2003)</xref>, ‘invites new forms of governmentality’ where discourses of desire and pleasure are rarely addressed in discussions of disability and sexuality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1363460712439655">Shildrick, 2007</xref>: 54, 64). Rather, discussions of disabled sexuality should take up ‘the emergence of new forms of embodied selfhood that takes account equally of the intersectionality of sociopolitical context, the meaning of intimacy and the erotic, and the psychic significance of the cultural imaginary’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1363460712439655">Shildrick, 2007</xref>: 64). Discussions of masturbation reveal that, even if a significant number of people masturbate with some frequency, there remains an implication that certain individuals’ masturbation practices need to be regulated. This control and oversight narrows the scope of sexuality and by extension recreates the primacy of reproductive heterosexuality as the outcome of this regulation.</p>
<p>The masturbation practices of prisoners and servicemen have been the subject of study. Both groups live in congregate settings, much like individuals with intellectual disabilities. Comparing these groups is instructive when considering how masturbation becomes promoted or regulated as a type of sexual expression above other forms of expression. Prisons are one location in which masturbation is openly regulated against its visibility and often completely forbidden. In 2007, an inmate in a Florida prison was convicted of indecent exposure for masturbating alone in his cell. A female corrections officer observed the inmate masturbating from the video monitoring room in the jail. As a result of the conviction, the inmate received an additional 60-day sentence. Similar bans against masturbating in prison have been upheld in other US states despite court challenges. Hensley and his associates conducted a study exploring masturbation and consensual same-sex activity in a male maximum-security prison. Their study found that 99% of those interviewed had masturbated while in prison with 78% masturbating more frequently; between 2 to 3 times a week up to more than once a day (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1363460712439655">Hensley et al., 2001b</xref>: 66). They also conclude that white prisoners are more likely to engage in same-sex sexual activity, while those who have a higher level of education masturbated less frequently (2001b: 68–69). The authors argue that condom distribution should be widely adopted in prisons to encourage safer sex practices and inmates should be allowed to masturbate without reprisal from authorities (2001b: 69–70). In another study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1363460712439655">Hensley and colleagues (2001a)</xref> researched female masturbation in prison. They conclude that the number of women who report having masturbated while in prison is twice the number of those reported in similar studies on masturbation frequency outside of the prison (2001a: 496, 499). They discuss that women in prison turn to masturbation more frequently as a way to reduce sexual tension and those who participate in same-sex sexual activity in prison have higher rates of masturbation (2001a: 499). They make the recommendation that masturbation should be permitted in prisons to reduce transmission of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (2001a: 499). Prisoners remain sexual; perhaps even more so, during incarceration, but sexual practices like masturbation are often treated as behavioral infractions and grounds for the charge of sex offense.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1363460712439655">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>A significant amount of the sexual activities that occur in prison are masturbatory in nature, despite the prohibition against it. While soldiers and prisoners ought not to masturbate but do so to achieve sexual gratification, individuals with intellectual disabilities ‘ought’ to masturbate to reduce behavioral issues, not for sexual gratification. While those with intellectual disabilities and prisoners both experience attention to their daily activities, the opposite commands reflect two different conceptualizations of sexuality for the two groups: for inmates masturbation is a kind of sexuality and for people with intellectual disabilities, masturbation is a tool for behavioral modification.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1363460712439655">6</xref></sup> In prisons, individuals who masturbate are often punished; however, masturbation for those with intellectual disabilities is seen as a benefit allowing for an appropriate articulation of sexuality, while mitigating behavioral issues, such as aggressive actions towards others. What are the assumptions that make these opposite perceptions on masturbation possible? Why does the meaning behind masturbation change in these locations? And how does the attention towards masturbation reveal similarities, despite perhaps differing management of those who masturbate? Additionally, how does aversion factor into decisions to monitor masturbation of certain populations?</p>
<p>Masturbation for individuals with disabilities has been configured as one of the only ways to express their sexuality assuming that interpersonal sexual intimacy is not readily available. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1363460712439655">Walsh (2000)</xref> argues that teaching individuals to masturbate and providing them the space to masturbate empower individuals to express their sexuality. Cambridge and others explain five key issues regarding the masturbation of people with intellectual disabilities: (1) inability to masturbate properly and achieve orgasm; (2) improper masturbation that may pose dangers including contact with clothes, people, or objects; (3) too much masturbation; (4) public masturbation and other inappropriate practices; and (5) the use of objects that harms the individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1363460712439655">Cambridge et al., 2003</xref>: 252). If an individual is considered to display one of these behaviors, then most likely they will be referred to some sort of masturbation behavior intervention and assessment. The end goal for such an individual is to learn how to masturbate ‘appropriately’. Of course, there is a certain level of subjectivity in these criteria: for example, is daily masturbation considered too frequent? While it is generally considered that masturbating in a crowded café is inappropriate because of social mores, if an individual chooses to masturbate with other individuals watching or participating, would that action warrant masturbation training? Masturbation training generally does not recognize mutual or group masturbation as an achievable outcome. Participating in more public sexual activities or even consenting to group sexual activities could unnecessarily warrant masturbation training for the parties involved to discourage such practices. The reasons for entry into training point to one way in which masturbation becomes more about behavior modification to replace sexual relations with others than a form of sexual experience. Public or group expressions of sexuality involve complex assessments of competency, social respect, and other legal considerations, but limiting masturbation as forbidden to be seen by anyone else clearly demonstrates the understanding of it as a substitute for sex not as a less restrictive and more diverse expression of sexuality.</p>
<p>Masturbation training becomes a disciplinary tool that is utilized, not to facilitate sexual pleasure but rather to place parameters on the act of masturbation. These parameters include the primacy of privacy and reduction of harm to self and others. Orgasm attainment is also listed as a goal for training, pointing to one way in which training can act as a conduit towards one pleasurable ending. The meaning behind the goal of orgasm attainment might vary, however, since some consider the inability to orgasm as one of the reasons individuals might display aggressive or problematic behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1363460712439655">Kaeser and O’Neill, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1363460712439655">Tarnai, 2006</xref>). Sexual pleasure then can be one of the unintended outcomes of the training. The discourse of harm reduction and behavior modification usurps an assessment of masturbation as an act of sexual expression for the means of pleasure. The primacy of sexual pleasure is largely absent for individuals with intellectual disabilities, while masturbation training provides a façade of an endorsement of sexuality for individuals. While the Facebook fan page for <italic>The ABC’s</italic> declares, ‘Sex can wait, masturbate’, <italic>The ABCs</italic> encourages individuals to masturbate in locations approved by the staff for such an activity. This public and professional attention towards the masturbation techniques or the habits of individuals with intellectual disabilities highlights not only possible sexual expression of individuals but also the ways in which their sexuality is discussed and potentially regulated. McGaughey and Tewksbury caution in relation to prison sexuality, ‘Sexual behavior, which is generally considered in mainstream society to be private, becomes a public/social issue within the context of institutionalization’ (2002: 135).</p>

<sec id="sec3-1363460712439655"><title>Masturbation and HIV</title>
<p>While the correlation among frequency of masturbation, sexual experiences, and the level of sexual desire is established for certain groups of individuals including prisoners, the relationship between masturbation and HIV is still being explored. D’Emilio and Freedman discuss how in the USA, gay men adopted mutual masturbation practices in response to the AIDS crisis (1997: 356). As a striking comparison, inmates in prisons are often forbidden to masturbate, and the act of masturbation is seen as spreading disease including HIV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1363460712439655">McGaughey and Tewksbury, 2002</xref>: 133, 139). But as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1363460712439655">Stengers and Van Neck (2001)</xref> argue, masturbation flourishes in locations of repression; so despite regulations, masturbation most likely continues in prisons. The solitary nature of masturbation allows for some creativity as to where and how an individual masturbates. However, a lack of privacy in situations where activities are regulated can result in these activities being monitored as well. The relation between HIV and masturbation takes on different meanings when aligned with differing markers of identity, such as race and class. Therefore, the contradictory assertion that certain individuals should masturbate to express sexuality safely (individuals with intellectual disabilities), while others are at risk of contracting HIV when masturbating (prisoners) highlights how the relationship between sex and infection is not equally applied to all populations. Assumptions that individuals with intellectual disabilities do not have sexual partners, let alone HIV, also influences the endorsement of masturbation as a safe alternative to vaginal and anal intercourse.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1363460712439655">7</xref></sup> Masturbation training for individuals with intellectual disabilities through sex education and individual counseling not only addresses reduction of behavioral issues but also introduces a discussion of masturbation as a safer sex practice. Encouraging individuals with intellectual disabilities to masturbate is widely accepted as a means to teach safer-sex practices that can reduce HIV/AIDS transmission rates, especially among men who have sex with men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1363460712439655">Cambridge et al., 2003</xref>: 261).</p>
<p>Interestingly, a pair of studies conducted on African American women and college aged students respectively, concluded that those who masturbate regularly also had multiple sexual partners and by extension are at a greater risk of being infected with HIV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1363460712439655">Pinkerton et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1363460712439655">Robinson et al., 2002</xref>). Robinson and colleagues argue that women, who masturbate frequently, especially early in life, have ‘some increased HIV risk, perhaps through the mechanism of increased interest and desire’ (2002: 97).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1363460712439655">8</xref></sup> They also reference additional studies that show a ‘negative relationship between masturbation and sexual variables related to safer sex’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1363460712439655">Robinson et al., 2002</xref>: 97; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1363460712439655">Choi et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1363460712439655">Davidson, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1363460712439655">Davidson and Moore, 1994</xref>). Thus, if one masturbates more, one is also more likely to practice more unsafe sex. For example, Davidson and Moore conclude that consistent and regular masturbation can make individuals less likely to use contraception and have a sexually transmitted infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1363460712439655">Davidson and Moore, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1363460712439655">Robinson et al., 2002</xref>: 97). Pinkerton and colleagues assert that for the college-aged women in their study, ‘masturbation is clearly <italic>not</italic> being used as a substitute for intercourse and, therefore, cannot be assumed to decrease HIV risk on that basis’ (2002: 118, original emphasis). The contention again is that frequent masturbation results in increased sexual desire; sexual desire here being the apparent barometer to measure HIV risk. This correlation between sexual desire and risk of HIV does not take into account how racism, classism, and sexism work as combined systems of oppression in the lives of individuals in relation to risks. Asking a male partner to use a condom is not always an option when a person is in an unequal relationship. There might be a lack of comprehensive sex education and access to reproductive technologies in certain geographical areas heavily populated by racial minorities and those with low incomes. The causal linkage between masturbation frequency and HIV risk can cover over other structural factors that make an individual more likely to contract HIV or another sexually transmitted infection. Finally, even the correlation between frequency and risk of infection is not unilateral, as seen through the hypothesis that frequent masturbation might have a negative relationship with HIV risk, meaning that individuals could possibly have higher risk if they did not masturbate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1363460712439655">Pinkerton et al., 2002</xref>: 118).</p>
<p>The correlation between masturbation frequency and the claim of health is somewhat of an enigma. There is a belief that masturbation can help individuals with low sexual desire to reach a ‘normal’ and ‘healthy’ amount of sexual desire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1363460712439655">Zamboni and Crawford, 2002</xref>). In contrast some researchers contend that frequent masturbation can place individuals at increased risk to contract HIV and other sexually transmitted infections. While masturbation has been credited as making individuals more comfortable with their bodies as well as having increased levels of self-esteem, masturbation continues to have stigma attached as well, notwithstanding its casual linkage with sexually transmitted infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1363460712439655">Barbach, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1363460712439655">Coleman, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1363460712439655">Dodson, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1363460712439655">World Association for Sexology, 1999</xref>). Neoconservative ideologies in the USA often influence discourses of morality in relation to sex education. Masturbation as a type of sexual activity is wrapped up in this discourse as well, where masturbating as an act of sexual expression is coded as immoral and inappropriate.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1363460712439655">9</xref></sup> The discussion and promotion of masturbation continue to have a controversial and complicated relationship in US sex education policies, which mirror the broader socio-cultural and political context of sexuality. Generally in the USA, masturbation as a group practice is consistently not discussed.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1363460712439655">10</xref></sup> Despite domestic uncertainties when it comes to the relationship of masturbation and human sexual expression, there still is a movement to align abstinence and masturbation in global efforts to reduce HIV transmission. Laqueur notes ‘to date no mainstream politician has been willing to publicly defend masturbation as a morally innocent and socially benign sexual practice’ (2003: 416).</p>
<p>Masturbation remains a controversial practice for sexual promotion for moral reasons and social taboos. For example, sex education rarely discusses masturbation as a type of sexual expression. However, the link among abstinence, masturbation, and condom usage helps to cement a certain type of philosophy of sex that limits those individuals who can reproduce. The implication is that if people want to be sexual, masturbating allows for sexual expression without fear of reproducing. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1363460712439655">Nelson (2003)</xref> traces how US foreign population policies around sexuality are inconsistent, especially in relation to populations of color. Promotion of sterilization and testing of birth control on women of color are examples of this type of US-driven global population policy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1363460712439655">Nelson, 2003</xref>: 113–132). Efforts to sterilize individuals are linked with promoting masturbation as various modes of restricting sexuality and denying reproduction. The multiplicity of meanings and policies surrounding masturbation reveals the uneasiness of sexuality of certain marginalized groups.</p>
<p>Globally masturbation promotion is consistent with the Bush Administration’s funding policy for HIV/AIDS prevention and its endorsement of ‘the ABC approach’ to sexuality, which refers to Abstinence, Be faithful, and Correct and Consistent use of Condoms. While Uganda is often cited as a successful country that adopted the ABC method of HIV/AIDS transmission reduction promoted by the Bush Administration and President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS relief (PEPFAR), there is little evidence that Uganda adopted a strictly ABC approach. Botswana is generally credited as being the country that started the ABC approach to reducing HIV transmission, but the more recent focus on the ABCs is controversial because it not only advocates abstinence until marriage but also does not generally allow for condom distribution outside of people in the so-called ‘high-risk’ categories: sex workers, intravenous drug users, and those with more than one sexual partner (AVERT, n.d.). It is an interesting correlation that both ABCs for people with intellectual disabilities as shown in the documentary film and those receiving financial assistance from the US government encourage not sexual intercourse but rather abstinence and self-arousal. US domestic and foreign policy promote this abstinence-based approach to sexuality as a morality-based response to sexually transmitted infections.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1363460712439655">11</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="sec4-1363460712439655"><title>How to teach: Do you know how to masturbate?</title>
<p>If individuals are masturbating or attempting to masturbate unsuccessfully, how can they be taught suitable ways of practicing ‘solitary sex with release’? Professionals working in the field of intellectual disability contend that successful masturbation can eliminate an array of behavioral issues. Masturbation is seen as a benefit insomuch that it allows for a reduction in potential disruptions in the institution or group home, not as an asset for sexual experience. Whatever the ultimate goal of training, be it reduction in ‘problematic’ behaviors or an altruistic desire to teach ways to orgasm, there are developed techniques employed to train individuals with intellectual disabilities ‘effective’ and ‘appropriate’ ways of stimulation.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1363460712439655">Kaeser (1996)</xref> advocates a type of masturbation training in which professionals train adults with intellectual disabilities in a hand-over-hand approach on an individual’s penis or clitoris. Kaeser argues that this approach can raise potential ethical concerns involving a paid staff person masturbating a disabled individual in his or her room. The ethical issues arise from the assumption that individuals with intellectual disabilities are unable to consent to a type of sexuality in which a staff member might touch an individual’s genitalia to facilitate orgasm and subsequently learn how to masturbate. In addition, there is an ethical consideration if government-funded staff can provide a type of facilitated sexual service through a hand-over-hand approach of masturbation training. Even though personal assistants bathe, toilet, and interact with individuals on a highly personal level involving physical contacts, the incorporation of sexuality as part the job requirement can be an entirely different consideration. On some level, the ability of the government to fund sexual services or sexual surrogacy becomes a key ethical consideration in this discussion. Kaeser considers that the benefits of training individuals how to masturbate to orgasm in their rooms are more important than any ethical concerns. In his discussion of masturbation training and Kaeser’s article in particular, Siebers makes the following observations about the benefits of masturbation training for institutional settings:
<list id="list1-1363460712439655" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>To help patients with mental disabilities understand that sexual acts should be private, allowing authorities to eliminate offensive behavior from public spaces.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>To provide patients with a means of releasing tension and controlling frustration, creating a more passive and manageable population for caregivers.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>To teach safer methods of masturbation to patients who are injuring themselves in the pursuit of sexual pleasure.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>To introduce the pleasures of sexuality as part of typical human existence to people for whom these pleasures are unknown. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1363460712439655">Siebers, 2008</xref>: 162)</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>While some of the benefits assumed with masturbation training include the importance of sexual expression in private and prevention of self-injury, it is important to note that the benefits are available for both the individual and the institution. Furthermore, the assumptions regarding the benefits of masturbation training are not generated from the individual but rather used as rationale and justification for the training. Individuals are not asking for the training. In fact, as discussed earlier, masturbation training usually occurs when a staff-member observes an individual masturbating in public or using devices or objects that the staff member considers inappropriate or harmful. Masturbation training can be restrictive (or normalizing) if individuals actively choose more public displays of masturbation, in a sex club for instance or in front of other people, when staff deems these public displays inappropriate.</p>
<p>A more docile (or passive) group of individuals with a reduction of behavioral issues makes the institutional seem more ‘pleasant’ – for staff at least. Siebers contends that masturbation training is ‘not a neutral activity’ because it ‘provides instruction in political agency in addition to helping the patient achieve sexual agency, declaring victory when the patient manages to achieve orgasm unassisted on a regular basis’ (2008: 162–163). Masturbation is coded with notions of sexual autonomy and manageable behaviors. Of course, this assumes that masturbation is a solitary act and not one between consenting parties, including couples with intellectual disabilities – a situation which is strongly discouraged in group homes. Individuals who masturbate become willing agents in their own sexual expression. But if masturbation training becomes a stand in for other types of sexual expression and is used solely as a tool of behavioral control, then victory cannot be claimed for the individual’s side, only for the institution. An individual’s right to express sexuality can get co-opted by a discourse of harm reduction that ultimately favors the cohesion of institutional living. A ‘problematic’ masturbator challenges a group home or institutions’ culture of behavior modification.</p>
<p>Although Kaeser’s concern with educating individuals to learn techniques for self-arousal and release is practical, this professional attention towards masturbation training and surveillance points to the potentially restrictive locations in which individuals with intellectual disabilities live and attempt to be sexual beings. Moreover, hand-over-hand masturbation training most likely is illegal in many locations and can be seen as a type of sexual abuse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1363460712439655">Cambridge, 2003</xref>: 261). Facilitated sexuality remains a controversial topic because of the blurring of boundaries between personhood and governmental assistance for sexual release. Not all individuals with intellectual disabilities are assumed to be able to consent to sexual relations. As such, facilitated sex can be seen as abuse. The politics around facilitated sexuality and the issues of consent for individuals with intellectual disabilities deserve further exploration within disability studies. Shildrick remarks that facilitated sex ‘draws attention to the difference of anomalous bodies’ in part because ‘the very notion of such hands-on involvement is particularly disturbing for both the wider public and the participants’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1363460712439655">Shildrick, 2009</xref>: 70–71).</p>
<p>As an alternative to hand-over-hand training, some researchers advocate the use of pictures, videos, anatomically correct dolls, condoms, vibrating pillows, and hand-held vibrators as tools that can potentially help individuals masturbate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1363460712439655">Fegan et al., 1993</xref>: 26–30). Alternative methods to teach people how to masturbate include using a model penis or vagina to demonstrate the technique, while avoiding any physical contact between staff members and service users (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1363460712439655">Cambridge, 2003</xref>: 259). Others contend that individuals with intellectual disabilities need to be taught to masturbate to climax to avoid behavioral problems that might emerge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1363460712439655">Fegan et al., 1993</xref>: 28). These behavioral problems are, of course, coded in medical and moral terminology. Problematic behaviors assume a standard set of social mores that should not deviate from Judeo-Christian morals of social interaction. As an example, sexual expression becomes appropriate only in the confines of an individual’s residence. Coding an activity or action as a ‘behavioral issue’ gives support staff license to correct the aforementioned behavior into something more ‘appropriate’. The binary of appropriate and inappropriate surrounds the discussion of masturbation training. Even so, the reduction of behavior problems is a widely circulated positive outcome of masturbation training without any evidence that a reduction occurs or if the training facilitates individuals’ satisfaction. As Siebers notes:
<disp-quote>
<p>To fail in masturbation training is to fail to become an autonomous agent, but this failure has everything to do with prejudices against disability because achieving both political and sexual agency relies on the presupposition that the body and mind are nondisabled and will function properly if trained. (2008: 163)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Thus, the discourse of sexual autonomy largely requires an idea that successful sexuality can be formed and manipulated. Individuals with intellectual disabilities supposedly need assistance to become sexually autonomous; failure here not only means a loss of autonomy but also perhaps a return of behavior issues, which are identified by staff members. The attention on behavior modification serves as an illustration of the professional oversight available in discussions of sexuality for people with intellectual disabilities. Sexual training is cloaked with the rhetoric of sexual fulfillment. The meaning making of masturbation reveals a specific assessment of what is deemed an appropriate expression of sexuality, in a location marked by professional oversight and reduced freedom.</p>
<p>One inventive approach to masturbation training comes from Family Planning New South Wales. A pair of books, <italic>About Masturbation for Males: for People with an Intellectual Disability</italic> (2007) and a similar version for females with intellectual disabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1363460712439655">Family Planning New South Wales, 1998</xref>), takes a more holistic approach to addressing masturbation for individuals with intellectual disabilities. Each book not only contains specific recommendations, resources, and guidance for support people and staff but also contains a story about masturbation that can be shared with the individuals with disabilities. The male story involves an unnamed man, who on being aroused in public, or as the book refers to it, when ‘he feels sexy’, returns to his room and masturbates till orgasm. The story then shows the man in his bathroom cleaning semen off his hands. The version for women with intellectual disabilities also contains a similar story about a woman going to her private room to masturbate and then to the restroom to clean up afterwards. Additionally, both books contain drawings of male and female sexual organs that can be used to teach individuals about anatomy and sexuality. What is unique about these books is that they present masturbation as part of everyday life and something natural for individuals to do. There is no talk of special approaches or potential behavioral issues, but rather a sex-positive approach of providing individuals with the space and resources needed to explore their own sexuality through masturbation. This type of approach recognizes that individuals with intellectual disabilities have the right to sexual expression. This recognition challenges the culture of protectionism and harm reduction so entrenched in discussions of sexuality for people with intellectual disabilities. Masturbation training in this context facilitates an expression of rights instead of attempting to mold an individual’s behaviors to fit the culture of the group home or other institution. Masturbation training can allow for an increased array of sexual knowledge and experience. Masturbation and the meaning behind such an activity reveal assumptions about disabled sexuality in general. Disabled people are deemed appropriate to be trained for sexual expression rather than disallowed sexuality in the name of failed autonomy and consent.</p>
<p>While the methods of how to train individuals to masturbate might vary from location to location, there is consensus that individuals ought to be given the space, privacy, and resources (e.g. lubrication, vibrator) to masturbate in their own rooms or bathrooms. This is in contrast to more public locations, such as living rooms, workplaces, and such. Again, the assumption behind masturbation is that it is a solo activity done in private. The two scenes discussed earlier from <italic>The ABCs</italic> reflect these general norms: masturbate in your locked room using any tools necessary to facilitate the activity. The problem with this line of thinking is that individuals in group homes often have roommates and doors that do not lock. Tools to facilitate masturbation might not be available as well. So the question still remains, when and where can you masturbate if you do not have your own room, any time to be alone, or a well-sealed bathroom compartment? Individuals with intellectual disabilities in congregate living are not automatically afforded privacy or the option to be sexual by themselves or with others.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1363460712439655" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>While an individual’s masturbation practice and frequency can remain unspoken, for some individuals there remains a tremendous amount of attention on their masturbatory practice. While prisoners masturbate with some frequency, the practice itself is coded as a behavioral infraction. Individuals in the military use masturbation to supplement sexual encounters with sex workers. Despite a perception that masturbating reduces an individuals’ risk for HIV, a growing body of research is making connections between frequent masturbation, increased sex drive, and risk of infection. At the same time masturbation training is promoted tentatively, as a way to correct hypoactive sexual desire disorder. Nursing homes are also considering how to address public expressions of masturbation in ways similar to those advocated by <italic>The ABCs</italic>, including removal and redirection, without considering the spatial set-up to limit privacy in most nursing homes. Finally, individuals with intellectual disabilities are often encouraged to masturbate not only to eliminate potential behavioral issues but also to quench their sexual drives. The result is that masturbation is strongly influenced by institutional discipline, while additionally inscribing the primacy of nonreproductive sexuality directives on individuals’ sexual expressions.</p>
<p>This article begins a discussion of the politics of masturbation and more specifically the sexuality of people with intellectual disabilities in the context of other institutionalized lives. In doing so, I chart the connections between the regulation of sexuality for people with intellectual disabilities and other groups of individuals similarly regulated in various places in the world. A significant focus on appropriate methods of masturbation and lack of focus on other ways of expressing or practicing sexuality bring forth a very rigid view of sexuality that reinforces the necessity of masturbation as a substitute for sexual intimacy to supposedly reduce behavioral issues and tension build-up, while simultaneously enforcing notions that certain groups of people should not engage in sexual intercourse. Perhaps this is because of the inability or unwillingness to consider that people with intellectual disabilities are able to consent to sexual activity or have reproductive rights. Or perhaps it is because of the view that some groups of people should not participate in forms of sexual expression other than autoeroticism.</p>
<p>While equipping individuals with the knowledge, supplies, and techniques to masturbate is potentially important in developing a more integrated sense of self, equal attention should be given to whether or not individuals are given the opportunity to be sexual and free from restrictions placed on their sexuality. Furthermore, what is not recognized or discussed in masturbation training materials for people with intellectual disabilities is that individuals might not want to be sexual or that they may choose an asexual lifestyle. Individuals who prefer to participate in mutual masturbation, either with a partner of the same or opposite sex or some other combination are not addressed or discussed. Mutual and public masturbation challenges the entire rhetoric behind masturbation training and exposes the spatial division between private and public. Rather, masturbation is seen as a solitary act, best done in private and preferably done when the staff members of your group home sanction you to do so. Masturbation for people with intellectual disabilities is not seen as a spontaneous event, but rather as the way to satisfy biological sexual urge and mitigate behavioral issues that trouble the authority of those regulating individuals with intellectual disabilities.</p>

In the same study, 67% of those interviewed had also experienced sexual intercourse, while the authors contend that early onset of masturbation practices results in an early age of intercourse (2000: 206). Additionally, the authors find a correlation, albeit tentatively, between frequent and early masturbation practices and sexually transmitted infections (2000: 207). Finally, corroborating previous work in feminist theory, 21% of those who were no longer virgins had their first sexual encounter with a sex worker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1363460712439655">Choi et al., 2000</xref>: 207; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1363460712439655">Enloe, 2004</xref>: 119–121).

When the ships leave, the town is once again desolate. This shows how military presence constructs a town’s economic structure and creates dependency.</p></fn>
<fn id="fn5-1363460712439655"><label>5</label><p>There is a significant amount of research done on sexuality and sexual practices in prison. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1363460712439655">Hopper in <italic>Sex in Prison: the Mississippi Experiment with Conjugal Visiting</italic> (1969)</xref> traces out a program that allows conjugal visits between married couples. The rationale for the program is that inmates who have opportunities to have conjugal visits have lower rates of recidivism than those who are not able to have these visits. Opportunity for sex supposedly reduces problem behaviors; a similar rationale expressed with teaching some individuals with intellectual disabilities how to masturbate in order to reduce behavioral issues. Conjugal visits however are not widely adopted throughout the USA partly because of expanding prison populations. Mary Bosworth in her essay, ‘Gender, race, and sexuality in prison’ makes the argument that female prisoners participate in lesbian sexual relationships even if they do not identify as lesbians outside the walls of the prison: ‘Lesbian and homosexual relations in prison can be understood as strategies of resistance not only to the pains of imprisonment as traditional sociologists would have us believe, but also to constructions of gender put forward by the institutions themselves’ (2003: 150). Scholars argue that the institutional nature of the prison restricts and encourages different expressions of sexuality based on notions of gender and appropriateness. Early research on sexuality, including work done by sexologist Havelock Ellis and researcher Joseph Fulling Fishman took on an alarmist note when predicting the number of homosexuals in prison – while Ellis estimates that 20% of male prisoners are in homosexual relationships, even if not entirely physical; Fishman estimates the figure at close to 80% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1363460712439655">Ellis, 1942</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1363460712439655">Fishman, 1951</xref>). Fishman even goes on to study individuals who came to the prison already identifying as gay and those who ‘became gay’ while in prison; thus further pointing to the ways in which certain types of sexuality are feared for the inmates. Currently only six states allow conjugal visits for their male prisoners in the USA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1363460712439655">Hensley, 2000</xref>). California and New York allow conjugal visits for same-sex partners.</p></fn>

<fn id="fn9-1363460712439655"><label>9</label><p>In the words of then Surgeon General of the USA Jocelyn Elders in 1994, ‘Masturbation is part of human sexuality, and it’s a part of something that perhaps should be taught. But we have not even taught our children the basics. And I feel that we have tried ignorance for a long time and its time we try education’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1363460712439655">Elders, 1994</xref> cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1363460712439655">Coleman, 2002</xref>: 13). The larger background of Elders’ words is that masturbation could be an effective way to reduce HIV/AIDS, while still expressing human sexuality. Her comments in front of the United Nations resulted in almost immediate disapproval from the Clinton administration and ultimately caused her to be removed from the position of Surgeon General because the Clinton administration disagreed with her views on the utility of masturbation as well as other issues. On an episode of the television program Penn and Teller: <italic>Bullshit!</italic> Elders remarked ‘I am against abstinence programs because I consider abstinence only to be child abuse’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1363460712439655">Penn and Teller, 2006</xref>).</p></fn>
