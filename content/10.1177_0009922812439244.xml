<abstract>
<p>Developmental language disorder has been reported in 3% to 10% of term infants and 30% of preterm infants (&lt;34 weeks gestation). Screening for language delay in preterm infants can be costly and time-consuming. The objective of this study was to assess the expressive language development of preterm infants using the Language Development Survey (LDS). A total of 178 preterm infants born at 23 to 34 weeks between 2006 and 2008 were enrolled. The LDS was completed by parents between 22 and 26 months at or shortly before 2-year neurodevelopmental assessment using the Bayley III Scale. A total of 26% of former preterm patients had language delay, using LDS. Significant correlations were observed between LDS results and Bayley III scores. Male gender and public health insurance were the most important risk factors for language delay in this cohort. Expressive language delay was present in 26% of preterm infants. LDS is a suitable and inexpensive screening tool for assessing language delay in preterm infants.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>As the survival of preterm infants improves, more attention is focused on improving their long-term developmental outcomes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0009922812439244">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0009922812439244"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0009922812439244"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0009922812439244">4</xref></sup> Developmental language disorder is the most common developmental delay affecting 3% to 10% of children and up to 30% of preterm infants.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0009922812439244">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0009922812439244"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0009922812439244"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0009922812439244"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0009922812439244">9</xref></sup> Poor motor, cognitive, and sensory development in isolation or in combination can contribute to poor language development. Premature infants show delays in both receptive and expressive language development. They commonly have a smaller vocabulary size and delay in combining words. School-aged children who were born prematurely have been shown to exhibit weaknesses in sentence complexity, phonological short-term memory, and syntax.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0009922812439244">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0009922812439244">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0009922812439244"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0009922812439244"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0009922812439244"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0009922812439244"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0009922812439244">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>Early identification of children at risk for language and/or other related developmental delay is critical to the well-being of children and their families and may lead to the use of early intervention services at a young age when chances for improvement are best.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0009922812439244">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0009922812439244">17</xref></sup> Pediatric care guidelines recommend developmental screening, including speech and language, at well-child visits up to age 3.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0009922812439244">16</xref></sup> However, recent reports suggested that less than half of surveyed pediatricians use effective means to screen their patients for developmental problems.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0009922812439244">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0009922812439244">19</xref></sup> Formal developmental screening is recommended for very-low-birth-weight infants.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0009922812439244">20</xref></sup> However, many former preterm infants do not have access to neonatal follow-up programs for formal developmental testing, and these visits are often not reimbursed by health insurance. The reason for the ineffective developmental screening in pediatrics is unknown, but time and staff limitations are likely a contributing factor.</p>
<p>Many different screening tools are available to identify language delay in young children. The Language Development Survey (LDS) developed by Rescorla is a 10-minute, parent-administered, validated, and simple tool to identify language delay in 2-year-old children.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0009922812439244">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0009922812439244"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0009922812439244"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0009922812439244">24</xref></sup> Parents are asked to circle a child’s expressive words from a list of 310 words in 14 semantic categories. In prior studies of more than 500 term infants, the LDS was highly correlated with performance on the Bayley Mental Developmental Index, Reynell, and Preschool Language Scale of expressive vocabulary.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0009922812439244">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0009922812439244"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0009922812439244"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0009922812439244">26</xref></sup> When a cutoff of less than 50 words and no word combinations was considered a screen failure, this LDS tool offered a sensitivity of 87% and specificity of 86%.</p>
<p>Preterm infants need careful attention to language development. Pediatricians would benefit from rapid parent-administered screening tools for these particularly vulnerable infants. We evaluated expressive language in 2-year-old infants who were born at less than 34 weeks of gestation. We also evaluated prenatal and postnatal risk factors for language delay in this preterm cohort. We compared results of the LDS in preterm infants with their results from the more traditional and time-consuming Bayley III Scale of Infant Development (BSID3).</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section3-0009922812439244">
<title>Study Design and Patient Population</title>
<p>We performed a prospective study to evaluate the use of the LDS tool in preterm infants born at Pennsylvania Hospital at 23 to 34 weeks of gestation and followed in our neonatal follow-up program. Parents provided informed consent. This study was approved by the institutional review board at the University of Pennsylvania. We routinely follow infant growth and development of all premature infants born at less than or equal to 32 weeks of gestation and a select group of at-risk 33- to 34-week gestational age infants with increased risk of developmental delay caused by multiple gestation pregnancies, maternal preeclampsia, intrauterine growth restriction, intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), or low APGAR scores. As part of standard follow-up care, infants received the BSID3 at a corrected age of 18 to 26 months.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0009922812439244">27</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0009922812439244">
<title>Neonatal Characteristics and Morbidities</title>
<p>Birth history and information regarding neonatal morbidities experienced during the infant’s initial hospitalization were obtained from the medical record and divisional database. Bronchopulmonary dysplasia was defined as oxygen requirement at 36 weeks corrected for postmenstrual age. IVH was graded using the Papile criteria.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0009922812439244">28</xref></sup> Sepsis or meningitis was defined as having a positive culture of blood or cerebrospinal fluid, respectively. Maternal race and health insurance (public or private) was determined from the birth hospitalization records. Insurance status was used as a proxy for socioeconomic status.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0009922812439244">
<title>Infant and Maternal Characteristics at Follow-up Visit</title>
<p>As part of the LDS, parents are asked to provide information regarding the highest level of maternal education (did not complete high school, high school graduate, some college, or at least 4 years of college), number of children living at home, attendance at day care, history of otitis media, and number of languages spoken in the home. Given the relatively small sample size, we dichotomized the number of languages spoken at home (1 vs &gt;1) and otitis media (any vs none). We evaluated the impact of limited maternal education by analyzing education based on whether a mother completed high school.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0009922812439244">
<title>Language Development Survey</title>
<p>The LDS is a validated, parent-administered 10-minute survey of infant speech at 22 to 26 months created by Rescorla.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0009922812439244">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0009922812439244"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0009922812439244"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0009922812439244">24</xref></sup> Parents received the LDS questionnaire by mail in the 2 weeks prior to their appointment and additionally were given an opportunity to fill out the LDS in the waiting room during their developmental evaluation. To be consistent with prior validation studies on the LDS, babies were scored as language delayed if they had fewer than 50 words or no word combinations at 2 years, within the range of 22 to 26 months corrected age.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0009922812439244">23</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="section7-0009922812439244">
<title>Bayley Scale of Infant Development (III Edition)</title>
<p>Former preterm infants discharged from our hospital are routinely followed for growth and formal developmental testing using the BSID3.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0009922812439244">27</xref></sup> BSID3 assessments were performed by our developmental psychologist who was blinded to the results of the LDS questionnaire. We used the results of the BSID3 cognitive composite score and language composite score, both of which have a mean of 100, with a standard deviation of 15. Toddlers with a score of 90 to 109 are considered to be in the average developmental range. A composite score of 80 to 89 is low average, and a score of 70 to 79 is borderline. We also evaluated the scaled score of expressive language, which uses a range of 1 to 19 and represents a child’s performance on a subtest relative to same-age peers. A scaled score of &lt;8 or a composite score of &lt;90 represents the lowest 25th percentile of children in the standardized sample.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0009922812439244">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>Statistical analysis of infant characteristics was performed using STATA (version 9, Statacorp LP, College Station, TX). Student’s <italic>t</italic> test and the χ<sup>2</sup> test were used for individual variable analysis. Language delay on the LDS was defined as &lt;50 words or lack of 2 word combinations. Variables that were associated with language delay on LDS with a <italic>P</italic> value of &lt;.10 were included in the multivariable analysis. Multivariable logistic regression was used to evaluate risk factors for LDS language delay. A <italic>P</italic> value of &lt;.05 was used for statistical significance. For sensitivity and specificity calculations, we used a BSID3 language composite score of &lt;90 or an expressive language score of &lt;8.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Our neonatal follow-up program routinely evaluated 23- to 32-week infants at 16 to 26 months corrected postmenstrual age and a subset of infants of 33 to 34 weeks’ gestation who were determined to be at higher risk for developmental delay because of pregnancy-associated or neonatal complications. For this study, we asked parents to fill out the LDS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0009922812439244">21</xref></sup> at 22 to 26 months. We evaluated results from the parent-administered LDS for 178 prematurely born infants who had a mean gestational age of 30 weeks (range 23-34 weeks) and birth weight of 1476 g (range 459-2573 g). Half of the infants were from singleton pregnancies and half from multiple-gestation pregnancies. The maternal and neonatal characteristics and associated neonatal morbidities of prematurity are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0009922812439244">Table 1</xref>. Infants in this cohort were born to relatively mature, primarily Caucasian women with private medical insurance.</p>

<p>In this preterm cohort, language delay at 22 to 26 months corrected postmenstrual age was common. Parent responses to LDS allowed us to stratify infants into 2 groups: those with normal language development (&gt;50 words and word combinations) and those with delayed language development (&lt;50 words or no word combinations). Language delay was identified in 46 infants (26% of cohort), including significant delays with word counts of &lt;30 in 31 infants (17% of the cohort).</p>
<p>We evaluated neonatal and maternal characteristics from birth hospitalization to determine risk factors for language delay (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0009922812439244">Table 1</xref>). Neonatal morbidities did not differ between infants with normal or delayed language assessment on LDS. The only factors from birth associated with language delay on LDS were public health insurance, male gender, and singleton pregnancies. In this cohort, singleton pregnancy was associated with younger maternal age, lower maternal education, and public health insurance.</p>
<p>We also evaluated maternal and infant characteristics at time of LDS administration for risk factors of language delay (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0009922812439244">Table 2</xref>). Maternal education (more than or equal to high school), more than 1 language spoken in the home, day care attendance, and history of otitis media were not associated with language delay. Public insurance at the time of neonatal follow-up evaluation remained a significant risk factor. For most infants (94.4%), health insurance status remained constant between birth and follow-up examination; the insurance status of 3 infants changed from public to private insurance and that of 7 infants changed from private to public insurance. Only 4 infants were reported to have any hearing loss at the time of follow-up, so the impact of hearing loss could not be evaluated as a risk factor in this cohort.</p>

<p>In multivariable analysis, only male gender and public insurance remained significant risk factors for language delay, using the LDS. Male gender increases the odds of language delay (odds ratio [OR] = 2.2; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.11-4.41). Maternal public insurance at the time of birth increases the odds of language delay (OR = 2.93; 95% CI = 1.39-6.16). Public insurance at neonatal follow-up remained a significant risk factor.</p>
<p>Most of the babies (82%) who completed the LDS had neonatal follow-up evaluations with the BSID3 at 18 to 26 months corrected age. Language delay on the LDS was significantly associated with lower BSID3 cognitive composite score, language composite score, and language expressive scaled score (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0009922812439244">Table 3</xref>). Among the infants with language delay on LDS, 45% had a language composite score of less than 90, and 61% had a scaled language score of less than 8. Among the infants with normal language (more than 50 words) on LDS, 90% had a Bayley 3 language composite score of greater than 90, and 93% had a scaled language score of greater than 8. Language delay on LDS had a sensitivity of 74% and specificity of 87% for predicting a BSID3 expressive scaled score of less than 8. The LDS retained specificity (82%) but had a lower sensitivity (61%) for predicting the more comprehensive BSID3 Language Composite Score of less than 90.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Preterm infants are at increased risk for language delay. The findings from this study support previous research in demonstrating the potential of the LDS as a general screening tool for language delay at 2 years of age. The LDS is inexpensive and can be completed in about 10 minutes by parents across all educational and socioeconomic backgrounds.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0009922812439244">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0009922812439244">22</xref></sup> The results of the LDS are immediately available to pediatricians and therefore infants can undergo further office-based screening during their well-child visit. The results of the LDS can be used to facilitate conversations with parents about language development. Furthermore, the LDS shows a high correlation with more time-consuming MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventories: words and sentences with a total vocabulary score correlation of 0.95.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0009922812439244">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0009922812439244"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0009922812439244">24</xref></sup> In this study, 26% of former preterm patients had language delay by the LDS criterion delay 3 (&lt;50 words and no word combinations), and 17% had significant language delay defined as fewer than 30 words. Language delay in this cohort of preterm infants was far greater than the published 10% to 15% delay by LDS in 2-year-old term toddlers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0009922812439244">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0009922812439244">23</xref></sup> Preterm infants need attention focused on long-term neurological development, with early referral to early intervention as needed.</p>
<p>The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends developmental screening of young children as a routine component of well-child care.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0009922812439244">16</xref></sup> However, a review of data from the 2007 Survey of Child Health found that only 19.7% (range 10%-47%) received a standardized, parent-completed developmental screen.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0009922812439244">18</xref></sup> As recently as 2009, less than half of pediatricians self-reported using at least 1 formal screening tool for the care of children younger than 36 months.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0009922812439244">29</xref></sup> For former preterm infants, pediatricians cannot rely on attendance at neonatal follow-up programs. Neurodevelopmental follow-up was proposed as a quality indicator for very-low-birth-weight infants between 0 and 3 years of age.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0009922812439244">20</xref></sup> Outside of large academic centers, formal neurodevelopmental screening of former preterm infants is not widely performed and not consistently reimbursed by medical insurance.</p>
<p>Although, large cohort studies have determined that neonatal morbidities such as chronic lung disease, IVH, or culture-positive sepsis are risk factors for poor neurodevelopmental outcomes, it is widely recognized that even preterm infants without these neonatal morbidities are at risk for neurodevelopmental impairment. All preterm infants need attention focused on long-term neurological development, not simply those with identified early neonatal morbidities. Language impairment may reflect more subtle disturbances in brain function, such as those related to phonologic short-term memory.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0009922812439244">6</xref></sup> Early neonatal morbidities did not predict increased risk for language delay on the LDS, reinforcing the recommendation that all former preterm infants need attention to language delay. The small sample size of this study, low incidence of intracranial pathology, and the use of a general screening test limits our conclusion on the impact of such perinatal factors.</p>
<p>Instead, we found that for our preterm infants, male gender and public health insurance were the most important risk factors. This is consistent with the risk factors for expressive language delay in all children, which include poverty, low parental education attainment, family history of language delays, maternal depression, and male gender.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0009922812439244">30</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0009922812439244"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0009922812439244">32</xref></sup> Male gender in premature infants is also a consistent risk factor for more severe lung disease and neurodevelopmental impairment. Many conditions associated with language delay such as autistic spectrum disorder and pervasive developmental delay are also more common in boys.</p>
<p>Research is needed to evaluate the impact of offering parenting, literacy, or infant development classes or developmental interventions to enrich the early learning environment of these at-risk infants. Studies have reported that the quality of maternal interaction with the infant with gestures and relevant descriptive speech may have a unique and positive contribution to language acquisition in childhood.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0009922812439244">33</xref></sup> Until more research is available, parents are encouraged to enhance the language exposure of their preterm infants by speaking and reading to their infants during their NICU hospitalization and after discharge.</p>
<p>We acknowledge several limitations in this study. This is a single-center study with limited heterogeneity in patient population. LDS results are based on parents’ memory and could be associated with recall bias. Our data did not show a statistically significant association of lower gestational age and birth weight with poor language development. This could be because of the nonrandom sample of 33- to 34-week infants already determined to be at high risk and an uneven gestational age distribution of our patients, with a smaller number of extremely low-birth-weight infants. As in previous studies, we found that lower gestational age was associated with lower scores when using continuous variables such as word count or Bayley 3 scores; yet the lower scores of premature infants remained within the normal range. We did not have a control group of term children from our hospital. Other studies have found that the BSID3 underestimated developmental delay when using reference ranges, unless the estimates of delay were computed relative to the mean and standard deviation of the control-matched population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0009922812439244">34</xref></sup> We did not have a follow-up beyond 2 years to determine how many of these infants remained language delayed at older ages. However, language delay has been found to be more persistent in former preterm infants and at times may present at older ages.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0009922812439244">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0009922812439244">35</xref></sup></p>
<p>Speech and language screening is imperative in high-risk individuals such as preterm infants. The LDS has been established as a simple, parent-administered screening tool for language delay in term infants at 2 years of age. Our results support the use of LDS in former preterm infants to help pediatricians screen for and detect language delay in these infants. Toddlers who are found to be language delayed on the LDS should receive formal evaluation of cognitive and language development along with referral to early intervention services. The results of this tool are immediately available, allowing the results to be used during office visits to discuss the importance of language development and make time for more thorough screening and/or developmental testing. All efforts to identify former preterm infants with language delay and early referral will confer the best chance for improvement in language skills through childhood.</p>
