<p>The embodiment of agency is often distilled and expressed through leaders who can deliver revolutionary change. Although this point is discounted by assumptions that outside forces shape events, this argument, according to Robert Rotberg’s insightful work, consistently fails to account for the ability of one individual to reshape and redirect the paths of people and nations. Leaders should not be discounted, but understood to be energetic path shapers who posit values that create communities and nations. In taking this thesis seriously, Rotberg understands that a crisis of political leadership exists today. There are few transformative leaders. To help remedy this problem, he not only presents a nuanced argument that examines how a form of transformative leadership rooted in moral and intellectual commitments is possible in certain spaces but also presents a normative claim that it is needed, especially in the developing world.</p>
<p>These assertions are bold and daring, not to mention hopeful. Yet he is careful not to overstate his claims regarding the potency of leadership in all places and in all times. He tempers his arguments by carefully showing how the presence of leadership is curtailed in the developed world and viable in the developing world. In relation to the former point, he sheds light on a leadership paradox in developed nations. They have the tradition, institutions, and values that allow individuals to develop leadership capacities. Although these countries have the ability to produce more leaders, they have less need for them. This supplements Stephen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0010414012467624">Skowronek’s (1997)</xref> argument about why transformational leadership is becoming limited in developed nations such as the United States. Institutional density and safeguards prevent leaders from positing a new set of values.</p>
<p>The absence of inhibitors that prevent the emergence of leadership provides fertile ground for the rise of leadership. In the developing world, people have the chance to assume a leadership mantle. Yet these places often lack the institutions to help provide individuals with the capacity to lead. In addressing this dilemma, Rotberg provides a practical model of responsible leadership. Even though the focus is on the developing world, Rotberg does not put limitations on leadership lessons that can be extracted from these places. In fact, he argues that his model holds “lessons for political leadership everywhere” (p. 3). Although he is careful to limit the scope of his claims regarding the potency of leadership, he is refreshingly bold in breaking free from contextual constraints that limit leadership insights to time and place. Because leadership matters in some degree regardless of context, it becomes morally and intellectually critical to understand what leadership means in both theory and practice. In undertaking such a project, he provides a model that is “intended to be a how-to manual for aspiring leaders” (p. 4).</p>
<p>Rotberg does this in two ways. First, he presents his construct of transformative leadership. Second, he looks at four different examples of this type of leadership by analyzing the merits of Nelson Mandela, Seretse Khama, Lee Kuan Yew, and Kemal Ataturk. Although Rotberg notes that none of these figures fits his ideal representation of a leader, each of these figures showcases what responsible leadership looks like. In developing his model, he argues that leadership is marked by certain core competencies. They are often emotionally intelligent such as Mandela, bring life to an ideal vision such as Lee and Ataturk, promote democratic reforms such as Khama, and possess integrity. This last competency is perhaps the most important. It is the moral principle of trust that allows followers to fully legitimize a new way of life. In essence, the basic premise behind responsible leadership is that an individual is deeply committed to leaving behind not a personal legacy, but a noble vision that can be translated to uplift and transform a community of followers. The relationship between leader and follower does not rest on a passionate connection, but a form of legitimacy that is able deliver results that can be trusted. Hence, the leader is able to mobilize the masses by being a steward of the people’s authentic needs. Of interest, he displaces Weber’s central thesis about the relationship between charisma and leadership. Although Weber places charisma as the engine behind transformative leadership, Rotberg puts this transformative energy on moral leadership. Accordingly, this allowed Ataturk to build a Turkish identity that was not totally bound by tradition, Lee to create a technocratic city-state, Khama to instill a sense of sovereignty to the people, and Mandela to inspire people to come together.</p>
<p>Even with this coherent perspective, there is a question regarding how transformative changes occur. This aspect becomes even murkier when Rotberg uses language such as achieving “mutual goals and joint purposes” and revitalizing “shared beliefs” (pp. 10, 35). This leadership perspective shares its roots in Woodrow Wilson’s view that a leader is able to interpret the authentic interest of the people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0010414012467624">Tulis, 1987</xref>). A leader does not change or create the motive bases but is able raise the people’s awareness of them. Yet Rotberg is also clear that leaders mold the makeup of people and nations. They do this by creating a vision and inviting people to follow them. Although the language of shared and mutual values can be appropriated in this context, it is also misleading to a certain extent. Leaders are the source of people’s identity. With this insight, there is a general question of whether transformative leaders interpret or create the “‘motive bases’ of potential followers” (p. 10).</p>
<p>Even though this conflict is not resolved, what Rotberg does best is show how moral leadership may contribute to transformative change. Each chapter on the four principal figures is able to capture who they were and how they struggled to make a difference. The explanation behind their success is not based simply on the force of their personalities. It is rooted in the force of their convictions to uplift and inspire. These results spring from the aforementioned critical competences such as integrity, intellectual honesty, and competency. The difficulty in developing and using these competencies provides one answer to why a crisis of leadership exists in both the developed and developing world.</p>
<p>Yet the failure to develop these core capabilities does not necessarily inhibit transformative leadership. There are other avenues to pursue to achieve transformational changes. As a result, Rotberg’s view of transformative leadership could be considered narrow and idealistic. He limits the meaning of leadership by describing “big men” who wield power to aggrandize themselves as merely being tyrants, not leaders. The narrowing of the definition of leadership to not include the unfortunate is problematic and, more important, hides the inherent dangers of what a transformative leader actually does. They create a way that helps move people into particular paths that can range from uplifting to degrading. This is why it is important not to lose sight of Weber’s central contribution of charisma. Legitimacy and followership do not solely rest on deliverable results that are to be trusted. They are also predicated on the ability to connect to people in nonrational and unforeseen ways.</p>
<p>Another possible limitation of this narrow definition of leadership is amplified by the fact that Machiavellian insights could have been taken more seriously. However, Rotberg partly counters this perspective with deftness. He argues that one does not just defeat fortune through one’s will and wit. It can also be done through a stern commitment to the public good. Contingency and change can be weathered by being anchored to underlying principles and having critical competencies. In particular, he shows how Mandela and Khama were able to do this in remarkable ways. Even with these accounts, Rotberg does not give enough attention to the ambiguous areas of statesmanship decisions. Lee and Ataturk were principled, but also made dubious, if not occasionally ruthless and wrong, choices. This dimension to their leadership makeup becomes critical because they were also the most transformative. A clearer discussion of how leaders handle their principles in the face of ambiguous situations would have been useful.</p>
<p>Apart from this minor quibble, Rotberg is able to forcefully present a leadership model that is counterintuitive. He presents an excellent how-to manual of leadership that is rooted in commitments and competencies. Political leaders serving in any capacity can benefit from this model. However, the real power of the question he asks is related to the transformative aspect of leadership. It is here where he argues that the power of agency can become transformative when attached to critical competencies that elevate a people, not a person. This contribution is significant. Critical competencies matter, but they do not fully explain what makes these leaders transformative. Despite the inability to fully uncover the majestic and mysterious nature of transformative leadership, Rotberg does provide much-needed additional insights into how this process may take place through moral and intellectual integrity.</p>
