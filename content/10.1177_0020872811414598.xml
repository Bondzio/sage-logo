<abstract>
<p>There is a significant lack of development studies on reproductive health, especially in developing countries. The field of social work has especially marginalized the study of reproductive health. Adding to this deficiency is the lack of meaningful theoretical frameworks guiding the reproductive field, especially in developing countries. This paper explores Amartya Sen’s theoretical perspectives as a possible theoretical framework that both guides the reproductive field and helps social work put reproductive health at the forefront of its agenda.</p>

<body>
<p>Remarkable advances in health status were achieved in almost all countries toward the close of the 20th century. However, health problems related to reproduction continue to be a major social problem. As reproductive health affects individuals’ well-being from birth to death, disproportionate levels of reproductive ill-health create a public health dilemma. For example, it is estimated that approximately one-fifth of the worldwide burden of illness and premature death is reproductive-health related (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0020872811414598">Lazarus et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0020872811414598">Singh et al., 2003</xref>). Given women’s childbearing role, the subject of reproductive well-being has special significance for women. It is estimated that one-third of the worldwide burden of illness and death for women is reproductive-health related (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0020872811414598">Ashford, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0020872811414598">Lazarus et al., 2004</xref>). Due to the magnitude of this problem, three out of the eight Millennium Development Goals targeted by the United Nations (UN) member states at the Millennium Summit in 2000 concerned reproductive health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0020872811414598">United Nations Development Program [UNDP], 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0020872811414598">United Nations Millennium Project, 2006</xref>). Yet this issue continues to receive insufficient attention, especially in developing countries. Furthermore, the field remains relatively atheoretical with no single influencing theory guiding the field.</p>
<p>This marginalization is especially evident in the field of social work, which is surprising given the field’s emphasis on human well-being and its prominent role in health issues. However, reproductive health has never been a mainstream social work area, and the problem is woefully neglected in developing countries. Traditionally, reproductive health issues in developing countries have been addressed either by the field health sector, by local or international non-governmental agencies, or by local government policies (mostly family planning). Attempts to understand reproductive health have taken a public health approach, emphasizing human rights, but without strong theoretical backing. Consequently, this article attempts to fill this gap by introducing Nobel Prize Winner Amartya Sen’s theoretical perspectives and their usefulness to the field of reproductive health, to demonstrate how social work can contribute significantly to this issue.</p>
<p>It is imperative to note at the onset that Amartya Sen’s discourses are on human well-being in general and are not propositions of reproductive health per se. However, health is an aspect of human well-being, and reproductive health is an aspect of health overall. Therefore, his propositions have many applicable merits to reproductive health, especially in developing countries with high poverty levels, scarce economic resources, and disproportionate levels of reproductive ill-health compared to developed countries. It is also important to understand that this model is not a new concept to the United Nations. Since the 1990s the United Nations Development Program, separate from the reproductive movement, has adopted Sen’s human development paradigm in its developmental efforts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0020872811414598">Fakuda-Parr, 2005</xref>). But very few efforts have been made to adopt this model directly to the reproductive health of women in developing countries, and no efforts have been made by the field of social work.</p>
<sec id="section1-0020872811414598">
<title>Current approaches toward reproductive health</title>
<p>In 1994 at the United Nations Cairo Conference, the UN adopted the well-being-based World Health Organization (WHO) definition of health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0020872811414598">United Nations, 1994</xref>). This shift was brought about largely by three different forces lobbying for change: (1) the international women’s movements in reaction to the coercive policy approaches that disregarded women’s well-being; (2) the public health movement seeking more holistic approaches; and (3) the rapid progress of the human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) epidemic, necessitating the urgency to look for root causes of the epidemic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0020872811414598">Pillai and Johnson, 2007</xref>). This move by the UN was viewed as a major victory by many groups, especially by transnational women’s groups who for many years were pushing for a broader conceptualization of women’s reproductive health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0020872811414598">Correa, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0020872811414598">Petchesky, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>This approach to reproductive health is considered the modern public health approach or reproductive rights based-developmental approach. This concept has special significance to developing countries. It is a progressive departure from the previous coercive population control approaches (anti-natalist) and prolife approaches (pro-natalist), and even reflects an exit from the narrowly-focused disease models which disregarded the individual rights of women for the greater public good (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0020872811414598">Rao, 2004</xref>). Thus the new public health model strongly emphasizes ‘reproductive rights of women’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0020872811414598">Mann, 1997a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0020872811414598">1998</xref>). Proponents of this model emphasize the importance of women’s rights to control their bodies with regards to reproductive decision making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0020872811414598">Petchesky and Judd, 2001</xref>). Additionally, the definition fully incorporated values and principles of gender equality and promoted empowerment of women to achieve equality through holistic multidimensional socioeconomic, political, and health improvements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0020872811414598">Petchesky, 1995</xref>). However, the central thesis of the public health approach is that human rights are the key encompassing element of connecting social factors that influence health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0020872811414598">Gostin, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0020872811414598">Mann, 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0020872811414598">1997a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0020872811414598">1997b</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite the importance of the public health model, reservations are voiced by different interest groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0020872811414598">Petchesky, 1998</xref>). Notably among them is the concern about an overemphasis of the individual rights-based approach to reproductive health of women in developing countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0020872811414598">Correa, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0020872811414598">Hartmann, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0020872811414598">Qadeer, 1998</xref>). Southern scholars for the most part have maintained that individual rights are pointless if the realities of individuals, especially women, and the circumstances in which they exercise freedoms are not taken into consideration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0020872811414598">Correa, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0020872811414598">Petchesky and Judd, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0020872811414598">Rao, 2004</xref>). Others have also pointed out the influence of gendered power dynamics of the larger structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0020872811414598">Petchesky and Judd, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0020872811414598">Pillai and Sunil, 2002a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0020872811414598">2002b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0020872811414598">Qadeer, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>Criticism of past approaches has led some critics to seek alternative models to address the reproductive health of women, especially one that is more congruent with developing countries’ values. Critics have also pointed out the lack of theoretical guidance in the field of reproductive health and insist that ‘a multidisciplinary approach is needed’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0020872811414598">Global Poverty Research Group, 2005</xref>: 1). They argue that a theoretical perspective is needed that takes into account context and relational conditions that create reproductive ill-health vulnerabilities, preventing attainment of reproductive well-being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0020872811414598">Global Poverty Research Group, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0020872811414598">Robeyns, 2002</xref>). As a result, some scholars have proposed Sen’s capability/freedom-based human development perspectives as an alternative approach to better address reproductive health of women in developing countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0020872811414598">DeJong, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0020872811414598">Robeyns, 2002</xref>).</p>

<title>Applicability of Sen’s theoretical perspectives</title>
<p>Sen’s theoretical perspectives on human development can be argued as a more comprehensive public health model of reproductive health that advances previous values-based models with capability, leading to empowerment. At the same time, his perspectives provide a much-needed theoretical framework for addressing reproductive health policy and practice at a global level, especially for addressing reproductive health matters in developing countries. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0020872811414598">Sen’s (1999a)</xref> development model differs in two distinct ways from the previous models of reproductive health: (1) it replaces the focus of individualistic human rights with the much broader concept of freedom/capabilities (that takes into consideration individual, cultural, and relational structures in its definition, among other determinants); and (2) it argues that social development efforts may be more important to human well-being than economic growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0020872811414598">Sen, 1999a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0020872811414598">2007</xref>). While this discussion presents the capability-based human development propositions of Amartya Sen, it is important to note that different perspectives on human development and capability have been proposed by others, notably among them those proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0020872811414598">Al Haq (1995)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0020872811414598">Martha Nussbaum (2000)</xref>.</p>
<p>The human development perspectives of Sen have four key concepts: capability/freedom, well-being/functioning, development as freedom, and human agency. The concept of freedom according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0020872811414598">Sen (1999a</xref>: 73) is the ability ‘to achieve actual livings that one can have reason to value’. This concept of freedom is also similar to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0020872811414598">Sen’s (1999a</xref>: 75) concept of ‘capability’, which he says is a type of a ‘substantive freedom to achieve alternative functioning combinations or the freedom to achieve various life styles’.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0020872811414598">Anand and Sen (1994)</xref> have identified reproductive freedom as an important freedom/capability. The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0020872811414598">UN’s 1994</xref> definition is that ‘people are able to have a satisfying and safe sex life and that they have the capability to reproduce and the freedom to decide if, when and how often to do so’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0020872811414598">UN, 1994</xref>: Chapter VII a). However, this approach reduces reproductive capabilities and freedoms to merely reproductive rights. The United Nations has emphasized the reproductive rights aspect of this definition, adding: ‘Implicit in this last condition is <italic>the right of men and women</italic> to be informed and to have access to safe, effective, affordable and acceptable methods of family planning of their choice for regulation of fertility’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0020872811414598">UN, 1994</xref>: Chapter VII a). Nevertheless, if we are to consider Sen’s definition of freedom and capability, then this freedom of entitlement or individual rights is only one aspect of reproductive freedoms and capabilities. Unfortunately, Sen himself does not explain what constitutes effective reproductive capability.</p>
<p>These definitions of freedom and capability are different from what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0020872811414598">Sen (1999b</xref>: 3) calls ‘human well-being’. Later, he describes it as ‘a person’s achievement: how well is his or her being?’. Well-being is equal to what he called ‘functioning’, which is ‘various things a person may value doing or being’, and adds that well-being can be an aggregate to reflect actual achievements or the ‘amount and extent of functionings enjoyed by a erson’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0020872811414598">Sen, 1999a</xref>: 75). The former (freedom/capability) is the choice or freedom to choose from a set of alternative lives one would wish to lead. In discussing the causal connection between the two, he reports that well-being can be seen as one set of living or doing from a varied combination of options, or it may be a direct result of an option itself. This ability to convert freedoms and capabilities to desired functionings and well-being, he argues, is affected by a multiplicity of interpersonal factors. For example, two people may have the same amount of external freedoms or capabilities presented to them, but their utility value may differ based on capabilities such as ‘differences in age, gender, special talents, disability, proneness to illness, and so on’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0020872811414598">Sen, 1999a</xref>: 69).</p>
<p>If well-being is seen as a desired achievement, we can make the case that reproductive health is an aspect of well-being – a desired end and a state ‘a person may value doing or being’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0020872811414598">Sen, 1999b</xref>: 75). This approach to reproductive health is very similar to the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0020872811414598">UN’s (1994)</xref> definition of reproductive health, which defines reproductive health as ‘a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity, in all matters relating to the reproductive system and to its functions and processes’ (Chapter VII a). On the subject of development, he emphasizes <italic>the human</italic> or <italic>people-first</italic> development policies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0020872811414598">Alkire and Deneulin, 2009a</xref>). To this end, he defines development as enhancement of human freedoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0020872811414598">Sen, 1999a</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0020872811414598">Sen (1999a)</xref>, the evaluative criterion of development is freedom/capability. That is, has the progress in development enhanced people’s freedoms and capabilities to function? He is opposed to strict evaluation of development through functionings or well-being. Strict focus on expanding functioning to him may lead to coercive and forceful policy practices, such as forced sterilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0020872811414598">Alkire and Deneuline, 2009b</xref>). An evaluation of well-being, he said, should take into account ‘counterfactual choice’; that is, what one could achieve given the options (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0020872811414598">Sen, 1992</xref>: 67).</p>
<p>If development is viewed as people first, and the goal is to bring about individual freedoms and capabilities, it must address factors beyond institutions, emphasis on human relations, and culture. He believed that development policies are value based; that is, what is translated as policies is what is valued as important. He strongly affirms the peoples’ right to decide for themselves; thus these policies must take into consideration their best interests. Here Sen’s concept of human agency is important to mention. ‘Agency,’ according to Sen, is the ‘ability to pursue goals that one values and has reason to value’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0020872811414598">Sen, 1999a</xref>: 19). Agency to him reflects both people themselves as well as benevolent social groups acting on their behalf. Thus defined, he believes human agency to be the best position from which to advocate for change.</p>
<p>Once policies are institutionalized they become social arrangements. To <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0020872811414598">Sen (1999a)</xref> these social arrangements should be targeted by human agency to enhance freedoms and capability. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0020872811414598">Sen (1993a</xref>: 8) argues that opportunities to a large extent depend on ‘what institutions exist and how they function’. He argues that institutions contribute to our freedoms and they can therefore be evaluated in terms of those contributions to our freedom. By the same token, however, individual freedom or human agency is also greatly constrained by social arrangements. If a certain social arrangement or a person’s position in a certain social arrangement disables a person from achieving full freedom, it is a social problem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0020872811414598">Sen, 1992</xref>). He sees deprivation, destitution, oppression, violence, inequality, and so on as such conditions or problems that prevent achievement of full freedoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0020872811414598">Sen, 1999a</xref>). Additionally, in this approach, development is viewed as a multidimensional <italic>process</italic> that expands a person’s freedoms or capacity to perform various functions. From this perspective, social, economic, and political aspects then become a few aspects – ‘constituent components’ – of development overall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0020872811414598">Sen, 1999a</xref>: 5). He emphasizes that some components are more instrumental in bringing about human freedoms than others. He argues that these components are best viewed as mutually complementary and causally correlated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0020872811414598">Sen, 1999a</xref>), and must be viewed together to understand what they can and cannot do (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0020872811414598">Sen, 1993b</xref>).</p>
<p>In the hierarchy of importance, he argues that social development efforts, by way of creation of social opportunities, directly benefit human capabilities/freedom and well-being, more than other more indirect efforts. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0020872811414598">Sen (2007)</xref> argues that economic gain can bring about a feeling of well-being or an opportunity to enhance human well-being, but it may not necessarily do so. Thus, to him, economic growth is not important in itself for human freedom, but only when it acts as an instrument or vehicle to make human lives better. He contests the view that human development is a kind of extravagance that countries can afford only when they have high economic growth. Instead, he demonstrates that nations can engage in human development efforts before breaking free from economic poverty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0020872811414598">Sen, 1993b</xref>). He has often cited welfare policies that are universal in nature as more beneficial to human agency, such as free education and universal health care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0020872811414598">Sen, 1999a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0020872811414598">2007</xref>). He has stated that democratic governments by design are the best political mechanisms to yield this end (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0020872811414598">Sen, 1993b</xref>). The next question is: what are the implications of Sen’s perspectives to the field of social work in guiding reproductive health of women?</p>

<title>Implications of Sen’s theoretical perspective to the field of social work to address reproductive health</title>
<p>Social work, as a field that primarily focuses on human well-being and acts in most circumstances as the conscience of the community, is in a position to contribute significantly to the reproductive health of women, especially in developing countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0020872811414598">Blyth, 2008</xref>). In fact, the International Federation of Social Workers (IFSW) has identified health in general an issue that is fundamental to social work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0020872811414598">IFSW, 2008</xref>). Yet as mentioned previously, social work has not traditionally been the primary interest group that has been active in the field of reproductive health of women, especially in the developing countries. However, a careful perusal of literature shows us that social work has been actively engaged in some areas of reproductive health, for example HIV/AIDS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0020872811414598">Blyth, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0020872811414598"><italic>Health and Social Work</italic>, 2004</xref>). More recently, partly as a result of the Millennium Development Goals’ emphasis on reproductive health, the field of social work is showing increased interest in the topic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0020872811414598">Blyth, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0020872811414598">IFSW, 2009</xref>). Despite this increased interest, the field continues to lack comprehensive theoretical frameworks to guide policy and practice in reproductive health. In the West, social work primarily operates from micro-practice frameworks, while the developing countries primarily depend on macro-level models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0020872811414598">Elliott and Mayadas, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0020872811414598">Midgley, 1995</xref>). What is lacking is comprehensive and bridging frameworks that unify what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0020872811414598">Elliott and Mayadas (1996</xref>: 61) call a ‘deadly dichotomy’ of micro and macro fields of practice. This is especially true where reproductive health matters are concerned.</p>
<p>In essence, then, a major implication of Sen’s theoretical perspectives to the fields of social work and reproductive health is that it can serve as a comprehensive and unifying theoretical framework to guide social work policy and practice bridging micro and macro approaches. It is a theoretical approach that is consistent with social work values. Both approaches focus on improving human well-being. International social work focuses on ‘enabling people to develop their full potential’, and the human development approach emphasizes ‘increasing human opportunities to function as they have reason to value’. Concepts such as human relationships, human rights, and social justice are crucial to social work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0020872811414598">Supplement of <italic>International Social Work</italic> [n.d.]</xref>: 1). These are all dimensions that contribute to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0020872811414598">Sen’s (1999a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0020872811414598">1999b</xref>) conceptualization of freedom/capability, people-first development, and agency. Second, it is a perspective that has both macro and micro practice implications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0020872811414598">Sen, 1999a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0020872811414598">1999b</xref>).</p>
<p>At a micro practice level, according to Sen’s theoretical propositions, improvements in reproductive health should be assessed in terms of reproductive capabilities. As social workers, we should primarily focus on improving people’s vectors of options to improve their reproductive health. However, capability depends on individuals and their situations. Each individual and each family has unique needs. These needs are based on a multiplicity of factors, including factors such as age, gender, disabilities, and class and ethnicity, among others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0020872811414598">Ariana and Naveed, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0020872811414598">Sen, 1999a</xref>). Each family has its component of unmet needs that traditional service delivery methods have left out. It is extremely important that social workers identify these unique needs. Intersecting these needs are also people’s cultural diversities. This approach recognizes that people differ in their values regarding their health, including reproductive health, and different people require different resources to reach their valued outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0020872811414598">Alkire and Deneulin, 2009a</xref>). Social workers must be respectful of these values in helping clients meet their needs. However, they must also help to dispel detrimental myths and combat influences of adverse groups, such as commercial medical interest groups and patriarchal structures that curtail people’s true freedoms to reach their desired ends.</p>
<p>One key element to enhancing people’s capabilities is actually having the <italic>ability to choose</italic>, which implies that empowering women and their families to be agents of their own health through increasing their reproductive capacities is central. Thus, social workers should help transform communities and individuals to act as agents themselves to increase efforts to improve their reproductive capabilities to choose their preferred reproductive health outcomes. This is consistent with the IFSW action statement that individuals have the right to make decisions regarding their health outcomes, and that individuals and their families perform the largest share of health work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0020872811414598">IFSW, 2008</xref>). Thus, social workers at micro practice level can act as activists, advocates, partners, educators, social counselors, and social researchers. Consequently, from this perspective, strength- and empowerment-based holistic capability enhancement methods may be encouraged over traditional, compartmentalized problem-oriented efforts.</p>
<p>At the development level, the human development perspective holds that developmental policies are normative based on value judgments of policy makers. The types of policies that get implemented are based on what has been identified as how groups should behave to bring about social improvements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0020872811414598">Alkire and Deneulin, 2009a</xref>). The question for social work policy and practice with regards to reproductive health, then, is: what type of policy should we promote? An important policy emphasis for social work is the human development perspective’s human or the <italic>people-first</italic> development focus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0020872811414598">Deneulin, 2009</xref>). That is, development must be viewed as improving individual choices or capabilities leading to human well-being, in this case reproductive capabilities, leading to reproductive health.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0020872811414598">Sen (2007</xref>: 3) has emphasized that social development-based efforts are more congruent with human development. He identified some of these efforts as ‘social policies, including the building up of facilities of education, health care, social insurance, social work, and cultivation of social relations between different people within society and across the world’. This is consistent among other social work value practices with the IFSW policy action statements to promote holistic understanding of health, and the commitment to advocate for ‘more equal distribution of resources that underpin health, including a minimum guaranteed income, food security, clean water, adequate shelter, warmth and clothing, education and safe and sustained relationships’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0020872811414598">IFSW, 2008</xref>: 1). Consequently, social workers at the policy and practice levels should lobby for and assist in the implementation of social policies that enhance people’s choices and social relationships, such as universal health care, education, and easy access for human resources. This involves promoting a holistic definition of reproductive well-being, and educating not only communities but also policy makers about effective policies that can promote reproductive well-being, challenging unjust policies, and collaborating and coordinating with other interest groups. Social work representation, or political representation that promotes social work values, is essential, especially at government and International Nongovernmental Organizations (INGO) levels. However, most importantly, social workers should organize communities to advocate for themselves at the necessary government and other interest group levels to seek what they need to pursue reproductive well-being, at the same time representing and giving a voice for the most vulnerable individuals and communities.</p>
<p>Yet another proposition with implications to international social work is that the human development approach places the human problems external to individuals. Social arrangements and people’s place in them are seen as the locus of human problems. Therefore, inequality, poverty, deprivation, and other such social evils are viewed to be caused by the arrangement of social structures (and not due to individual malfunctions; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0020872811414598">Sen, 1999a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0020872811414598">1999b</xref>). How individuals are affected by these problems depends on their respective place in these arrangements. It is not sufficient to just replace a person’s position in the structure, it is also important to target the social arrangement itself. This is also compatible with the IFSW health policy statement that ‘health status is primarily determined by social, economic, environmental and political conditions and is an issue of social equality and justice’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0020872811414598">IFSW, 2008</xref>: 1, § 5). This idea has several implications for how international social work can approach the reproductive health of women in developing countries. This means social workers can act like agents of change, helping to restructure these social arrangements to enhance the reproductive health of individuals and communities. Additionally, as agents of change, they can also help change clients’ social positions in the systems directly. Furthermore, they can help integrate different segments involved in reproductive health. They can also help them understand the interconnections involved and emphasize the importance of interdependence to work for the common good to overcome reproductive ill-health.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In conclusion, a human development perspective is compatible with international social work values, mission, and goals. Sen’s human development theory has utility to both the field of reproductive health and the field of social work to address reproductive health matters. It can provide much-needed theoretical guidelines for the field of social work with regards to the reproductive health of women. With helpful implications of how international social work can address the reproductive health of women, especially in developing countries, it is a perspective well worth exploring. However, limitations exist. One of the biggest drawbacks of this approach is that concepts are underspecified, and the scope and range is not explicated in its entirety. Additionally, reproductive health is a topic that generates much debate and controversy. Yet Sen himself does not provide clear guidelines as to how to navigate through these controversies, except to say that our duty is to help expand people’s capabilities, and recognize that different people have ‘different values in terms of health, and they will often weigh these values against other dimensions’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0020872811414598">Ariana and Naveed, 2009</xref>: 234). Nevertheless, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0020872811414598">Sen (1993a</xref>: 48) notes, there is a positive side to an incomplete theory in that it can be ‘consistent and combinable with several different substantive theories’, allowing it to be completed with ‘reasoned agreement’.</p>
<p>In the end, the true feasibility of a theory can be measured only after multiple tests and validations of that theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0020872811414598">Payne, 1997</xref>). Attempts to study Sen’s perspectives are rapidly gaining momentum in the mainstream developmental fields (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0020872811414598">Clark, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0020872811414598">DeJong, 2006</xref>), thus giving hope to validity and applicability of the theory in general. It is hoped that this theory will be pursued by more social work academics, especially testing its value to the field of reproductive health in developing countries.</p>
