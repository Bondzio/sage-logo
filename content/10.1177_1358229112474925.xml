      <p>In this issue Douglas Hodgson considers the educational rights of people with disabilities, reviewing the development of international human rights law and standards and their application in Australian law and policy, referring to the Disability Discrimination Act 1992 and the Disability Standards for Education 2005. The effects of disability-based discrimination may be most noticeable in education. He discusses the obstacles to the full realisation of these educational rights and argues that the principal barrier is a lack of resources to provide appropriate support and services. In considering ways of making these rights more effective, he highlights the need for a greater focus on practical measures in order to eliminate discrimination. Issues raised by Hodgson include the failure to respond to special educational needs at the pre-school stage, when, as he argues, the earlier the identification of the disability the greater is the chance of developing programmes to deal with the individual’s needs. A further issue emphasised is the importance of accessible enrolment practice. He also considers the advantages of inclusive education. However, the key issue, not just in Australia but worldwide, is the need to provide sufficient resources to meet these educational needs.</p>
      <p>Obonye Jonas considers the persecution of homosexuals in Africa and possible strategies for combating this oppression. Jonas argues that the African Commission has a key role to play in the struggle for the recognition of gay and lesbian rights and in challenging attitudes, yet so far has shown little commitment to protecting these rights. Jonas considers persecution in Malawi, Senegal and Uganda. Homosexuality remains illegal in the majority of African states and many of the leaders of African states are openly homophobic. Some African states have signed up to the major international human rights instruments, including the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which prohibit discrimination on the ground of sexual orientation yet fail to protect gays and lesbians from violence and persecution. Even where homosexuality is legal, gays and lesbians may suffer abuse and discrimination. For example, South Africa’s constitution guarantees a right to sexual orientation but there are still high levels of violence against gays and lesbians. Yet, as Jonas argues, recognition of sexual minorities is essential for a state committed to human rights protection. He discusses the question in terms of the rights to equality, bodily integrity, privacy and dignity and the need to protect individual rights against majoritarian views. Obviously decriminalisation will not guarantee protection, as homophobic attitudes may persist, but it is an essential step towards equality.</p>
      <p>Myriam Hunter-Henin also focuses on education but discusses the challenges of accommodating religious faiths in the school context, when doing so may be perceived as a threat to a nation’s identity. The treatment of this question is considered with particular reference to European Convention jurisprudence and the use of the proportionality test. The problem of reconciling what may appear to be incompatible rights is addressed and the role of law as a tool for negotiation between diverging interests is examined.</p>
