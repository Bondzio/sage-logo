<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>In his recent paper advocating reform of mental health legislation, Arya invokes autonomy, equity and freedom from discrimination to argue that a mentally ill person should be coercively treated ‘only if the individual is deemed “incapacitated” to make decisions that he/she considers are in his/her best interest’ (p.3).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1039856212475325">1</xref></sup> He defines a loss of capacity via established legal criteria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1039856212475325">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1039856212475325">3</xref></sup> and states that ‘only when a patient is unable to make an autonomous decision is it the duty of the health professional to act in the patient’s “best interests”’ (p.3).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1039856212475325">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Arya then translates this secure base into his first two criteria for coercive treatment – the presence of a mental illness and the absence of capacity. His third criterion, though, does not emerge from his ethical analysis. It takes the form of the curiously formulated ‘a risk that is significant enough for the society to believe that prevention of this risk is a collective responsibility of the society’ (p.4).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1039856212475325">1</xref></sup> Arya posits that once a mentally ill person is deemed to lack capacity, he or she may only receive coercive treatment if judged to present this oddly conceived level of risk. Odder still, he suggests that the arbiter of presence or absence of this level of risk will usually be the person’s primary caregiver.</p>
<p>Arya’s third criterion is impossible to support. Since it is not possible for even trained professionals to usefully categorise psychiatric patients by their likelihood of coming to, or causing, future harm,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1039856212475325">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1039856212475325">5</xref></sup> how could relatives be expected to do so? Similarly, how could caregivers (or in their absence, health professionals) judge what level of risk society believes to be sufficient so as to make its prevention the collective responsibility of society? How could this level of risk be judged by anyone?</p>
<p>Arya is right to seek reform of our mental health laws, and right to demand that people living with mental illness not be subject to coercive treatment unless it can be demonstrated that they lack decision-making capacity. He is also right in saying that ‘health professionals have an obligation to endeavour to enhance autonomy and facilitate the likelihood of a patient being able to make an autonomous decision’ (p.3).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1039856212475325">1</xref></sup> However, he errs when he introduces his complicated notion of risk as his third criterion for coercive treatment.</p>
<p>If a person lacks capacity to make a treatment decision, and that capacity cannot be restored with support, then treatment should be given in the person’s best interests. Moreover, as Arya also suggests, best interests should not be calculated from some ‘external perspective’. Instead, every effort should be made to ascertain and understand the patient’s will and preferences, and to give effect to these to the fullest extent possible when prescribing treatment in a person’s best interests.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1039856212475325">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1039856212475325">7</xref></sup></p>
