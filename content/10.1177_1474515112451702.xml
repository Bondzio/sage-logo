<title>Background:</title>
<p>A sustained epidemic of cardiovascular disease and related risk factors is a global phenomenon contributing significantly to premature deaths and costly morbidity. Preventative strategies across the full continuum of life, from a population to individual perspective, are not optimally applied. This paper describes a simple and adaptable ‘traffic-light’ system we have developed to systematically perform individual risk and need delineation in order to ‘titrate’ the intensity and frequency of healthcare intervention in a cost-effective manner.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1474515112451702">
<title>Methods:</title>
<p>The GARDIAN (Green Amber Red Delineation of Risk and Need) system is an individual assessment of risk and need that modulates the frequency and intensity of future healthcare intervention. Individual assessment of risk and need for ongoing intervention and support is determined with reference to three domains: (1) clinical stability, (2) gold-standard management, and (3) a broader, holistic assessment of individual circumstance. This can be applied from a primary prevention, secondary prevention, or chronic disease management perspective.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1474515112451702">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>Our experience with applying and validating GARDIAN to titrate healthcare resources according to need has been extensive to date, with &gt;5000 individuals profiled in a host of clinical settings. A series of clinical randomized trials will determine the impact of the GARDIAN system on important indices of healthcare utilization and health status.</p>

<p>The GARDIAN model to delineating risk and need for varied intensity of management shows strong potential to cost effectively improve health outcomes for both individuals at risk of heart disease and those with established heart disease.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Non-communicable forms of heart disease, linked to preventable risk factors, represent one of the biggest contributors to premature deaths and costly morbidity around the globe.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1474515112451702">1</xref></sup> Recent data from Northern Europe<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1474515112451702">2</xref></sup> and sub-Saharan Africa<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1474515112451702">3</xref></sup> provides evidence of a sustained and emerging epidemic of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in high and low-to-middle income countries, respectively. This global phenomenon is attributable to a combination of: (1) the health dynamics of ageing populations, (2) a preponderance of risk factors due to poor lifestyle choices (e.g. sedentary behaviour, smoking, and high-caloric diets rich in saturated fats), and(3) improved survival rates for acute cardiac events and chronic heart disease owing to medical advancements. While there are obvious regional differences in risk profiles across the globe, established and emerging antecedents of heart disease and other forms of CVD (predominantly ischaemic stroke), including hypertension<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1474515112451702">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1474515112451702">5</xref></sup> and type 2 diabetes,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1474515112451702">6</xref></sup> are at historically high levels.</p>
<p>Naturally, the prospect of more people affected by CVD requires careful consideration of the fundamental role and sustainable funding of primary and secondary prevention programmes. Unfortunately, despite encouraging results from EUROACTION,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1474515112451702">7</xref></sup> data from the EUROASPIRE surveys<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1474515112451702">8</xref></sup> suggest that we are yet to optimally apply preventative strategies either from a population to individual risk control or from a primary to secondary prevention perspective. Ideally, as represented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1474515112451702">Figure 1</xref>,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1474515112451702">9</xref></sup> all countries around the globe would apply an integrated and holistic model of primary and secondary prevention across the full continuum of life from a population to individual perspective.</p>

</fig>
<p>One of the major impediments to applying an individual approach to primary or secondary prevention is determining how best to apply limited resources to their greatest potential, particularly in low-resource settings.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1474515112451702">10</xref></sup> For example, it became clear in the initial application of post-discharge chronic heart failure management programmes that they would become rapidly unsustainable from an economic and logistic perspective without the ability to effectively ‘release’ patients from management in order to accommodate newly discharged patients in greater need of active management.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1474515112451702">11</xref></sup> Arising from this conundrum of using available resources wisely and in a sustainable manner (i.e. how best to make do with limited resources but make the greatest impact on health outcomes), we describe an easy-to-apply ‘traffic light’ coding of individuals and patients according to their needs – the GARDIAN (Green Amber Red Delineation of Risk and Need) system. Specifically, this paper describes how our systematic approach to individual assessment of risk and need from prevention to chronic disease management can cost-effectively modulate the frequency and intensity of healthcare intervention for both individuals at risk of heart disease and those with established heart disease. We also describe how the impact of GARDIAN is being rigorously evaluated in a series of randomized clinical trials involving &gt;5000 participants.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1474515112451702">
<title>Key barriers to optimal prevention and management</title>
<p>There are compelling individual and public health reasons to apply the findings from multidisciplinary management programmes and population-based studies to develop a more systematic, yet simple, approach to applying limited healthcare resources. In reviewing the literature and in undertaking our own extensive research programme, we have identified three critical domains that provide important insights into the needs of any individual and the factors that will determine their future health outcomes without pro-active and responsive intervention.</p>
<sec id="section7-1474515112451702">
<title>Clinical instability</title>
<p>We have previously shown that between 10–40% of cardiac patients remain clinically unstable when assessed in the 7–14 days following an acute admission.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1474515112451702">12</xref></sup> These patients are at high risk for recurrent readmission and/or death. In the community setting, a similarly large proportion of individuals present with extreme risk factors (e.g. markedly elevated blood pressure) that require immediate attention.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1474515112451702">
<title>Suboptimal pharmacological and non-pharmacological intervention</title>
<p>A potentially important contributor to clinical instability and longer-term morbidity/mortality is suboptimal pharmacological therapy – from the lack of antiplatelet therapy for someone who is recovering from an acute coronary syndrome to the absence of an effective antiarrhythmic agent for someone with ‘rate controlled’ chronic atrial fibrillation (AF). Even when treated appropriately, therapy adjustment is often inadequate; typically half of patients treated for hypertension<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1474515112451702">4</xref></sup> or dyslipidaemia in primary or secondary prevention<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1474515112451702">13</xref></sup> studies do not meet recommended target levels. From a nonpharmacological perspective, strategies such as regular exercise, weight reduction, smoke cessation, and healthier dietary patterns to improve cardiovascular health are often inadequately applied at the individual level and in coordinated programmes (including cardiac rehabilitation).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1474515112451702">14</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1474515112451702">
<title>Individual barriers to positive health outcomes</title>
<p>Beyond traditional risk factors (including smoking, metabolic disorders, and hypertension), there are many individual and health-system barriers to positive health outcomes. In the absence of flexible healthcare models, individual factors such as treatment nonadherence, poor knowledge, and suboptimal self-care behaviour<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1474515112451702">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1474515112451702"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1474515112451702">17</xref></sup> have proven difficult to overcome. With increasing age and comorbidity, cognitive impairment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1474515112451702">18</xref></sup> and depression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1474515112451702">19</xref></sup> have also been identified as important modulators of cardiovascular outcomes (particularly impacting on ability to self-care and motivation to change health behaviours). These problems are often magnified in the setting of social isolation and distance from healthcare services typically centred around large population centres.</p>

<title>GARDIAN: a traffic light system of risk delineation and management</title>
<p>As part of a programme of research to expand the evidence-base of predominantly nurse-led programmes across the full spectrum of CVD (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1474515112451702">Table 1</xref>), we have developed a simple and adaptable ‘traffic-light’ system of risk delineation and management (GARDIAN). GARDIAN has enabled us to sustainably (and cost-effectively if proven in a series of clinical randomized trials; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1474515112451702">Table 1</xref>) address four key principles directed towards individuals aged 25 years or more as outlined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1474515112451702">Figure 1</xref> (proactive primary prevention, detect disease early, aggressive secondary prevention, and chronic disease management). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1474515112451702">Table 1</xref> highlights that our experience with applying and validating GARDIAN (with continued development and improvement) to titrate healthcare resources according to need has been extensive to date; with &gt;5000 individuals profiled in a host of settings (ranging from the community, primary care, and nurse-led home and clinic programmes in addition to multisite programmes) and subsequently managed using this approach. The following sections outline the key components and practical application of this system of care. More detailed descriptions of the specific methods used to assess study participants and their subsequent management are available in currently published and impending reports arising from the trials described in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1474515112451702">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<title>Clinical stability</title>
<p>Clinical stability is denoted by any functional limitation and/or chronic symptom relating to underlying CVD or a related condition despite medical or surgical therapy. Although this domain is particularly important in patients discharged from an acute coronary event and/or with chronic heart disease and may represent a life-threatening event (e.g. syncope indicative of ventricular arrhythmias), it also has relevance to a community care setting where an individual with extremely elevated blood pressure (e.g. systolic blood pressure &gt;180 mmHg) requires immediate attention.</p>

<title>Gold-standard management</title>
<p>Gold-standard management is determined by comparing all recommended and prescribed (pharmacological and nonpharmacological) treatment against gold-standard guidelines for the primary and secondary prevention of CVD (or related conditions). The adequacy of management needs to be evaluated against clinical targets, particularly for risk reduction (e.g. blood pressure, lipids, and HbA1c). There are a plethora of guidelines that guide the application of both pharmacological and nonpharmacological therapies that need to be evaluated for all individuals to provide maximal primary or secondary prevention. In primary prevention in particular, risk prediction equations are valuable to aid in the identification of high-risk subjects and to guide treatment intervention.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1474515112451702">20</xref></sup> Consistent with the well-described ‘treatment gap’ phenomenon described above, it is not unusual to find patients who are not adequately managed (perhaps clinically unstable) yet immediately benefit from the application of evidence-based therapies.</p>

<title>Holistic profile</title>
<p>Holistic profile is defined by a range of important behavioural, psychological, or social factors that will positively or negatively impact on an individual’s short- to long-term health. These include the pattern of awareness and knowledge about the impact of cardiovascular risk and established disease, self-care abilities, cognitive function, mental health (particularly anxiety and depression), social support, and of course, the pattern of treatment adherence; the latter including extent of knowledge about the purpose and potential adverse effects of such treatment. Typically these can be specifically measured using a range of validated tools.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1474515112451702">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1474515112451702"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1474515112451702"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1474515112451702"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1474515112451702">25</xref></sup> However, comprehensive, individual assessment on a one-to-one basis will often highlight factors not easily captured by formal tools. Once again, it is not unusual to find that individuals with clinical instability and contributory factors that require intervention beyond gold-standard therapy.</p>

<title>Classifying individuals using GARDIAN: titrating intensity and frequency of management based on presentation</title>

A RED code (‘stop immediately and address areas of concern to promote clinical stability’) is assigned to anybody who is clinically unstable, the reasons for which may be related to how the individual measures up on the other two domains of GARDIAN (gold-standard management and holistic profile). The recommendation or intervention pattern for RED-coded individuals requires prompt action via referral to a health professional, specialist, or in extreme cases directly to a hospital, in order to avert a cardiovascular event (in the case of primary prevention), prevent the progression of worsening disease (secondary prevention), or avoid a major morbid or fatal event (chronic disease management). Based on the level of need, the follow-up strategy can involve a combination of phone contact, home/clinic visits, and close liaison with the individual’s health professional or specialist(s) to monitor clinical status and/or address contributory factors.</p>
<p>An AMBER code (‘proceed with caution ensuring that areas of concern are addressed in the short-to-medium term’) is assigned to anybody who is suboptimally managed or has deficits in their holistic profile without causing clinical instability. At the very minimum, those who are not on gold-standard treatments and/or not achieving therapeutic goals for primary prevention, secondary prevention, or chronic disease management will be designated as an AMBER-coded individual. From a holistic profile perspective, those who have a poor social network (e.g. live alone and in relative isolation from family or friends), are incapable to self-care, have impaired cognitive function or mental health issues, have poor understanding and awareness of their underlying CVD or related conditions/risk factors, or treatment thereof, and who are nonadherent to their prescribed treatment plans will also be designated as an AMBER-coded individual. The follow-up strategy for AMBER-coded individuals involves a combination of phone calls or home/clinic visits with possible liaison with the individual’s health professional or specialist(s) to assist in applying gold-standard therapy and help monitor potential side effects of therapy, until all targets are met. A key requirement is the need to ‘coach’ those to achieve target therapeutic goals (e.g. lipid levels), educate them about their underlying CVD or related conditions/risk factors and establish clear times to seek medical assistance, and determine the need for referral to allied health professionals or further intervention.</p>
<p>A GREEN code (‘proceed with the patient’s care unchanged’) is assigned to anybody who is found to be clinically stable, on gold-standard management, and meeting therapeutic targets for primary or secondary prevention or chronic disease management perspective and with no individual issues likely to negatively impact on their health outcomes. The follow-up strategy involves limited planned contact but the ability to receive future advice in order to maintain good heart health and/or address any contributory factors as they may arise.</p>

<title>Common elements of intervention arising from GARDIAN classification</title>
<p>Whilst we present a framework for clearly delineating risk of a poor health outcome and subsequent need for intervention with modification of the frequency and intensity of management between red-, amber-, and green-coded individuals, there are some commonalities that apply across all individuals at any place along the CVD disease continuum. The key elements of intervention that naturally arise from GARDIAN classification include: (1) ‘coaching’ to promote a healthy lifestyle, support risk modification, ensure the quality use of medicines, and encourage active self management of risk and chronic disease, (2) improving the coordination of care to work with healthcare professionals to achieve individual goals for optimal risk and disease management, (3) incorporating family members or carers to optimize the management of individuals, and (4) providing the ability to phone a designated cardiac nurse for advice to facilitate positive health outcomes in the immediate to longer term. In all of our disease management programmes, the instance of a (re)admission to hospital or re-evaluation of an individual assessment of risk is prompted with regard to the appropriate primary prevention, secondary prevention, or chronic disease management guidelines.</p>

<title>Practical application of GARDIAN</title>
<p>This section provides a real-life case study of GARDIAN in action, in this case a 68-year-old man recently hospitalized with chronic AF (rate controlled). As can be appreciated, in order to effectively apply GARDIAN, it is important to not only comprehensively review the patient’s clinical status and psychosocial circumstances, but consult the latest detailed guidelines and interpret the therapeutic targets specific to the forms of CVD, remembering that any attempts to accommodate the ‘recipe’ approach offered by expert guidelines becomes progressively harder to apply with competing therapeutic priorities and the needs of the individual. Ultimately, the clinical support and management of individuals has to take into account those symptoms and risk factors that most affect them in conjunction with any consequences (i.e. reduced survival) derived from selecting specific therapeutic targets.</p>
<sec id="section18-1474515112451702">
<title>Brief case scenario</title>
<p>Mr Smith was a 68-year-old man recently hospitalized with chronic AF controlled via rate therapy. His past history included uncontrolled hypertension and, while advanced echocardiography demonstrated intact left ventricular systolic function, it showed an enlarged left atrium and diastolic dysfunction. A comprehensive home visit 10 days following hospital discharge revealed the following according to the GARDIAN classification system.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-1474515112451702">
<title>Clinical status</title>
<p>At the home visit, Mr Smith was found to be clinically stable with a blood pressure of 130/75 mmHg and a heart rate of 75 beats/min (rhythm AF) confirmed by a 12-lead ECG. Whilst there were no other signs and symptoms of heart failure, he was assessed as New York Heart Association functional class II. However, a 24-hour ECG Holter monitor applied at the home visit and reviewed immediately after demonstrated a highly labile heart rate (with frequent episodes of ‘fast’ AF/flutter and heart rate &gt;100 beats/min). Mr Smith subsequently reported periodic episodes of weakness, palpitations, and dyspnoea.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section20-1474515112451702">
<title>Management status</title>
<p>According to his risk score for thromboembolic events, Mr Smith was appropriately prescribed a combination of aspirin and clopidogrel. However, given his impaired cardiac structure/function and subsequently revealed episodes of uncontrolled AF, his cardioprotective and antiarrhythmic therapy was assessed to be suboptimal relative to current guidelines. From a nonpharmacological perspective, Mr Smith had been encouraged to exercise but had not been referred to a specific programme to address his persistent tobacco smoking (20 cigarettes per day).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section21-1474515112451702">
<title>Holistic status</title>
<p>On formal assessment, Mr Smith was found to have mild cognitive impairment. Moreover, when discussing his health with his supportive wife, it was discovered that Mr Smith had made a conscious decision to pay for his cigarettes and his wife’s treatment (she had emphysema exacerbated by his smoking) rather than regularly paying for his own treatment; fortunately he still had his medication from his hospital episode at that time. Overall, his ability to self-care was found to be impaired.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section22-1474515112451702">
<title>GARDIAN classification</title>
<p>Based on the above, Mr Smith was assessed as a RED category requiring immediate intervention to address his clinical instability. Other related issues requiring intervention included: (1) his level of antiarrhythmic and cardioprotective therapy, (2) smoking, (3) financial status, and (4) his inability to self-care.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section23-1474515112451702">
<title>Management</title>
<p>As in all cases where GARDIAN is applied, Mr Smith and his wife were informed of the visit findings and their options in respect to risk mitigation, optimal treatment (including the need for urgent intervention), and ongoing surveillance discussed relative to their perceptions of what they required (in terms of support) and could manage. This included a list of priorities from their perspective (e.g. Mr Smith agreed that his smoking did need to be addressed as a priority). A comprehensive report was sent back to Mr Smith’s primary care physician and cardiologist. The latter was contacted immediately and an urgent review of Mr Smith’s clinical status and pharmacotherapy was undertaken with more intensive surveillance and treatment implemented. In the short-to-medium term, the cardiac nurse organized a referral to a Quit Smoking programme, a community pharmacist (home medicines) review, financial advice, and continued surveillance over 3 months (including one further home visit and four phone calls) to ensure the revised management plan was appropriately implemented.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Based on the studies ongoing or completed to date, as presented above, and the practical experiences of the authors, we believe there is a compelling case for the GARDIAN system to be applied widely in order to improve the cost-efficiency of prevention and disease management programmes. This pragmatic strategy applies a framework for individual assessment of risk and need from prevention to chronic disease management in order to cost-effectively modulate the frequency and intensity of healthcare intervention for individuals at risk or with established heart disease. To our knowledge, this is the first systematic approach to delineating risk and in turn the need for varied intensity of management designed to specifically improve cardiovascular-related health outcomes.</p>
<p>Our experiences with the GARDIAN system (in &gt;5000 individuals to date in a range of settings) have been extremely positive in respect to managing a potentially high workload for our cardiac nurses as they seek to apply quite complex risk mitigation and disease management protocols. Continued development of the system has resulted in the development of an electronic platform that allows the cardiac nurse to generate automated reports (facilitated by an envelope folding machine) according to the three key domains of assessment. Ultimately, the success of GARDIAN (representing a key component of enhanced intervention/management relative to usual care) will be judged by the results of a number of clinical randomized trials across the cardiovascular spectrum of disease and risk. However, early results from a primary prevention (VIPER-BP study), secondary prevention trial (<email>Young@Heart</email> study) and chronic disease management study (WHICH? trial) are extremely encouraging and form the basis for our confidence in its wider adoption and utility. Further development of the tool will specifically focus on needs and management of the increasing number of individuals with metabolic syndrome/diabetes. In the future, we hope to undertake studies that examine the external validity and consistency of the tool in other healthcare systems.</p>
<p>In summary, the GARDIAN system was designed to be a pragmatic strategy to tailor prevention and disease management to individual needs whilst ensuring limited resources (i.e. time allocation of both cardiac nurses and the wider healthcare team) are used cost-effectively. With extensive experience with this system, our group believes it can be widely used and adapted accordingly across the spectrum of CVD prevention and management.</p>
