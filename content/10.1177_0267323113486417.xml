<abstract>
<p>Debate about the quantity of political information often tends to evaluate television negatively since it became a widely used mass medium. Systematic data on the supply and proportion of political information on television, however, are scarce. This research fills this gap by presenting a longitudinal analysis of broadcast time for political information. The authors examine specifically how time spent on the broad categories of information, infotainment and entertainment on television in the Netherlands has evolved from 1957 to 2006. Results show that over time both public and commercial broadcasters have dedicated more time to information programming, but these programmes have moved out of prime time, especially on commercial channels. Overall, time spent on entertainment has gone down, contrary to expectations, while time for infotainment programmes has gone up, in concordance with existing beliefs.</p>

<body>
<p>Most discussions and appraisals of political information on television have a clear temporal angle to them, often focusing on dynamics in the post-Second World War era. Although some authors qualify television as inherently at odds with the requirements of providing political information (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0267323113486417">Hart, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0267323113486417">Postman, 1985</xref>), the more common approach is to question whether the quality and quantity of political information have deteriorated since television became a widely used mass medium.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0267323113486417">1</xref></sup> Focusing on the content and style of political television journalism, authors have studied whether the information that television provides has become more popular and more personalized, and have often – though not always – concluded that popularization and personalization have occurred to the detriment of other, more substantial dimensions of political information. These studies are often led by concerns about TV’s harmful influence on the workings of a healthy democracy (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0267323113486417">Brants and Neijens, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0267323113486417">Machin and Papatheoderou, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0267323113486417">Sparks and Tulloch, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0267323113486417">Street, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>In this article, we take issue with an important problem in the research about political information on television: the assumption of deterioration over time. Studies focusing on specific trends in media content, such as popularization or personalization, provide contrasting evidence (see for instance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0267323113486417">Norris, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0267323113486417">Rahat and Sheafer, 2007</xref>), with Anglo-American based scholars more often leaning towards the idea that entertainment has become all dominant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0267323113486417">Blumler and Kavanagh, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0267323113486417">Langer, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0267323113486417">Wattenberg, 1991</xref>). As systematic data on the supply and proportion of political information on television have hardly been collected, the evidence for strong-worded convictions about a changing ‘political information environment’ tends to be weak, and often based on selective or anecdotal data.</p>
<p>The research we present in this article is meant to counter these issues by presenting, first, a historically grounded inventory of potential broadcast time for political information. We examine specifically how the time spent on the broad categories of information, infotainment and entertainment on television in the Netherlands has evolved from 1956 to 2006. While only a small country on the global stage, its media landscape has been recognized as indicative for other national systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0267323113486417">Hallin and Mancini, 2004</xref>). Second, we articulate the outcomes with the three phases of political communication that various authors have identified as, successively, ‘party-domination’, ‘public logic’ and ‘postmodern’ or ‘media logic’.</p>
<p>In the following sections of this article we discuss, first, the only longitudinal empirical study about changes in political information on television that is available at present, and address the more general temporal models in political communication. Next, we specify the resulting research questions and describe the archive data and the coding categories used for the analysis. Our results show that over time both public and commercial broadcasters in the Netherlands have dedicated more time to information programming, but these programmes have moved out of prime time, especially on commercial channels. We also find that overall time spent on entertainment has gone down, contrary to expectations, while time for infotainment programmes has gone up, in concordance with existing beliefs. These diverging trends are relatively well explained by taking the three phases of political communication into account. In conclusion, we discuss our results in the context of the debate about the quality of political television journalism for democracy, and provide suggestions for further research.</p>
<sec id="section1-0267323113486417">
<title>Theory</title>
<p>There is, at present, little empirical evidence about changes in the available airtime for political information on television. Yet, it is evident that there is now more broadcasting time than ever. A growing number of television channels and the rise of other platforms to watch television (internet, mobile phones) have given television a non-stop presence, although many authors have argued that this has also made it harder to reach people and TV’s audiences have increasingly become fragmented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0267323113486417">Koopmans, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0267323113486417">Prior, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0267323113486417">2007</xref>). It is unclear, however, whether the current abundance simultaneously offers more space for political information, or whether it has been filled with entertainment offerings instead. Does more time also mean more time for political information? <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0267323113486417">Aalberg et al. (2010)</xref> are in fact the only researchers to have addressed this question, by studying the flow of political information in six western countries over a period of 20 years. Based on an analysis of TV guides in 1987, 1997 and 2007, they found that the time spent on news and current affairs differs considerably across countries, with the lowest scores for those countries that are most commercialized. Their conclusion on developments over time is less clear-cut: in most countries, the amount of news in general has increased as the consequence of the establishment of new (commercial) channels, but they do not find such a trend focusing on prime time specifically. However, the relatively limited time-span (20 years) and the fact that they sampled only three years in that period does not allow for a systematic and structural comparison over time.</p>
<p>The study by Aalberg et al. demonstrates how important it is to identify the most basic level of what they call the ‘political information environment’, which concerns, among other things, the question as to how much time is actually (made) available for political information. This is the focus of the research at hand. While Aalberg et al. focus on the development of news and current affairs programmes per se, in a somewhat limited time period, we analyse the <italic>relative</italic> amount of time available for political information by comparing how the number of and hours spent on information, infotainment and entertainment programmes have changed from the beginning of television to the current period. This prolonged time period, and the inclusion of the two other main categories of TV programming compared to the Aalberg et al. study, enables us to articulate the trends in the political information environment with the different phases of political communication that several scholars in this field have identified. They generally divide the postwar era into three overlapping periods to describe changing relations between politics, media and citizens.</p>
<p>The first two decades after the Second World War have mostly been identified as the first phase, in which political parties dominated most Western European societies. These political parties were closely related to strong cleavages that structured societies in clearly distinguishable groups, based on social distinctions or – as in the Netherlands – on ideological preferences and religious denominations. Press and broadcasting media in this period were usually clearly tied to those societal divisions. As Brants and Van Praag argue ‘most press and broadcasting in countries of the Northern European model functioned as a platform on which specific factions of the socio-political elite could inform the electorate about the ideas and plans they deemed relevant for the public to know’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0267323113486417">Brants and Van Praag, 2006</xref>: 28). This so called period of <italic>political parallelism</italic> meant a situation in which political parties set the agenda, which journalists followed. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0267323113486417">Blumler and Kavanagh (1999)</xref> call this period the <italic>first age</italic> of political communication and describe it as a ‘party-dominated communication system’ in which political messages were substantive and enjoyed ready access to the mass media. Citizens voted in accordance with their group-based loyalties; hence political campaigns were set up to mobilize rather than to persuade voters. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0267323113486417">Farrell and Webb (2000)</xref> call this period the <italic>first stage</italic> of political campaigning, whereas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0267323113486417">Norris (2000)</xref> talks of <italic>premodern campaigns</italic>. In most European countries, there was only a limited amount of television per day, concentrated in the evening. As a medium of political communication, it offered little absolute time for political information and if it did it was clearly targeting its own constituency. Brants and Van Praag describe the situation in this period as a <italic>partisan logic</italic>, and characterize Dutch society as a system of pillarization with a ‘servile nature of the political communication system’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0267323113486417">2006</xref>: 29).</p>
<p>Most authors agree that during the 1960s a new phase of political communication began (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0267323113486417">Blumler and Kavanagh, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0267323113486417">Brants and Van Praag, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0267323113486417">Farrell and Webb, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0267323113486417">Norris, 2000</xref>). In this <italic>second age</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0267323113486417">Blumler and Kavanagh, 1999</xref>) the media system opened up and expanded, and the amount of television time increased drastically. Secularization, diminishing social cleavages and an increasingly volatile electorate meant that parties were no longer secure of votes and election campaigns became more important. It also meant that journalism became more independent and critical of political parties. In this <italic>second stage of campaigning</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0267323113486417">Farrell and Webb, 2000</xref>) marketing specialists and campaign consultants were increasingly used and parties placed ‘an emphasis on the party leader, and a focus on nationwide standardization and the broadcasting of a single campaign message’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0267323113486417">Farrell and Webb, 2000</xref>: 105). The rise of this <italic>modern campaign</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0267323113486417">Norris, 2000</xref>) was, in sum, related to the dealignment of parties from their constituencies, a more independent role perception of journalists, and a more professional approach to election campaigns. Brants and Van Praag call this the phase of <italic>public logic</italic> and describe it as ‘the heyday of political communication’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0267323113486417">2006</xref>: 29) because – as they claim – the media identified themselves with the public good and journalists provided the news they deemed relevant for citizens. Politicians predominantly set the agenda, and journalists acted as watchdogs of democracy.</p>
<p>Not only did the amount of television time available to audiences increase drastically, there is also abundant evidence that the kind of television on offer changed as well. Television both expressed and contributed to cultural developments that have been identified, for instance, as ‘informalization’ and ‘democratization’. A new ‘youth’ generation developed a culture with music as an important form of expression, and protested against the older generation and the (political) establishment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0267323113486417">Damen, 1992</xref>). The democratization movement propagated the participation of all citizens in all aspects of social and political life, including the process of opinion formation and public communication, and a growing desire by social and cultural movements towards more participation in the broadcasting system. In line with this, various TV broadcasters experimented with new ways of giving audiences a voice: the BBC for instance attempted with the show <italic>Open Door</italic> to realize spectator participation, which the WDR also tried with <italic>Anruf Erwünscht</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0267323113486417">Hollander, 1982</xref>).</p>
<p>Many of the features of this second phase are present also in the current situation. However, authors additionally agree that we have ‘landed’ in a third phase of political communication, a <italic>third age of political communication</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0267323113486417">Blumler and Kavanagh, 1999</xref>), a <italic>digital age</italic> or <italic>third stage</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0267323113486417">Farrell and Webb, 2000</xref>), a period of <italic>postmodern campaigns</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0267323113486417">Norris, 2000</xref>) or of <italic>media logic</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0267323113486417">Brants and Van Praag, 2006</xref>). Typical of this third phase is the abundance of off- and online media, a diversity of communication styles and bespoke instruments of campaign communication for specific target groups.</p>
<p>This third phase arguably started in the 1990s with the arrival of cable and satellite technology, 24-hour news media, the multiplication of radio and television channels, the proliferation of communication equipment in people’s homes and a growth of commercial media in Western European countries, all resulting in increasing media competition. Consumer desires instead of public needs are said to influence what the media offer, resulting in a commercialized demand market (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0267323113486417">Blumler and Kavanagh, 1999</xref>). Ever increasing electoral volatility and the fragmenting media landscape also force political parties to be much more strategic in their communications, availing themselves of media management techniques, public opinion polls and focus groups, and with politicians performing in a more personal and popular manner. This intensifying competition among politicians and journalists to reach a fragmented, individualized and easily distracted audience demands saleable and attractive communication, giving power to the media, who set the agenda in this media logic phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0267323113486417">Brants and Van Praag, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>In this consumer-oriented political communication phase, television networks are thought to spend less broadcasting time on ‘pure’ political coverage, and increasingly more on ‘infotainment’, since the increased competition stems from entertainment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0267323113486417">Blumler and Kavanagh, 1999</xref>). Also, because political parties have intensified their professionalization, journalists try to increase their own prominence and ‘power’ over the political coverage that remains. This in turn leads politicians and their advisers to seek other outlets to get their message across, such as soft media formats and non-political shows (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0267323113486417">Blumler and Kavanagh, 1999</xref>), again stimulating the rise of infotainment programmes. The latter development also makes clear why it is imperative to include – as we do in this research – infotainment and entertainment categories in an analysis of the political information environment.</p>
<p>In <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0267323113486417">Table 1</xref> we summarize the different terminologies for these three phases, and show how they capture similar processes. Describing developments in western, mainly European but to some extent also Anglo-Saxon countries, there seems to be a clear consensus among authors about the overall typifications of the political information environment. It also shows that the three consecutive phases are better thought of as extensions of the previously existing environment, rather than as a replacement. In the current period, for instance, ‘docile’ partisan journalism is still available in the professional, almost glossy magazines that, for instance, political parties distribute among their members. Professional journalism evidently also still exists, within more consumer-oriented journalism.</p>

<p>What is unclear, however, is whether the political information environment as a whole has grown, declined or remained stable. It is not self-evident that non-stop, multi-platform television contains as much time, as part of the total output, for political information, as the limited TV period did. In fact, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0267323113486417">Hallin and Mancini’s (2004)</xref> work suggests, implicitly, that this may not be the case, since the increase in television time has gone hand in hand with a change in television cultures. They argue, specifically, that the polarized pluralist and the democratic corporatist models, typical for continental Europe, are evolving towards the liberal model (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0267323113486417">Table1</xref>) resembling more and more the Anglo-Saxon situation. European media systems, they argue, have become increasingly separated from political institutions due mainly to processes of secularization and commercialization. This evolution resembles the development of the three phases described above, as the first phase to some degree resembles the ideal-type democratic corporatist model, and the third phase of ‘media logic’ bears close similarity to the liberal model. Hallin and Mancini’s argument would imply that television time for political information has declined in relation to the overall television output. We test this assumption by collecting and analysing data from the Netherlands, a country exemplifying the democratic corporatist model, but also a country moving towards a liberal model and entering the third phase of political communication, increasingly showing signs of a media logic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0267323113486417">Brants and Van Praag, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Our purpose to combine trends in the availability of programme categories with the phases of political communication, leads to trend-related and phase-related research questions. Trend-related questions focus on changes over time in the presence of the various programme categories. On the one hand, increasing broadcasting time has offered, especially for public broadcasters, the opportunity to provide more serious information, which is one of their main (government enforced) tasks, without having to cut into their airtime for entertainment to attract audiences. This might have resulted in an increase in the relative presence of information on television – both in terms of broadcasting time and number of programmes. On the other hand, secularization, commercialization and competition might have acted as counter-forces. Therefore we ask:</p>
<p><italic>RQ1a</italic>: How does the relative number of programmes for the various categories change over time?</p>
<p><italic>RQ1b</italic>: How does the relative broadcast time for the various categories change over time?</p>
<p>Next to providing a broad overview, a specific analysis of prime time seems warranted. During prime time, when most people actually watch TV, the stakes are high. For both public and commercial broadcasters, competition is strongest, and audience ratings most important from 6 till 10 p.m. We thus ask:</p>
<p><italic>RQ2a</italic>: How does the relative number of programmes during prime time for the various categories change over time?</p>
<p><italic>RQ2b</italic>: How does the relative broadcast time during prime time for the various categories change over time?</p>
<p>The Netherlands started with a strong state-regulated public broadcasting system in the first two phases and developed into a dual broadcasting system in the third phase. This resulted from more flexible regulations, causing competition not only between separate channels, but also between public television, on the hand, and commercial TV, on the other. We wonder how this influenced their programming strategies and ask:</p>
<p><italic>RQ3</italic>: Over time are the developments in the number of programmes and relative broadcast time for the various categories similar for public and commercial channels?</p>
<p>The phase-related questions concern developments in the three phases of political communication. The first phase is characterized by a dominance of political parties, with media as their direct mouth-pieces, and in the second phase the media system opened up and journalists became more independent, critical and aware of the public good. Both might explain a strong dominance of broadcast time for ‘heavy information’, but at the same time the limited amount of television in the first phase, and cultural developments in the second phase make citizens more demanding, leading us to ask:</p>
<p><italic>RQ4</italic>: Are informative programmes most prevalent in the first and second phase?</p>
<p>Finally, we expect there to be some clear indications of the third, media logic phase in the structural supply on television. But because the Netherlands has also shown some resistance against described trends, we refrain from hypothesizing and ask:</p>
<p><italic>RQ5</italic>: Are infotainment programmes gaining ground on informative programmes in the third, media logic phase, compared to previous phases?</p>

<title>Data and method</title>
<p>We answer these questions by presenting data from the Netherlands, a country – we claim – that is typical of a more general movement from a democratic corporatist model to a liberal model.</p>
<sec id="section3-0267323113486417">
<title>Data collection</title>
<p>To cover the complete postwar period of political communication in the Netherlands, we collected data from 1957, when the first television programmes were broadcast, to 2006.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0267323113486417">2</xref></sup> For 1957 till 1988 we used archived print TV programme guides.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0267323113486417">3</xref></sup> From 1989 onwards information about Dutch broadcasting is digitally available from Intomart (until 2002) and the Dutch Audience Research Foundation (SKO). All public and commercial TV channels were included. To ensure that our results are not biased we limited the data by selecting both the three months preceding national elections and the two mid-term months between two elections. We initially expected there to be more informative programmes and more broadcast time for informative programmes during election periods. We checked for differences between these periods, but regression analyses, that included as the independent variable a trend score that has the value of 0 for the first period and increases with 1 for each subsequent period, showed that the difference between election and non-election time is not significant for any of the discussed results. We thus disregard this distinction in the remainder of the article. Combining all data from the three sources into one dataset, we achieved a dataset of over 750,000 cases, meaning individual programmes that were broadcast in a total of 30 selected periods (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0267323113486417">Table A1</xref> in the Appendix). We divided these periods into the three phases, following the study of Brants and Van Praag on the history of political communication in the Netherlands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0267323113486417">2006</xref>). The first seven periods form the phase of partisan logic (1957–1969), the eighth to the 20th time periods form the phase of public logic (1970–1989) and the last 10 periods contain both public and commercial channels, forming the media logic phase (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0267323113486417">Table A1</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0267323113486417">4</xref></sup></p>

<title>Operationalization</title>
<p>In the data collection, we used individual programmes as the unit of analysis, and collected information about title, date of broadcast, duration in minutes (start and end time), channel and broadcast organization of all television broadcasts (24-hour). In the analysis at hand, we report only on the number and the duration of programmes.</p>
<p>Every unique programme was allocated to a specific programme category by one coder (for example <italic>The Journaal</italic> was allocated to the category ‘news’), and every unique programme was only allocated to a specific category once. This allocation code was then automatically applied each time the specific programme appeared in the database. No scientific literature is available about this country-specific allocation, so our allocation is based on the programme information in the archives and online database, and on secondary information about the content and/or format of the programmes available at the Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision, programme or broadcaster websites, or in some cases Wikipedia (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0267323113486417">Table A2</xref> in the Appendix for a list of these categories and some programme examples).</p>
<p>We then categorized the programme categories as belonging to ‘heavy information’, ‘infotainment’ or ‘entertainment’, on the basis of the classification schemes of Intomart and the Dutch Audience Research Foundation. This is a tripartition that has a long history, although it has also been subject to fundamental debate and practical issues concerning its application to concrete programmes that defy easy categorization (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0267323113486417">Adriaans and Van Hoof, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0267323113486417">Leurdijk, 1999</xref>). The categorization we present adds a clearly described and detailed classification scheme to the existing literature and is in line with commonly used – but often conceptually vague – distinctions between quality, serious, hard news (i.e. heavy information) and popular, entertainment, tabloid, soft news (i.e. infotainment) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0267323113486417">Barnett, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0267323113486417">Baum, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0267323113486417">Brants and Neijens, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0267323113486417">Harrington, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0267323113486417">Patterson, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>The category ‘heavy information’ includes news, current affairs and other programmes that solely aim to provide information, although that can apply to a wide range of issues. In the first and second phase of political communication, this is the category where one would traditionally expect to find most political information. Infotainment, or ‘light information’ as it is called in the Dutch classification scheme, is the category within which we grouped all genres and programmes that combine information and entertainment, for instance in talk shows and show business programmes. The entertainment category includes self-evident types of soap opera, comedy, melodrama and detective series. We placed lifestyle, nature and sports here as well, thus constructing a category that is unlikely to provide broadcast time for political information.</p>
<p>We use two different operationalizations for the prominence of the various categories: per period, we calculated the <italic>total number of programmes</italic> and the <italic>amount of broadcast time</italic> (in minutes) spent in each category. We used these two variables to assess the relative presence of programme categories through time, meaning the percentage of the total number of programmes and broadcasting time respectively that is being taken up by the specific category. We calculated the means of numbers and duration of the total of programmes in each category to draw comparisons between the three phases. For instance, in the third period 1655 minutes were spent on heavy information, 391 minutes on infotainment and 5959 on entertainment. In total, 8005 minutes were broadcast during this period, with 21% spent on information, 5% on infotainment and 74% on entertainment. Subsequently, the percentages per meta-category of all periods within a phase were summed up and divided by the total amount of periods, resulting in a mean score of the relative presence per meta-category per phase. For the media logic phase we also compared the means for public and commercial broadcasting.</p>

<title>Trends</title>
<p>Our first research questions concerned the change in the relative number of programmes (RQ1a and RQ2a) and in relative broadcast time (RQ1b and RQ2b) for the various categories from 1957 to 2006. Starting with the first research question, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0267323113486417">Figure 1</xref> shows the overall trends in the relative number of programmes for each meta-category. Whereas these percentages stay relatively stable on public channels, we see a steep increase of informative programmes on the commercial channels. While these trends may counter common wisdom about developments in the relative presence of information, infotainment and entertainment programmes, a more detailed focus on developments in prime time offers an additional understanding. To answer our research question about the trends in the number of programmes during prime time (RQ2a) we present <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0267323113486417">Figure 2</xref>, which shows the opposite trend: an increase in entertainment programmes and a decrease in informative programmes, which is similar for both types of channels.</p>

</fig>
<p>Since general broadcast time has increased immensely over the years, we are also interested in the relative broadcast time for the categories (RQ1b and RQ2b). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0267323113486417">Figure 3</xref> shows the overall trends in the amount of broadcast time spent on the three programme categories, which shows that for both types of channels the amount of broadcast time for information increased, and for entertainment decreased. However, during prime time (RQ2b) we see in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0267323113486417">Figure 4</xref> that there is a decreasing amount of broadcast time spent on information on all channels.</p>

</fig>
<p>The third research question asked whether the developments over time in the number of programmes and relative broadcast time for the various categories are similar for public and commercial channels. Looking again at <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0267323113486417">Figures 1</xref><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0267323113486417"/><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0267323113486417"/> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0267323113486417">4</xref> we see that the developments for public and commercial channels are comparable in that they both broadcast increasing amounts of information during the entire day. At prime time both public and commercial channels have continuously fewer numbers of informative programmes and both broadcast decreasing amounts of information between 6 and 10 p.m., although this trend is much stronger for commercial channels. Public channels increasingly broadcast infotainment instead of entertainment and information, and commercial channels increasingly broadcast vast amounts of entertainment at the cost of information.</p>
<p>Our conclusion thus is that overall there is increasingly more ‘heavy information’ available on TV, in a wide variety of programmes, on both public and commercial channels. However, at prime time, entertainment and, to a lesser extent, infotainment gain ground, especially on the commercial channels. We conducted additional tests to see whether linear trends (independent variable) in the amount of broadcast time (dependent variable) for the various categories at prime time were statistically significant. Therefore, we conducted a regression analysis on aggregated data, with average scores per period as the main interest. We included as the independent variable a trend score that has the value of 0 for the first period. For each subsequent period the value increases to 1. The dependent variable is the percentage of the total amount of broadcasting time that is being taken up by the various categories. This analysis showed that the decrease of information at prime time on commercial channels is significant (B = −1.370, SE .331, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). This indicates that in each subsequent period, the percentage of information on prime time decreases by 1.37% compared to the previous period. The decrease of information at prime time on public channels is not significant (B = –.087, SE .100, <italic>p</italic> = .39). Across all channels the decrease of information during prime time is also not significant (B = –.133, SE .099, <italic>p</italic> = .187) but the increase of infotainment at prime time is (B = .361, SE .060, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). Overall, the amount of broadcast time for infotainment increases in each subsequent period by 0.36%, compared to the previous period.</p>
<p>Over time, increasingly more ‘heavy information’ has become available on television on both public and commercial channels. Yet at prime time, entertainment gains ground at the expense of information, although the increase is relatively small and statistically not significant. To enhance our understanding of these somewhat complex and contradictory trends we now turn to our phase-related research questions to see whether these developments can be elucidated by focusing on time-specific circumstances.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0267323113486417">
<title>Phases</title>
<p>Our first phase-related research question (RQ4) asked whether informative programmes are most prevalent in the first and second phase. As we have seen in the figures so far, the entertainment category has always had the greatest presence on TV. Both in general, and at prime time, television is mainly an entertaining medium, on both public and commercial channels. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0267323113486417">Table 2</xref> shows that especially in the first, partisan logic phase the relative presence of entertainment (79%) is strongest, compared with information and infotainment. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0267323113486417">Table 3</xref> shows that the means of the absolute amount of broadcasting time increase strongly over time, indicating more broadcast hours. It also shows that the broadcast time spent on informative programmes increased more than the broadcast time for the other categories. This is more clearly visible when we look again at the relative means in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0267323113486417">Table 2</xref>, and see an increase of information from 17% in the partisan logic phase, to 19% in the public logic phase, to 20% in the media logic phase. On the public channels only, the percentage of information increased to 25% in the third phase. Thus, although informative programmes are not the most prevalent in the first two phases (nor in the third), they are becoming more important over time.</p>

<p>Finally, we asked if infotainment programmes gain ground on informative programmes in the third, media logic phase compared to the previous phases (RQ5). Looking at <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0267323113486417">Table 4</xref>, we see that the number of infotainment programmes increased from around 3% in the first two phases to almost 8% in the media logic phase. We also see an increasing amount of broadcasting time spent on infotainment, especially on public channels, where it doubled its relative presence from 4% to 8% (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0267323113486417">Table 2</xref>). This is however not at the cost of airtime for information, since we have seen that the amount of airtime for these programmes also increased. In general, the entertainment programmes lose broadcast time, on both public and commercial channels.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study of the political information environment gives no conclusive evidence for a decreasing quantity of potential broadcast time for political information on television. We see increasing amounts of time spend on information at the cost of entertainment (public TV) and infotainment (commercial TV) programmes. These results concur with the study of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0267323113486417">Aalberg et al. (2010)</xref>. However, we also see that there is increasingly less information broadcast at prime time, especially on commercial channels. In concordance with existing beliefs, we find that more diverse infotainment programmes are aired in the media logic phase, which get more broadcast time especially at prime time. Whereas Aalberg et al. argue that countries with strong public television offer more prime time ‘heavy information’, we actually find that although at the start of the third phase commercial channels aired as much information as public channels at prime time, both type of channels over time have fewer numbers of informative programmes and also spend less and less broadcasting time on them at prime time. This trend is stronger for commercial than for public channels.</p>
<p>More specifically we have seen that in general most broadcast time is spent on entertainment. Especially in the first phase of partisan logic the share of entertainment programmes is the largest. This phase can be regarded as the starting phase for television, a period in which both broadcasting organizations and governments were still figuring out how to deal with this ‘new’ medium. The very limited airtime and political parallelism of this phase are apparent in the strict rules that concerned mainly the distribution of airtime for the various, social-political broadcasting organizations, and the mandate ‘to broadcast programmes acceptable for everyone’. In the Netherlands, stipulations as to the types of content that broadcasting organizations had to air were very vague and mainly focused on the cultural and religious needs that existed in Dutch society. The (partisan) press was indeed the most important mass medium, and television was mainly regarded as amusement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0267323113486417">Wijfjes, 2005</xref>). Children’s programmes and art broadcasts such as films, plays and operas, etc. were aired most frequently. These programmes were classified as entertainment in this study.</p>
<p>In the second, public logic phase of expanding media and professionalizing journalism, much more broadcasting time became available. Also, due to the presence of a second public television channel, broadcasting organizations and journalists became more adapted to the medium. In the Netherlands the cooperation between broadcasting organizations in one news programme (<italic>Het Journaal</italic>) continued, and the current affairs programmes of the separate broadcasting organizations became really established as a critical, analytical journalistic genre. This is visible in the increasing amount of time spent on informative programmes in this phase. Although increasing competition between broadcasting organizations led to concerns about the growing amount of mass entertainment, we actually see that the category of ‘heavy information’ programmes increased the most in relative terms in this ‘heyday of political communication’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0267323113486417">Brants and Van Praag, 2006</xref>: 29).</p>
<p>As expected in the media logic phase (based on the existing literature), the airtime for infotainment increased most noticeably. The intensifying competition among politicians and journalists, it seems, has stimulated the rise of infotainment programmes, which are also increasingly aired at prime time. We see in this phase a general decrease of broadcast time for pure entertainment. In fact, we see again an increase of information, which is probably because (commercial) broadcasters, in a dual broadcasting system, such as in the Netherlands, need at least their own news programme in order to be taken seriously. These informative programmes are, however, scheduled more and more outside prime time, as shown. On the one hand, this finding seems to support claims about increasing consumer-orientation and convergence towards a liberal model of political communication. On the other hand, the third phase is characterized by an abundance of off- and online media and a proliferation of communication equipment. Digital recording machines such as TiVo, and the increasing availability of TV shows on the internet lead to more personal viewing. At any time of the day people can watch both ‘heavy information’ or info- and entertainment programmes, both at home on television or at the computer, but nowadays also increasingly away from the house, on laptops, notebooks, tablets and mobile phones. One could argue that television programming becomes less important and therefore the idea of prime time less meaningful.</p>
<p>Discussion on the quality of journalism, the viability of public debate and the role of political information on television in times of changing political communication has led to many studies on a popularization of political communication and a personalization of politics. The question, however, of whether the space for these forms of politics and political communication was and is available, and has expanded over time, has hardly been studied until now and only in a somewhat limited way. For popularization and personalization to occur, media need to offer a suitable ‘stage’. With regard to television this means that genres that are open or vulnerable to these styles need to be increasingly available for both popularization and personalization to increase. Our study shows that this is only partly the case. The overall relative presence and proportion of information on television has remained relatively steady over the years. Infotainment has increased, but its presence is still relatively small. Yet our study gives no information about the content of specific programmes. Traditionally the category of ‘heavy information’ is where one would expect to find most political information, but more research is needed into whether and how the content of ‘heavy information’ programmes might have become more entertaining. We are also in need of additional understanding of the infotainment genre, to see what kind and how much political information might reach a wide(r) audience through these programmes.</p>
<p>With regard to processes in politics and the media, we conclude that, although there might have been a shift in the Netherlands from a democratic corporatist model towards a more market and consumer demand-oriented model, secularization and commercialization have not led to an overall decreasing availability of broadcast time for politically relevant information. The rise of infotainment at prime time on both public and commercial channels, and the rise of entertainment during prime time on commercial channels do call for wariness regarding future developments and more in-depth content analysis of these various programmes. But we also argue that the relevance of prime time is diminishing with the increase of personal viewing and the growth of digitally available television content. We conclude that the process of change from a partisan to a media logic, in a country that shifted from a public service to a dual broadcasting model, does not yet support the idea of eroding opportunities for public debate. Our results do reinforce the notion that countries with a strong public broadcasting tradition offer a hearty diet of political information programmes to their audiences, especially on the public broadcasting channels themselves.</p>

<p>In 1956 Dutch television started with the first broadcast of a daily news programme, but since there were too few data for this year to include in our analysis, our research period starts in 1957. Looking at a postwar period of (thus almost) 50 years, our research period ends with the parliamentary elections in 2006.</p>

<p>We used the same guide for the entire period, the <italic>Televizier</italic>, an independent radio and television programme guide, except for a few years for which the guide was unavailable. We then used the <italic>AVRO-bode</italic>.</p>

<p>Part of our data actually suggests slightly different beginning and end years for the three phases – the biggest changes in the number of programmes are found in 1963 (increase in share of information category of 13.9%) and 1989 (decrease in share of information category of 14.2%; see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0267323113486417">Figure 1</xref>). Since these changes are not reflected in the actual broadcast time or in prime time programming, we decided to stick to the classification that is based on the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0267323113486417">Brants and Van Praag (2006)</xref>, who consider a wider variety of characteristics of political communication when choosing the end dates of the various periods.</p>
