<abstract>
<p>Recently, alternative dispute resolution (ADR) practices have gained increased exposure as a superior way of addressing workplace conflict. Several studies suggest that organizations in the USA have widely diffused some form of ADR. But uncertainty remains about whether this development is peculiar to the USA or whether it marks a more systemic shift in the way workplace conflict is addressed in organizations. The purpose of this article is to contribute to the debate about the importance of workplace ADR by examining the extent to which organizations based in Ireland have adopted ADR practices to address individual and group-based work problems. It also assesses the factors that influence the diffusion of ADR. The article finds that the diffusion of ADR practices has not been widespread in Ireland, with more innovation occurring in relation to ADR practices aimed at addressing group-based rather than individual-based workplace problems. US-ownership and high commitment HRM practices are found to be significant influences on the diffusion of ADR.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Workplace conflict, how it manifests itself and how it is managed is a core part of the management of the employment relationship. Organizations can pay a high cost if workplace problems are not settled fairly and efficiently. Days can be lost due to some form of industrial action: sickness and absenteeism rates can be high; and management–employee relations can become strained if not embittered. Disharmony at the workplace can impede organizations from creating adaptable structures to succeed in today’s challenging business environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0143831X11424767">Bendersky, 2003</xref>). On the positive side, organizations that possess effective conflict management arrangements are more likely to have employees who feel they have dignity and justice at work and are more committed to the mission of the organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0143831X11424767">Costantino and Sickles Merchant, 1996</xref>). On paper, the case seems to be compelling enough for organizations to develop effective conflict management strategies.</p>
<p>But it is not at all certain what constitutes an effective conflict management system, although it is likely to depend on a variety of factors such as the nature of the problems facing an organization, the rights and interests of the parties involved and probably most important of all the calibre of the conflict management procedures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0143831X11424767">Bingham and Nabatchi, 2003</xref>). In recent years, the concept of alternative dispute resolution (ADR) has received considerable exposure in the workplace conflict management literature and for some it represents the basis of a high quality conflict management system as it seeks to involve the parties to a dispute in a consensual process that empowers them to solve their differences to their mutual satisfaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0143831X11424767">Cropanzano et al., 2008</xref>). Most of the work done on the extent to which organizations are diffusing ADR practices to manage workplaces has been in the United States. The evidence appears to suggest that there has been a fairly widespread move by organizations to adopt at least some form of ADR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0143831X11424767">Lipsky and Avgar, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Relatively little work has been done on the organizational uptake of ADR in other countries. This leaves a question mark about whether the use of ADR to solve workplace problems is peculiar to the USA or whether it constitutes a genuinely innovative approach to conflict management that HR managers are engaging with in different countries. The purpose of this article is to make a contribution to the discussion that needs to take place on this issue by examining the extent to which organizations in Ireland have adopted ADR-style practices to address workplace conflict. The article is organized as follows. The first section examines how and in what ways ADR marks a departure from conventional practices used to resolve workplace conflict. The following section identifies the factors that might influence the organizational diffusion of ADR practices by organizations. The methodology used to carry out the research is then described. The following section sets out the main findings of the survey. The penultimate section assesses the import of the main findings. Finally, the conclusions draw out the key arguments of study.</p>

<title>Conventional and ADR practices for managing conflict</title>
<p>Old-style personnel management adopted a broadly phlegmatic attitude to workplace conflict. For the most part, the workplace was considered no different from any other social context in which there are close and repeated human interactions: mostly there will be a high level of cooperation between people, but on occasions relationships may sour, causing problems and conflict to occur. Some even considered that conflict at work may actually perform the positive role of clearing the air between management and employees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0143831X11424767">Eaton and Keefe, 1999</xref>). Workplace conflict can take a variety of forms. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0143831X11424767">Edwards (2003)</xref> has distinguished between conflict pertaining to managerial relations (focused around the exercise of managerial authority and decisions made by managers) and pertaining to market relations (focused on pay and conditions of employment).</p>
<p>Sometimes conflict at work arises from intra-managerial rivalry. On other occasions disputes between employees within work groups or involving work groups can be the source of the problem. But conflict is seen in the literature to arise mainly from interactions between employees and managers or their employers. Employees sometimes allege inappropriate (if not illegal) behaviour by managers such as decisions on pay or promotion or discrimination, bullying, or violation of health and safety rules. Managers occasionally feel it is necessary to take disciplinary action to address bad behaviour by employees, for example poor time keeping, drinking at work, or aggressive behaviour and so on. Conflict between managers and employees can either be focused around individuals or be group-based, with the latter sometimes leading to industrial action including strikes. Strikes and other sanctions, such as work-to-rules, overtime bans and the like are expressions of group conflict. Conflict involving individual employees may find expression in formal employment grievances, in cases taken to industrial tribunals and similar bodies and in litigation. It may also find expression in employment turnover, absenteeism and other expressions of individual dissent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0143831X11424767">Dix et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0143831X11424767">Godard, 2011</xref>). In this study we build on this long-established distinction in the field between group or collective and individual conflict and between conventional and ADR practices for managing and resolving conflict.</p>
<p>Solving workplace conflict, whether it is either individual or group-based, is usually seen as involving a number of formalized procedures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0143831X11424767">Lewin, 2001</xref>). In relation to grievances affecting individuals, long-established or conventional procedures normally involve several steps, the first of which requires employees to seek to resolve issues where possible informally by engaging with the party immediately involved, and then, if unable to resolve an issue, to register a dispute in a formal manner. In unionized firms, after submitting a formal grievance, the individual employee is normally represented by a trade union shop steward or some other designated representative. If grievances cannot be resolved in the firm, they may be referred by either or both of the parties to external publicly funded agencies that seek to conciliate the parties or to industrial tribunals, or they may result in litigation in the civil court system. A similar procedure is normally used in a dispute affecting a group of employees, which is commonly addressed initially, at a first stage of procedure, by engagement. On the management side, progressively higher levels of managers become involved if the grievance or dispute is not resolved at the first or intermediary stage of the procedure. The last stage of the procedure invariably involves some kind of formal adjudication of the grievance or dispute, often involving external publicly funded agencies such as the Advisory Conciliation and Arbitration Service (Acas) in the UK, the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service (FMCS) in the USA and the Labour Relations Commission (LRC) and Labour Court in Ireland. In unionized firms, these procedures are usually provided for in collective bargaining processes and collective agreements which seek to reconcile the often competing claims of management and unions and to maintain employment relations stability within the organization. Non-unionized firms follow a variety of methods but usually enshrine such procedures in staff manuals or even in employment contracts.</p>
<p>An alternative set of conflict management practices has emerged in recent decades which seek to put into practice a new and distinct approach to resolving and even preventing conflict and these are usually termed alternative dispute resolution or ADR practices. While conventional approaches to conflict resolution often involved the exercise of power play between disputants, where one party sought to impose their will on the other, or involved using procedures to establish ‘rights’ under collective agreements, company policy, or the law, ADR practices seek to resolve conflict wherever possible on the basis of the parties seeking to find mutually acceptable means of advancing their ‘interests’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0143831X11424767">Costantino and Sickles Merchant, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0143831X11424767">Ury et al., 1993 [1988]</xref>). As with conventional conflict management practices, two forms of ADR are evident. One addresses mostly individual-based conflict. ADR practices to solve individual conflict in the workplace have their origins in the USA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0143831X11424767">Dunlop and Zack, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>Interest in such ADR practices dates as far back as the 1960s, but the topic is seen as really taking off in the 1980s when HR managers in large companies started to search for ways to stem the massive increase in litigation on workplace issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0143831X11424767">Goldberg et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0143831X11424767">Teague, 2006</xref>). ADR practices were seen as a way of keeping workplace disputes out of the courts and facilitating their resolution inside the organization. Among the practices commonly associated with ADR are the operation of formal ‘open-door policies’, where employees with a grievance can seek access to any manager in search for a solution, skipping over their immediate manager or supervisor if they believe this is warranted by the nature of the grievance which concerns them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0143831X11424767">Ewing, 1989</xref>). Also included in this category are ‘hotline’ or email-based ‘speak-up’ systems which can impart information to employees, respond to problems or refer employees to other processes for resolving grievances in firms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0143831X11424767">Lewin, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0143831X11424767">Rowe and Baker, 1984</xref>).</p>
<p>External or internal ‘fact-finders’, mediators, or experts of various kinds may also be used to resolve grievances. So too may ‘employee advocates’, whose job it is to represent employees in pursuance of a solution to a grievance, and ‘ombudsmen’, who act as honest brokers to resolve disputes through internal fact-finding and mediation. Also commonly associated with ADR is the use of review panels comprised of managers or of employees’ peers and the use of arbitrators as a final stage in dispute resolution. Sometimes ADR at the workplace is presented as a completely new departure, but this assessment needs qualification as established methods of reaching settlements to workplace grievances – mediation, conciliation, arbitration and so on – are, in one way or another, to the fore in many ADR procedures.</p>
<p>A second strand of the literature on ADR highlights the need for proactive approaches to manage conflict affecting groups of employees, particularly the use of ‘interest-based’ or ‘mutual gains bargaining’ and related techniques and processes. The literature on non-union firms focuses on conflict affecting work groups, while that pertaining to unionized firms focuses also on innovations in the manner in which collective agreements are concluded with trade unions. The limited literature on work group conflict in non-union firms, especially in the context of high performance work systems, stresses such things as the need for managers and team members to gain training in mediation and conflict resolution, the importance of resolving disputes quickly at the lowest possible levels, the possible involvement of mediation specialists in inter-group and intra-group conflict and the importance of communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0143831X11424767">Lipsky et al., 2003</xref>: 65–9; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0143831X11424767">Lynch, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0143831X11424767">Rowe, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>While a number of the techniques and processes associated with interest-based bargaining (for example, fact-finding, the exchange of information and the search for solutions to problems) are also at the core of ADR practices for resolving grievances and disputes involving individuals, the literature on interest-based bargaining has mainly been concerned with finding new ways to resolve group and collective disputes. Indeed, for the most part the literature on interest-based bargaining and associated techniques focuses on the manner in which collective agreements are concluded in unionized firms. The starting point for much of this discussion is that collective bargaining negotiations are the pre-eminent mode of conflict management as they allow management and trade unions to agree to an outcome which is mutually satisfactory.</p>
<p>Two distinct categories of collective bargaining are widely seen to exist: distributive or adversarial approaches and integrative, interest-based or problem-solving approaches. In the distributive approach to negotiations, management and trade unions use a variety of methods to maximize their returns. The assumption is that the interests of employers and employees are in competition, which encourages managers and employees to go head-to-head in an instrumental bargaining contest. In contrast, an interest-based approach to negotiations emphasizes the pursuit of a set of techniques and processes that lead to settlements that incorporate the interests of all parties. The assumption is that while management and trade unions may not always agree, they have more in common than is often assumed and can resolve their differences through dialogue and mutual adjustment. In other words, negotiations need not be ‘zero-sum’ where the gains of one party in the negotiation occur at the expense of the other party. Instead, negotiations can lead to mutual gains, deals that incorporate the interests of both parties. Collaboration and joint action are the by-words of interest-based negotiations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0143831X11424767">Barrett and O’Dowd, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition to revamping collective bargaining negotiations to make these less adversarial, a series of other ADR practices are seen as encouraging positive interactions between employers and unions or between managers and groups of employees. These include the use of third-party facilitators or mediators early in a sequence of negotiations to assist the parties to avoid deadlock and reach a settlement – a practice sometimes referred to as ‘assisted negotiations’. Such a practice contrasts with traditional procedures wherein facilitators or mediators typically become involved only when the parties become deadlocked and register a failure to reach agreement. ‘Brainstorming’ and intensive communication and consultation between managers and groups of employees are also prime examples of ADR practices. The purpose of these arrangements is not so much to resolve problems but to facilitate an ongoing process of discussion and exchange between managers and employees so that they identify ways to solve problems. Through engaging in such problem-solving activity, the assumption is that cooperative relationships will deepen inside the organization: creativity and learning is fostered in a manner that builds up employee loyalty and voice. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0143831X11424767">Table 1</xref> sets out these various conventional and ADR-based approaches to managing workplace conflict involving individuals and groups of employees.</p>

</table-wrap>
<p>How conventional and ADR practices align with external institutions for administering employment rights and conflict resolution in Ireland also needs to be considered. In respect of grievances and disputes involving individual employees, conflicts incapable of resolution within firms may be referred by either or both parties to outside institutions with overlapping jurisdictions. The Rights Commissioner service of the Labour Relations Commission deals with disputes arising in the context of a range of statutory employment rights, as well as disputes where employment rights per se are not at issue. The service also deals with disputes involving small groups of workers and can be accessed by any employee or group, whether unionized or not. Disputes handled by the Rights Commissioners may be appealed to the Labour Court or the Employment Appeals Tribunal, depending on the issue in dispute. The Employment Appeals Tribunal deals with grievances arising around statutory employment rights in a range of areas extending from redundancy payments and unfair dismissals to statutory work leave. The Equality Tribunal administers the Employment Equality Acts, Equal Status Acts and Pensions Acts. Finally, employees may seek to pursue alleged breaches of employment rights in the civil courts, either directly or on appeal from some of the agencies that operate in the field. The normal course for resolving collective disputes that prove incapable of resolution within firms is to involve the Labour Relations Commission, which seeks to conciliate the parties, or the Labour Court, which typically issues non-binding recommendations in disputes referred onwards for adjudication by the Labour Relations Commission. Decisions of the Labour Court may sometimes be challenged on matters of jurisdiction or points of law in the higher civil courts.</p>

<title>The diffusion of ADR practices in firms</title>
<p>ADR practices to solve workplace problems are not going to diffuse evenly across an economy. A range of factors are likely to influence the shape and nature of the diffusion process. One possible factor is business sector. Different parts of the economy operate in different ways. The dynamics of market competition, the size of firms, the sophistication of technology and the skills and competences of human capital vary across sectors. These factors are commonly regarded as shaping the manner in which organizations manage people, including practices used to resolve workplace conflict (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0143831X11424767">Dyer and Reeves, 1995</xref>). Thus, to capture this possible influence we assess the extent to which ADR practices are being diffused differently by firms in the manufacturing and service sectors. Another factor that might have a bearing on the diffusion process is firm size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0143831X11424767">De Kok and Uhlaner, 2001</xref>). Large firms are typically considered to have more resources – and more need – to develop formal human resource management (HRM) systems with considerable capacity to learn about and adopt innovative HRM practices. In contrast, small firms are usually seen as functioning without a separate HRM department, even in some instances without dedicated HRM specialists, which weakens their ability to keep pace with state-of-the-art people management policies. It will be interesting to find out the extent to which large and small firms have different profiles with regard to the use of ADR practices.</p>
<p>Firm characteristics are also likely to be a factor in the uptake of ADR practices. Unionized firms, for example, are commonly viewed as operating different conflict management systems to non-union firms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0143831X11424767">Lewin, 2001</xref>). For the most part, unionized firms are viewed as possessing formalized stepwise disciplinary and grievance procedures to address workplace problems. Procedures for handling grievances and disputes in non-union organizations are usually seen as less formalized; non-union firms are probably more accepting of informal methods to resolve disputes such as line managers settling a problem with employees without using formal procedures. Another significant difference is that while unionized firms normally use collective procedures to address conflict, non-unionized firms prefer procedures that focus on the individual employee (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0143831X11424767">Budd and Colvin, 2005</xref>). Thus, the dynamics of conflict management are also likely to be different in unionized and non-unionized firms. For example, unionized firms are likely to be keen to ensure that collective processes do not work in an overly adversarial manner, which might explain the growth in interest in forms of mutual gains bargaining (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0143831X11424767">Barrett and O’Dowd, 2005</xref>). Non-union firms, in contrast, probably are more interested in cultivating individualized forms of conflict management, perhaps to stave off the threat of trade union organizing campaigns. ADR has also been associated in the US literature with a concern to avoid, marginalize, or otherwise contain unions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0143831X11424767">Colvin, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0143831X11424767">Lipsky et al., 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Another firm characteristic that is likely to have an influence on the diffusion of ADR practices is whether an organization is domestically or foreign-owned. Multinationals (MNCs) are considered pattern-setters when it comes to inventing the template for innovative HRM practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0143831X11424767">Taylor et al., 1996</xref>). Because they are considered to have more advanced and sophisticated internal HR resources, MNCs are seen as best positioned to design people management policy that will maximize organizational performance. This factor is especially significant in the Irish context as the level of foreign direct investment (FDI) relative to the size of the economy is one of the highest in the world. A lively and ongoing debate concerns whether multinationals investing in Ireland, and particularly multinationals of US origin, are diffusing sophisticated HRM policies across a wide range of areas that include profit-related pay, direct communication systems and the management of workplace conflict (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0143831X11424767">Gunnigle et al., 2007</xref>). As a result, there is a widely held perception that the subsidiaries of multinational companies, especially from the USA, stand apart from indigenous companies with regard to the HRM policies they pursue. It will be interesting to find out whether this holds true for ADR practices.</p>
<p>A large literature has emerged on how organizations are diffusing an array of new employment and human resource policies to support competitive strategies focused on innovation or quality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0143831X11424767">Osterman, 1994</xref>). Yet relatively little has been written directly about the extent to which ADR practices are used in high performance workplaces. However, there are some exceptions, mostly from the USA. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0143831X11424767">Colvin (2004)</xref> finds that organizations that use team-based working are more likely to adopt innovative conflict management practices, including ADR practices. In their systematic investigation, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0143831X11424767">Lipsky et al. (2003)</xref> argue that a range of ‘endogenous influences’ arising from the shift to high performance workplaces and innovation or quality-focused competitive strategies are driving innovation to conflict management systems in US organizations. In a more normative piece, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0143831X11424767">Rowe (1997)</xref> argues that organizations are upgrading their conflict management systems not only to ensure that they do not become misaligned with other human resource innovations, but also to be in a better position to accommodate more assertive modern workers. Thus, it is important to explore whether those firms that follow quality-based competitive strategies are more likely to diffuse ADR practices. Relatedly, ADR practices, whether focused on individuals or groups, have been associated with skill- and knowledge-based work and workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0143831X11424767">Cutcher-Genshenfeld et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0143831X11424767">Stone, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>In the literature there is some ambiguity about the relationship between ADR practices and high commitment HRM. On the one hand, there is a largely prescriptive literature, mainly US in origin, which suggests that ADR practices positively contribute to the creation of an organizational climate that facilitates employee engagement and loyalty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0143831X11424767">Colvin et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0143831X11424767">Ewing, 1989</xref>). On the other hand, the literature on high commitment HRM rarely discusses ADR practices. Mention is made of direct communication systems, performance-related pay, competency development and so on, but seldom is reference made to ADR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0143831X11424767">Cropanzano et al., 2008</xref>). Thus it is unclear whether firms pursuing high commitment HRM actually include ADR practices in their repertoire of people management policies. Or to put the matter slightly differently, it appears an open question whether ADR practices are more likely to be found in firms that possess a high number of high commitment HRM policies.</p>
<p>A final factor that might influence the diffusion of ADR practices is the extent to which firms emulate perceived best-practice approaches to conflict management in leading companies. The organizational sociology literature on institutional isomorphism can be used to throw light on this point (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0143831X11424767">Dobbin et al., 2007</xref>). According to this view, similar types of policies tend to diffuse across organizations once these have acquired the mantel of best practice. In other words, organizations may emulate or copy each another. But this usually does not happen spontaneously; normally it is the result of two main processes. One is a ‘follow-the-leader’ process where a group of organizations that are considered to be doing best in terms of managing people acquire the status of exemplars. Other firms try and acquire their success by mimicking what they do. The result is a convergence of HR practices. The other is a learning process which involves HR managers recognizing deficiencies in the way people are managed or acquiring new knowledge that causes them to change their view about certain people management policies. Either way the learning process triggers a change agenda, which invariably involves the HR managers searching for best practice. The result is usually copying from exemplar organizations. Thus, it is important to assess whether any organizational emulation is occurring in relation to ADR practices. In particular, it is important in the Irish context to assess whether Irish-owned firms seek to emulate the conflict management practices of leading companies, including leading international companies.</p>

<title>Research strategy and methods</title>
<p>The analysis in this article is based on a survey designed to assess the incidence, antecedents and effects of conflict resolution practices. The four-page questionnaire was the result of a long process of consultation and deliberation. An initial draft questionnaire was constructed based on international literature on workplace conflict management and our prior research work on the topic. The draft questionnaire was discussed by two focus groups: one group consisted of senior members of the Labour Relations Commission, the main public dispute resolution agency in the Republic of Ireland, the other of senior HR practitioners from a range of Irish companies. Intensive interviews were also held with other HR and conflict resolution specialists and pre-pilot versions of the draft questionnaire were completed by them with a view to establishing the clarity and relevance of the proposed survey questions. The questionnaire was revised in light of suggestions made by the two focus groups and intensive interviews. A pilot survey was then undertaken of 179 companies, with follow-up phone calls to a proportion of these, leading to further refinement of the questionnaire. The final questionnaire included a definition of workplace conflict to ensure that survey respondents shared a common understanding of the topic. This also provided a means of countering any possible non-cooperation and non-response that might arise from workplace conflict, or provisions for conflict management being viewed in a negative light, or associated only with unionized workplaces. The definition adopted was as follows:</p>
<p><italic>Workplace conflict involves differences in views and conflict between individual employees and their employer; among individuals; and between groups of employees, whether unionized or not, and their employer. It is recognized that the resolution of workplace conflict can have beneficial effects for employers, employees and other stakeholders in the business</italic>.</p>
<p>The sampling strategy was devised by the authors in conjunction with the Survey Unit of the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI), Dublin (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.esri.ie">www.esri.ie</ext-link>), and the survey fieldwork was conducted by the research firm Ipsos-MORI (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ipsos-mori.com/offices/ireland.aspx">www.ipsos-mori.com/offices/ireland.aspx</ext-link>), under the direction of the ESRI Survey Unit. The final survey consists of a sample of Irish companies employing 20 or more employees, drawn at random from a population list of firms, stratified by size, region and sector. As is common practice in surveys of firms, large firms – present in the population in smaller numbers – were oversampled to provide reliable estimates of the features of firms in this category. Between February and March 2008, a postal questionnaire was sent to 3113 Irish companies drawn from the ESRI database, with 505 useable responses being received. The response rate was 17 percent, ranging from a 10 percent response rate among small companies, to a 30 percent response rate among large companies. This is well in line with the response rates obtained in international and Irish surveys of firms. The results were weighted to adjust for the oversampling of large firms and to compensate for differences in response rates between firms of different sizes and sectors. Descriptive research results reported later are based on weighted data estimates.</p>

<sec id="section5-0143831X11424767">
<title>Conflict management practices and research variables</title>
<p>The usage by firms of conventional and ADR practices was identified through a series of questions which distinguished between practices used to resolve grievances involving individual employees and practices used to resolve what were described as ‘contentious issues and disputes involving groups of employees’. The wording used for resolving group conflict was carefully considered, drawing on focus group discussion and feedback from expert participants on the draft survey instrument. We were again careful to ensure that managers responsible for HR in non-union firms, where the term ‘dispute’ might not normally be used, understood the scope of the conflict on which we sought to focus. All survey questionnaire items were examined and sometimes reworded or revised on the basis of the focus groups, expert feedback and the pilot survey. With respect to the items presented in both the individual and group conflict management categories, few concerns arose in this process and the items in general were recognized and well understood by respondents. The item ‘formal interest-based (‘win-win’) bargaining was familiar to respondents. This reflected the prevalence of training programmes in the area, the salience of the concept in the professional literature and the prevalence of initiatives in interest-based bargaining, sometimes in large companies.</p>
<p>The independent variables used in the analysis of influences on the diffusion of ADR were operationalized as follows. A dummy variable for sector was coded 1 for manufacturing and 0 for services. Medium and large firms, employing 50 or more employees, were coded as 1 and firms from 20 to 49 employees were coded as 0. As discussed later, increasing the size threshold for the medium and large firms category had no material effect on the results. Firms recognizing unions were coded as 1 and non-union firms coded as 0. Firms were also asked to indicate the importance they attributed to ‘preventing unions from extending their influence into, or within, the company’ in influencing their approach to conflict resolution. Responses were recorded on a four-point scale ranging from ‘not important’ to ‘extremely important’.</p>
<p>To test for any effects on ADR practices related to multinationals, US multinationals were coded as 1 and all other firms as 0 and other-foreign-owned multinationals (the majority of which were of European origin) were coded as 1 and all other firms as 0. Thus the reference category for examining any effects arising from multinationals was Irish-owned firms. The competitive posture of firms was measured in the survey by following the broad method adopted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0143831X11424767">Osterman (1994)</xref>. Respondents were asked to assess the priority that their firms assign to competing on the basis of innovation and/or quality relative to price.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0143831X11424767">1</xref></sup> To allow for examination of whether ADR practices were more prevalent in firms where workers are engaged in high-skill or knowledge-intensive work tasks and activities respondents were asked to indicate the approximate proportion of their firm’s workforces engaged in skill or knowledge-intensive work tasks and activities.</p>
<p>To test for effects of high commitment HRM on the adoption of ADR practices, a scale was developed measuring the incidence of a series of 11 HR practices commonly regarded as components of a ‘high commitment’ or ‘high performance’ HRM model. The practices comprised a formal performance management system, individual performance-related pay, group performance-related pay, profit sharing/share ownership, formally designated team-working, regular employee surveys, the assessment of employees’ values, attitudes or personality at the time of hiring, a policy of no compulsory redundancies, common (single-status) terms and conditions of employment, a system of regular team briefing that provides employees with business information and internal career progression as a formal objective for all employees. The alpha coefficient for the scale is .671.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0143831X11424767">2</xref></sup> Finally, firms were asked to indicate the degree of importance they attributed to ‘emulating best practice in conflict resolution in leading companies’ in influencing their approach to conflict resolution. Responses were recorded on a four-point scale ranging from ‘not important’ to ‘extremely important’.</p>

<title>Descriptive research results</title>
<p>This section of the article overviews the descriptive research results for the main categorical variables examined. The primary focus in this section is on the incidence of conflict management practices and in particular ADR practices, but indications of variations in practices across firms with different features are also outlined. The possible discrete influence of US MNCs is considered in the next section, which reports the results of multiple regression analysis examining all potential influences discussed on the diffusion of ADR practices in firms in Ireland.</p>

<title>Practices for managing conflict involving individual employees</title>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0143831X11424767">Table 2</xref> shows that the majority of surveyed firms, 60.2 percent, have a traditional formal written grievance and disciplinary procedure involving progressively higher levels of management in addressing individual employment disputes. The table also points towards some variations between firms of different types. The incidence of formal written grievance procedures appears higher in unionized firms than non-unionized firms (66.9 percent compared to 61.3 percent respectively). About half of small firms (50.2 percent) adopt formal written practices to address individual workplace problems compared to just over three-quarters (79.5 percent) of medium/large firms. Employees in the manufacturing sector seem more likely to be covered by a formal written grievance and disciplinary procedure than those in services (defined in the survey as distribution and other service firms). Foreign-owned multinationals seem more likely than Irish-owned firms to have formal written procedures (89.3 percent compared with 56.2 percent). Overall, although there is some variation across types of organizations, the use of formal written mechanisms for addressing individual grievances is widespread throughout Ireland.</p>

<p>While traditional formal grievance procedures are thus quite widely prevalent, the evidence suggests that overall there has been little adoption of innovative ADR practices to manage conflict involving individual employees. The most common ADR practice used by almost 53 percent of firms to address individual grievances is a formal open-door policy. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0143831X11424767">Table 2</xref> shows that little difference exists between unionized and non-unionized firms with regard to the extent to which this practice is used. Some difference appears to exist between small and medium/large firms. The difference appears somewhat more marked between Irish-owned and foreign-owned firms: 50.8 percent of Irish-owned firms and 61.5 percent of foreign-owned firms operate open-door policies. There seems to be a difference also between the sectors examined: 48.9 percent of manufacturing firms compared to 55.1 percent of services operate open-door policies. Overall, the survey suggests that the use of a formal open-door policy is reasonably prevalent in Ireland. This is not the case with the other ADR practices surveyed.</p>
<p>Organizations sometimes appoint external, third-party experts to provide a range of conflict management services such as mediation, fact-finding and, on occasion, arbitration. The survey sought to find out the extent to which external experts, other than from public dispute resolution bodies (Rights Commissioners, Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court), are used by organizations in Ireland. Only a minority of establishments (16.3 percent of firms) use independent experts to resolve conflicts involving individual employees and somewhat more marginal variations are evident in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0143831X11424767">Table 2</xref> across firms with different organizational characteristics. Some firms seek to ensure that a level of procedural justice is built into grievance and disciplinary procedures by providing employees with the option of using employer-designated employee advocates as a form of representation. The survey found that around 7 percent of firms as a whole use employee advocates, although the incidence of this practice is unevenly distributed: employee advocates are used in 11.9 percent of unionized firms and 5.0 percent of non-unionized firms. Only 4.1 percent of small firms use employee advocates compared to 11.9 percent of medium/large firms. The use of employee advocates appears more prevalent in the manufacturing sector, with 11.2 percent of firms in this sector adopting this practice, compared to only 6.5 percent of firms in the services sector. Employee advocates are used in 3.8 percent of Irish-owned firms compared to 12.5 percent of foreign-owned firms. Thus, while the use of employee advocates is not particularly common in firms in Ireland, unionized, manufacturing, foreign-owned and larger firms appear more likely to employ this ADR practice.</p>
<p>The survey reveals that an employee ‘hotline’ or email-based ‘speak-up’ service are used by only 4 percent of organizations and some variations are indicated between firms of different types. Virtually no small firms (0.9 percent) use the procedures, but they are found in 7.6 percent of medium/large firms. Whereas 12.2 percent of foreign-owned firms use an employee ‘hotline’ or email based ‘speak-up’ service, only 0.7 percent of Irish-owned firms do so. These findings suggest that that the employee ‘hotline’ or email based ‘speak-up’ service may be the preserve of non-Irish and of larger firms. The survey found that ombudspersons are used by only about 2 percent of organizations; no small firms appear to use company ombudsmen, while they are used by 4.0 percent of medium/large firms. The use of ombudsmen may be more prevalent in foreign-owned firms than Irish-owned: the respectively proportions being 4.2 percent and 0.7 percent.</p>
<p>As alternatives to managers unilaterally deciding how to adjudicate workplace problems, review panels comprised of managers or of employees’ peers may be used. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0143831X11424767">Table 2</xref> shows that review panels comprised of managers are used by 6 percent of firms in Ireland. Differences between groups of firms are not on the whole notable. Even fewer firms, or about 3 percent, used review panels comprised of employees’ peers in adjudicating on workplace disputes, with few differences of any note arising across groups of firms.</p>
<p>The evidence that emerges from the survey is that very few firms are diffusing innovative ADR-style conflict management practices to address workplace problems and disputes involving individual employees. Whether an organization is small or large, multinational or Irish-owned, union or non-union, engaging in manufacturing or service activities, the general pattern seems to be to stick with tried-and-tested methods to manage conflict and resolve disputes.</p>

<title>Practices for managing conflict involving groups of employees</title>
<p>A contrasting set of findings emerge from the survey in relation to resolving contentious issues and disputes involving groups of employees. The survey results for this area are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0143831X11424767">Table 3</xref>. Formal written procedures involving progressively higher levels of management in addressing disputes involving groups of employees are found in some four out of 10 firms. The table shows that 50.8 percent of unionized firms have formal written procedures for the resolution of group conflicts compared to 40.2 percent of non-unionized firms. With regard to firm size, 41 percent of small firms possessed formal written procedures for group-based problems compared to 70.8 percent of medium/large firms. Differences also appear to exist between Irish-owned and foreign-owned firms in this area, with 36.1 percent of Irish firms operating such procedures compared with 51.8 percent of multinationals. Differences between firms from the different sectors appear not so pronounced.</p>

<p>Overall, about 17 percent of firms resort at final stage in the procedure, where deadlock remains, to public dispute resolution bodies, such as the Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court. The table shows that four out of 10 unionized firms say that they resort to the public dispute resolution bodies where deadlock remains, compared to 5.6 percent of non-union firms – confirming that the Labour Relations Commission and Labour Court remain very much the preserve of unionized firms. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0143831X11424767">Table 3</xref> reveals that medium/large firms are over three times more likely to use public bodies as small firms (49.8 percent and 15.0 percent), while the services of public agencies are used twice as much by the foreign-owned firms than by Irish-owned firms (29.5 percent and 14.4 percent).</p>
<p>In addition to traditional formal written procedures and resort to external public agencies for dispute resolution, six ADR-type practices for managing (including in some cases seeking to avoid) conflict involving groups of employees were examined in the survey. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0143831X11424767">Table 3</xref> shows that about 30 percent of firms use intensive formal communications regarding impending change with groups of employees with a view to avoiding disharmony or conflict. Unionized firms appear much more likely to use such formal communication systems than non-union firms: the proportions here being 34.4 percent of unionized firms compared to 22.7 percent of non-union firms. Larger firms use intensive formal communication considerably more frequently than small firms: the proportions being 55.9 percent and 23.9 percent respectively. There also appears to be a difference in the use of intensive formal communication between the sectors examined, with 33.3 percent of manufacturing firms and 25.5 percent of service firms adopting this practice. Finally, there appears to be a difference in usage between Irish-owned and foreign-owned firms: 21.6 percent of Irish firms and 37.9 percent of foreign multinationals having adopted this practice.</p>
<p>External experts are used as problem-solvers and facilitators in negotiations in a significant minority of firms. One in five firms said they have used external experts to assist in reaching settlement or to prevent deadlock in discussions or negotiations in the company. In contrast only 8 percent of firms use private external arbitrators (other than the Labour Relations Commission or Labour Court) to adjudicate disputes. Over twice as many unionized firms than non-union firms use an external expert to assist in reaching a settlement or to prevent deadlock in discussions or negotiations. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0143831X11424767">Table 3</xref> shows that medium/large firms use external experts to assist in reaching a settlement or to prevent deadlock nearly twice as often as small firms. Overall, the findings suggest that organizations prefer to engage external experts to problem-solve rather than to adjudicate. Organizations are as likely, if not somewhat more so, to use private experts rather than public agencies when it come to providing ‘softer’ services such as mediation and problem-solving.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0143831X11424767">Table 3</xref> shows that 31 percent of firms use brainstorming, problem-solving and related techniques to solve problems or resolve collective disputes. The table suggests some contrasts between categories of firms. Rather surprisingly smaller firms appear more likely to use these practices. While Irish-owned firms are less likely to use these practices than foreign-owned firms (27.3 percent and 36.6 percent respectively).</p>
<p>Finally, the survey asked firms whether or not they used interest-based bargaining practices. These practices are used to develop collaborative approaches to collective bargaining negotiations and to solve problems and differences between managers and employees and among work groups. It was stated by 16 percent of firms that they engaged in formal interest-based bargaining. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0143831X11424767">Table 3</xref> reveals little difference between unionized and non-unionized firms – suggesting that interest-based bargaining is not the preserve of unionized firms that engage in collective bargaining. Nearly twice as many large/medium firms (29.4 percent) use formal interest-based bargaining as small firms (15.1 percent). Foreign-owned firms are significantly more likely than Irish-owned firms to use formal interest-based bargaining techniques to resolve disputes: the proportions being 22.8 percent compared to 14.0 percent respectively.</p>
<p>The general pattern of the descriptive survey findings relating to the management of group-based workplace conflict contrasts with those relating to the management of conflict involving individual employees. Whereas nearly two-thirds of firms adopt formal written procedures to resolve individual-based workplace problems, only 40 percent of firms use formal written procedures to address group-based problems. While the survey found that few organizations have embraced ADR-style practices to solve individual-based workplace problems, significant minorities of firms have adopted proactive ADR-style practices for addressing group-based workplace problems. Thus overall firms in Ireland appear to be more innovative in relation to managing group-based than individual-based conflict.</p>

<title>Multivariate regression results</title>
<p>The descriptive results reviewed in the previous section point to some variations in the incidence of ADR practices in firms with different features. However, as some of the features examined are likely to be intercorrelated, multivariate analysis is required to establish the discrete contribution of different features to explaining the incidence of ADR practices, as well as to examine the contribution of other potential influences measured by ordinal scales. In this section we deploy binary logistic regression modelling to extend our analysis of the survey data.</p>

<title>Influences on the diffusion of practices for managing conflict involving individual employees</title>
<p>We begin by examining influences on the diffusion of practices for managing conflict involving individuals. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0143831X11424767">Table 4</xref>, union recognition doubles or more than doubles the odds that firms have adopted several ADR practices such as the use of external experts to resolve grievances and review panels of managers (<italic>p</italic> &gt; .10). A concern to avoid or contain unions however is not found in general to be associated with individual ADR practices; the only exception involves formal open-door policies (<italic>p</italic> &gt; .10). Thus, non-union firms are not found to be the principal exponents of individual ADR in Ireland.</p>

<p>The adoption of individual ADR is not associated with the size categories compared in the regressions (large and medium firms employing 50 or more employees as compared with firms employing 20–49 employees). Shifting the firm size threshold to 1000 employees or more has no bearing on the results. US multinationals are substantially more likely than their Irish counterparts to adopt some individual ADR practices (‘hotline’ or ‘speak-up’ services and ombudsmen), but the pattern is not consistent across all practices and US firms may make less use of external experts (<italic>p</italic> &gt; .10). Other foreign-owned multinationals are not found to be more likely than their Irish counterparts to have adopted ADR practices for managing individual grievances and disputes, with the sole exception of their greater use of ‘hotline’ or ‘speak-up’ services. There appears to be little consistent association with sector (manufacturing vs services): manufacturing firms sometimes being less likely to have adopted specific practices (‘hotline’ or ‘speak-up’ services) and sometimes more so (employee advocates).</p>
<p>Firms adopting HRM practices are shown to be more likely to have adopted a series of individual ADR practices: formal open-door policies, ‘hotline’ or ‘speak-up’ services and employee advocates. Neither firms prioritizing innovation and quality over cost nor firms with higher proportions of skill- or knowledge-based workers appear any more likely to have introduced individual ADR practices. Finally a concern to emulate good practice in leading firms appears to have no discrete association with the adoption of ADR practices for managing individual grievances and disputes. To test for the possibility that diffusion by emulation was either pronounced or more pronounced among Irish firms than foreign-owned firms, the emulation variable was interacted with a dummy variable denoting Irish ownership in further analysis. The results suggested that Irish-owned firms were no more likely to implement individual ADR practices by emulation than foreign-owned firms.</p>
<p>In summary, bearing in mind the modest overall incidence of individual ADR practices, as outlined in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0143831X11424767">Table 2</xref>, the diffusion of these practices is sometimes positively associated with union recognition and is usually not affected by any underlying concern to contain or avoid unions. US multinationals are more likely than their Irish counterparts to adopt some individual practices but appear less willing to bring in outside experts in conflict resolution. The greater the degree to which firms have adopted HRM practices the more likely they are to have implemented a range of practices for managing conflict involving individual employees. Emulation of best practice in leading firms is not found to be a significant influence on the diffusion of ADR practices for managing individual grievances and disputes in firms in Ireland.</p>

<title>Influences on the diffusion of practices for managing conflict involving groups</title>
<p>We turn next to examining influences on the diffusion of ADR practices for managing conflict involving groups of employees. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0143831X11424767">Table 5</xref> shows that three out of the five group ADR practices examined are between two and five times more prevalent in firms recognizing unions than in non-union firms: these are ‘assisted negotiations’, the use of external arbitrators other than from the state-provided agencies for conflict resolution and the use of formal communications around impending change. There is no evidence from the results to suggest that union containment played any role in the uptake of these practices. Larger firms are associated with some specific group ADR practices but not with these practices in general. Again the results are materially unaffected by changing the size threshold examined.</p>

<p>Shifting the firm size threshold to 1000 employees or more has no bearing on the pattern of results. US multinationals are not associated with the uptake of group ADR practices and, paralleling a finding on individual ADR in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0143831X11424767">Table 3</xref>, appear substantially more reluctant to resort to external arbitrators in group or collective disputes. Other foreign-owned multinationals are no more or less likely than their Irish-owned counterparts to have adopted most group ADR practices. The test outlined earlier for the possibility that diffusion by emulation was either pronounced or more pronounced among Irish firms than foreign-owned firms again obtained negative results in the case of group ADR practices.</p>
<p>Again there is a strong association between HRM practices in firms and the use of a range of group ADR practices. Consistent with the findings on individual ADR in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0143831X11424767">Table 3</xref>, neither innovation/quality-focused competitive postures nor skill-based work or workers appear to be associated in any general sense with group ADR. Also, again, emulation of leading firms is not an influence on the uptake of group ADR, the sole exception being interest-based bargaining (<italic>p</italic> &gt; .10).</p>
<p>In summary, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0143831X11424767">Table 3</xref> revealed that significant minorities of firms had adopted various ADR practices for managing conflict and disputes involving groups of employees, and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0143831X11424767">Table 5</xref> reveals some of the influences that have affected the diffusion of these practices. Group forms of ADR are mainly associated with firms where unions are recognized and are not in general more pronounced in US firms, and indeed in some instances (external arbitrators) appear less so. Sector, competitive posture and the skill content of the work undertaken seem to play no role in the diffusion of group ADR and neither for the most part does emulating leading companies. Firms committed to HRM are more likely to have adopted a range of group ADR practices.</p>

<title>Conclusions and discussion</title>
<p>In conclusion we focus on two sets of findings: first, the incidence of ADR practices for managing both individual and group conflict and second, influences on the diffusion of ADR practices. With respect to the first issue, most firms in Ireland follow relatively orthodox practices to resolve workplace conflict. The incidence of ADR practices for managing conflict involving individuals is by any standards very low or modest. To the extent any innovation is occurring, it relates more to ways of managing group-based workplace problems. The low incidence of individual ADR practices in Ireland – the prevalence of these practices is very much lower, for example, than reported in research on the US; though different sample compositions make direct comparisons perilous – may reflect a number of features of the institutional framework for conflict resolution. Firms in Ireland may find themselves defending grievances brought by employees to the Rights Commissioner service of the Labour Relations Commission. This is an informal and confidential service and is not as onerous as facing litigation in the civil courts. Though compensation may be awarded to successful grievants, costs are not awarded or levied. Grievances relating to employment rights within the jurisdiction of the Employment Appeals Tribunal or the Equality Tribunal or subject to litigation in the civil courts are more likely to involve more substantial representation costs for employers. Legal representation at these tribunals is standard practice. Compensation is also awarded and costs are borne by the parties themselves. Damages may also obviously arise in the civil courts and costs may be awarded. Yet, the scale of compensation, damages and costs arising from these various institutions seem of a different and more modest order than reported in a country like the USA where individual ADR practices appear more widely prevalent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0143831X11424767">Colvin, forthcoming</xref>). Nor can Irish firms constrain their employees to use company-based conflict management practices to resolve employment grievances as arises in the USA under the US Supreme Court’s ‘Gilmer’ judgement – a development linked with a growth in the prevalence of individual ADR practices in that country (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0143831X11424767">Colvin, forthcoming</xref>).</p>
<p>The higher prevalence of group than individual ADR practices in Ireland can also be related to features of the institutional and competitive environment. First of all, union density, which averages 28 percent in the Irish private and commercial state-owned sector, is an influence. Unionized firms are committed to using collective employment processes to address a range of work and HRM-related matters. If these collective processes operate in a dysfunctional manner – because of overly adversarial behaviour for example – they can act as an institutional drag on firm performance. Thus, it is in the interest of both managers and unions for these arrangements to work smoothly, which explains why a significant group of firms are adopting collective ADR processes. The other factor at play is the intense competitive pressure on firms of all kinds, whether unionized or non-union. The current competitive environment puts a premium on business adaptation: to be successful, firms have to continuously upgrade product strategies and the skill levels of employees. But organizational change places a burden on all categories of staff – running the risk that they might become demotivated and even disgruntled. Practices such as brainstorming and intensive communications surrounding change management are potentially effective ways of addressing these dangers. Thus, a significant group of firms can be seen as using group ADR processes to navigate the high seas of business change.</p>
<p>Turning to how variations around average levels of diffusion of individual and group ADR practices can be explained, the results contain some interesting results. US-owned multinationals are more likely to have adopted several individual ADR practices than their Irish counterparts, but this pattern does not follow through into group ADR. This indicates a greater preference for the use of individualized ADR in managing conflict. The lesser use of external experts or arbitrators in individual and group conflict resolution indicates an approach to conflict resolution which is both more individualized and internalized or ‘privatized’ than in Irish-owned firms or other multinationals – confirming aspects of conflict management involving the use of ADR in US firms as outlined in the literature. Other foreign-owned multinationals are considerably less distinctive than their Irish counterparts in the manner in which they manage workplace conflict.</p>
<p>The regression analysis also reveals that high commitment HRM is associated with the incidence of a range of individual and group ADR practices in firms in general. This indicates that ADR practices may well involve an attempt to replicate in the sphere of conflict management the kinds of objectives that animate HRM practices in general: seeking to build commitment to the organization by fostering a more cooperative, engaged and less adversarial approach to work and employment relations. In the light of this, the neglect of ADR in much of the mainstream literature on HRM is surprising and limiting in promoting an understanding of the kinds of employment practices that support the search for high commitment. It also bears emphasis that no evidence could be found that ADR was more prevalent in firms assigning priority to competing on the basis of quality and innovation, or in firms with higher numbers involved in skilled or knowledge-based work. This runs against the grain of the theoretical literature – a literature still founded on little empirical research. Also in the Irish case, strategies specifically concerned with union avoidance or marginalization would not appear to be associated with the adoption of ADR practices. Finally, the emulation of best practice in leading firms does not appear of itself to be a mechanism through which ADR practices diffuse, either in firms in general or in Irish-owned firms. The low level of diffusion of ADR in firms in Ireland, especially with respect to managing individual conflict, suggests that ADR is not diffusing on any widespread basis across the Atlantic to Ireland. The absence of an association between ADR and a number of putative influences identified in the literature suggests that firms in Ireland are immune to some of the influences widely canvassed in the literature when it comes to their approach to the management of workplace conflict.</p>

<p>Respondents were asked to assign points to represent the weighting their firms attributed to competing on the basis of innovation and of quality relative to cost, where 100 points were preassigned by us to competing on the basis of cost. So respondents who viewed competing on the basis of innovation to be twice as important for their organizations as cost would assign 200 points to this aspect of competition; respondents in firms who regarded competing on quality as about half as important as cost would assign 50 points to this aspect of competition and so on. A scale measuring the degree to which firms, as seen by respondents, pursued competitive postures emphasizing innovation and quality was then constructed by deriving the first principal component scores of the points assigned to competing on the basis of innovation and quality relative to cost.</p>
