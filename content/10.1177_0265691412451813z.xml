<p>In this meticulously detailed narrative, Paul Spalding reconstructs the history of what has been until now an imperfectly understood period in the Marquis de Lafayette’s life. The story is exhaustively documented through a wealth of primary source material, ranging from correspondence and memoirs to military and judicial records to pamphlets and newspapers, some of which have been previously unavailable to historians and are widely dispersed among collections spanning no less than eight countries.</p>
<p>The story begins on the night of 19 August 1792, when, fleeing his Jacobin enemies and a Revolution derailed from what he saw as its proper constitutional course, Lafayette and several other French officers were taken prisoner at Rochefort while seeking safe passage to the Dutch Republic. Taken into custody first by Prussian and later Austrian authorities, Lafayette’s captors whisked him westward behind the advancing armies of the French Republic, from the German fortress towns of Wesel and Magdeburg, to Neisse in present-day Poland, and finally to the Moravian city of Olmütz. Lafayette suffered both physically and mentally from the isolation and deprivations of his long imprisonment, but over time a relaxation in restrictions allowed him to read newspapers, receive visitors, and maintain limited correspondence with family and friends, thus keeping him apprised of events in the outside world. Aided by an elaborate system of secret communications between Lafayette, his fellow captives, and supporters beyond the prison walls, these relative freedoms emboldened him to stage a dramatic but hopelessly botched attempt to escape in November 1794. The remainder of his captivity was punctuated by the arrival of his wife Adrienne, who successfully lobbied Francis II for permission to share her husband’s ordeal along with their two daughters until their release in September 1797.</p>
<p>One of the book’s great strengths lies in its exploration of Lafayette’s ambiguous status. Initially considered a prisoner of war, both Frederick William III of Prussia and the Hapsburg Emperor Francis II quickly became disposed to treat him rather as a prisoner of state once Lafayette made it clear that he would not trade French military secrets for his release, proudly maintaining his posture as an enemy of the Coalition despite his defection. As Spalding explains, these bastions of the old order ‘exaggerated Lafayette’s responsibility for the Revolution’ (17), casting him in the role of ideologue and figurehead for the forces that had already dissolved the bonds between England and its colonies, destroyed the French monarchy, and sparked rebellions in the Low Countries. By incarcerating this dangerous ‘apostle of liberty’ (4), they hoped to arrest the spread of revolutionary ideas and spare themselves the fate of Louis XVI. Thus, despite the fact Lafayette was of little strategic importance to the Coalition as a bargaining chip so long as French authorities showed little inclination to extricate him, he was of immense symbolic significance in the larger counter-revolutionary struggle.</p>
<p>Lafayette owed his eventual release to French diplomatic pressure and the intervention of Napoleon Bonaparte, who, enjoying the fruit of his recent successes in the first Italian campaign, was in a position to impose such a demand upon Francis II amidst peace negotiations. But what Spalding uncovers is the role played by an extensive international network of ‘Fayettists’ centred around cities like Philadelphia, London, Paris and Hamburg-Altona, and who for five years tirelessly endeavoured to publicize his plight and press for his release through both official conduits and informal power brokerage. As a ‘hero of two worlds’, Lafayette could boast claims to the sympathies of some of the most famous personages of his day, including George Washington, Charles James Fox, and Germaine de Staël. Spalding especially emphasizes the role played by women in this campaign, and while historians of the early modern period have long recognized the ability of aristocratic and other elite women to wield such informal power, the book nonetheless offers a detailed glimpse of the mechanisms through which women exercised agency in political affairs.</p>
<p>Less persuasive, however, are Spalding’s tentative claims about the efficacy of this campaign, which, he suggests, ultimately tipped the scales in Lafayette’s favour. While his partisans were certainly influential, there is ample reason to believe that Lafayette’s incarceration would have come to a logical end along with the collapse of the First Coalition and the lull in continental hostilities following the Peace of Campo Formio. Moreover, despite the fact that Napoleon was doubtless wary of Lafayette’s potential as a political rival, securing the latter’s release lent dramatic weight to his self-fashioned image as the only man capable of healing France’s revolutionary wounds. Nonetheless, the book makes an invaluable contribution to our understanding of political dissent and resistance to state repression in the age of the Atlantic revolutions.</p>
