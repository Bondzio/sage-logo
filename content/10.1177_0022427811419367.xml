<title>Objectives.</title>
<p>The authors examine perceptions of a peer’s substance use to determine whether and to what degree individuals project their own behavior onto their perceptions of peer’s delinquency, and to determine whether the constructs of self-control and peer attachment are related to perceptions.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Methods.</title>
<p>Using a sample of 2,154 young adult respondents within friendship pairs in which each respondent reported their own substance use and their perception of the friend’s use, the authors estimate a series of regression models with perceptions of a peer’s alcohol, marijuana, <italic>Salvia divinorum</italic>, and hard drug use as dependent variables.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Results.</title>
<p>Perceptions of a peer’s substance use are approximately equally related to a peer’s and a respondent’s use of each substance. Projection occurs to a greater extent when perceiving low-frequency behaviors. Low self-control is sporadically associated with higher perceived substance use.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Conclusions.</title>
<p>Peer self-reported delinquency and perceptions of peer delinquency are distinct constructs. Because projection appears to be worse for infrequent behaviors, researchers should use caution when using low-frequency behaviors to measure perceptual peer delinquency. Although the data used are cross sectional, the perceptual measure is confounded by too many variables other than a peer’s actual delinquency to be considered a valid measure of the sole construct of peer delinquency.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Delinquency among one’s peers is one of the strongest correlates of criminal activity known to behavioral scientists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0022427811419367">Warr 2002</xref>). The term “peer delinquency” is somewhat misleading in that the vast majority of studies operationalizing this construct do not actually measure a peer’s true delinquency, but rather one’s perceptions of a peer’s, or peer group’s, delinquency. As such, the majority of “peer delinquency” measures would be more accurately termed “perceptual peer delinquency,” connoting that they measure the subject’s perception of his or her friends' use and not the friends' own self-reports.</p>
<p>Although perceptual peer delinquency measures are extensively used in literature and are consistently empirically linked to offending behavior (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022427811419367">Akers 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0022427811419367">Pratt and Cullen 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0022427811419367">Pratt et al. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0022427811419367">Warr 2002</xref>), these measures and their use have generated a fair share of criticism. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0022427811419367">Newcomb (1961)</xref> was one of the first to raise issue with a perceptual measure of behavior. His argument was centered on what he termed “projection.” Projection is the situation in which an individual’s perceptions of others are influenced by their own characteristics. In terms of perceptions of peer delinquency, projection occurs when one is asked to report the delinquency of another person and that report is unknowingly influenced by their own behavior (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022427811419367">Gottfredson and Hirschi 1987</xref>, 1990).</p>
<p>The potential for projection occurring in peer delinquency measures has been raised as a concern by many who research crime and deviance (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022427811419367">Agnew 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022427811419367">Aseltine 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022427811419367">Gottfredson and Hirschi 1987</xref>, 1990; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022427811419367">Haynie 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022427811419367">2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022427811419367">Haynie and Osgood 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022427811419367">Kandel 1996</xref>; Matsueda and Anderson <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022427811419367">1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0022427811419367">McGloin 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0022427811419367">McGloin and Shermer 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0022427811419367">Thornberry et al. 1994</xref>; Zhang and Messner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0022427811419367">2000</xref>) and by those who focus on psychological measurement (e.g., see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022427811419367">Carroll et al. 2006</xref>). The construct validity of the measurement of peer delinquency rests on the assumption that one’s perception of another’s behavior accurately reflects that person’s deviance. As such, the potential for projection occurring is an issue of central concern to criminologists.</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022427811419367">Gottfredson and Hirschi (1987)</xref> additionally challenge the use of perceptual peer delinquency measures due to tautological concerns. They argue that the individual and a peer may simultaneously engage in deviant acts. They state “The delinquent activities reported for friends are the same delinquent activities previously reported by the respondent for himself” (p. 598). In turn, this leads to the conclusions that “self-reported peer delinquency is just another measure of self-reported delinquency” and that “delinquency is correlated with delinquency” (p. 597). If an independent variable unknowingly taps the outcome’s construct, the resulting conclusions are (at best) questionable. Gottfredson and Hirschi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022427811419367">1990</xref>) instead believe that the common variable of self-control should render the relationship between peer delinquency and delinquency spurious and especially the relationship between perceptual peer delinquency and self-reported delinquency. Among others, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0022427811419367">Thornberry and Krohn (1997)</xref> have noted that if Gottfredson and Hirschi’s concern is valid, then “virtually the entire body of research assessing the relationship between association with deviant peers and self-reported deviance would be useless because the measures are not independent” (p. 222). While researchers have tried to address the similarity between perceptions of peer delinquency and self-reported delinquency without measures of delinquency directly from friends (e.g., Matsueda and Anderson <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022427811419367">1998</xref>; Zhang and Messner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0022427811419367">2000</xref>), such investigations are speculative and inherently paint an incomplete picture because there is no way to judge whether those perceptions are correct.</p>
<p>Comparisons between perceptual peer delinquency measures and self-reported peer delinquency are somewhat rare. Bauman and Ennett (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022427811419367">1996</xref>) concluded that perceptual measures of peer smoking were distinct from the peer’s direct report of his or her actual smoking. The authors concluded that “there may be a strong tendency for adolescents to use their own smoking behavior to describe the smoking behavior of their friends” (p. 189). Other scholars focusing on different behaviors also have suggested that projection may be occurring (e.g., Bauman and Fisher <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022427811419367">1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022427811419367">Bauman and Koch 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022427811419367">Fisher and Bauman 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022427811419367">Graham, Marks, and Hansen 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022427811419367">Iannotti and Bush 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022427811419367">Jussim and Osgood 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022427811419367">Marks and Miller 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0022427811419367">Norton, Lindrooth, and Ennett 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0022427811419367">Perkins and Craig 2003</xref>; see also Zhang and Messner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0022427811419367">2000</xref>). Recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0022427811419367">Young and colleagues (2011)</xref> investigated the dependent variable of misperception of peer delinquency. They concluded that although most peoples' perceptions are fairly accurate, low self-control may be a major cause of inaccuracies in perceiving peer delinquency. If self-control is affecting the perception of a peer’s delinquency, the covariance between self-control and peer delinquency may have been inflated in past studies due to unseen measurement error, which would have affected the strength of both constructs.</p>
<p>It should be noted that the majority of the previously mentioned studies include perceptual peer delinquency measures that inquire about a group of friends. To properly determine whether projection is occurring, measures of perceptual peer delinquency must be linked to the self-reported behavior of specific friends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022427811419367">Kandel 1996</xref>). Group level measures in such investigations are not ideal because individuals could correctly perceive a group’s delinquency while incorrectly perceiving how individuals within that group behave. Existing projection literature also does not address how the frequency of a behavior may impact one’s ability to perceive a peer’s actual delinquency.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0022427811419367">1</xref></sup> As the prevalence of a delinquent act increases so too will opportunities to observe that act, suggesting that people will likely be more aware of their friend’s frequent delinquencies. Accordingly, infrequent behaviors will not provide individuals with many observations on which to develop a perception.</p>

<sec id="section2-0022427811419367">
<title>Current Study</title>
<p>Using a large sample of best friend pairs, this study’s purpose is to address if projection is occurring in perceptions of peer delinquency by assessing if and to what degree individuals project their own substance use into their perception of a peer’s substance use. We do this by using direct and perceptual measures of peer delinquency. We examine whether one’s own use of drugs is related to the perceptions of a peer’s use after the peer’s actual use is taken into account. If one’s own use is related, we conclude that some projection has occurred.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0022427811419367">2</xref></sup> As Gottfredson and Hirschi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022427811419367">1990</xref>) suggest, the relationship between a peer’s use and one’s own use may be spurious due to other factors related to both one’s own use and perceptions of friend’s use. To examine this possibility, we include four variables that may impact that relationship; attachment to the friend, self-control, social fraternity or sorority membership, and gender. After investigating a scaled measure of substance use, we investigate four types of drug use individually—alcohol, marijuana, salvia,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0022427811419367">3</xref></sup> and other hard drug use. These four substances vary greatly in the frequency which they are used, allowing us to investigate how perceptions of peer delinquency may vary based on the frequency of the behavior perceived.</p>

<title>Data and Sample</title>
<p>Information was collected from 2,154 college students in 1,077 best friend dyads at a large southeastern university. Potential participants were recruited from two dozen high enrollment courses with a total of 4,973 enrolled students. A representative from the research team asked potential respondents to volunteer to come to the study location with a person who was one of their five best friends and currently enrolled at the university. Each person who was in one of the selected courses received extra credit for their participation. Because the study included a large number of classes with a large number of people within them, both individuals in a dyad were in a selected course and received extra credit approximately 20 percent of the time. The remainder of the time, the person not receiving extra credit simply came to the study with the only incentive of helping his or her friend.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0022427811419367">4</xref></sup> No one was allowed to participate in the study more than once.</p>
<p>Upon arriving at the study site, the friends were signed in with their student identification cards by a researcher after they agreed to voluntarily participate in the research. Participants were administered identical surveys that were precoded with a matching dyadic identification number to mark them as a linked pair. The two friends filled out their surveys in separate rooms, were debriefed, and exited through separate doors to avoid contact with one another and reduce the possibility of data contamination. As our interest is in the construction of an individual’s perception of another’s substance use, dyadic data files were transformed and merged so that each individual and each individual’s friend’s characteristics of interest were on the same line of data (this is called as “double entry” dyadic file structure; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022427811419367">Kenny, Kashy, and Cook 2006</xref>). This resulted in a total sample of 2,154 individuals.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0022427811419367">5</xref></sup>

<sec id="section7-0022427811419367">
<title>Perceptual peer delinquency</title>
<p>While studies typically use perceptions of peer delinquency as independent variables to represent the delinquent peers construct, this study utilizes perceptual peer delinquency measures as the outcome variables. Participants were asked how many times in the past 12 months the other member of the dyad binge drank and used marijuana, salvia, and hard drugs on a scale ranging from 1 (<italic>never</italic>) to 9 (<italic>two to three times a day</italic>). The wording of these four items was adapted from the National Youth Survey (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022427811419367">Elliott, Huizinga, and Ageton 1985</xref>). These substances were chosen to allow us to determine if factors relating to perceptions are consistent across very frequent (alcohol; 64 percent self-report prevalence in the data), somewhat frequent (marijuana; 33 percent self-report prevalence), and infrequent (salvia and hard drugs; 4 percent self-report prevalence each) behaviors. An overall substance use scale was created by summing each of these items and dividing by the number of items. As few participants perceived their peer to have used salvia or hard drugs and almost all that did perceived use at the lowest level (scored 2), these dependent variables were collapsed into binary outcomes (0 = <italic>no perceived use</italic>; 1 = <italic>perceived use</italic>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0022427811419367">6</xref></sup>

<title>Self-reported substance use</title>
<p>Both the self-reported substance use of the respondent and the self-reported use of their peer are included as independent variables in the current analysis.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0022427811419367">7</xref></sup> Participants reported their own use on the same 1 to 9 scale that was used to assess perceived use.</p>

<title>Control Variables</title>
<sec id="section11-0022427811419367">
<title>Peer attachment</title>
<p>A measure of peer attachment was included, as the extent one is attached to their peer may affect perceptions and the extent of projection. Five items, measured on a scale of 1 to 5, asked how strongly the subject agreed that they could talk to their friend about problems, if the friend could keep secrets, if the friend is happy when the subject is successful, if they would miss the friend if they moved away, and if they are happy when spending time with the peer (α = .87).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0022427811419367">
<title>Self-control</title>
<p>Since self-control may affect one’s own criminal involvement as well as with whom one associates (see Gottfredson and Hirschi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022427811419367">1990</xref>), self-control is included as an additional factor that may be related to perceptions. Self-control was measured with the scale created by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022427811419367">Grasmick and colleagues (1993)</xref> that taps the six dimensions of self-control identified by Gottfredson and Hirschi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022427811419367">1990</xref>). This attitudinal measure scaled well (α = .84) and is coded so that lower scores represent lower self-control.</p>

<sec id="section13-0022427811419367">
<title>Other controls</title>
<p>Two covariates, social fraternity/sorority membership (1 = <italic>affiliated</italic>) and gender (1 = <italic>male</italic>), are included in the final models. These variables are included because men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0022427811419367">Moffitt et al. 2001</xref>) and those in Greek organizations on college campuses (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022427811419367">McCabe et al. 2005</xref>) are at a higher risk of substance use and misuse than those who are female and/or unaffiliated with Greek organizations, suggesting that these traits may be associated with perceptions of use.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0022427811419367">
<title>Analytic Strategy</title>
<p>In order to determine which factors are associated with an individual’s perception of another’s substance use, a series of stepwise regression models are estimated for the overall substance use scale and for each individual substance. The total substance use measure and the measures of alcohol and marijuana use are all positively skewed and resemble the Poisson distribution. Though the measures are not counts, Poisson regression is an effective mechanism for this type of data and likelihood ratio tests of the alpha parameters failed to reach significance, indicating that Poisson models are more appropriate than negative binomial models. Because the salvia and hard drug use outcomes are binary, rare events logistic regression models are estimated.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0022427811419367">8</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>To determine if we obtain different results based on the prevalence rate of use for the different drugs, we first examine an aggregate scale of drug use, combining the frequency of drug use across our four measures. We then examine each drug use measure separately beginning with the most prevalent (binge alcohol use) and concluding with the two least frequent (salvia use and hard drug use). The dependent variable is first regressed onto only the peer’s self-reported substance use.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0022427811419367">9</xref></sup> The subject’s own substance use (the projection measure) is then entered into the equation to determine if it is significantly related to one’s perceptions of a peer’s use after the peer’s self-reported use is taken into account. To investigate if any observed relationships are possibly spurious due to the influence of other variables, control variables are entered in two stages. First, a third model adds in peer attachment and self-control, and finally a fourth model adds the Greek affiliation and gender controls.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>
<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0022427811419367">Table 1</xref> shows a series of basic information about perceptions, self-reported subject delinquency, and self-reported peer delinquency. The first two columns show how correctly respondents have perceived the substance use of a peer based on whether or not they have personally used the substance. For all four substances, nonuser respondents have perceived their peer’s behavior with a higher level of correctness than those who use substances. Although we cannot determine the causes of the inaccuracies of users with a descriptive analysis, this finding suggests that it is likely that personal substance use has altered our respondents' ability to accurately perceive a peer’s substance use. The likely reason for the relatively high perceptual accuracy for the low frequency behaviors is the fact that most people’s friends have not used, meaning that many perceptions are correct because both the perceiver and the peer indicate “never.” The final columns of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0022427811419367">Table 1</xref> show correlations between the measures of perceptual peer delinquency, the subject’s self-reported delinquency, and the peer’s self-reported delinquency. The delinquency measures from the higher frequency behaviors of alcohol and marijuana use are more strongly related to one another than the infrequent behaviors. The relationships between the measures for the substance scale are also moderately strong, given that most of the variability in the scale is being driven by frequent behaviors.</p>

Results regarding the projection hypothesis are presented in stepwise regression models in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0022427811419367">Tables 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0022427811419367">3</xref>. A perceptual peer substance scale composed of all four substances serves as the first outcome in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0022427811419367">Table 2</xref> (models 1 to 4). Peer self-reported use (“SR of Peer Use”; model 1) is strongly related to one’s perceptions of it. When the subject’s self-reported substance use (“SR of Subject Use”; model 2) is included, the effect of the peer’s self-reported use is decreased by approximately 30 percent (<italic>b</italic> = .309, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001 [model 1] to <italic>b</italic> = .218, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001 [model 2]). The fact that the subjects' own use is not only significant but also decreases the effect of peer’s actual use suggests that subjects are projecting their own use into perceptions of their friend’s use. The effects of both self-reported measures remain significant as peer attachment and self-control are entered (model 3), and neither control variable is statistically significant. Model 4 enters being in a social fraternity or sorority and gender. Although both of these variables are significantly related to perceptual peer substance scale, they do not affect the relationships between the self-reported measures and perceptions of peer use. Although pseudo-<italic>R</italic>
<sup>2</sup>s are problematic because they do not reflect the true variance explained in the model, they are useful in this instance for examining the amount of additional variance explained as additional variables are added to the models. The overall variance explained increases by approximately 20 percent when the subject’s self-reported behavior is included in the model to <italic>R</italic>

<p>The remaining models deconstruct the scale and use perceptions of individual substances as dependent variables in order to determine if relationships are contingent on the differences in prevalence rates of the different substances. Models 5 to 8 in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0022427811419367">Table 2</xref> use the perceptual peer variable of binge drinking as the dependent variable, a high-frequency behavior in the sample. The magnitude of the coefficient associated with the peer’s self-reported substance use decreases by approximately 30 percent from model 5 to model 6 when the subject’s self-report is added. When the alcohol outcome variable is assessed, the statistical distinction between the two measures of self-reported substance use becomes blurred, as the peer’s self-reported binge drinking (<italic>b</italic> = .141, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) is only slightly larger than a subject’s binge drinking (<italic>b</italic> = .131, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). The four control variables (models 7 and 8) fail to reach significance and do not affect the strength of the two self-report measures, and the subject’s and peer’s self-reported behavior account for the pseudo variance explained in perceptual peer binge drinking (<italic>R</italic>
<sup>2</sup> = .193).</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0022427811419367">Table 2</xref> concludes with models 9 through 12, which follow perceptual peer marijuana use as an outcome, a behavior of moderate frequency in the sample. Once again, the inclusion of a subject’s own marijuana use is significant and decreases the magnitude of the peer’s self-reported use on perception by about 30 percent. A clear difference between this model and the binge drinking model is that a person’s perception of their peer’s marijuana use is more strongly related to the peer’s actual use (<italic>b</italic> = .159, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) rather than the self-reported use of the subject (<italic>b</italic> = .118, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). When self-control is entered in model 11, lower amounts of self-control are related to higher amounts of perceived peer substance use. Finally, model 12 shows that neither Greek status nor gender associate with perceptions of a peer’s marijuana use, and the other variables remain at current levels of strength.</p>
<p>Table 3 shows rare event logistic regression results that regress a person’s perceptions of their peer’s salvia use onto self-reported measures of salvia use (an infrequent behavior in our data) and control variables. Model 13 shows that a peer’s use of salvia strongly associates with one’s perceptions of it, and this effect remains significant and similar in magnitude when the self-reported salvia use of a subject is entered, which also reaches high levels of significance. In model 14, the peer’s (<italic>b</italic> = 1.205, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) and subject’s (<italic>b</italic> = 1.507, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) self-reported salvia are both significantly related to perceptions. Lower levels of self-control once again are related to higher amounts of perceived peer substance use. The addition of social fraternity/sorority and gender control variables in model 16 does not alter the results of the model, as neither approaches levels of significance. The peer’s salvia use alone explains 12 percent of the pseudo-explained variance in the model and the subject’s self-reported use adds 15 percent more variance explained (<italic>R</italic>
<sup>2</sup> = .276), which suggests that the projection measure is more influential on the model than the peer’s actual use.</p>
<p>The analysis concludes by investigating the perceptual outcome of another low frequency behavior—hard drug use (models 17 to 20). The peer’s self-reported delinquency is significantly associated with perception again, as is the subject’s self-reported use (models 17 and 18). Together in model 18, the measures of peer (<italic>b</italic> = .902, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) and subject (<italic>b</italic> = 1.007, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) self-reported substance use have very similar effects on the perception of a peer’s hard drug use. When peer attachment and self-control are added to the models (model 19), peer attachment fails to reach levels of significance, but low self-control once again is related to higher amounts of perceived substance use of a peer. The social Greek status and gender controls do reach significance, but their relationship does not alter the existing relationships.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0022427811419367">11</xref></sup>

<title>Discussion and Conclusions</title>
<p>Although many have speculated that peer delinquency perceptions are not actually measuring the delinquency of peers (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022427811419367">Gottfredson and Hirschi 1987</xref>, 1990), the use of perceptual peer delinquency measures are very common in research on crime and deviance. Using a sample of friendship dyads and four perceptions of a specific friend’s substance use as dependent variables, the current study has presented new evidence to address this important conceptual and methodological issue.</p>
<p>Three main findings emerge from this study. First, perceptions of a peer’s drug use are related to self-reported use once the peer’s actual delinquency is controlled. This is true for the drug scale and each of the four drug types investigated in this study. Using the formula suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0022427811419367">Paternoster and colleagues (1998)</xref>, we tested whether the peer's self-report or the respondent's self-report was more strongly related to perceptions of peer delinquency. These results (unreported) revealed that the peer's self-reported delinquency was more strongly related to perceptions than the respondent’s self-report for the substance use scale (<italic>z</italic> = 1.98, <italic>p</italic> ≤ .05) and marijuana use (<italic>z</italic> = 3.05, <italic>p</italic> ≤ .01) outcomes. This, however, was not the case for the other three outcomes; for these substances, the magnitude of the effect of peer’s actual behavior is not significantly larger than that the respondent’s use. Considered conservatively, the effects of respondent and peer self-reported substance use on perceptions are not substantially different. Although this neither definitively rejects nor supports <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022427811419367">Gottfredson and Hirschi’s (1987</xref>, 1990) hypothesis that perceptual measures of delinquency only measure the subject’s self-reported behavior, we can safely conclude that subjects use their own drug use to make some assumptions about the drug use of others.</p>
<p>Second, individuals appear to be most strongly projecting their own behavior into perceptions of infrequent behaviors, as projection is worst for salvia use and hard drug use. Low-frequency behaviors offer few points of potentially observing one’s peers committing the acts. Perhaps if someone experiments with a less common substance, they are likely to rely on assumption in the absence of observation and assume that their counterparts are behaving as they do. This frequency finding is relevant to the common practice of using scales of peer delinquency as independent variables. If a scale contains both infrequent and frequent peer behaviors, our findings would suggest that the individual scale items might be measuring the typical dependent variable—self-reported delinquency—in different amounts. If future research can, for instance, conclude that projection most frequently occurs across low-frequency forms of deviance, then researchers should utilize higher frequency behaviors in peer delinquency scales when low-frequency forms of delinquency are not of central theoretical importance, such as the situation when researchers simply want to statistically control for peer delinquency.</p>
<p>Third and finally, the control variables failed to fundamentally change the relationships that self-reported peer use and self-reported subject use had with perceptions of peer delinquency. Peer attachment never reached levels of significance, and sorority or fraternity membership and gender were only sporadically associated with peer delinquency perceptions and did not change the strength of the other variables even when significant. Interestingly, low self-control was associated with higher amounts of perceptual peer delinquency in several models, which might suggest that self-control may alter one’s ability to perceive peer delinquency (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0022427811419367">Young et al. 2011</xref>). If this is the case, past studies examining the effect of self-control that have included a measure of perceptual peer delinquency (as is almost always done; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0022427811419367">Pratt and Cullen 2000</xref>) may have, to a moderate extent, measured a respondent’s self-control twice because the self-control of the respondent may have been echoed in the perceptual peer delinquency measure. Because of this, the covariance between the constructs of peer delinquency and self-control may have been artificially inflated due to unseen measurement error in the perceptual measure of peer delinquency—this may have reduced the strength of the self-control construct in these studies.</p>
<p>This study contains some limitations that should be acknowledged. First, the analytical unit in this study is dyadic and contains only two best friends instead of an entire friendship network. Although research has suggested that the delinquency of a best friend has a stronger influence on an individual than a regular friend’s delinquency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0022427811419367">Weerman and Smeenk 2005</xref>), we believe not being able to measure other friends and create friendship webs is a limitation (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022427811419367">Haynie 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022427811419367">2002</xref>). It may be possible that the network’s delinquency may influence one’s perception of a best friend’s delinquency in a similar way to how one’s self-reported delinquency influences the perception. Additionally, the gender structure and balance of a friendship dyad may have an added impact on perceptions of behavior, and future studies should evaluate the structure of the dyad to determine if this impacts projection.</p>
<p>Finally, this study’s design is cross sectional, and as such we are unable to determine causal order between changes in perception and delinquency. Recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0022427811419367">Young and colleagues (2011)</xref> had a choice as whether or not to use a cross-sectional or longitudinal analysis in evaluating misperception as a dependent variable. They stated that<disp-quote>
<p>an individual’s reported perception … of peer delinquency is a contemporaneous indicator that is captured at the time a survey questionnaire is completed … other social process measures are tapping behaviors and events prior to the respondent’s report of his or her peers' delinquency, and, therefore, prior to the measurement … As a result, correct temporal ordering is established in a cross-sectional analysis.(p. 614)</p>
</disp-quote>We understand the logical perspective of Young and colleagues because measures of perceptual peer delinquency are indeed instantaneous and do reflect past behavior. However, this belief is tenuous because the development of a perception of a peer’s delinquency may be an intricate process with many possible causal paths. The assumption that cross-sectional data are satisfactory rests on <italic>another</italic> assumption that peer behavior is the <italic>sole</italic> cause of perceptions of peer delinquency. While a peer’s actual delinquency would ideally influence one’s perceptions, the causal direction may be in the opposite direction and one’s perceptions may alter the peer’s delinquency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0022427811419367">Thornberry et al. 1994</xref>; Zhang and Messner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0022427811419367">2000</xref>). We would predict a reciprocally causal relationship where perceptions of behavior have a causal influence on a peer’s behavior, which in turn may influence perceptions, and we would expect this relationship to be moderated by projection. Longitudinal data are necessary to address this possibility.</p>
<p>Existing data are weak in their ability to address the causal question in perceptions of peer delinquency. Weerman’s Dutch data (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0022427811419367">Meldrum et al. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0022427811419367">Weerman and Smeenk 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0022427811419367">Young et al. 2011</xref>) are the best equipped as there are multiple waves, but even this data set is limited because there are inconsistent scales of measurement for perceptual, self-report, and actual peer delinquency and there are only five delinquency items, four of which are infrequent behaviors. A further understanding of the issue of causality in perceptions of peer delinquency is important, and moving toward a complete understanding of this would require a data set that (1) has a longitudinal panel design; (2) has a wide range of delinquency measures, including measures of subject delinquency, perceptions of peer delinquency, and that peer’s (or those peers') delinquency; (3) collects data from dyads or networks; and, most importantly, (5) has perceptual peer delinquency items that reflect <italic>one</italic> person’s behavior. If perceptual peer delinquency items reflect the behavior of multiple others, any information about the accuracy and causality of perceptions is lost if the researcher is unable to partition out which friend was most influential for the perceptions.</p>
<p>The inevitable question arises: Is using a perceptual peer delinquency measure a valid way to measure peer delinquency? Like the multiple elements contained in a measure of perceptual peer delinquency, the answer is multifaceted and depends largely on what the research is attempting to accomplish. If it is the intention of the researcher to include a measure that truly reflects a peer’s self-reported delinquency, using one person’s perception of that behavior will not suffice. Very simply, a measure of perceptual peer delinquency produced by one individual contains too many additional constructs to be considered an operationally valid measure of the sole construct it is supposed to represent.</p>
<p>On the other hand, potential situations could easily arise when a researcher would want to measure perceptual peer delinquency. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022427811419367">Akers (1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022427811419367">2009</xref>) argues that social learning theory is a theory based on one’s perception of their peers' delinquency, regardless of the true delinquency of those particular peers. Thus, if it is the researcher’s goal to measure a perceptual measure of peer delinquency, such as in testing social learning theory, the status quo of the construct’s measurement is both appropriate and valid. But, let the take-home message be clear: The construct of “peer delinquency” is not the same as the construct of “perceptual peer delinquency.”</p>

<p>Descriptive characteristics from the overall sample are available upon request from the lead author. Missing data were eliminated through listwise deletion.

The highest amount of deleted cases was for the scaled measure, eliminating 16.67 percent of available cases.

<p>Considering multicollinearity could have been a potential problem in this study, each model was checked rigorously for potentially collinear variables. In order to do this, we checked for independent variables with low tolerance, high variance inflation factors (VIFs), problematic explained variances, and high intervariable correlations. All the results indicated that the models reported in this article did not suffer from problems of multicollinearity, and thus had no difficulty distinguishing effects of individual independent variables.</p>

<p>Although the logistic model is appropriate for dichotomized outcomes, still very few perceived that their peer had used salvia or hard drugs in the past year (98 percent and 97 percent perceived no use, respectively). Such low frequencies necessitate a rare events correction, which adjusts standard errors to manage issues created by estimating logistic regression models for dependent variables that have events occurring far less frequently than nonevents (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022427811419367">King and Zeng 2001</xref>).</p>

<p>Because of clustering in the data, single level regression models with clustered standard errors and multilevel regressions were also estimated. These results were substantively the same, assuring that independence violations were not affecting our results. As such, we report single level regressions results with non-clustered, robust standard errors.</p>

<p>Because pseudo-<italic>R</italic>
<sup>2</sup> 's are difficult to interpret, we reran the step-four models using ordinary least squares (OLS) regression to see approximately how much variance of each perception was covered. For the alcohol and marijuana modeling, our variables explained much of the variance in perception—60 percent and 56 percent, respectively. In models measuring the less frequent salvia and hard drug outcomes, the stochastic errors dramatically increase. The predictors in the salvia perception model explained 18 percent of the variance, and the perceptual hard drug model’s predictors explained only 16 percent. There are clearly other factors at work in one’s perceptions of a friend’s lower frequency delinquency that we have not captured. Future research investigating the nature of these constructs is warranted.</p>
