<p><italic>Background</italic>: Thailand is not only a popular destination for Swedish tourists, it is also the foreign country where the largest numbers of Swedish males contract HIV. This study investigated sexual risk-behaviour of Swedish men who have sex with commercial sex workers (CSW) in Thailand. <italic>Method</italic>: Eligible men were approached on location in red-light districts of Pattaya and Bangkok with a self-administered multiple-choice questionnaire in December 2010.

Out of the men that were planning to have sex with a CSW in the near future, 80% reported that they would use condoms consistently. While most of these men always use, and plan on always using a condom when having sex with a CSW, some do so inconsistently or not at all.

<title>Background</title>
<p>Ever since the arrival of American soldiers on leave from the nearby Vietnam War in the 1960s, the sector of Thailand’s commercial sex market that caters to foreigners has evolved to become a bona fide industry, and many tourists visit the country for the specific purpose of buying sex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1403494813480572">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1403494813480572">2</xref>]. This study set out to establish if Swedish male sex tourists in Thailand are a group at risk for contracting sexually transmitted infections (STIs), that is, do the men that engage in sexual intercourse with commercial sex workers (CSWs) actually use condoms? Condoms, when used correctly, are the only protection against sexual transmission of HIV and other STIs. Thailand is of particular interest for this study for two main reasons. Firstly, it is a very popular destination for Swedish tourists with more than 400,000 visitors in 2009 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1403494813480572">3</xref>], and secondly, it is the foreign country where the largest numbers of Swedish males contract HIV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1403494813480572">4</xref>].</p>
<p>Commercial sex is common in Thailand and practiced openly throughout the country. The illegal status of prostitution and the large number of part-time CSWs makes it difficult to approximate the number of CSWs in Thailand. According to the U.S. Department of State [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1403494813480572">5</xref>], there were 73,917 adult CSWs in registered entertainment establishments. However, the actual number might be much higher, as street prostitution is widespread. Thailand’s commercial sex industry is divided between a domestic market, primarily catering to Thai nationals, and an international market that targets foreign men. The latter is primarily taking place in brothels, massage parlours, and bars in “red light districts” of tourist destinations. The number of tourists to Thailand has grown from less than 400,000 in 1967 to 14.5 million in 2007 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1403494813480572">6</xref>]. Some visit the country with the specific purpose of buying sex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1403494813480572">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1403494813480572">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1403494813480572">7</xref>].</p>
<p>Initially, Thailand was hit hard by the emerging HIV epidemic. In 1989, a sero-survey in Chiang Mai showed that 44% of the female sex workers were infected with HIV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1403494813480572">8</xref>]. As condom use among sex workers has increased, incidence of HIV has decreased [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1403494813480572">9</xref>]. HIV prevalence among female CSW in brothels was 6.8% in 2005 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1403494813480572">10</xref>].</p>
<p>A 1996 survey [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1403494813480572">11</xref>] of Swedish males found that 12.7% of the respondents had paid a CSW for sexual services. We have not been able to find any studies that investigate risk-behaviour among Swedish med who have sex with CSWs in Thailand, nor any studies that measure the condom habits of these men.</p>

<sec id="section2-1403494813480572" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section3-1403494813480572">
<title>Population and setting</title>
<p>All data was gathered in red-light districts in Bangkok (Nana Plaza and Soi Cowboy) and Pattaya (Beach Road, sois 6, 7, 8 and Walking Street). Sites were chosen in dialogue with the Population and Community Development Association (PDA), a local NGO with extensive experience in HIV prevention. The interviewers approached men in the streets or inside bars and restaurants of these locations. Before handing out the questionnaires, the subjects were screened for eligibility, i.e. Swedish citizenship. The interviewers tried, to the best of their abilities, to avoid discriminating between different ethnicities. However, men of perceived Thai appearance were not approached. Therefore, one must suspect that any Swedish males with Thai appearance were not included in this study. All subjects were invited to read a brief description of the study and based on that give informed consent to participate in the survey. A total of 158 subjects completed the questionnaire. The refusal rate was approximately 35%.</p>
<p>“Sex” in this study is narrowed down to vaginal and anal intercourse. It is beyond the scope of this study to penetrate whether the respondents engage in sex with women, men or transsexuals. Thus it is not known if they have been the receiving party of anal intercourse. Concurrently, the type of establishments in the streets where data collection took place strongly suggests that the men surveyed mainly engage in penile–vaginal intercourse. The bars that cater to the MSM (Men that have Sex with Men) community are found in other streets that were not surveyed.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1403494813480572">
<title>Instruments and measurements</title>
<p>A questionnaire containing mostly multiple-choice questions was self-administered anonymously and put in an unmarked envelope by the respondents. Seven participants asked the interviewers to fill in the questionnaire for them, all stating not having their reading glasses with them as the reason for this. All participants were given a free condom after finishing.</p>
<p>We recoded four variables. For the variable <italic>relationship status</italic>, we collapsed the answer alternatives “divorced”, “unmarried”, and “widower” into the new category “single”, which was contrasted by the answer alternative “married/cohabitant”. We asked the respondents if they had any sexual experience with CSWs prior to them filling out the questionnaire. The answer alternatives were “yes, once”, “yes, several times”, and “no”. The first two alternatives were collapsed into one category. The answers to the question “do you believe that you will have sex with a CSW during your stay in Thailand?” were dichotomized by collapsing the answer alternatives “yes” and “maybe” into one category, and the answer alternatives “I don’t know” and “no” into the other. Finally, the answers to the question “if you were to have sex with a CSW in Thailand, would you then use a condom?” were also dichotomized. The answer alternatives “no”, “maybe” and “don’t know” were collapsed into one category, contrasting the third possible answer alternative, “yes”.</p>
<p>Perceived risk of becoming infected with HIV if having unprotected sex with a Thai CSW was estimated by the question “What do you think: Out of 100 men who have unprotected sexual intercourse with a Thai prostitute, how many will be infected with HIV?”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1403494813480572">
<title>Statistical methods</title>
<p>The data collected were analysed using SPSS version 18 generating cross-tabs, independent sample <italic>t</italic>-test, univariate and multivariate logistic regression.</p>
<p>On the questions about travel companions, the respondents could indicate more than one answer alternative. Thus, when generating the estimates for these variables, we analysed those respondents who had not indicated the specific answer alternative as the reference category for each measure respectively.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1403494813480572">
<title>Ethical considerations</title>
<p>In a study of this nature, the respondents’ anonymity was considered to be paramount. In order to receive informed consent, the informants read a sheet containing of information of the study and information about their rights as study participants, which were in accordance with the Helsinki declaration. The consent forms were not signed – as this was judged to jeopardize the participants’ anonymity, though they had to tick a box on the questionnaire indicating that they had read the consent form and that they had understood its contents and that they consented to participate.</p>
<p>We would also like to emphasize that this study, through the data collection, did not take a judgmental stance on the issue at hand. The main purpose of the study was to investigate to what extent Swedish nationals engaged in unprotected sex with CSWs in Thailand. It was not to change the behaviour of the respondents, meaning that the informants were not approached with any attempts of raising awareness regarding condom use or moral issues about prostitution.</p>

<sec id="section7-1403494813480572" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>A total of 243 subjects were identified as eligible for inclusion in this study, and approached. Out of these, 85 declined and 158 completed the questionnaire (refusal rate = 35%). As described in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1403494813480572">Table I</xref>, the mean age in the sample was 44 years. About 30% of the respondents were married or cohabitants. Commonly, the subjects were either travelling alone or together with friends.</p>

<p>Of the respondents, 63% reported previous sexual experience with CSWs, and 27% of these men reported inconsistent condom use in the past. Almost half of the men sampled had the intention to have sex with a Thai CSW during the present trip, and 20% of these men reported inconsistent plans for condom use. Within this group were 3 individuals (4% of the men with intent to have sex with a CSW) that indicated that they had the specific intention to have unprotected sex with a Thai CSW. The mean risk estimation (rated in percent) of becoming infected with HIV if having unprotected sex with a Thai CSW in the sample was about 15%.</p>
<p>As indicated in the univariate logistic regression (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1403494813480572">Table II</xref>), the particular age group of the traveller did not seem to be related to intent of having sex with a Thai CSW. On the other hand, relationship status was highly significant (OR 3.9) as well as having had prior experience of sexual intercourse with CSWs (OR 17.7). Travel companionship did not seem to be associated with the intent to purchase sex, though travelling alone (OR 2.8) was on the borderline of being significant.</p>

<p>To establish whether the results of the univariate analysis were consistent, we performed a multivariate logistic regression with intent of having sex with a Thai CSW as the outcome variable (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1403494813480572">Table III</xref>). The analysis could determine that both the independent variables being single (OR 5.0) and having previous experience with purchasing sex (OR 43.3) remained associated with intent to buy sex on the present trip. In addition, when adjusted for all other variables, travelling with friends was also positively associated with intent to have sex from a Thai CSW (OR 5.7).</p>

<p>From a public health perspective, the use of contraceptives, and condoms in particular, within the sex industry is of great importance. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1403494813480572">Table I</xref>, of the 76 individuals within our sample who indented to have sex with a Thai CSW during the stay in Thailand, 15 respondents (20%) would consider doing it without using condoms. In order to investigate if this behaviour was related to any of the independent variables, we performed a cross-tabulation (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1403494813480572">Table IV</xref>). The results indicated that the willingness not to use condoms when having sex with a Thai CSW seems to be evenly distributed across different subgroups. As no significant difference was found in the distribution within subgroups we decided not to perform any additional analyses of this question.</p>

Being middle aged seemed to be associated with having a lower risk assessment than being of old or young age. In addition, the results also indicated that lifetime experience imply a lower risk assessment of becoming infected with HIV if having unprotected sex with a Thai CSW, though this finding was not statistically significant.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The results of this study indicate that a great number of Swedish men that frequent red-light districts engage in sexual intercourse with CSWs or have done so in the past. They also indicate that a majority of sex-buyers use condoms consistently. Our results also highlight the demographic diversity of Swedish males who engage in commercial sex in Thailand.</p>
<p>Comparing the results of this study to other studies is a challenge. Method and population differ between studies. Thorpe et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1403494813480572">12</xref>], in Bali, asked Western male subjects about recent (last week) condom use with CSWs and found that 69% of the men reporting consistent use, whereas this study asked about condom use with CSWs ever, and got the result 72%. Another comparable study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1403494813480572">13</xref>] reported that 91% of Japanese males reported consistent lifetime condom use when having sex with a CSW in Thailand. Swedish sex buyers, based on our findings, seem to use condoms slightly more often when purchasing sex than the average Western male, but less often than Japanese male tourists. One must, however, consider that the present study did not ask when a respondent had sex with a CSW, a subject born in 1940 might have had sex with a CSW only once, decades ago, when HIV was not an issue.</p>
<p>The results, that indicate that the willingness to use condoms while having sex with a Thai CSW is evenly distributed within subgroups, indicate that the assessed population level transmission risk of HIV might not be related to use of condoms. However, one cannot exclude that there is a relationship on an individual level, if a risk estimate is on the extreme.</p>
<p>The question about estimated risk of HIV infection from unprotected sex with CSWs received answers ranging from 0%–100%, with a mean of 15%. The actual risk of female-to-male transmission of HIV depends on many variables that are beyond the scope of this study. However, a rough estimation made using available data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1403494813480572">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1403494813480572"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1403494813480572"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1403494813480572">17</xref>] puts the risk of transmission at less than 0.1% for each sexual encounter between a subject of this study and a female CSW in Thailand.</p>
<p>Both young age and no history of sex with a CSW seemed to be associated with a higher estimation of the risk of contracting HIV from unprotected sex with a CSW. HIV came into public awareness in the mid-1980s, and one might speculate that males who had their sexual debut before or around this time could have a better knowledge of the transmission of HIV than males who had their sexual debut after the arrival effective antiretroviral treatment. However, the reasons for the higher risk estimation remains unknown and needs to be further investigated.</p>
<p>Our findings cannot establish that the assessed risk is associated with intending to have unprotected sex with a CSW. A recent Swedish general population study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1403494813480572">18</xref>] found that there was no association between the perceived risk of becoming infected with STIs and condom use. However, we have not been able to find any previous studies on the perceived risk of STI transmission and condom use in relation to sexual intercourse with CSWs.</p>
<sec id="section9-1403494813480572">
<title>Methodological considerations</title>
<p>A big concern in this study was reporting bias. Questions about sexual behaviour are generally perceived as sensitive, and the data collection might suffer from measurement error [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1403494813480572">19</xref>]. Several studies have tried to identify factors that influence response rates and measurement errors. Key factors include setting, mode of administration, interviewer effects and degree of perceived anonymity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1403494813480572">20</xref>].</p>
<p>Social desirability can induce measurement error through social desirability bias [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1403494813480572">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1403494813480572">21</xref>]. In an attempt to minimize social desirability bias, data was gathered in red-light districts, where the otherwise anti-social behaviour of buying sex is actually the norm. Also, men that appeared to be in the company of Caucasian females were not asked to participate, as these females might create a biased setting.</p>
<p>Other efforts to minimize reporting bias included gathering data using self-administered questionnaires, since they seem to yield a higher response ratio and less biased answers than face-to-face interviews [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1403494813480572">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1403494813480572">20</xref>]. Respondents also tend to provide more valid answers of sexual behaviour to interviewers of the same sex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1403494813480572">22</xref>]. Therefore, only males gathered data for this study. Anonymity and interviewer confidentiality was stressed both verbally and in the informed consent document.</p>
<p>Some respondents gave contradictory answers, e.g. four respondents reported never having had sex with a CSW, but went on to answer the questions about condom use with prostitutes. The same pattern was seen in the next section about intention of having sex with a CSW in the near future, and planned condom use on those occasions. The explanation could be honest mistakes such as misreading the questions and instructions. It could also have been caused by intoxication, as many respondents were clearly under the influence of alcohol (based on field worker notes). Another explanation could be that they were actually exposing some ambivalence. Unfortunately it is impossible to discern the reasons, and this shows one of the weaknesses of the questionnaire.</p>
<p>Eight subjects reported that they were widowers. Of these, five were born in 1984 or later. It seems unlikely that so many young widowers all happened to participate in this study, and these claims are likely untrue. Should this be the case, one must suspect other untruthful claims by these men.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>This study set out to find if Swedish men who have sex with CSWs in Thailand are at risk of contracting HIV and other STIs. The results showed that the majority of the sample used condoms consistently when having sex with a CSW. However, a quarter subjects in this study that had had sex with CSWs reported inconsistent or complete lack of use in the past, and one-fifth of them reported inconsistent plans to use condoms in future sex with CSWs. One must therefore conclude that this group is indeed at risk of contracting HIV and other STIs. Most men are aware of the risk of contracting HIV and even exaggerate the risk. It would therefore be recommended to further explore the actual reasons behind the choice of not using a condom and its relation to perceived risk.</p>
