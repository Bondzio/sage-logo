<abstract>
<p>Wheel/rail contact is critical to the successful operation of a railway network. Contact occurs at the wheel tread/rail head and wheel flange/rail gauge corner. Contact conditions are more severe in the latter, which occurs mainly at curves. The contact is small and supports large loads; therefore, high contact stresses are generated. These, combined with the slip in the contact, are primarily responsible for driving the processes that lead to wheel and rail damage, whether by deformation, wear or a fatigue process. Multi-body dynamics software is useful for predicting the wheel/rail contact characteristics; however, there is a shortage of experimental tools available. In this study, the feasibility of an approach based on an ultrasonic sensor mounted on the wheel is investigated. The sensor emits an ultrasonic pulse which is designed to impinge on the wheel flange. If there is no contact the pulse is fully reflected back at the flange and picked up by the same sensor. If flange contact takes place, a proportion of the pulse amplitude will be transmitted into the rail. The signal reflected back to the sensor is therefore reduced. The amount by which this signal reduces indicates how much flange contact has occurred. This work had two aspects. First, a standard ultrasonic ray-tracing software package was used to establish what it is possible to measure with sensors mounted in the wheel and to determine the best location and orientation. The second aspect was an experimental study to determine whether such measurements are feasible. Test specimens were cut from sections of wheel and rail, and a 2 MHz ultrasonic contact transducer was bonded onto the wheel in a position best suited to detect the flange contact. The specimens were pressed together in a bi-axial loading frame to generate differing degrees of rail head and flange contact. The reflected signal was monitored as the normal and lateral loads were varied. It proved possible not only to detect the onset of flanging, but also to record a signal that varied monotonically with both normal and lateral applied load. A map of reflected ultrasound against the applied loading is presented. The technology, while not currently suitable for full field implementation could be very useful in laboratory studies on, for example, a full-scale wheel/rail rig.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0954409712460986" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Ideally wheel/rail contact should be confined to the wheel tread/rail head where the geometry is such that the loading is relatively mild. However, during curving, contact can occur between the wheel flange and the rail gauge corner. Contact conditions are more severe in this location because the geometry is less conformal and the sliding greater. In such situations it is common to have two points of contact, at the wheel flange and at the tread. The contact is typically 1 cm<sup>2</sup> in size and supports a large load; therefore, high contact stresses are generated. These combined with the slip in the contact are primarily responsible for driving the processes that lead to wheel and rail damage, whether it be by deformation, wear or rolling contact fatigue.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954409712460986">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>There is clearly a need for information about the wheel/rail contact interface in terms of position, area and contact stress level. This is particularly important when problems such as wear and rolling contact fatigue may occur. There are several analytical models routinely used to analyse the wheel/rail contact. The simplest of these, Hertz theory, however, assumes that the two components are smooth elastic solids of revolution. To model the real shape of the profiles, numerical solvers have been developed, such as FASTSIM, CONTACT and finite element approaches.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954409712460986">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0954409712460986"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954409712460986">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>There are only a few experimental techniques that can be used to measure contact parameters. Pressure-sensitive films have been used to determine the extent of contact.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954409712460986">5</xref></sup> However, these change the nature of the contact and therefore are limited in their range of application. Dynamic wheel/rail contact area measurements have been taken using low-pressure air passing through 1 mm diameter holes drilled into the rail head.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954409712460986">6</xref></sup> In this technique the pressure variations caused by holes becoming blocked by passing wheels are monitored and the areas determined. This, however, can only give very limited spatial data.</p>
<p>An approach that has shown promise is the use of reflected ultrasound. This makes use of the fact that ultrasound is transmitted through a rough surface interface when there is asperity contact and is reflected when there are small air pockets. Thus, a scan of reflected ultrasound across an interface can be achieved. A map of reflection coefficients can be generated, which can be converted into a contact pressure via a calibration process. This approach has been used successfully to study static wheel tread/rail head interfaces<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0954409712460986">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0954409712460986"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0954409712460986"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0954409712460986">10</xref></sup>; however, it cannot be easily used on the flange because of the more complex geometry and it is of no use for field measurements. Another ultrasonic method used for interrogating contacts relies on surface waves, this again would be impractical to use in this situation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0954409712460986">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>In this work the information that can be obtained from a single stationary transducer has been explored, particularly looking at the flange contact. This was with a view to mounting a transducer on a wheel to provide dynamic sensing of flange contact. This could provide important information on where on a rail network, wear and rolling contact fatigue may be a problem.</p>

<sec id="sec2-0954409712460986"><title>Background</title>
<p>When an ultrasonic pulse strikes an interface between two materials it is partially transmitted and partially reflected. The proportion reflected, known as the reflection coefficient, <italic>R</italic> depends on the acoustic impedance mismatch between the two materials as shown in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula1-0954409712460986">equation (1)</xref>. The ratio of the displacement amplitude of the reflected wave, <italic>A</italic><sub>r</sub>, to the amplitude of the incident wave, <italic>A</italic><sub>i</sub>, is determined by
<disp-formula id="disp-formula1-0954409712460986"><label>(1)</label><mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline" id="math1-0954409712460986"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>A</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>r</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>A</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>i</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>z</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>z</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>z</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>z</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:math><graphic alternate-form-of="disp-formula1-0954409712460986" xlink:href="10.1177_0954409712460986-eq1.tif"/></disp-formula>
where <italic>z</italic> is the acoustic impedance (the product of density and wave speed) of the media and the subscripts refer to the two sides of the interface. If the wave strikes a steel/steel interface and there is perfect contact, then it will be fully transmitted (<italic>z</italic><sub>1</sub> = <italic>z</italic><sub>2</sub>). The impedance of air and steel are 412 and 46.02 × 10<sup>6 </sup>kg/m<sup>2</sup>s, respectively. Thus, an ultrasonic wave will be virtually completely reflected at a steel/air interface, but will be fully transmitted at a homogeneous steel to steel contact.</p>
<p>Thus, if the transducer is positioned in the correct orientation it can detect when contact occurs. The contact between the wheel and rail will never be complete, i.e. 100% contact. There will be microscopic air gaps between the regions of asperity contact. This means that <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula1-0954409712460986">equation (1)</xref> represents a lower bound and <italic>R</italic> never reaches zero. Experience suggests that <italic>R</italic> reduces to around 0.2 for highly loaded rough surface contacts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0954409712460986">7</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="sec3-0954409712460986"><title>Modelling approach</title>
<p>A convenient method for determining the ideal position for an ultrasonic transducer is to use ray-tracing software. Ray-tracing is achieved by finding the intersection points of the rays and the solid bodies. Intersection points are kept or discarded according to the logical relationship between the combined objects. The software models the propagation of ultrasonic waves and internal reflections at any number of interfaces within a solid structure. The transducer is modelled as a source and the signal amplitude at any location in the structure can be determined.</p>
<p>Diffraction and scattering in reality will result in a reduction of amplitude of the reflected signal; however, it does not affect the bulk ultrasonic wave paths, especially in the high-quality materials in question. If one was to investigate a rough cast iron or similar materials with irregular material structures, one might benefit from including this information in the simulation. The ray-tracing works using Snells law and geometry. It is a powerful tool that can be used to not only find the optimum sensor position, as in this case, but also to predict complex ultrasonic phenomena such as the change in frequency content at an interface.</p>
<p>In this work, the geometries of the wheel and rail were created and exported into the software (in this case Imagine3D (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.imaginefa.com/">http://www.imaginefa.com/</ext-link> for further details of the software)).. They were extruded (for rail) and revolved (for wheel) as a solid to generate the three-dimensional solid bodies for the simulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954409712460986">Figure 1</xref>).
<fig id="fig1-0954409712460986" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Solid-body model of the wheel and rail used in the ray-tracing software.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954409712460986-fig1.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p>Once the geometry was created, a longitudinal mode transducer was specified and located on the wheel body. The concept was to use the same transducer to both send and receive ultrasonic signals (pulse–echo mode). The software predicted the ray path within the wheel and the signal reflected back to the transducer or transmitted through the interface with the rail component. The transducer design and location was then modified to investigate the response and spatial resolution.</p>
<p>The location of the ultrasonic transducer is critical in determining whether it can ‘see’ the occurrence of flange contact. The sensor must also be located in a position on the wheel so that it is both accessible and easy to install. The first series of simulations were performed to determine the optimum location and orientation of the transducer. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954409712460986">Figure 2</xref> shows the sensor ray passage for two positions of the transducer. Position (a) is the best since part of the wave has been reflected back from the flange contact. At position (b) the reflection was oblique and so the received signal is virtually zero.
<fig id="fig2-0954409712460986" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Ray-tracing results for two transducer positions (the waveform above each plot indicates the magnitude of the reflected signal).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954409712460986-fig2.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p>Once the optimum transducer position was selected (an angle of 47° and a height above the contact point of 21 mm) a suitable mounting point for the sensor was machined on the wheel specimen used in the experiments.</p>
<p>The greater the width of the contact, the more of the sound wave will strike a solid–solid interface and be transmitted. A further series of simulations were carried out (from no contact to complete contact) to observe the change in the reflected pulses and the reflection coefficient. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954409712460986">Figure 3</xref> shows the results. As the width of the contact, <italic>b</italic>, was increased to more than 6 mm, it became enough to let all the pulses pass through the surface. The reflection coefficient remained constant at a value of 0.17. This corresponds to a value consistent with a rough surface contact. It should be noted that the ray-tracing software is not a contact model. ‘Contact’ is achieved by simply overlapping the bodies in the software.

<p>The wheel and rail specimens used in the experimental work were cut from sections of UIC 60 900A rail steel and R8T wheel steel (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954409712460986">Figure 4</xref>). A frame and two hydraulic cylinders, shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954409712460986">Figure 5</xref>, were used to normally and tangentially load the specimens together.
<fig id="fig4-0954409712460986" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>Test samples cut from wheel and rail sections (note the slice was made on the wheel periphery at an angle of 47°).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954409712460986-fig4.tif"/>

</fig></p>
<p>Normal loads, varying from 0 to 80 kN in the vertical direction, were applied using an Enerpac hydraulic cylinder which was located below the wheel/rail specimens. Another hydraulic cylinder was used to generate lateral loads from 0 to 9 kN in the horizontal direction. As the wheel/rail components had no constraint in the horizontal direction, a lateral load would cause relative sliding between wheel and rail. A large enough normal load must be applied to prevent this sliding.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0954409712460986">Figure 6</xref> shows a sketch of the experimental layout. The instrumentation consisted of an ultrasonic pulse receiver (UPR); a bespoke device manufactured by NDT solutions, a 500 MHz LeCroy ‘Waverunner’ oscilloscope with a capture speed of 500 M samples/s, a Windows-based data processing computer and a 2.25 MHz longitudinal contact transducer with a 0.375″ element manufactured by FDU Gamma Aerotec, serial number H02886. The UPR provided a voltage step which excited the transducer to produce an ultrasonic pulse. The signals reflected at the wheel/rail interface were received by the same transducer passed to the UPR and amplified. The oscilloscope was used to digitize the received signal and download it to the computer. LabView was used to control the UPR and extract the reflection from the wheel/rail for further processing.
<fig id="fig6-0954409712460986" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p>Schematic of the experimental system.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954409712460986-fig6.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p>First, a reference amplitude was measured for the situation in which the wheel and rail were out of contact. In this case the ultrasound was reflected from the steel/air interface so <italic>R</italic> had a value of approximately one (not all the ultrasound was received due to the slight curvature of the surface) and most of the wave amplitude was reflected. The reference reflected signal was then equal to the incident signal. Subsequently measured reflections were divided by this reference signal to obtain the reflection coefficient. The reflection coefficient amplitude was recorded. In practice it is easier to pass the time domain pulse through a fast Fourier transform to obtain a reflection coefficient spectrum. The amplitude can be easily obtained from the peak of this spectrum.</p>
<p>Normal and lateral loads were applied in sequence and for each load case the reflected signal was recorded and the reflection coefficient amplitude determined. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0954409712460986">Figure 7</xref> shows a series of reflected pulses as the normal load was increased. The transducer has a centre frequency of 2.2 MHz (used to reduce the effect of attenuation apparent with a 5 MHz transducer) and a band width of between 1.1 and 3.4 MHz.

<p>The reflection coefficient was obtained by recording the amplitude at the transducer centre frequency (2.2 MHz) and dividing by the amplitude for the zero-load case. This data is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0954409712460986">Figure 8</xref> for increasing the normal load on the specimens.

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0954409712460986">Figure 9</xref> shows the results when a lateral load is applied in steps when the normal load is 80 kN. As the lateral load is increased the flange contact gets larger and the reflection coefficient reduces.

<sec id="sec6-0954409712460986" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title>
<p>The map of reflection coefficients in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0954409712460986">Figure 10</xref> clearly shows that reflection is sensitive to both normal and lateral loads; thus, it may therefore be feasible to detect the onset of flange contact using this ultrasonic approach. However, there are many issues that would need to be resolved and as such at the moment it will probably have to remain a tool that is used mainly in research/testing within a laboratory rather than something that is transferred to the field. Some of the hurdles to implementation are discussed below as the performance of the technique is evaluated and then a first step to using the technique is suggested.</p>
<p>The practical implementation of a sensing system of this kind in the field would be difficult in terms of actually mounting the unit and then feeding back the data. The sensors are relatively robust and can be permanently glued in place and should be able to withstand the aggressive environment. Either a small hole would be drilled into the wheel side, or it could also be possible to bond a small boss (at the correct angle) onto the wheel. Connecting wires must then be fed back through slip rings to an on-board pulser receiver and data capture unit. Another possibility would be to have a small ultrasonic pulser (similar to that built into ultrasonic flow meters and level sensors) mounted directly on the wheel which uses telemetry to send the post-processed signal back to an on-board receiver.</p>
<p>It is envisaged that the transducer would be continuously pulsed during wheel rotation. This means that only when the sensor is over the contact location would a change in the recorded signal be observed. Typically, using conventional ultrasonic equipment, pulsing can be achieved at a repetition rate of 20 kHz. Therefore, signals can be recorded at intervals of 50 μs. It is likely, therefore, that depending on the contact patch size and the train speed, that between five and 10 signals could be recorded from a contact patch as the sensor location on the wheel passes overhead. Then a full revolution must be completed before signals are recorded again. This means that only flange contact events that exist for more than one revolution can be picked up by a single sensor on the wheel periphery. Flange contact would actually be intermittent in one wheel revolution.</p>
<p>One advantage is that the sensor is effectively self-referencing. This is because for much of its operation the wheel and rail are out of contact. This means that the signal is reflected back from the steel/air interface. Since all subsequent signals are referenced to this signal any changes in the transducer output with say, for example, temperature or bond degradation are cancelled out.</p>
<p>With a single sensor it would be difficult to separate the increased reflection caused by a either a change in normal load or a change in lateral load so the technique as outlined here would rely on the normal load remaining constant, which of course, particularly in curving, it certainly does not. The location of the sensor is also critical to what region of contact across the flange that can be observed. This paper has simply considered contact between the rail shoulder and the throat of the wheel flange. When the wheel mounts the rail so that the contact occurs on the tip of the flange then the sensor, in its current location, may not be able to observe this region. Also, there could be more than one contact. Possibly more than one sensor is needed; this is an area for further study. Work has been initiated to study the wheel tread/rail head contact using ultrasonic arrays.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0954409712460986">12</xref></sup> This may help provide a solution to the problem of seeing more of the flange contact as well as dealing with varying loads. Better still, transducers could be attached (they can be simply glued on) at specified locations to cover the region of interest (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0954409712460986">Figure 11</xref>). This gives greater flexibility than a standard array which has a fixed area.
<fig id="fig11-0954409712460986" position="float"><label>Figure 11.</label><caption><p>Possible transducer configurations.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954409712460986-fig11.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p>The transducers could be powered by a small low-weight signal conditioning box that is also wheel-mounted. The conditioning box would generate the ultrasonic pulse and receive reflections; this data would then be sent via an RFID output. A receiver and a status monitor would be mounted somewhere inside the train. The transducers would be pulsed continuously and for most of the time receive a fully reflected pulse (i.e. air gap as there is no flange contact), only when flange contact occurs would the pulse amplitude reduce. Digital gates could be set to identify pulses that are associated with a flange contact. As the flange contact develops, the different transducers would be able to locate the position of the wheel and the severity of loading.</p>
<p>There are potentially implications from third-body interfaces between wheel and rail such as curve grease or top of rail friction modifier. This can be dealt with and in fact work has been carried out recently on wheel axle/hub interference fits that involved the presence of a lubricating wax.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0954409712460986">13</xref></sup> The issue would be actually accounting for this as it changes along a length of track.</p>
<p>It is also worth noting that it would also be possible to use the ultrasonic sensor to detect wear of the wheel contact face. The time for the pulse to travel from the sensor to the interface and back is readily available from the reflected signal. As the wheel wears the path length will reduce and the time of flight decrease. It is a simple matter to convert this reduced time of flight to a wear measurement. Estimates of worn depth accurate to tens of microns should be quite feasible. Severe wear would, however, affect the profile such that the reflection of ultrasound would alter significantly.</p>
<p>One immediate step that could be taken with the technology is to mount it on a full-scale wheel rail testing rig (see, for example, Stock et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0954409712460986">14</xref></sup> where the wheel rolls for a fixed linear distance down a piece of rail (not achieving a full rotation normally) before returning to the start to begin a new cycle). This would allow loads to be fixed, slower operating speeds to be used, angle of attack to be controlled, etc. so a full parametric study could be carried out and the influence of third-body materials could be assessed as well.</p>

<p>This study has demonstrated that it is possible to detect flange contact using an ultrasonic sensor mounted on the wheel. A modelling approach, using ultrasonic ray-tracing software, was used to determine the best location for the sensors. This sensor location was used in the design of some simple specimens that were cut from sections of wheel and rail. The specimens were subjected to combined normal and lateral loading and the sensor response monitored.</p>
<p>The ultrasonic signal was processed into a reflection coefficient. The value of this coefficient varied between one and 0.68 as the normal load was applied up to 80 kN. As the contact area grew larger more of the ultrasound was transmitted and so less was reflected. When the lateral load was increased from zero to 9 kN, the flange contact grew and the coefficient value dropped from 0.68 to 0.635.</p>
<p>The proposed approach has so far only been carried out on static specimens in a hydraulic press. It is potentially feasible to extend this to a full-scale wheel/rail rig and use continuous pulsing to ensure that the contact is captured as the sensor passes over the rail. Full implementation in the field is probably not possible at the moment, but a lot could be learned in laboratory tests.</p>
