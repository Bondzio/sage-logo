<abstract>
<p>Little evidence is available about nurses’ use of electronic tools during handoffs. This qualitative study explored information management and use of electronic tools during nursing handoffs. The sample included 93 handoffs by 26 nurses on 5 medical/surgical units in 2 western hospitals with a robust electronic health record (EHR). Data collection included audiotaping handoffs, semi-structured interviews, observations, and fieldnotes. The dataset was inductively coded into 33 categories and 5 themes: good nurse expectations for handoffs, paper forms are best, information at a glance, only pertinent information please, and information tools that work. Two-thirds of the nurses abandoned use of the leadership-endorsed electronic handoff form, preferring personal paper forms. The findings suggest effective electronic solutions will require extensive contextually-based information, information integrated across EHR modules and portable, electronic support throughout shifts. This is a call to action for leaders and informaticists as they select and design future electronic tools.</p>

<p>Despite the crucial nature of patient care handoffs, surprisingly little is known about this activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0193945911407089">Dracup &amp; Morris, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0193945911407089">Riesenberg, Leitzsch, &amp; Cunningham, 2010</xref>). The term <italic>handoff</italic> implies formal transfer of role and responsibility for a patient’s care from one provider to another (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0193945911407089">Solet, Norvell, Rutan, &amp; Frankel, 2005</xref>). Nursing handoffs on medical and surgical units—most commonly in the form of change-of-shift reports—are complex, cognitively intense activities where nurses synthesize and communicate pertinent information across patients using multiple information sources and tools. Electronic health records (EHRs) have the potential to improve this synthesis and communication. The World Health Organization (WHO) and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0193945911407089">Leape &amp; Berwick, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0193945911407089">Strople &amp; Ottani, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0193945911407089">WHO, 2007</xref>) promote the use of information technology to improve communication in health care. Yet, little research is available about information technology use during nursing handoffs. The first author found in previous research that medical and surgical nurses did not use any information tools during handoffs despite having EHRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0193945911407089">Staggers &amp; Jennings, 2009</xref>). Do nurses with access to robust EHRs use them during handoffs? If not, why not? How do nurses manage information before and during handoffs on medical and surgical units with EHRs?</p>
<sec id="section1-0193945911407089">
<title>Previous Research on Nursing Handoffs</title>
<p>Various terms are used in the literature for the communication event during patient care transitions: <italic>handover, handoff, shift report, intershift report</italic>, and <italic>change of shift report</italic>. No matter the term, the research on nursing handoffs is less robust than one would expect given its frequent occurrence in acute care facilities worldwide. In an early study of handoffs, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0193945911407089">Wolf (1989)</xref> completed an ethnography, deeming handoffs a ritual replete with “professional jargon.” Others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0193945911407089">Staggers &amp; Jennings, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0193945911407089">Wolf, 1989</xref>) noted the informal, unstructured nature of handoffs, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0193945911407089">Lange (1992)</xref> found that information exchanged on four medical-surgical units was not sufficient for nurses to move directly from a handoff to patient care. Nurses had to find missing data on medications (34%), physicians’ orders (18%), and laboratory data (10%). In one of the more common areas of study on the topic, researchers found that nursing handoffs can serve multiple purposes including, at least, information processing, cultural, social, emotional, and organizational (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0193945911407089">Kerr, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0193945911407089">Patterson &amp; Wears, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0193945911407089">Philpin, 2006</xref>) communication of group values and provision of a safe haven for complaints and jokes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0193945911407089">Wolf, 1989</xref>). However, the crux of handoffs in acute care remains the communication of salient, accurate information about patients and their care needs.</p>
<p>The majority of past research concentrated on nurses’ perceptions about handoffs. European and Canadian nurses were dissatisfied with handoffs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0193945911407089">Meissner et al., 2007</xref>). Nurses perceived new methods of handoffs positively—whether relatively simple in a written form or more complex, such as a computerized physician sign-off form accessed by nurses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0193945911407089">Baldwin &amp; McGinnis, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0193945911407089">Berkenstadt et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0193945911407089">Bolanos, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0193945911407089">Brown Lazzara, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0193945911407089">Fraser, O’Brien, Tobar, &amp; Waller, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0193945911407089">Kalisch et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0193945911407089">Shendell-Falik, Feinson, &amp; Mohr, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0193945911407089">Sidlow &amp; Katz-Sidlow, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0193945911407089">Wilson, 2007</xref>). Authors of a systematic review determined that anecdotal reports exist about best practices for handoffs report, but evidence supporting these claims is absent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0193945911407089">Riesenberg et al., 2010</xref>). Others recently described perceived barriers and facilitators to nursing handoffs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0193945911407089">Welch, Flanagan, &amp; Ebright, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Changes in traditional handoff structures and processes were associated with improvement in time efficiencies, report content, and compliance with quality improvement methods. The most common finding across studies was improved time efficiencies. New manual handoff methods reduced shift report time or prevented time delays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0193945911407089">C. D. Anderson &amp; Mangino, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0193945911407089">Baldwin &amp; McGinnis, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0193945911407089">Bosek &amp; Fugate, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0193945911407089">Brown Lazzara, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0193945911407089">Mikos, 2007</xref>). Other authors found improvements in the content, accuracy, or compliance with quality improvement measures using various handoff methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0193945911407089">Barbera, Conley, &amp; Postell, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0193945911407089">Brown Lazzara, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0193945911407089">Dowding, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0193945911407089">Fraser et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0193945911407089">Lamond, 2000</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0193945911407089">Staggers and Jennings (2009)</xref> found no differences in handoff content across audiotaped, bedside, and three types of verbal reports, and researchers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0193945911407089">Arnold et al., 2006</xref>) found no differences on communication quality and patient safety measures after a classroom intervention using the Situation, Background, Assessment, Recommendation (SBAR) format proposed by the Joint Commission. Certainly, these types of outcomes—accuracy, content, and quality measures—are most critical in assessing the effectiveness of new handoff methods, but they are less commonly included as outcome variables.</p>
<p>Computerized tools for handoffs are available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0193945911407089">J. Anderson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0193945911407089">Apker et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0193945911407089">Flanagan, Patterson, Frankel, &amp; Doebbeling, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0193945911407089">Joy et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0193945911407089">Raines &amp; Mull, 2007</xref>). However, current literature focuses nearly exclusively on physician handoffs. Only two studies described computerized handoff tools for nurses. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0193945911407089">Kalisch et al. (2007)</xref> noted positive nurse perceptions about a custom-computerized handoff tool. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0193945911407089">Nelson and Massey (2010)</xref> described a quality improvement effort resulting in a generic electronic template not integrated with an EHR.</p>

<sec id="section2-0193945911407089">
<title>Purpose</title>
<p>Handoffs in general and increased work complexity specifically can interfere with patient safety on medical and surgical units (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0193945911407089">Ebright, Patterson, Chalko, &amp; Render, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0193945911407089">Potter et al., 2005</xref>). Technology-enabled work is purported to reduce errors, but how nurses manage information using technology during handoffs is understudied. To that end, we conducted an exploratory study to examine nurses’ information management before and during handoffs on medical-surgical units in settings with computerized provider order entry (CPOE) and electronic nursing documentation in place. The findings from this study will inform future electronic designs to reduce errors and enhance medical and surgical patient safety.</p>

<title>Study Design and Setting</title>
<p>This qualitative, interpretive descriptive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0193945911407089">Thorne, 2008</xref>) study was conducted in a tertiary care facility and a cancer specialty hospital in the Western United States. Interviews with nurses and observations of patient handoffs were collected from the five medical and surgical units in the 425-bed tertiary care facility (two surgical and one medical) and a 50-bed cancer hospital (one surgical and one medical). Jointly, these institutions employ more than 1,700 registered nurses (RNs) who use the existing EHR. The population of medical and surgical nurses on the five units of interest was approximately 420 nurses. Appropriate approvals were obtained from the institutional review board as well as from the chief nursing officers and the unit nurse managers.</p>
<p>The institutions shared a vendor EHR at Stage 4 of seven of the Health Information Management and Systems Society Electronic Medical Record Adoption Model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0193945911407089">HIMSS Analytics, 2010</xref>). At this stage, EHR functions are founded on a clinical data repository as well as integrated ancillary functions across the laboratory, radiology, and pharmacy. The facility progresses from viewing test results to CPOE and having available clinical protocols. Future stages beyond Stage 4 include physician documentation and closed loop medication administration (order entry through medication administration via bar coding). Actual available functions included CPOE, nursing documentation, an electronic medication administration record, results review and a picture archiving, and communication system initially installed in 2009, 2007, 2001, and the late 1990s, respectively. A patient summary form for handoffs was a component of the 2009 installations. Data collection occurred after the handoff form and CPOE were installed for 9 months.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0193945911407089">
<title>Sample</title>
<p>A purposive sampling technique was used to select nurses across levels of expertise, shifts, length of shifts, patient care units, and type of nurse (permanent staff, agency, and per diem). Nurses with less than 6 months of nursing experience were excluded from the study. Nurses were recruited using several methods after the researchers obtained approval for the study from the two hospital chief nurses. The researchers met in person with the five unit nurse managers to describe the study and sampling methods. Then, each nurse manager provided email addresses for a list of potential participants from her unit. The researchers contacted the nurses via email and then met with participants in person to describe the study and obtain consent.</p>
<p>The primary source of data was from direct observation and audiorecording of nurses engaged in 93 unique patient handoffs on 25 different handoff occasions on the five different units from October to November 2009. Nurses giving (vs. receiving) a handoff report were selected for observation and interview data collection. These nurses needed to synthesize material across various patients and tools to prepare and communicate shift report. The cognitive tasks of nurses giving and receiving a handoff are distinct; therefore, the researchers focused only on nurses giving a handoff. Nurses worked in 8- and 12-hr shifts; data were collected equally across nurse expertise, units, and shift changes at 07:00, 15:00, 19:00, and 23:00 hr.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0193945911407089">
<title>Data Generation, Procedure, and Data Analysis</title>
<p>After nurses were consented, the investigators initiated four separate but complementary types of data collection. First, handoffs for nurses ending their shifts were audiorecorded. Second, each member of the research team recorded their observations in field notes throughout their time on the unit and during the patient handoff report. The field notes were integrated into the handoff report transcript. Third, a member of the research team audiotaped a debriefing interview with nurses giving report about their handoff practices and tools. Semistructured questions included, for example, “Describe how you prepare for report.” “What do you do to prepare to give report?” “What do you use to give report?” “Describe your report tool.” “What features of the EHR do you use during shift report?” “Which do you find helpful, not helpful?” and “What other tools do you use to prepare or give report?” Fourth, the investigators collected nurses’ handoff forms with their permission, blinding them of all identifiers immediately after they were received.</p>
<p>Audiorecordings of both the handoff report and the interviews with nurses after handoffs were transcribed verbatim by a professional transcriptionist, checked for accuracy by the investigators, and blinded to protect the identities of nurses, patients, and others. Transcripts from the handoff report and the nurse interviews were analyzed using a first cycle of descriptive coding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0193945911407089">Saldana, 2009</xref>) with Atlas ti<sup>™</sup> software version 6.1. Coding proceeded inductively, with segments of talk identified that pertained to the research questions and descriptive code words applied to index the topic. The research team coded 6 of the 25 documents jointly to develop consensus about the coding manual and definitions of codes. Thereafter, the research team members worked separately to apply codes to the transcripts, sharing coded data and interpretations of the data during team analysis meetings. Regular research team meetings were held to develop and refine data abstractions from codes to patterns and relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0193945911407089">Thorne, 2008</xref>). A series of team meetings were held to discuss the coding processes and understandings of the data set as a whole. Intercoder reliability was assessed for a sample of two separate transcripts coded independently by two different coders on the research team. As a result, definitions for several categories were honed, patterns reassessed across the interviews, and interrater reliability was deemed adequate. Second cycle, theoretical and axial coding strategies were applied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0193945911407089">Saldana, 2009</xref>) to identify categories and their properties. Coding was recursive, with analysis moving back and forth between transcripts, first-level and second-level coding.</p>
<p>A process-oriented approach to validity was attained through a variety of means (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0193945911407089">Cho &amp; Trent, 2006</xref>). Our research team consensus discussions offered a means of working through different investigator perceptions and memories of the research setting and meanings of the change-of-shift verbal and nonverbal data. Data generated from complementary strategies was systematically and inductively coded and abstracted to the categorical and then thematic levels. Prolonged engagement in the two hospitals, persistent observation of the change-of-shift phenomena by three different research team members, and assembly of thick descriptions of our fieldwork also supported the validity of our processes.</p>

<sec id="section7-0193945911407089" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>Observations and interviews involved 26 nurses who gave report on an average of 4 patients for a total of 93 patients. The sample consisted of 3 male and 23 female nurses. With an average age of 37, nurses’ modal educational level was a bachelor’s degree. Total nursing experience ranged from 6 months to 20 years with an average of 5.6 years. Nurses’ experience on their particular units ranged from 1 week to 9 years with an average of 3 years.</p>
<p>The average length of handoffs was 40 min, and the interviews lasted for an average of 15 to 30 min. Nurses on all units gave face-to-face, verbal handoffs as they sat by EHR computer terminals in the nurses’ station, a practice strongly encouraged by institutional leadership. Report occurred between two RNs, one giving and one receiving report; one session included an RN being precepted to the unit.</p>
<p>The combined data set was inductively coded into 33 categories and five themes: good nurse expectations, paper forms are best, information at a glance, only pertinent information please, and information tools that work. The themes are related in a patterned way (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0193945911407089">Figure 1</xref>) and represent the dimensions of the handoff, including expectations of the qualities of a successful handoff report, what information is needed, and how it is managed before and during a handoff.</p>
<fig id="fig1-0193945911407089" position="float">

<caption><p>The themes and relationships</p></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0193945911407089-fig1.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>Handoffs are embedded in a specific context (patient care unit) that defines the process of handoffs. That is, the unit context includes cultural aspects and values among nurses on the same patient care unit that defines the content of handoffs as well as each of the themes found in this study. Thus, context is related to good nurse expectations. Good nurse expectations influence the particular information deemed pertinent on the unit. Nurses access information tools to obtain pertinent information according to their contextual needs and nurse expectations. Information is then synthesized and organized into nurses’ handoff tools, primarily paper based. The information is continuously evaluated and updated during the shift as per the described cycle.</p>
<sec id="section8-0193945911407089">
<title>Good Nurse Expectations</title>
<p>Nurses expressed a need to adhere to expected values of what a “good nurse” should do to be prepared for shift report on this unit and spoke about expected information to communicate during a handoff.</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>Mostly, I review what I charted over the last 12 hr, look at the last set of vital signs, last set of I’s and O’s [intakes and outputs] just to make sure everything’s current, see if there are any new orders.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Nurses need to identify pertinent data such as low output on a surgical patient or a new order that would need to be addressed and communicated during the handoff. A shared expectation was that nurses would communicate major known events during a handoff such as pending surgery or planned discharges to help oncoming staff predict care needs. Of the information communicated, a shared “good nurse” value is to communicate only pertinent information for patients on this particular unit during a handoff (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0193945911407089">Figure 1</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0193945911407089">
<title>Only Pertinent Information Please</title>
<p>Pertinent information that nurses gather and expect to be presented at a patient handoff included contextual information, the plan of care, and current patient status. Contextual information includes basic demographic data (name, age, and room number), primary treating doctor/team and their contact information, other disciplinary services (e.g., pain service), history, diagnosis, and allergies. Plan of care information centers on major care events—nursing care, clinical events during the course of stay, and physician orders. One nurse stated, “Just things that you would need to pass on about your patient, like if they have thoracentesis today; they’re going have one tomorrow or things like that” These nuggets of information may include central line/intravenous line flushes, medications, or a last pain assessment. Current patient status provides the nurse with a summary about how the patient is at the moment and how the patient has progressed throughout the shift, for example, vital signs with trends, and fluid input and output. One nurse stated,</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>I want a 12-hr overview of their vital signs, I want a 12-hr overview of what they had for I’s and O’s so . . . . we can see if anything is trending up or trending down. . . I’s and O’s are big on this [surgical] floor.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Pertinent information is gathered and evaluated from several sources including information tools, the next phase in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0193945911407089">Figure 1</xref>.</p>

<p>At the beginning of their shifts, nurses printed a computerized handoff form—the Nursing Summary Report (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0193945911407089">Figure 2</xref>)—or created their own personalized, handwritten form (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0193945911407089">Figure 3</xref>). None of the nurses giving reports used the available EHR as their main source for information during handoffs despite the availability of an electronic handoff form. Nurses receiving reports would access pertinent modules to double-check information, such as intake and output, conveyed to them. The EHR was then only an adjunct to handoffs rather than being a central reference even though the electronic form was designed with nurse input. Devices were plentiful at the nursing stations on every unit and mobile workstations were available.</p>

<p>The leadership in the institution strongly encouraged nurses to use the Nursing Summary Report for handoffs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0193945911407089">Figure 2</xref>). However, the one-page report was controversial among nurses, and they defended the use of their paper forms. The electronic form arbitrarily truncated patients’ orders and lacked pertinent data, such as the patient’s history, physical findings, and pertinent aspects from progress notes. “We can print a report. I like to do that sometimes. But if we can’t get most of the information that we need on that piece of paper, we actually miss enough that it doesn’t make it worth it.” Another nurse mentioned that, especially when patients transfer from another department, orders no longer pertinent still print on the nursing summary,</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>I’m going to get a nurse summary report that is from, say, ICU [Intensive Care Unit] because it’s going to have all the ICU protocols on it still, all their stuff they’ve done, all their labs, so it’s going to fill my entire paper. I’m not doing that. I’m going to have my own sheet.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Nurses synthesized information with their personal paper tools they called their “brains” as described in the following section.</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>I like just the basics on my brain. And then I like to read all the extra stuff, and then I’ll write it, the significant stuff down if I feel it necessary. But it [the Nursing Summary Report] is just too busy. It’s just too much for me.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>The electronic report used an entire sheet of paper for each patient,</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>It’s bulky so you carry around tons of paperwork, especially if you have five patients. Let’s say each one of them has two pages so you’re carrying around 10 pages of information and you can’t stick it in your pocket.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>When asked whether they ever saw their paper forms being computerized, all but 2 of the 26 nurses immediately answered, “No.” Nurses felt that their handoff form needed to be portable and be quickly accessible, attributes they did not attribute to technology. They voiced the need to have a paper form to jot quick notes important to prevent information loss, especially because of inevitable interruptions. One nurse explained,</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>I think we’d still need to carry around something, just because we write so much down. Patients tell us something and we’ll write it down. Otherwise, I will forget it. I can walk out of a room and four people will talk to me before I cross the hall and get into the med room.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>The EHR patient summary report did not follow the requirements listed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0193945911407089">Figure 1</xref>—that information is related to context, good nurse expectations, and pertinent information only. The tool that was most succinct is next in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0193945911407089">Figure 1</xref> and described in the following section.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0193945911407089">
<title>Paper Forms are Best</title>
<p>All 26 nurses relied on a paper form they referred to as their “brains” to give verbal handoff reports instead of viewing the updated nursing summary report in the EHR. Nurses took notes on the paper form during report, carried it in their pocket, updated it throughout the shift, and then used the paper as their primary reference to give report to the nurse coming on shift (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0193945911407089">Figure 3</xref>).</p>
<p>Nurses spatially organized the paper as they planned care, often drawing a time line or grid for pertinent information such as laboratory results, medications, procedures, and activities due during the shift (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0193945911407089">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0193945911407089">3</xref>). Nurses would then cross items off their papers as they were completed and captured a running account of care rendered throughout the shift. They tailored the information individually. For instance, if they cared for a patient on a previous shift, they would omit information about the patient’s history and capture only the latest information.</p>
<p>Paper forms were central to organizing nurses’ work throughout the shift.</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>I do logon [to the EHR] and check [EHR information] often—but if I lose my paper, I’m pretty much lost. So, this is my main thing . . . This is the only way that I keep track of what I’m supposed to do—my paper.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>The available EHR was used only to double-check information during handoffs, never to guide the form or content of the handoff report.</p>
<p>Physically writing information helped nurses remember or encode the information. As one nurse indicated, “It helps cement it more up here [gestures to head] if you can write it down.” Another nurse mentioned, “Being able to kinda go through and scribble out . . . is part of the whole process for my thinking.”</p>
<p>Most of the nurses in the study (65%) used a personalized, hand-made paper form (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0193945911407089">Figure 3</xref>). The formats varied, including 3 × 5 inch index cards, 8.5 by 11 inch paper folded into quadrants, a preprinted slip of paper listing each major body system and a blank piece of paper. Nurses acknowledged that their format may not work for others but “This makes sense to me.” One nurse said, “I think we’re all unique and we all need different things, and different organizational type skills for them.”</p>
<p>Of the 35% of nurses who used the computer-generated Nursing Summary Report (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0193945911407089">Figure 2</xref>), all wrote additional information onto the form. Nurses who used the summary report commented that the benefit of the computerized form was that they did not have to copy basic demographics and orders, but other data needed to be added. “Sometimes they don’t have all of it on there, so I just have to fill it in.” One nurse used a paper form with a preprinted outline of body systems in addition to the nursing summary report. Despite the assertion from many nurses that their paper handoff forms were “unique” and designed just for them, suiting the way they think, spatial and content similarities existed across the forms. Across units, more nurses on a surgical transplant unit used the computerized form than on the other four units. Otherwise, its use was sporadic, and nurses on the medical units used the form least.</p>
<p>Nurses described their own formats. Experienced nurses had particular paper handoff structures they developed over many years and novice nurses identified the need for a handoff structure shortly after graduation. Expert nurses often continued to use their own structure; one nurse printed out the patient summary report and added it to a notebook with a collection of forms—the summary report, a personally developed form and one that included body systems.</p>
<p>The next theme in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0193945911407089">Figure 1</xref> is related to the use of paper forms, in that information is quickly and easily accessible.</p>

<title>Information at a Glance</title>
<p>Nurses’ spoke to quick information access “in one spot.” Because nurses tailor the content of the forms to the way they individually do work, near immediate information retrieval is possible. Nurses forego the need to log into the EHR and navigate through a series of screens to find the requested information. “I can quickly look at my paper and not have to go through everything on the computer.”</p>
<p>Nurses used their forms as a quick reference for patient data. One nurse commented,</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>And after you get report . . . you have four or five patients. You can’t remember everything. So right before I go in the room, I look at the paper. Okay, what do they have again? What wounds am I going to be looking at? . . . So it’s just a quick reference for me. I would never keep going to the computer and looking it up. It’s faster to have a piece of paper in front of you.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Nurses had other reference information in their pockets, such as phone numbers for the attending physicians or drug information. “I’ve got a cheat sheet for phone numbers that I would need for calling around the hospital or things that I want to remember about general nursing things, like how fast can I push this [drug].” One nurse carried the Davis Drug Guide<sup>™</sup> application installed on a Palm Pilot<sup>™</sup> ,“When I’m in a patient’s room, and they want to know what a drug is, what is in it, I can refer to it. I can look up the drug.”</p>
<p>Nurses used colored highlighters, techniques such as circling information to emphasize critical information. “Today I highlighted Leucovorin<sup>™</sup> because it’s a critical medication and has to be given on time. So I just highlighted that, just to remind myself, you’ve got to get there.” Nurses also highlighted information that they felt was crucial to remember to pass on to the next shift. They retrieved this information “at a glance.”</p>
<p>Combined, the findings indicate that nurses rely on tools other than the EHR to meet their cognitive support and work design needs during handoffs. Implications are discussed in the following section.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The five themes describe information management before and during handoffs in two settings with full CPOE and nursing documentation. These findings suggest areas for discussion: (a) cognitive support requirements for handoff tools, (b) cultural aspects of nurses’ handoff forms, and (c) the design of technology-supported handoffs.</p>
<sec id="section14-0193945911407089">
<title>Cognitive Support Requirements for Handoff Tools</title>
<p>The authors were surprised to discover nurses’ continued reliance on paper forms during handoff activities, despite the availability of robust electronic tools and leadership encouragement to use the electronic patient summary form. Nurses’ personalized paper forms provided necessary cognitive support for prioritizing nurses’ work, organizing tasks, encoding information, updating crucial information throughout the shift, and transmitting report to the next nurse using the paper form as a central reference. The paper forms were dynamic tools used throughout the shift. In fact, nurses felt lost during their shifts if they misplaced their paper handoff forms, referring to these forms as their brains to emphasize their critical importance. The forms represent synthesized information across information sources—tools, patients and other nurses’ communication tailored to this patient, this shift, this unit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0193945911407089">Staggers &amp; Jennings, 2009</xref>). This kind of synthesized information was unavailable from any other resource including the EHR. More than just a list of tasks, paper forms are a set of priorities, activities, alerts, cautions, and new information, creating a key, multipurpose tool. Despite the individual styles across nurses, internal consistency exists and nurses can describe their own formats. Consistency is a concept emphasized in system design theories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0193945911407089">Shneiderman, Plaisant, Cohen, &amp; Jacobs, 2010</xref>); it is paramount for predictability and quick information retrieval.</p>
<p>The notion of the critical nature of paper forms is in contrast to authors and organizations promulgating the use of technology in handoffs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0193945911407089">Leape &amp; Berwick, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0193945911407089">Matic, Davidson, Salamanson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0193945911407089">Strople &amp; Ottani, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0193945911407089">WHO, 2007</xref>). However, the results are consistent with the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0193945911407089">Stead and Lin (2009)</xref> as well as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0193945911407089">Hardey, Payne, and Coleman (2000)</xref>. Stead and Lin stated that even the premier EHRs do not provide necessary cognitive support to clinicians, in particular being able to obtain the overview of the patient. Hardey and colleagues noted the integral role that paper forms or “scraps” played for nurses. Readers might expect that this role evolved with computerization; however, the findings in this study are consistent with those of Hardey et al. even though their data were collected precomputerization. Recent reports indicate that U.S. EHR vendors are not yet employing standard usability principles and practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0193945911407089">Armijo, McDonnell, &amp; Werner, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0193945911407089">McDonnell, Werner, &amp; Wendell, 2010</xref>) that may have contributed to the less effective electronic patient summary report. Usability assessments could have uncovered the misfit of the summary report with nurses’ work.</p>

<sec id="section15-0193945911407089">
<title>Cultural Aspects of Nurses’ Handoff Forms</title>
<p>Nurses in this study claimed that nurses need their own styles for information to “make sense.” Cultural models specify community-wide organizing principles and actions. In this case, the shared cultural model of a paper handoff form formalizes shared, overlapping, and interlocking knowledge directing nursing actions toward culturally valued behaviors within a community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0193945911407089">Kronenfield, 2005</xref>). The content recorded on a paper form helps nurses formulate specific clinical judgments about choices and priorities for the day within the cultural model of nursing work valued on a particular unit. Paper handoff forms help nurses decide how to act, how to anticipate the actions of others, and how to modify actions in response to changing environmental considerations while maintaining a sense of overall purpose. In this sense, the paper form itself is not the cultural model of effective handoffs, but the illustration of the cultural model in a concrete and useful form. Informaticists should be aware of the cultural aspects fulfilled by current forms and how ingrained these forms are in nurses’ work. Only when electronic tools fulfill the same cultural function and utility as paper forms, will they be as acceptable.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-0193945911407089">
<title>Technology-Supported Handoffs</title>
<p>A main finding of the study is that the paper forms in this study are deeply embedded with contextual information about patients, units, and tasks across patients. Useful forms have “at a glance” information and cues to conform with “good nurse” handoff expectations of the specific unit. The available electronic handoff form, designed as a generic form for all medical-surgical nurses, did not meet nurses’ cognitive support requirements because it lacked these features. This particular vendor has sites worldwide and its templates are similar to other EHR vendors.</p>
<p>The mere presence of technology will not result in improvements in safety and productivity or even result in its use in practice. The findings from this study suggest that effective electronic solutions for handoffs will require contextually based information, information integrated across traditional EHR modules and portable, and electronic support throughout shifts. An EHR patient summary form is necessary but not sufficient to support nurses’ work. These detailed applications may be a challenge for health IT vendors and organizations because of the effort and maintenance required for multiple designs. However, the effort will be necessary to provide required cognitive support for nurses.</p>
<p>The ergonomics of a computerized tool will need to emulate the paper form in its portability and easy accessibility. A handoff tool, such as a mobile device, needs to be designed to support nurses’ work for entire shifts versus one communication event. Nurses’ work is riddled with the possibility of errors, and their need for these “at a glance” options could avoid “at a glance” mistakes because accessing an EHR does not allow for an instant information check.</p>
<p>The majority of nurses in this study claimed that paper forms should not be computerized. Reasons for this may be that the current summary reports in EHRs are too rigid. Prototypes of more flexible designs could positively impact this perception.</p>
<p>In addition to design considerations, cultural values of personalized handoffs and individual styles will need to be acknowledged and managed for safe, technology-supported handoffs. Paper forms are deeply embedded in nursing and unit culture. Nurses pride themselves on the unique styles, and even leadership mandates may not result in standardized, technology-supported handoffs as was seen here in the quiet return of paper.</p>
<p>This study investigated adult medical and surgical units in two hospitals. The study included only units with synchronous, verbal handoffs; therefore, the results may not generalize to other report methods. We recommend that researchers videotape handoffs in the future to capture the richness of information exchange and concomitant EHR screens. This study examined a patient summary report from only one vendor and one health information technology service supporting the two hospitals. However, this particular vendor supplies EHRs worldwide and the institution includes academic informatics programs.</p>
<p>Future researchers could identify other factors that might affect handoffs report, such as interruptions and nurse–patient ratios. The effect of the structure of nursing handoffs on actual patient care and safety measures could also be investigated to include determining omissions and gaps in information during shift report.</p>
<p>This study examined medical-surgical nurses’ information management during handoffs. The findings were in five themes: good nurse expectations, only pertinent information please, information at a glance, paper forms are best, and information tools that work. Nearly two thirds of nurses used personal, paper handoff forms instead of the available computerized nursing summary report highly supported by institutional leaders. Nurses indicated that their personally tailored paper forms were their lifelines during a shift. The EHR was used only by the nurse receiving report to double-check information such as intake and output. The existing patient summary report was too generic to be useful for nurses’ cognitive support during handoffs. It did not contain crucial, contextually based unit and patient information or organize information by logical clustering such as medications with pertinent vital signs or laboratory values.</p>
<p>These findings are a clear call to action for nurse informaticists and clinical leaders as they select EHRs and specify the requirements for electronic tools to support safe, effective, and efficient nursing handoffs. Nurses’ information needs are highly contextualized by unit and patient and span traditional EHR modules. Nurses require portable tools with immediate access throughout their shifts, and individual handoff forms are culturally embedded. Most important, clinical nurse input to the design of summary reports is crucial from the onset of customization to testing and deployment. Nurse input from different units is imperative. These design and cultural challenges could be the subject of future studies on this complex, interactive process critical to safe patient care.</p>
