<p>The psychological literature on collective memory and human rights violations is wide ranging and encompasses multiple nuances and interrelations. Research in this area deals with the links between memory and political repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0959353511415966">Castillo and Piper, 1998</xref>), trauma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0959353511415966">ILAS, 1991</xref>), identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0959353511415966">Piper and Montenegro, 2008</xref>), state policies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0959353511415966">Loveman and Lira, 2002</xref>), reconciliation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0959353511415966">Reyes, 2007</xref>) and memory and space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0959353511415966">Fernández, 2008</xref>), among others. However, in this field one type of relationship that has seldom been addressed by psychology in general, and by social psychology in particular, is that of memory and gender.</p>
<p>Psychology’s concern regarding this relationship has emerged outside the sphere of human rights, with an orientation toward the study of the specificity of the mechanisms of memory and the content of reminiscences in each gender. In closer proximity to the concern about the impact of violence are the investigations on traumatic memories related to experiences of sexual violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0959353511415966">Reavey and Brown, 2006</xref>). Some of psychology’s findings have been used to understand the memories of women’s experiences of repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0959353511415966">Jelin, 2002</xref>), as well as of sexual violence in situations of torture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0959353511415966">Gutiérrez, 2005</xref>). However, human rights psychology has not delved deeper into the relationship between memory and gender, at least not in the political context of dictatorships, in which human rights violations have been a State policy. The foregoing makes amends for the paucity of contributions from psychological literature to the construction of the memory of women’s struggles and resistance, and to the collective and public dimension of that memory.</p>
<p>Women historians are the ones who defend and argue in favor of the importance of historicizing women and their struggles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0959353511415966">Barrancos, 2005</xref>). It is this discipline that has taken charge of reconstructing the memories of those women who ‘crossed the threshold of domestic order and became involved ( … ) in the public sphere’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0959353511415966">Barrancos, 2005</xref>: 41). With regard to the construction and development of a feminist social psychology, this historical perspective must be assumed and articulated with questions appropriate to social psychology.</p>
<p>This article appropriates that challenge by analyzing one product of the materialization of Chilean women’s collective memory. We refer to the monument called <italic>Mujeres en la memoria</italic> (<italic>Women in memory</italic>), built by a women’s collective that defends memory after the Pinochet military dictatorship. This analysis will inquire into the effects of this monument within the gender system. We make a contribution to feminist theories and movements through the reflection on women’s struggle to defend human rights and memory, as well as through the analysis of one of its material expressions – the monument. To this end, the possible relationships between memory and gender will be addressed through the perspective of a critical constructionist social psychology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0959353511415966">Ibáñez and Iñiguez, 1997</xref>), thus contributing to the development of both social psychology and gender studies. Notions of post-structuralist feminism will be incorporated, specifically its critical posture vis-à-vis society, culture and science, ‘thus joining the search for the deconstruction or eradication of the category of “woman” as a category of universal identity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0959353511415966">Pujal, 2007</xref>: 28).</p>
<p>We also make a contribution to social psychology through a reflection on the relationship between memory and human rights. Memory will be understood as a collective construction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0959353511415966">Halbwachs, 1950</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0959353511415966">Middleton and Brown, 2005</xref>), a social practice that contributes to producing that which we call <italic>past</italic>. This will be analyzed in its performative dimension, problematizing its social and political effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0959353511415966">Piper, 2008</xref>). The articulation between collective memory and post feminism leads one to think of remembrance as a performative practice. Understanding ‘the performative’ as the reiteration of a norm or set of norms that, upon acquiring the condition of “act” in the present, conceals or disguises the conventions that it is reproducing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0959353511415966">Butler, 2002</xref>).</p>
<sec id="sec1-0959353511415966"><title>Memory, gender and social psychology</title>
<p>The limited development in the relationship between gender, memory and human rights violations has contributed to the construction of a stereotyped vision that refers to men struggling and women suffering, succeeding yet again in causing gender to disappear and become invisible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0959353511415966">Jelin, 2002</xref>). Within this naïve vision, masculinity is associated with resistance while femininity is associated with pain, mourning and concern for the persecuted other: father, husband or son. To avoid this conceptualization, history must be analyzed from a gender perspective. This allows us to see women as significant actors in the resistance to Pinochet’s dictatorship and in the struggle for the country’s democratization.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0959353511415966">Jelin (2002)</xref> shows the gender specificity of the practices and effects of political repression in the Southern Cone’s dictatorships. This would be explained by the differentiated position in the gender system, in which women suffer violence through the persecution of their men in addition to being direct victims of political repression. It is the role in which they are most often viewed: widows, daughters, mothers and grandmothers; and it is the position from which they articulate their principal struggles. Women organize around the figure of their repressed relative to denounce their disappearance, incarceration, torture or murder, leading human rights organizations from that position. Its gender character is also expressed and constructed in some of the icons and ritual activities of these organizations. In their public demonstrations of denouncement and memory, they carry placards with the photographs of their dead or disappeared relatives. This performance has been converted into a symbol of the defense of human rights and memory, a sign characteristic of human rights organizations.</p>
<p>These movements rendered visible what was denied, occupying the public space with their practices of denouncement and giving voice to those who were being silenced by the military regime. Their performances succeeded in becoming a symbol, first of the struggle against forced disappearance, and later of their memory. From a perspective of gender, a paradoxical effect of these movements may be seen: the women occupy the public space as active fighters who denounce and make evident that which the dominant sectors conceal and deny. Nevertheless, what is made visible is not their character as political subjects, as women who struggle, but rather their men who are persecuted in their capacity as political militants. The women appear as bearers of the other’s image which, when analyzed from the point of view of their effects on identity, contributes to the construction of a gender identity that is disconnected from their agency as political actors.</p>
<p>In Chile of the dictatorship, women denounced and resisted; subsequently, they defended memory, which becomes an essential part of social transformations. Firstly, this is because this is one of the principal ways in which women occupy the public space in the democracy that is being won. Secondly, because the women’s memories narrate the past from their own position in the gender system, introducing a point of view that is different from that of the men. Finally, upon creating memory, the women succeed in occupying a place in history that, as part of the gender system’s processes of domination, is usually hidden.</p>
<p>The hegemonic memories are those of men, whether their own or of the women who remember them. The reports stating disappearances or deaths fundamentally center on those who were mainly the direct victims, which in the Chilean cases are men. This is why the construction of memories that are proper to the women’s experience renders visible the complexity and diversity of a different experience.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec2-0959353511415966"><title>Monument to ‘women in memory’</title>
<p>During the Chilean post-dictatorship, multiple actions of reconstruction of the memory of those events, denied by official history, were carried out. Among them is the construction of memorials and monuments that are seen to inscribe the memory in public spaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0959353511415966">Piper et al., 2008</xref>). The majority are due to the initiatives of human rights groups that, as mentioned above, are mainly led by women. Nevertheless, they remain the expression of the narration of the masculine other’s experience. The existing memorials and monuments, through names or images, point to those who were disappeared, and executed detainees, among whom women are included. However, women’s presence is marginal. Masculinity exercises domination not merely in numerical terms but also in relation to masculinized languages,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0959353511415966">1</xref></sup> as well as to the principal figures that are remembered in these monuments. It is not that women are absent, but that their presence is minimized by masculine preponderance.</p>
<p>In this context, a group of women who were militants in human rights organizations created the <italic>Committee Pro-Monument to Women Victims of Repression</italic>. Its objective was the construction of a memorial (inaugurated in 2006; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0959353511415966">Figure 1</xref>) that would position the women who were direct victims of the dictatorship in the public sphere. The initiative sought to produce a rupture with the country’s logic of hegemonic memorialization, publically recording the history of women. The construction of the monument (the only one of its kind in Chile) is part of the broad-based movement of struggle by women to constitute themselves as political subjects, to achieve visibility and to occupy a place in the public sphere. We would argue, however, that the monument must be analyzed as an expression of the gender system (i.e. ‘a set of sexed social roles and system of thought or representation that culturally defines the masculine and the feminine and informs sexual identities’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0959353511415966">Thébaud, 1993</xref>: 14)).

<sec id="sec3-0959353511415966"><title>Memory as performance</title>
<p>We understand memory as a social process and product. That is, memory <italic>is made</italic> from and on the basis of social relations, and always <italic>in and from</italic> the present. Therefore, while memory speaks of the past, it is a <italic>past of the present</italic> – which implies that it is precarious and transformable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0959353511415966">Vázquez, 2001</xref>). Our memories reproduce the meanings of what has occurred and, at the same time, they have the power to transform the conditions that will (or will not) make new processes of signification possible. This is one of the qualities that give memory its power to break the limits established by the hegemonic versions of the past (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0959353511415966">Piper, 2008</xref>). It is in this sense that we propose to focus the study of these memories in the articulative and possibly transformative power of the <italic>performance</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0959353511415966">Butler, 2001a</xref>: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0959353511415966">2002</xref>). The idea of the <italic>performance of memory</italic> enables the comprehension of memorials and monuments as a set of reiterated actions constrained by certain norms, identity builders, in which there is a conflation (or rather, a blurring) of the limits between artificiality and the real. As performance, it is sustained by a specific context for its signification and functions as an historic and culturally codified system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0959353511415966">Taylor, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>In the construction of memorials and monuments, the repeated and ritual use of certain symbols, aesthetics and discourses helps to fix certain memories and often to separate them from the practices of power that produce them. What is reiterated is not an exceptional act, but rather a norm or a set of norms. For this reason we analyze the monument <italic>Mujeres en la memoria</italic> as <italic>performance</italic> of memory; that is, as a normative practice that promotes ideologies, affects, behaviors and subjects. At the same time it must be considered that, while the repetition of the norm institutes identities, it does not determine them, since in its <italic>mise-en-scène</italic> it generates deviations, transgressions and, therefore, transformation.</p>
<sec id="sec4-0959353511415966"><title>Analyzing the monument</title>
<p>Understanding the monument as <italic>performance</italic> of memory implies asking oneself not about its representation, but about the social realities that this practice promotes and, more specifically, the identities that it helps build. This implies analyzing the monument in a constant movement, from the elements that compose it toward its globalness, asking ourselves about the possible interpretations and the psychosocial effects they produce. We will refer below to three analytical dimensions: <italic>The Enunciative/Interpretative Dimension</italic>, <italic>Placement</italic> and <italic>Uses and Appropriations</italic>.</p>
<sec id="sec5-0959353511415966"><title>The enunciative/interpretative dimension</title>
<p>This refers to the message or meaning that the monument seeks to transmit, its symbols and aesthetics, as well as its possible interpretations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0959353511415966">Piper et al., 2008</xref>). Through the analysis of possible readings, we have centered on those that are most plausible, considering the enunciatory context and the historicity of the symbols used. It is not our intention to render an account of a supposedly <italic>true interpretation</italic> of the monument, but of one possible interpretation amongst others.</p>
<p>The analysis of the elements that comprise it makes it possible to distinguish three parts, as follows: a bluish-green glass wall drawn with vertical lines that are broken by transparent glass squares (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0959353511415966">Figure 1</xref>); the esplanade on which the wall is located, and a plaque (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0959353511415966">Figure 2</xref>) on which are etched the words <italic>Mujeres en la memoria</italic>. <italic>Monumento a las Mujeres Víctimas de la Represión Política</italic> (<italic>Monument to Women Victims of Political Repression</italic>)<italic>.</italic> Unlike most monuments, this one does not bear the names of those it remembers, nor the dates of the repression, nor images of any kind. The monument’s referentiality is abstract and seeks to make the women – disappeared and executed during the dictatorship – appear in a non-figurative manner. Two elements help enable this reading: on one hand, the plaque’s direct allusion to the homaged subject (women victims of political repression) and, on the other, the use of squares which constitute a social citation of photographs women have carried on placards in their practices of denunciation and commemoration, during and after the dictatorship (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0959353511415966">Figure 3</xref>).
<fig id="fig2-0959353511415966" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Esplanade on which the wall is located, and a plaque on which the words <italic>Women in Memory. Monument to Women Victims of Political Repression</italic> are etched.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0959353511415966-fig2.tif"/>
</fig>
<fig id="fig3-0959353511415966" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>Personal collection of Arpilleras by Isabel Margarita Morel. This group of Arpilleras is part of a chronology integrated by 54 pieces that Morel has entitled ‘Newspaper of fabric’. It deals with handicrafts created by women during the military dictatorship, referring both to their own and to the countries’ realities. Arpilleras are detailed and colorful hand-sewn pictures depicting lives and stories. Arpilleras originated in Peru and Chile and are elaborated through a traditional hand stitching technique that serves to communicate different kinds of stories, usually stories of pain, grief and injustice.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0959353511415966-fig3.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p>The transparent squares are a reiteration of the performance of resistance and memory by the women. They are a repetition of the use of the banner; at the same time they constitute a transformation of the sign. Firstly, they no longer evoke a specific individual, but a position of subject – the <italic>woman-victim</italic> – in an enunciation of the visage of all women, but of no one woman in particular. The transparent squares make it possible, finally, for whoever observes them, to see him/herself reflected in the glass, becoming a part of that collective subject. Secondly, the square does not just refer to the victim’s photograph, but also to those who bear (and continue bearing) the placards. Thus, the reference and homage are double and include two subjects: the woman-victim, and the woman-fighter.</p>
<p>The problem is that these keys of interpretation are not readily available to the passerby or visitor. Moreover, one can only understand that one is standing before a <italic>monument</italic> if one reads the information on the plaque. And that only speaks of women-<italic>victims</italic>, without even making reference to the women-<italic>fighters</italic>. Neither does it proffer any clues to the women’s identities – not their ages, political affiliation, or the historical period when they were persecuted. The plaque only makes reference to political repression, without specifying the historical context within which it was practiced. Thus, in spite of the fact that the monument seeks the visibilization of women-victims and fighters, the latter are left invisible as historical and political subject. Moreover, the monument does not offer the multiplicity of their positions, nor the heterogeneity of their experiences, political choices, tensions of aspirations – thus constructing a homogeneous woman-subject, without internal differences. The women are fixed in a position of subject, in which the sole visible signal is their character as victims of political repression, and thus their being remembered in this identity category.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec6-0959353511415966"><title>Placement</title>
<p>The monument’s placement is an important element to analyze in at least two respects. On one hand, it is the expression of two current policies of memory, as well as of the political force of the movement that manages the project. A monument built in a significant locus of the city that is visible and of easy access speaks of a State that confers importance to the memory that said action promotes. On the other hand, the accessible or inaccessible character of its placement enables or poses difficulties for its possible use and appropriation.</p>
<p>This monument is located in the intersection of two main arteries of Santiago, situating it in a central point of the city map. Nevertheless, it is constructed over a pedestrian esplanade that is difficult to access and offers poor visibility, reducing the likelihood of people finding it easily. The monument can only be made out by an observant eye and/or thanks to serendipity. Its placement makes it difficult to convert it into a significant urban landmark and keeps it hidden from the (casual) eyes of the city. Its placement thus contributes to the ongoing invisibility of the women’s struggle to materialize their memories. The contradiction in a placement that is at the same time central yet hidden and inaccessible is an expression of the Chilean post-dictatorship’s policies of remembrance. While these policies have been an important part of the government discourse, they have been translated into weak initiatives with limited visibility.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec7-0959353511415966"><title>Uses and appropriations</title>
<p>A third dimension to consider in the monument’s analysis is its use and appropriation as a place of memory. It is to the extent that the social actors, oriented by their own interpretations, remember in/with it, that it is charged with affects and meanings. The placement of the monument under analysis does not promote or facilitate its use as a space of commemoration. Moreover, recent research has shown that it is a place given scant use for remembering, and that it is not considered as being significant, neither by human rights groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0959353511415966">Piper, et al., 2008b</xref>), nor by the young people who usually pass through that area of the city. For them, the monument makes no allusion to women nor to their history. They merely consider it to be an artistic and cultural expression devoid of content, rather than an appeal for use as a commemorative space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0959353511415966">Juarez and Salanova, 2008</xref>).</p></sec></sec></sec>
<sec id="sec8-0959353511415966" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Memory is a field marked by conflict, in which versions of the past that legitimize or negate certain present and future values struggle with each other for predominance. Memorials and monuments are part of that conflict. This is why the analysis of these should consider the versions of the past that they promote, and the psychosocial effects of their material and aesthetic strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0959353511415966">Piper et al., 2008</xref>). The analysis in this article illustrates that the monument <italic>Mujeres en la memoria</italic>, as performance of memory, expresses and reproduces the gender system. What becomes naturalized is the relationship between public space and masculine gender, a venue in which men raise their own voice. Although the women are not absent in that space, their struggles have in fact allowed their appropriation – usually they occupy it by situating themselves under the shadow of the <italic>other</italic>. The <italic>Comité pro-monumento mujeres en la memoria</italic> seeks to subvert this relationship of domination by narrating their own history and rendering visible their own distress and struggles. However, the analysis carried out shows that the monument has the opposite effect: it renders invisible woman as political subject.</p>
<p>In today’s Chile, woman have made themselves part of the policies of memorialization, seeking to install their own version of the past. They have done so by joining in with the new social movements’ defense of identity. In this case, the articulating axis of identity for the members of these movements is that of being victims of political repression. The monument is a product and expression of these movements, which seeks its own space in the public sphere in order to commemorate its past. As the materialization of its memories, it constructs a social subject constituted by the crossing over of two positions: that of victim, and that of woman. The subject produced is homogeneous, as though all women-victims were equal in experiences, positions and political identities.</p>
<p>The monument operates as a production technology of the woman-victim subject; therefore its problematization presupposes the juxtaposition of the existence of a core identity for the subject, so as to reveal the political mechanisms that constitute it, and the rendering of strategic forms of power as intelligible. It is not a matter of negating its existence, or the pain it presupposes, but of showing how it is constituted by our current practices. The memories of the Chilean dictatorship have gone about transforming the protagonists of its political struggles into <italic>sufferers</italic>, and by this means have stripped them of their political strength. Their problematization would therefore have to be capable of locating them as social actors again (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0959353511415966">Piper, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>In this article we have illustrated that the monument not only does not fulfill its objective of making women’s struggles against the dictatorship visible; it moreover has the effect of contributing to the construction of an identity category that secures the gender system’s relations of domination. Nevertheless, and citing Judith Butler (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0959353511415966">2001b</xref>: 90), we would say that ‘this is not a reason for abandoning the struggle for recognition; it is merely a reason for understanding what may be considered as a legitimate and desirable scenario in order for this to happen. Recognition cannot lock us into a place if it will occur in a radical democratic policy’. A memorialization policy of this type should contribute to the <italic>mise-en-scène</italic> of multiple memories. Accordingly, in this new scenario women could be interpellated by a diversity of values and experiences of struggle.</p></sec>
