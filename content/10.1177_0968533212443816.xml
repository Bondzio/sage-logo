<p>Few academic law tomes are as moving and as readable as Professor Rachael Mulheron’s <italic>Medical Negligence: Non-Patient and Third Party Claims</italic>. This beautifully written analysis of the legal principles that govern the liability of healthcare professionals to non-patients and third parties is accessible and necessary reading for clinicians and lawyers alike. Currently, as a general rule, healthcare professionals do not owe a duty of care to non-patients and third parties. However, there are notable exceptions in both English and foreign precedents, which are analysed in the book. As the author observes, this is an expanding area of law that demands separate and detailed treatment; this work fulfils those objectives.</p>
<p>With topics ranging from injuries to non-patients caused by physically impaired or mentally ill patients to ‘Good Samaritan’ liability, all sections are illustrated by sufficiently tragic cases to fuel the film industry for decades. The author treats the emotive subject matter with understandable compassion, taking care to explain, for example, that the ‘Bad Samaritan’ is not necessarily motivated by <italic>mal fides</italic>. At the same time she maintains a rigorous approach to the law of tort.</p>
<p>The application of <italic>Caparo </italic>as the preferred test to establish duty of care to non-patients is established at the outset in an explanation so clear and well structured that a newcomer to law will receive a logical introduction to factors such as reasonable foreseeability of damage and requisite proximity between claimant and defendant that will be considered routinely in any non-patient claim.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0968533212443816">1</xref>
</sup> This is balanced with reference to the alternative methods for imposing a duty of care: ‘assumption of responsibility’ by the healthcare professional to the non-patient or whether the contested duty owed would be ‘incremental’ to successful outcomes in previous cases.</p>
<p>For those with an interest in comparative law, the author, whose career includes a period as a practising lawyer in Australia, infuses the volume with judicial outcomes from a variety of jurisdictions, which share English common law’s negligence-based liability. For example, the US case of <italic>Tarasoff </italic>is explored at length.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0968533212443816">2</xref>
</sup> It concerns an action by a female murder victim’s family that was permitted to proceed against the medical defendant and others who failed to warn or protect the victim despite knowledge of a mentally unstable student’s malicious intentions towards her. <italic>Tarasoff </italic>was the first American case to find that a healthcare professional owed a duty of care to protect a third party from a patient of unsound mind.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0968533212443816">3</xref>
</sup> Mulheron therefore uses it as a starting point to consider whether a similar finding in favour of the claimant could occur in English courts. It is contrasted with some unsuccessful English examples, such as <italic>Palmer v Tees HA</italic>,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0968533212443816">4</xref>
</sup> which concerns Rosie Palmer, who was assaulted and murdered despite the perpetrator having confided to a healthcare professional his proclivity to commit such a crime involving a child, and <italic>Osman v Ferguson</italic>.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0968533212443816">5</xref>
</sup> Notwithstanding distinguishing factors in US and English examples to date, the author concludes that the conservatism of English precedent suggests that a <italic>Tarasoff</italic> finding is still unlikely. She then examines the effects of the US decision, which has led to a proliferation of third-party claims.</p>
<p>The degree of comparison between jurisdictions varies between the chapters, with overseas opinion being more prevalent where there is a paucity of English judicial opinion; contraction or inheritance of disease from patients by non-patients being a prime example. Much of the work focuses therefore on <italic>potential </italic>claims. However, matters of direct contemporary relevance are included, such as the chapter on pure psychiatric injury claims by those associated with the patient. There is also reference to the effects of the European Convention on Human Rights, which was incorporated into English law by the Human Rights Act 1998, particularly as a last resort for wrongfully accused parents in neglect or abuse of children cases, for whom there is little, if any, scope for redress.</p>
<p>Although the English position is usefully summarised for healthcare professionals in the appendix, English and non-English case law blurs on first reading. A clearer demarcation in the body of the text would have been helpful. Indeed, English law is not always influenced by overseas opinion; ‘fear of the future’ claims being a case in point. Possible developments in English law, were they to be presented with cases similar to those decided in other jurisdictions, are supported with academic commentary. However, little is made of the difference between funding in the NHS of healthcare and litigation, and private insurance-based healthcare models in other jurisdictions. The reliance on and availability of legal aid in England, the scarcity and prudence of which has to some extent precluded development in this conservative area of law, is not examined but will influence the extent to which this area of law burgeons.</p>
<p>Instead, whether or not the current position represents good law is at the heart of the argument. Mulheron, who has played a prominent role in law reform in respect of class actions, is critical of confusion and inconsistency in English law, particularly in the context of recovery for pure psychiatric injury by non-patients. In this example the distinction between primary and secondary victims of negligent care is troublesome and difficult to apply, as recent decisions prove.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0968533212443816">6</xref>
</sup> The only remedy for this, the author argues, is for Parliament to introduce legislation. Yet, in 2007 the Department for Constitutional Affairs made known its reluctance to do so. By exposing the current complexities this book successfully expounds a case for change.</p>
<p>Much of this area of law is as yet uncharted in English courts. Nevertheless, as the book amply confirms, liability to third parties who suffer damage as a result of professional negligence can sometimes be held. Once a duty of care is found, further challenges lie in establishing that the professional caused damage to the claimant on account of a breach of that duty by failing to exercise an accepted standard of care, applying <italic>Bolam</italic>
<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0968533212443816">7</xref>
</sup> and <italic>Bolitho</italic>.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0968533212443816">8</xref>
</sup> Mulheron succeeds in drawing attention to the potential pitfalls and challenges that claimant lawyers may encounter when bringing a case in the future. This subject matter may also prompt clinicians and their professional colleges to better define standards of care beyond the needs of the patient, while balancing competing demands of confidentiality and trust. Perhaps Lord Diplock’s position in <italic>Sidaway </italic>that ‘a doctor’s duty of care . . . is owed to that patient and none other’ will thus in time be consigned to history.<sup>
