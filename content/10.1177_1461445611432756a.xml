<p>This volume provides a very useful and interesting introduction to how conversation analysis and ethnomethodological research (EM/CA) deliver outstanding insights into issues related to work and organization studies. It represents an interchange between organization and EM/CA research that has been long awaited since <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1461445611432756">Boden’s work (1994)</xref>. Moreover, the editors seek to break new ground in organization studies by engaging a particular ethnomethodological project, ‘one that draws heavily from conversation analysis’ (p. 24). Thus, all contributions offer detailed analysis of audio and video recordings of everyday work and organizational conduct. Through a comprehensive collection of theoretical and empirical chapters, they show how the ‘turn practice’ of organization theories, from which emanates a series of practice-based studies, makes room for the EM/CA approach as an approach in its own right.</p>
<p>The book is very well structured. The chapters can be read consecutively or individually. Thanks to a systematic presentation of the field and key concepts, the contributors offer a collection of studies of high quality that is very pleasant to read and can be recommended not only for new researchers and students of organizations and related disciplines, but also for more experienced researchers in the field.</p>
<p>The volume is divided into two parts. The first consists of two major introductory chapters by the editors and addresses important epistemological and methodological issues based on the contributors’ studies. The second part has eight chapters presenting analysis of real-life practices and written by prominent authors in the field. These illustrate concretely how analytical and methodological concepts from EM/CA can be applied in organization studies.</p>
<p>In the first chapter of the second part (Chapter 3) Potter and Hepburn investigate the subjective and objective sides of the organizational setting of a school board meeting. They show how subjective aspects (such as power, authority) are contingent and dependent upon the ongoing action, and they consider organizational structure and psychology as an interactional accomplishment.</p>
<p>In Chapter 4, Llewellyn looks into the ways that, during a recruitment interview, participants collaboratively accomplish the task of being an ‘interviewer’ and a ‘candidate’, while they orient to different ‘possibilities for supportive and fairly oppressive interventions’ (p. 95) related to the setting’s central premise. He then highlights different aspects of considering a participant’s, or in Garfinkel’s terms a member’s, situated knowledge (knowledge in practice and knowledge of practice) and the setting’s core features as they are informed by ethnomethodological studies.</p>
<p>In Chapter 5, Greatbatch and Clark focus on the situated production of stories. Criticizing the use of decontextualized transcripts for storytelling research in organizational studies, they propose an alternative approach based on conversation analysis. They show how linguistic and multimodal features of the interaction help the analyst to interpret in a more detailed and relevant way ‘the nature, the meaning and the significance of stories’ (p. 117).</p>
<p>In Chapter 6, Heath and Luff study sale practices in auctions. Their paper adds to a small but growing number of interactional studies concerned with ‘the ways in which institutional forms and structure emerge within and are sustained through social interaction’ (p. 139). Through their paper they contribute to the general body of thought in contemporary economics on economic behaviour and the constitution of economies.</p>
<p>In Chapter 7, Clark and Pinch explore in detail salespeople’s and shoppers’ pre-verbal bodily orientations; thereby they question traditional marketing studies on consumer conduct. They show that awareness of social and interactional organizing principles enables professionals to have a more effective encounter in terms of economics and organization needs.</p>
<p>Moore, Whalen and Gathman (Chapter 8) focus on the situated use of documents, such as work orders, that are considered as a dynamic resource for the ongoing action that participants can transform and manipulate within the flow of the ongoing action. They also show how the study of standardized forms can inform real practices in everyday activities.</p>
<p>In Chapter 9, Samra-Fredericks presents the interactional accomplishment of a strategic plan and brings together some recent developments in strategy work within organizational studies and ethnomethodology. She shows how situated and local practices configure not only the joint production of a document mobilizing more or less elusive conceptual phenomena, but also the collaborative accomplishment of participants’ identities and roles.</p>
<p>Finally, Hindmarsh (Chapter 10) explores the concept of communities of practice and questions the related notion of ‘peripheral members’. His paper shows how difficult it is to make a clear distinction between central and peripheral members within an interaction, since the peripheral members can participate, sometimes in a very subtle way, in the activity’s achievement.</p>
<p>This book provides a good road map for going beyond the separation between organization studies concerned about evaluability and control process, and EM/CA research focusing on ecological validity.</p>
<p>We could then wonder how EM/CA qualitative work, by bringing to light endogenous categories and processes that are relevant for participants themselves within the flow of the interaction, provides a set of conditions for quantitative analysis; this kind of work is still scarce (for an example, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1461445611432756">Mangione-Smith et al.’s (2006)</xref> study of doctor–patient interaction) but is worth exploring more. Indeed, quantitative work is a crucial issue for organization and management studies considering groups and institutions, especially as comparative analysis is often required for professional evaluation use (organization development and consolidation).</p>
<p>This volume tackles many cutting edge ideas that issue a challenge to future research to build upon, and that can lead us to a better understanding of a combined EM/CA practice-based theory and to methodological considerations regarding systematic observation and data collection.</p>
