<p>In recent years English readers have been treated to an increasing portion of translated material from Robert Spaemann’s corpus. And this, to be sure, has been greatly profitable for all privileged to be familiar with his work. Though this volume as a whole lacks a plainly stated thesis, each of the four essays included—composed separately but gathered together for publication under the original German title of <italic>Das Naturliche und das Vernunftige—</italic>it is not without a guiding question. ‘The question underpinning this book’, Spaemann makes plain, ‘is this: How should we conceive of nature in such a way so as to understand ourselves as natural beings without also at the same time “abolishing” ourselves?’ (p. xxiv). Rather than offering up a hard and fast answer to this question, however, Spaemann offers us a manner of <italic>approaching</italic> the fundamental questions of anthropological study—What constitutes personhood? What does it mean to say humans have a unique nature? Is there a latent teleology within our concepts of ‘the natural’? and so on. While this is not to say that Spaemann does not present either his views or arguments for them, it is simply to alert potential readers to the fact that Spaemann’s views come to us in the mode of philosophical <italic>counsel</italic>. His suggestion is not so much that the basic questions of theological anthropology are the wrong ones, but rather that they must be asked anew, and, in this new asking, they must be approached as the deeply moral questions that they are.</p>
<p>In this, Spaemann’s most enduring insight has to do with his claim that our attempts to venture answers to anthropological questions are shot through with a haste born of a basic dualism that he contends must be overcome. Either, as in the case of materialists like Dawkins, our humanity is explained by the (admittedly complex!) physical processes that determine human actions or, as in much of the Kantian inheritance and phenomenological tradition that followed it, what is most basic to our humanity is the manner in which it is constituted by an individuated gaze. Importantly, each side of this particular stalemate involves a reductionism that fails to pay sufficient attention to what Spaemann sees as our capacity for self-transcendence. ‘That the human being transcends himself’, Spaemann tells us, ‘is more than an afterthought’. ‘It means’, he continues, ‘that the essence of the acts that characterise the human as human are overlooked when they are understood “anthropologically”, that is, when they are understood merely as expressions of the agent’s generic way of being’ (p. 19). Spaemann’s view is that it is precisely this type of transcendence that renders human nature <italic>human</italic>. ‘Human nature’, he argues, ‘is defined by what it is <italic>not</italic>; that is, human nature is characterised by anticipation’ (p. 20). This is why, readers can assume, Spaemann concludes the preface of the book with the assertion that a suitable alternative title to the book is ‘The Pointlessness of the Question, What is a Human Being?’ (p. xxv).</p>
<p>This alternative title to the work is suggestive, insofar as it is not that Spaemann dismisses the notion of a particularly human type of being but, rather, that in characterising the question of ‘What is a Human Being?’ as <italic>pointless</italic>, it is our current narrow description of the <italic>what</italic> that is the cause of concern. What scientism brings us towards—as the able translators of the volume point out in their introduction—is a moment of paralysis in our intellectual and cultural debate concerning the status of human persons that, following Spaemann’s counsel, can only be overcome if and when we refuse easy reductionisms wherever and whenever we find them.</p>
<p>This means, therefore, that in his discussion of evolution Spaemann refuses to debate issues of the hard sciences, choosing instead to point out the ideological quality of ‘evolutionism’, which, as he sees it, promises more than scientific descriptions of human origins could ever deliver. Further, in his discussion of the relation of human dignity and human rights, Spaemann contributes to the ongoing debate concerning the <italic>basis</italic> of rights by providing an account of the origin of human dignity that simultaneously insists that it extends to all of humanity and is premised upon a theological understanding of God’s relation to human nature itself. ‘For one reason and one reason only human beings possess what we call “dignity”, Spaemann tells us, ‘because as moral beings they represent the Absolute’ (p. 60). And in the concluding essay on the relation of the ‘natural’ and the ‘rational’, Spaemann insists that what is natural to <italic>human</italic> beings is not material facts but the capacity for love, whether it be the perniciousness of <italic>amor concupiscentiae</italic> or the nobility of <italic>amor benevolentiae</italic>.</p>
<p>With this we can step back and ask the question of Spaemann’s relationship to theology, generally conceived. Some readers more interested in insights garnered from the likes of biblical authors, key Patristic figures, the Reformers, or even noted twentieth-century theologians than Spaemann’s favoured smattering of the Greeks, Kant, and twentieth-century critical theorists (with an occasional nod to Aquinas thrown in for good measure) may be put off by what appears at times to be a collection of influences whose relation to one another is not immediately obvious. Other readers may wish for something like the common practice of <italic>either</italic> a series of introductory paragraphs explaining just how the claims of each individual essay interrelate—‘in the first essay I argued X, which has paved the way for my discussion of Y, etc’—<italic>or</italic> a concluding chapter that ‘pulls it all together’, as the expression goes.</p>
<p>Yet Spaemann’s ardent resistance to this type of device and his eclectic use of influences are not the signs of an undisciplined mind, nor, in fact, an unnecessarily opaque style. Rather, the import of each of the individual essays on the topics of ‘Human Nature’, ‘Evolution’, ‘Human Dignity’, and ‘The Natural and the Rational’ becomes clear when they are taken as a whole. As the meditations of counsel that they are, the essays of this volume serve to refocus the theologian’s gaze insofar as they show some matters to be issues of serious concern and others as tedious, superficial, or unremarkable. In this act of clarification, wherein the trivial is obscured and the significant brought before the eyes, Spaemann has done us all a great service.</p>
