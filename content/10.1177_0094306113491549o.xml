<p>In <italic>The Jury and Democracy</italic>, John Gastil, E. Pierre Deess, Philip J. Weiser, and Cindy Simmons take their cue from Tocqueville and ask an important question: is the U.S. jury system “a quiet engine of democratic public engagement?” (p. 9). They note that jury service is akin to voting as a central feature of democratic societies—both are instances where citizens are asked to make decisions that have real consequences, guiding the movement of state and society and impacting the lives of members of their communities. To explore this question the authors take a dual track. They review the place of the citizen juror, and jury, in democratic theory and in relation to theories of civic engagement and deliberative democracy, arguing that the jury experience and jury system are in many ways a kind of inclusive and deliberative democratic decision-making process that could serve as a model for other realms of civic life. Second, they undertake an ambitious survey study of jury service, evaluating its impact on individuals’ sense of their political selves and their subsequent levels of civic engagement, including voting likelihood and participation in community groups, political action, public talk, and media consumption.</p>
<p>Much of the book seeks to interpret and explain what the authors frame as their central empirical finding: serving on a criminal trial jury that reaches a “conclusive deliberative experience” results in increased post-jury voting rates. A “conclusive” experience is defined as deliberation on a jury that reached a verdict (versus being an alternate juror, or jurors in incomplete trials or hung juries). In a sample of 1,395 jurors in Thurston County, Washington there was a statistically significant 9.6 percent increase in post-trial voting rates among such jurors compared to jurors who did not participate in conclusive juries but who had similar pre-trial voting rates. While seemingly small, the authors point out this increased rate of voting is similar to the 9 percent boost seen in face-to-face get-out-the-vote drives in nonpartisan elections, one of the most effective means of voter mobilization.</p>
<p>To further test the jury/voting connection, the authors assembled a national historical sample of 13,000 jurors from eight demographically diverse counties in eight different states. They collected data on the type of trial (civil, criminal, number of charges) and type of jury experience each individual had (verdict, hung, alternate), and for two-thirds of these jurors they were able to collect voting participation data for a roughly 10-year period from the mid-1990s to the mid-2000s including voting in the years before and after jury service. Here they found that for criminal trial jurors, if they had previously been infrequent voters and deliberated on a case to a verdict, this increased their voting rate by 4.3 percent after jury service. Additionally, those who served on hung juries experienced a 6.8 percent increase in voting. There were no significant voting effects for those who previously had high voting rates, or for jurors sitting on civil trials.</p>
<p>What do we make of this small but significant increase in voting participation associated with a deliberative experience on a criminal trial jury? The main argument of the book is that the experience of jury deliberation itself is for many a transformative event—citizens move from private life into a public role, engage in an often emotional deliberative process with their peers, and render a judgment with consequences for others and perhaps the larger community. In short, they emerge with a changed sense of their responsibility and capacities as citizens, and are likely to be more engaged members of their communities (as reflected in voting participation). The authors advance several reasons why increases in voting and other civic participation behaviors result from criminal versus civil trial jury experience: the former requires unanimous verdicts and the consequences of the jury decision are often severe—thus producing a more intense deliberative experience than in civil trials, which often hinge on more technical (e.g., financial or business law) arguments and require only a majority vote for a decision.</p>
<p>The bulk of the book delves deeper into understanding the jury experience from the point of view of jurors themselves, based on an in-depth longitudinal survey of 3,380 jurors in King County (Seattle), Washington. Contrary to popular perceptions of jury service as boring and something to be avoided, they find the large majority of jurors who sat on trials were quite engaged in the trial and jury experience, and came away with a positive assessment of the jury and court system. Many reported a stronger sense of civic responsibility connected with their jury service. The authors present detailed data on the quality of the deliberation process, and find that respectful, participatory, and thus more democratic forms of deliberation are associated with positive juror assessments of the experience as well as increased voting rates by jurors post-trial. They also find small but significant positive effects of a satisfying jury experience on increased engagement with public affairs media, public talk about community or political issues, and political action such as attending meetings or volunteering in a campaign.</p>
<p><italic>The Jury and Democracy</italic> is an ambitious book—it includes far more data, and suggestive arguments on the connections between the jury system, public engagement, and democracy than are possible to summarize here. It makes a strong argument for the jury as an archetype of civic engagement, one that reveals “the limitations of the voting-centric conception of democratic citizens and reveals the need for direct democratic processes to provide more institutional support for citizen deliberation” in the political processes of society (p. 191). It will be of interest to scholars of criminal justice and the sociology of law, as well as those more broadly concerned with civic engagement, the public sphere, and democratic theory.</p>
