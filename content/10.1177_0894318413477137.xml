<p>Feeling grateful is a universal human experience of health and quality of life. Feeling grateful is inherent in life experiences, cherished beliefs, and shifting relationships; it is inherent in being human. Over the centuries authors have written about their beliefs and musings about gratitude. In the more recent literature studies from various disciplines have contributed findings concerning gratitude, however this report is the first of a study on the phenomenon <italic>feeling grateful</italic> as a living experience from a human science perspective.</p>
<p>Usage of words in cultures are derived from ancient languages conveying significant meanings. Words like <italic>grateful</italic> and <italic>gratitude</italic>, which are culturally determined over time and are derived from the Latin word <italic>gratia</italic>, comes from the “Indo-European tradition and Sanskrit <italic>gurtih</italic> and <italic>gurath</italic>, [meaning] “praise”<italic>”</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0894318413477137">Visser, 2008</xref>, p. 168). Gratitude, a concept and a feeling initially unique to the Latin language, eventually became incorporated into other European languages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0894318413477137">Visser, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>The theoretical evolution of gratitude and gratefulness was found to be steeped in the essential constituents of a happy life. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0894318413477137">Smith (1759/2000)</xref> focused on the moral sentiments that unearthed gratitude, binding people together with the giving and receiving of benefits. Unlike <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0894318413477137">Seneca (1935)</xref> who viewed gratitude as a form of debt, and Aquinas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0894318413477137">Harpham, 2004</xref>) who saw gratitude as a debt to be reconciled, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0894318413477137">Hobbes (1651/1991)</xref> proffered gratitude as a societal necessity where people do things for others when they do not directly receive any benefit from their actions.</p>
<p>From the psychological literature, gratitude was described as a relational virtue, a quality of integrity that involved strong feelings toward others, and enhanced personal and relational well-being contributing to quality of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0894318413477137">Emmons &amp; Crumpler, 2000</xref>), a form of acknowledgment for original gifts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0894318413477137">van Kaam, 1972</xref>), and an emotional response for benefits received from good intentions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0894318413477137">Tsang, 2006</xref>). Gratitude was viewed as being distinct from obligation, indebtedness, and happiness, being preceded by the perception of benefitting from another’s generosity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0894318413477137">McCullough, Kimeldorf, &amp; Cohen, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Psychological research suggested that there is a growing relationship between gratitude and the thriving of a life fully lived (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0894318413477137">Peterson &amp; Seligman, 2004</xref>). Gratitude was found to be a predictor of the ability (moral emotion) to forgive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0894318413477137">Neto, 2007</xref>), a temporary emotional state that influenced individual growth and development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0894318413477137">Fredrickson, 2004</xref>), a way of seeing the larger context of ongoing relationships that open the world to new possibilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0894318413477137">Solomon, 2004</xref>), and was seen to mediate envy and anxiety, while an essential ingredient in the capacity of a person to build relationships with others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0894318413477137">Klein, 1957</xref>). Gratitude was described as private and public, personal and communal, extending beyond social convention providing personal life meaning and embracing life itself as a gift (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0894318413477137">Emmons &amp; Shelton, 2002</xref>). The more grateful persons were purported to be, the more satisfaction they reported with their lives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0894318413477137">Watkins, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>The medical literature is replete with comments and anecdotes stating that individuals were <italic>grateful</italic> for persons, events, places, or things, which enriched or added something of value to their lives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0894318413477137">Karlsson, Johansson, &amp; Lidell, 2005</xref>). Gratitude was one of the most commonly reported emotions, significantly and positively correlated with hope and removal of harm, associated with women’s responses to cancer following referral for genetic risk assessment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0894318413477137">Phelps, Bennett, &amp; Brain, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>In the nursing research literature gratitude was identified as an important phenomenon. Only one study was explicitly guided by a nursing framework, Watson’s theory, which uncovered gratitude as a component of suffering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0894318413477137">Wayman &amp; Gaydos, 2005</xref>). Other studies identified gratitude as: a descriptor for being alive and receiving help (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0894318413477137">Fridlund et al., 2000</xref>), a reflection of happiness and worry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0894318413477137">Häggström, Axelsson, &amp; Norberg, 1994</xref>), and a response to living with colorectal cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0894318413477137">Ramfelt, Severinsson, &amp; Lützén, 2002</xref>). Persons living with cognitive impairment spoke of feeling grateful for receiving their daughter’s care, while also feeling guilty for being a burden (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0894318413477137">Ward-Griffin, Bol, &amp; Oudshoorn, 2006</xref>). Gratitude with guilt, as reciprocation for support, and as a descriptor of survival were themes identified in both the nursing and medical literature.</p>
<p>Within the humanbecoming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0894318413477137">Parse, 2007</xref>) literature, no specific studies have been conducted to explore the living experience of feeling grateful. However, three studies did report that within the structure (phenomenological description) of the living experiences investigated, gratitude or grateful was part of the structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0894318413477137">Baumann, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0894318413477137">Cody, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0894318413477137">Mitchell, 1994</xref>). While <italic>gratitude</italic> surfaced in the structure of a Parse research method study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0894318413477137">Cody, 2000</xref>) and a descriptive exploratory study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0894318413477137">Baumann, 1994</xref>), and <italic>grateful</italic> in the structural definition of a van Kaam study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0894318413477137">Mitchell, 1994</xref>), no studies have been completed to date exploring the living experience of <italic>feeling grateful</italic>. Therefore, the living experience of <italic>feeling grateful</italic> is a phenomenon of research interest to nursing to discover its meaning to health and quality of life.</p>
<p>The meaning of <italic>feeling grateful</italic> for the researcher was captured in concept inventing with a synthetic definition that involved contemplation with living personal experiences, nursing practice in multiple settings, and with the arts, literature, media, and other artforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0894318413477137">Parse, 1997</xref>). This process surfaced three essences, which when synthesized created a unique definition of <italic>feeling grateful: Feeling grateful is buoyant appreciation with acknowledging the cherished in communion-aloneness</italic>. This definition was consistent with the humanbecoming school of thought (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0894318413477137">Parse, 1998</xref>) and guided the initial exploration of the phenomenon of interest.</p>

<title>Purpose and Significance of the Study</title>
<p>The purposes of this research study were to (a) discover and explicate the structure of the living experience of feeling grateful as a universal phenomenon; (b) to contribute to the advancement of nursing knowledge through a scientifically rigorous process by enhancing the theory of humanbecoming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0894318413477137">Parse, 2007</xref>); and (c) to add to the body of knowledge about the phenomenon of <italic>feeling grateful</italic>.</p>
<p>The findings of this Parse research method study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0894318413477137">1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0894318413477137">2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0894318413477137">2005</xref>) of <italic>feeling grateful</italic> enhanced knowledge in distinct ways. New knowledge generated from this study: (a) explicated unique ways of becoming related to feeling grateful, (b) enhanced understanding of ways of connecting with persons in practice, and (c) revealed phenomena for further research. The research question was: <italic>What is the structure of the living experience of feeling grateful</italic>?</p>

<title>Nursing Perspective</title>
<p>The humanbecoming school of thought (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0894318413477137">Parse, 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0894318413477137">2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0894318413477137">2010</xref>) was the theoretical foundation that guided this study. This theory is comprised of three principles that are underpinned by four postulates: illimitability, paradox, freedom, and mystery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0894318413477137">Parse, 2007</xref>). Parse defined <italic>illimitability</italic> as “indivisible unbounded knowing extended to infinity, the all-at-once remembering and prospecting with the moment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0894318413477137">Parse, 2007</xref>, p. 308). Illimitability connotes the vast plenitude of unlimited possibility with indivisible, unpredictable, everchanging humanuniverse. <italic>Paradox</italic> refers to “an intricate rhythm expressed as a pattern preference” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0894318413477137">Parse, 2007</xref>, p. 309). It is a distinct ebbing-flowing rhythmical tension of unique pattern preferences, cocreated in the moment, which connotes specific meaning. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0894318413477137">Parse (2007)</xref> defines <italic>freedom</italic> as “contextually construed liberation” (p. 309). Freedom is directly connected to choice and is inherent with humanuniverse openness and possibility. <italic>Mystery</italic> is defined as the “unexplainable, that which cannot be completely known unequivocally. It is a puzzlement, an impenetrable” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0894318413477137">Parse, 2007</xref>, p. 309). Mystery is the indivisible, unpredictable, everchanging human’s uniquely unfolding knowing in light of not knowing everything there is to know, as possibilities are shape-shifting with humanuniverse. These four postulates emerge with the phenomenon of study, <italic>feeling grateful</italic>.</p>
<p>The four humanbecoming postulates: illimitability, paradox, freedom, and mystery become visible with the phenomenon <italic>feeling grateful</italic>. The living experience of <italic>feeling grateful</italic> is a freely chosen way of being with the world, open to the illimitable possibilities for which a person may feel grateful. <italic>Feeling grateful</italic> is experienced as an indivisible, unpredictable, everchanging uniquely human paradoxical rhythmical pattern preference, which has mystery with meaning that is not completely known in the moment. The postulates emerge with the phenomenon <italic>feeling grateful</italic> and are fundamental truths that undergird the humanbecoming principles.</p>
<p>In light of the three humanbecoming principles, <italic>feeling grateful</italic> is a universal phenomenon and an everchanging experience living uniquely in the moment. The first principle states “structuring meaning is the imaging and valuing of languaging” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0894318413477137">Parse, 2010</xref>, p. 258). Feeling grateful is a freely chosen way to value something of importance with speech, silence, movement, and stillness. It is experienced explicitly-tacitly, reflectively-prereflectively and arises with cherished ideas, projects, and persons while moving on with hopes and dreams. In light of the second principle “configuring rhythmical patterns is the revealing-concealing and enabling-limiting of connecting-separating” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0894318413477137">Parse, 2010</xref>, p. 258), feeling grateful surfaces with the intimacy of affiliations as pattern preferences are disclosed-not disclosed, potentiating-restricting while attending-distancing with connections. Associated with the third principle “cotranscending with possibles is the powering and originating of transforming” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0894318413477137">Parse, 2010</xref>, p. 258), feeling grateful is the pushing-resisting with sureness-unsureness of coming to know the ground swell for which one feels grateful. Inherent in the tension is the risk for potential disregard when feeling grateful affirms or not the familiar–unfamiliar as a new perspective is birthed and comes to light. Feeling grateful, from the humanbecoming perspective, emerges as a pattern preference as meanings arise with the mystery of unbounded knowing.</p>

<title>Participant Selection and Protection of the Participants</title>
<p>The participants were 10 persons 18 years of age or older, literate in English, and recruited from the community. Following approval from a university human research ethics committee, prospective participants were approached by referral or directly by the researcher, read a plain language statement, and freely signed a consent form that fully disclosed the purpose, procedure, and intent of the study. Participants were informed that there were no known risks and that they could withdraw from the study at any time without prejudice. Participants agreed to be audiotaped at a quiet place of their choosing and to describe their living experience of feeling grateful. The audiotapes, transcripts, and consent forms were kept secure according to university policy.</p>

<title>Methodology</title>
<p>The Parse research method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0894318413477137">Parse, 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0894318413477137">2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0894318413477137">2005</xref>) is a phenomenological-hermeneutic research method inspired and designed to enhance the humanbecoming theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0894318413477137">Parse, 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0894318413477137">2007</xref>) and to discover the structure of the living experience of feeling grateful. This basic research method advances nursing science, deepening, expanding, and explicating the understanding of meaning and patterns for human living experiences related to health and quality of life. Both <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0894318413477137">Burns and Grove (2005)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0894318413477137">Parse (2001)</xref> set standards by which qualitative research studies are critiqued. By adhering to such standards, both rigor and credibility of the research were achieved for this study. The processes of the method are: dialogical engagement, extraction synthesis, and heuristic interpretation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0894318413477137">Parse, 2005</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section5-0894318413477137">
<title>Dialogical Engagement</title>
<p>Dialogical Engagement is defined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0894318413477137">Parse (2001)</xref> “as a true presence of the researcher with the participant” (p. 170). True presence is “a free flowing attentiveness” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0894318413477137">Parse, 1998</xref>, p. 71), essential to the method and data collection process. Dialogical engagement is an open dialogue focused on the phenomenon of interest, as opposed to a conventional interview style. Prior to beginning each dialogical engagement the researcher dwells with the phenomenon and centers on the dialogue about to be (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0894318413477137">Parse, 2001</xref>) in order to be attentive in true presence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0894318413477137">Parse, 2005</xref>). Each dialogical engagement begins with the researcher asking a question such as “Please talk with me about your experience of feeling grateful.” Only questions that moved the dialogue were asked, such as, “Tell me more about your experience of feeling grateful,” or “Can you please relate that to feeling grateful? or “Is there anything more you would like to say about feeling grateful?”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0894318413477137">
<title>Extraction-Synthesis</title>
<p>Extraction-Synthesis is the research process of laboriously teasing out the essences of the participants’ descriptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0894318413477137">Parse, 2005</xref>). The researcher dwells with each audiotape description while fully absorbed in deep concentration with the corresponding transcript (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0894318413477137">Parse, 2005</xref>). The extraction-synthesis process is a rigorous, intense, seamless rhythmical ebbing and flowing of dwelling with and inventing, while extracting-synthesizing core concepts in the language of the participant and then at higher levels of abstraction in the language of the researcher. These statements formulate the language-art, which arose directly from each participant’s description of feeling grateful while adhering to logic and semantic consistency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0894318413477137">Parse, 2005</xref>). These core concepts when synthesized form the structure of the living experience of feeling grateful that answers the research question.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0894318413477137">
<title>Heuristic Interpretation</title>
<p>Heuristic Interpretation is “weaving the structure (the finding of the study) with the principles of human becoming and beyond to enhance knowledge and create ideas for further research” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0894318413477137">Parse, 2005</xref> p. 298). The four processes of heuristic interpretation are structural transposition, conceptual integration, metaphorical emergings, and artistic expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0894318413477137">Parse, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0894318413477137">2011</xref>). Structural transposition and conceptual integration “move the discourse of the structure to the discourse of the theory” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0894318413477137">Parse, 2001</xref>, p. 171). <italic>Structural transposition</italic> moves the structure of the living experience to a different level of abstraction, and <italic>conceptual integration</italic> connects the structure (the finding of the study) to the language of science, humanbecoming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0894318413477137">Parse, 2005</xref>, p.298). <italic>Metaphorical emergings</italic> are metaphors that participants share that elucidate deeper meanings about the living experience of the universal phenomenon of interest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0894318413477137">Parse, 2011</xref>). The <italic>artistic expression</italic> is the researcher’s choice of an artform reflecting the structure of the living experience, which “incarnates the transfiguring moments” arising with the experiences of the research process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0894318413477137">Parse, 2005</xref>, p. 298). It is a purely personal artistic expression of meaning for the researcher (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0894318413477137">Parse, 2005</xref>).</p>

<title>Thomas’ Story</title>
<p>Thomas said that feeling grateful is a constant warm-hearted, complete, euphoric feeling of thankfulness that he enjoys. It is being aware and thoughtful especially when helping others. It is a happy, joyous, fluid feeling, where nice things flow, in doing something for somebody. He said, “You have to have pain and suffering in order to become grateful.” It is a tedious process, taking extra steps in trying situations when there is negativity. Feeling grateful is an easy, peaceful feeling, like having a security blanket. He said that feeling grateful is a good feeling that comes from within, which is never-ending, always changing, and evolving. Feeling grateful is putting a positive spin in everybody’s day. Thomas pondered, “Feeling grateful is being aware of other people’s situations, losses, where they live, the war zone, and that type of thing, and being grateful to know that you have an opportunity not to be in that position.”</p>

<title>Carlos’ Story</title>
<p>Carlos said that feeling grateful is a profound, happy feeling of fullness, being thankful and thoughtful, not only having a place in the world but having a place in a family. Feeling grateful is a wonderful overwhelming experience to be cherished that is humbling and beneficial. It makes him feel completely whole as a human being to feel grateful, helping him understand and appreciate, and making him focus. He stated, “I know that the only reason I am here is because my parents loved me without even knowing me. They went to a strange, different country and they adopted me, and if I am not grateful for that I don’t deserve anything else I get.” Everything he has received since then has been a gift, so he feels optimistic and upbeat. He said feeling grateful is also getting rid of the guilt when taking something for granted. For Carlos, feeling grateful is appreciating where things come from, the satisfaction of owning something for the very first time, and the responsibility of sharing or giving a gift without expecting anything in return. Feeling grateful, he said, portrays him in a better light to people, helping them relate. For him, feeling grateful is keeping in close contact with family and friends. Having lost many family members, feeling grateful for him can also be scary and he stated “just as you have been given something it can be taken away from you, so it’s an exciting, happy, and great feeling, but at the same time it can be a sad and emotional feeling.”</p>

<title>Potent Elation Amid Tribulation</title>
<p><italic>Potent elation amid tribulation</italic> is the exhilaration of excitement when acknowledging something important that arises with experienced hardship. It illuminates the intensity of flux that participants experienced all-at-once, as they are living feeling grateful, while moving forth with day-to-day personal choosings. One participant spoke with such expressions as “overt happiness, thanksgiving, and reaffirmation [with being] on the right track [in] doing something purposeful.” For her, it was “a sense of being positive, upbeat, [and] accepting life changing experiences, knowing that life is a gift.” At the same time, referring to a child who was living with uncertain life expectancy, she said,
<disp-quote>
<p>There was a lot of anxiety and grief [in] trying to take this awful situation and still [feel] grateful that she was there, [that] she was alive. There is an overpowering sense of gratitude that, even if she were to die, soon, I would still have known her, and still had all those experiences to be grateful for.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p><italic>Potent elation amid tribulation</italic> for another participant was a “constant warm-hearted, happy, joyous, euphoric feeling of thankfulness that comes from within.” At the same time he said, it is “a tedious process, taking extra step[s] in trying situations, when there is negative activity.” He said, “You have to have pain and suffering in order to become grateful.” Another participant, referring to the challenges with preparation to show her art work to the public stated that feeling grateful was “energizing, serene, and personal, an experience of relief after struggling.” She said feeling grateful gives “peace of mind and it encourages me to paint; it keeps me from giving up when things are low.” <italic>Potent elation amid tribulation</italic> captures ideas from the participants’ descriptions of moving onward, fueling desires and opportunities, while sustaining hopes and dreams. For participants, it was a bubbling up of pleasurable moments as they persisted in moving onward with their lives amid the challenge and turbulence of everyday occurrences.</p>
<p><italic>Potent elation amid tribulation</italic> was structurally transposed as <italic>buoyant fortitude amid the arduous</italic> and conceptually integrated with the humanbecoming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0894318413477137">Parse, 2007</xref>) theory as <italic>powering</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0894318413477137">Parse, 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0894318413477137">2007</xref>). Powering is a concept of the principle, “cotranscending with possibles is the powering and originating of transforming” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0894318413477137">Parse, 2007</xref>, p. 309). Powering is risking while living the unbounded possibilities of the paradoxical rhythms “pushing-resisting, affirming-not affirming, and being-nonbeing” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0894318413477137">Parse, 2007</xref>, p. 309). Powering, integral to being human, is an undeniable strong force for celebration amid the tensions of living day-to-day. In the participants’ descriptions there was a sense of feeling affirmed by gifts. The pushing-resisting force of buoyant fortitude amid the arduous is risking something that is deemed important in the face of the possibility of nonbeing. As choices are made in feeling grateful, powering is the propelling force that moves humans to soar to new horizons of understanding, reaching beyond prior knowing. Some participants used phrases such as “get back up,” “it moves me to new places,” and “made me stronger,” underscoring elements of courage.</p>
<p>The core concept <italic>potent elation amid tribulation</italic> was not explicitly described in the existing literature on gratitude, gratefulness, or <italic>feeling grateful</italic>, however the situations in which gratitude or gratefulness was described did yield consistency with some ideas offered by various researchers. For example concepts such as joy, happiness, lucky, and thankful with resentment, pain, grief, medical diagnosis of cancer, and loss shed light on <italic>potent elation amid tribulation.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0894318413477137">Ringdal, Plos, and Bergboom (2008)</xref> identified gratitude as being loved and supported by family while accepting life following traumatic injury, whereas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0894318413477137">Orr, Wills, Holmes, Britton, and Orr (2007)</xref> reported that participants who received kidney transplants were grateful to donors who helped to give them their life back while also feeling beholden, guilty, and regret that the person had to die to make the kidney available. These examples point to <italic>potent elation amid tribulation</italic> from particularistic grounding.</p>
<p>Consistent with the humanbecoming school of thought, concepts similar to potent elation amid tribulation emerged from Parse research method studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0894318413477137">Parse, 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0894318413477137">2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0894318413477137">2005</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0894318413477137">Baumann (2000)</xref> discovered the concepts <italic>uplifting delight</italic> and <italic>bewildering trepidation</italic> in a study on feeling loved. While these concepts are reminiscent of <italic>potent elation amid tribulation</italic>, when structurally transposed they were <italic>unburdening joy</italic> and <italic>faltering perturbation</italic>, and conceptually integrated respectively as transforming and enabling-limiting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0894318413477137">Baumann, 2000</xref>). In this study <italic>potent elation amid tribulation</italic> when structurally transposed as <italic>buoyant fortitude amid the arduous</italic> was conceptually integrated as powering, highlighting the vacillating paradoxical tension that exists when feeling grateful. The paradoxical tension found with the core concept <italic>potent elation amid tribulation</italic> is similar to <italic>struggling in pursuit of fortification</italic> in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0894318413477137">Daly’s (1995)</xref> study on suffering and <italic>fortitude amid adversity</italic> in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0894318413477137">Doucet’s (2008)</xref> study on having faith. While these concepts illustrate powering, in this study <italic>potent elation amid tribulation</italic> further explicates and sheds new light on powering as a paradoxical tension of pushing-resisting forces that all-at-once affirm being as enlivened jubilation in the face of onerous foreboding of non-being.</p>

<title>Assuredness-Unassuredness</title>
<p><italic>Assuredness-unassuredness</italic> illuminates the cadent merging of certainty-uncertainty with conforming-not conforming that participants experienced all-at-once, as they are living the ebb and flow of feeling grateful in experiences of daily life. <italic>Assuredness-unassuredness</italic> emerged with optimism and doubt. One participant said,
<disp-quote>
<p>It’s an overwhelming sense of knowing that things work out. There are times when you say ‘Whew, I’m so grateful, I just missed that one,’ but I think it’s more subtle [on a] day-to-day basis. It’s the subtleties of having a life changing experience.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Feeling grateful arose as <italic>assuredness-unassuredness</italic> in participants’ dialogues that also showed conforming-not conforming with personal expectations. One participant spoke of feeling grateful with the certainty-uncertainty of risking in selecting a university for a career that was not her preferred choice, but was perceived by others as more secure. The university she chose was accessible and accepting of her race. She ultimately was living the certainty of knowing that she made a significant contribution to her community by blending her professional work and her love of art during her work life. She was unsure of the meaning and value her work held for others until she was recognized by the community and her peers as making a contribution to society. Another participant spoke of feeling grateful as <italic>assuredness-unassuredness</italic> in not knowing what will happen next, as she reflected on loss and relief with the death of her sister-in-law. She reflected,
<disp-quote>
<p>I have just been through the death of [my brother’s] wife, which was, in a way not a grateful situation, but in another way a grateful situation because of the fact that he will not have as much concern and worry. She had various illnesses and [he] was always there to take care of her. And when you go through that, there is always the worry for the close other and that lovingly burdensome responsibility that he had is now eased. So that’s a part of [feeling] grateful also. And so I’m very happy about that.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p><italic>Assuredness-unassuredness</italic> with feeling grateful is the all-at-once undulating experience of certainty and doubt. Assuredness arises as a strength of purpose, a certainty with clarity of knowing, yet with elements of uncertainty. In this study participants showed doubt even with the certainty of feeling grateful for those experiences that were important to them. There was a certainty of conviction with the all-at-once uncertainty with known and unknown possibilities.</p>
<p><italic>Assuredness-unassuredness</italic> was not described explicitly in the existing totality paradigmatic literature on gratitude or gratefulness, however the situations described by some authors did yield consistency with the tension of living life in a new way with certainty-uncertainty and conformity-nonconformity when adhering to a strict medical regimen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0894318413477137">Orr et al., 2007</xref>); responding to the receipt of genetic risk information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0894318413477137">Phelps et al., 2008</xref>); and options following a stroke (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0894318413477137">Häggström et al., 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>In the humanbecoming literature <italic>assuredness-unassuredness</italic> is captured in the research on feeling unsure. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0894318413477137">Morrow (2006)</xref> found the core concept <italic>discomforting trepidation with assuredness-unassuredness</italic>, while <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0894318413477137">Bunkers (2007)</xref> found the core concept <italic>disquieting apprehensiveness</italic>, in studies of <italic>feeling unsure.</italic> A phenomenological study on <italic>waiting</italic> described the core concepts <italic>vigilant attentiveness surfacing amid ambiguous turbulent lull</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0894318413477137">Bournes &amp; Mitchell, 2002</xref>) as a “grueling experience of unsure stillness” (p. 62), when participants torturously followed system waiting-room rules with the agony of not seeing their loved one when desired. Similarly, in a study of <italic>taking life day-by-day</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0894318413477137">Welch, 2007</xref>), the concept sure-unsure arose with the “ambiguity of unfolding moments” (p. 271), as the participants were simultaneously living clarity with the vagueness of knowing-not knowing what to expect.</p>
<p><italic>Assuredness-unassuredness</italic> was structurally transposed as <italic>certitude-incertitude</italic> and conceptually integrated with the humanbecoming theory as <italic>originating</italic>. Originating, like powering, is a concept of the principle, “cotranscending with possibles is the powering and originating of transforming” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0894318413477137">Parse, 2007</xref>, p. 309). The paradoxes of originating are conforming-not conforming and certainty-uncertainty. Originating is a way of living certainty-uncertainty with everyday life, conforming and at once not conforming with established traditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0894318413477137">Parse, 2007</xref>). Assuredness-unassuredness, of the core concept <italic>feeling grateful</italic>, is closely connected with certainty-uncertainty. <italic>Feeling grateful</italic> for participants in this study was a way of assuredly venturing onward, even during the ambiguity of difficult circumstances. There was a certainty of purpose when feeling grateful, which was tempered with some doubt. <italic>Feeling grateful</italic> was also a way of inventing a perspective on something given as a gift. There is a sureness-unsureness with which persons approach a gift. Some participants spoke of the assuredness of life itself being a gift, while all-at-once the unassuredness of living with the unknowns of limited life expectancy.</p>

<title>Benevolent Alliances</title>
<p><italic>Benevolent alliances</italic> illuminates the significant meaning of interpersonal relationships. Participants spoke about others as they described feeling grateful, whether close or distant, with persons who had died or had just been born. The sense of generosity, doing good, and showing kindness flowed through all participant descriptions about others. One participant spoke of adopting her children when she said, “You know, other people don’t miss it, but that baby crying at 2 AM in the morning, every time I thought, ‘I’m a mom!” Another participant said that feeling grateful, “makes [me] feel that someone cares.” For her, feeling wanted and appreciated was always in context of connections with others. One participant spoke of <italic>benevolent alliances</italic> as she was present and bearing witness to her dying sister when she said,
<disp-quote>
<p>I was just grateful that I was getting this intimacy, so I guess in many ways [feeling grateful] has meant for me always an experience of intimacy I’ve never had that experience of [feeling] grateful without others.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The core concept <italic>benevolent alliances</italic> when conceptually integrated with the humanbecoming theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0894318413477137">Parse, 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0894318413477137">2007</xref>) conveys <italic>valuing connecting-separating. Valuing</italic> is found in the principle “structuring meaning is the imaging and valuing of languaging” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0894318413477137">Parse, 2007</xref>, p. 309). <italic>Valuing</italic> is expressed with the choices a human makes in the moment, confirming select value priorities while not confirming others. Living that which is prized confirms what is valued and not valued in the moment. Connecting-separating is a concept of the principle “configuring rhythmical patterns of relating is the revealing-concealing and enabling-limiting of connecting-separating” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0894318413477137">Parse, 2007</xref>, p. 309). It is an all-at-once cadent rhythm of attending to while distancing from persons, situations, ideas, or projects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0894318413477137">Parse, 1998</xref>). Similarly, with each separation there is a connecting that is deemed more important to the person in the moment. The construct valuing connecting-separating illuminates the core concept <italic>benevolent alliances</italic> and is pivotal to the living experience of <italic>feeling grateful</italic>. There is a prizing of uplifting meaning moments that humans live when they are <italic>feeling grateful</italic> that occurs simultaneously while alone and with others. <italic>Benevolent alliances</italic> when structurally transposed becomes <italic>amicable affiliations. Amicable affiliations</italic> is conceptually integrated as valuing connecting-separating, integral to being human, and can be illustrated in the literature located in the totality paradigm and in the simultaneity paradigm.</p>
<p>Research studies on feeling grateful in the totality paradigm allude to benevolent alliances. Benevolent alliances were related to feeling grateful with relationships and support from family or significant others when regaining health following colon cancer and while looking forward to creating a new future (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0894318413477137">Ramfelt et al., 2002</xref>); feeling grateful for professional assistance, satisfaction with progress, while worrying about the future (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0894318413477137">Häggström et al., 1994</xref>); and when feeling grateful for receiving a kidney transplant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0894318413477137">Orr et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>In the simultaneity literature <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0894318413477137">Pilkington and Kilpatrick (2008)</xref>, in their study on suffering, identified <italic>benevolent alliances</italic> as a core concept, emphasizing the significance that participants held for others, objects, and ideas. Other researchers, including <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0894318413477137">Morrow (2006)</xref> in a study on feeling unsure, reported that <italic>treasured alliances</italic> occurred with special, important persons as they confirmed not-confirmed cherished beliefs. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0894318413477137">Parse (2001)</xref>, in her study on contentment, uncovered <italic>benevolent engagements</italic> as intimately close and loving relationships, and with her study on feeling respected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0894318413477137">Parse, 2006</xref>) identified <italic>prized alliances</italic> as “close family members, friends, or colleagues” (p. 55). These descriptions are closely aligned with <italic>benevolent alliances</italic>, which when structurally transposed is <italic>amicable affiliations</italic> and conceptually integrated as <italic>valuing connecting-separating</italic>.</p>
<p><italic>Valuing connecting-separating</italic> has been identified in the simultaneity paradigm, specifically the humanbecoming literature in studies including <italic>feeling loved</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0894318413477137">Baumann, 2000</xref>), <italic>feeling unsure</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0894318413477137">Bunkers, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0894318413477137">Morrow, 2006</xref>), <italic>feeling lonely</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0894318413477137">Karnick, 2008</xref>), <italic>feeling respected</italic>, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0894318413477137">Parse, 2006</xref>), <italic>grieving a loss</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0894318413477137">Pilkington, 2005</xref>), and <italic>suffering</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0894318413477137">Pilkington &amp; Kilpatrick, 2008</xref>). <italic>Valuing connecting-separating</italic> is an all-at-once prizing of cherished others, ideas, objects, and events. Descriptions of <italic>feeling grateful</italic> by all participants in this study conveyed that <italic>benevolent alliances</italic> were about others, ideas, objects, and events, replete with meaning moments confirming what is valued, while at the same time not confirming that which is not valued. The descriptions of <italic>feeling grateful</italic> that led to the core concept <italic>benevolent alliances</italic> showed that as participants spoke of <italic>feeling grateful</italic>, they distanced themselves from what was happening at the moment as they connected with cherished memories or hopes for possibilities.

<title>Metaphorical Emergings</title>
<p>During the dialogical engagements, participants spontaneously expressed several metaphors that reflected their experience of <italic>feeling grateful</italic>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0894318413477137">Parse (2011)</xref> identified metaphorical emerging as ways that participants creatively express the meaning of their living experiences. Metaphors are phrases that convey truth for the moment in surprise twists on meaning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0894318413477137">Parse, 2011</xref>). Metaphors enhance understanding of feeling grateful from a humanbecoming perspective. One participant said, “Feeling grateful is a warm, complete, euphoric sometimes “Fourth of July” type feeling.” The <italic>“warm, complete, euphoric sometimes Fourth of July type feeling”</italic> is a driving force of the pushing-resisting of powering with potent elation amid tribulation when <italic>feeling grateful</italic>. The e<italic>uphoric</italic> feeling in the metaphor shows the paradoxical rhythm of uplifting delight tempered with potential deflating dejection with a sureness-unsureness of conforming–not conforming with others when freely living pattern preferences. The <italic>Fourth of July</italic> metaphor confirms value priorities of uplifting celebration while not confirming other priorities as the person is connecting-separating with benevolent alliances, ideas, experiences and imagined illimitable possibilities when <italic>feeling grateful</italic>. The metaphor: <italic>warm, complete, euphoric sometimes Fourth of July type feeling</italic> enhances understanding of the living experience of <italic>feeling grateful.</italic></p>

<title>Artistic Expression</title>
<p>The painting L’Etoile ou Danseuse sur Scène (The Star Dancer on Stage) by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0894318413477137">Edgar Degas (2010)</xref> illuminates the core concepts of the living experience of feeling grateful and reflects the researcher’s journey with completing this study (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0894318413477137">Figure 1</xref>). The Star Dancer conveys the buoyancy of potent elation amid tribulation with the upraised position of her head and soft smiling facial expression, as she seemingly floats across the stage, powering amid the tribulation of the tensions imposed by the intricate and physically demanding complexity of body positions. The dark background hues and incomplete dance figures convey an air of uncertainty, a potential foreboding with the assuredness-unassuredness of her anticipated ability to perform the required movements, originating a unique interpretation of story and dance movements with certainty-uncertainty each time she performs. For the participants of this research study, feeling grateful was always with benevolent alliances depicted by Degas as figures recessed in the background showed their connections with the dancer by attending to her performance. Two of the figures, one man and one woman, stand relaxed as if cherishing the dancer in connecting-separating moments, one with the other and with the dancer all-at-once. The dancer lives amicable affiliations with her audience, valuing connecting-separating as she interprets each movement. Interpreting this artform while dwelling with the experience of the research process and the structure more fully illuminated the meaning of the living experience of feeling grateful sparking insights about the powering of potent elation amid tribulation, the originating of assuredness-unassuredness, and the valuing connecting-separating of benevolent alliances. The processes of sciencing that includes interpreting an artform expands the understanding of the universal living experience of feeling grateful.</p>

<title>New Knowledge</title>
<p>Five findings emerged from this research study as unique new knowledge, which do not appear in the extant literature on <italic>feeling grateful</italic>:</p>
<list id="list5-0894318413477137" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>The structure of the living experience of feeling grateful is potent elation amid tribulation arising with the assuredness-unassuredness of benevolent alliances emerged as new knowledge not previously reported in the literature.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Potent elation amid tribulation as the pushing-resisting of affirming-not affirming being in light of nonbeing emerged as essential to feeling grateful as a strong force for celebration amid the angst and tensions of living day-to-day. This unique conceptualization is new to humanbecoming sciencing and extant literature, and expands the understanding of powering as a potent force of feeling grateful.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Assuredness-unassuredness emerged as an essential concept of feeling grateful as a way of venturing onward, even during the ambiguity of difficult circumstances, when experiencing new ways of conforming-not conforming with the certainty-uncertainty.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Benevolent alliances as an all-at-once connecting-separating of love, intimacy, generosity, doing good, and showing kindness emerged as essential to feeling grateful.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>A new understanding and appreciation of feeling grateful as an experience of health and quality of life has emerged from this study.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>These findings are new and contribute to nursing’s body of knowledge by enhancing the understanding of humanbecoming school of thought (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0894318413477137">Parse, 1998</xref>), focusing attention on the phenomenon feeling grateful as important to health and quality of life, and by providing ideas for future research and practice.</p>

<sec id="section24-0894318413477137">
<title>Implication for Nursing Research</title>
<p>The goal of the Parse method is to enhance understanding of the humanbecoming school of thought by explicating the structure, meanings, and patterns of human experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0894318413477137">Parse, 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0894318413477137">2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0894318413477137">2010</xref>). The first core concept <italic>potent elation amid tribulation</italic> could be further enhanced by investigating universal living experiences like feeling joyful, feeling happy, feeling sad, feeling afraid, or suffering. The second core concept <italic>assuredness-unassuredness</italic> may lead one to investigate the universal living experiences of feeling sure, feeling unsure, feeling confident, feeling secure, or trusting another. The third core concept <italic>benevolent alliances</italic> might lead to further investigations on loving another, helping another, understanding another, or feeling alone. Research phenomena such as these have the potential to contribute significantly to the general understanding of feeling grateful and to contribute to knowledge about humanbecoming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0894318413477137">Parse, 2007</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section25-0894318413477137">
<title>Implication for Practice</title>
<p>The findings of this study have implications for nurses and others who practice with people and families wherever they are located. The focus of practice emanates from the humanbecoming principles, honoring the meaning, respecting patterns and choices of hopes and dreams related to feeling grateful. Nurses may have a heightened awareness to listen to patients’ expressions of feeling grateful. The knowledge about feeling grateful can be used to inform nurses who are living the humanbecoming perspective in practice, it may assist nurses to be in true presence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0894318413477137">Parse, 1998</xref>), nurse with person or group, as indivisible, unpredictable, everchanging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0894318413477137">Parse, 2007</xref>) mysteries. Nurses may be more aware of and respect values, bear witness to persons choosing freedom to choose changing health patterns, and honor persons’ desires and wishes. Bearing witness in true presence, with persons who choose to share their living experience of feeling grateful, honors the individual or family members as they share the mystery and illimitable possibilities of living their health.</p>
