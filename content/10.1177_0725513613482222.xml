<abstract>
<p>While post-modernist assaults on modernity correctly expose the pretensions of modernity – including its constructs of meaning in history, its abnegation of mystery, and its lapses into scientism, historicism, and relativism – the philosopher and theologian Bernard Lonergan discerned progress as well as decline in recent intellectual history. In part this is because under contemporary conditions we can avoid the pretensions of modernity, since – in the wake of modern science and modern historical scholarship – we witness <italic>the differentiation of interiority</italic>, which, properly understood as the discovery of the self, may be seen as leading to a new integration of the spiritual, the intellectual, the moral, and the historical.</p>

<title>Lonergan and the restoration of the philosophy of history</title>
<p>The philosophy of history, as a sophisticated and explicit reflection on history in its broadest scope, has two crucial preconditions: first, the differentiation of ‘history’ as a meaningful field of inquiry; and, second, the differentiation of ‘philosophy’ as an identifiable mode of existence, cultural form, and normative cognitive enterprise. The two differentiations were intimately intertwined in what Jaspers called the ‘Axial Age of History’ (and Bergson saw as the origin of ‘open morality’ and ‘open religion’), with its ‘discovery of the mind’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0725513613482222">Bergson 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0725513613482222">Jaspers 1968</xref>).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0725513613482222">1</xref>
</sup> The differentiation of history was tied to the differentiation of transcendence in the world religions and, as such, provided the subject matter for philosophical investigation (frequently under the umbrella of theology); while the differentiation of philosophy itself gave rise to an experience of history in the sense of a decisive ‘before’ and ‘after’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0725513613482222">Eliade 1959</xref>).</p>
<p>These differentiations of the Axial Age created tensions and challenges. There was the paradoxical recognition that the meaning of human existence in time was intrinsically related to that which is beyond time. And the erection of a theoretical culture faced its own paradox in describing the love of wisdom as situated between ignorance and knowledge, and also threatened to oscillate between a domination of history by fixed ideas and logical norms and a self-imposed skepticism. In Lonergan’s view, these problems were not adequately resolved or even adequately addressed in the Axial Age or in the ensuing tradition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0725513613482222">McPartland 2010a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0725513613482222">2010b</xref>: 128–36).</p>
<p>In the last few centuries in the West, perhaps ironically, the philosophy of history has seemed to come into its own precisely as it has rejected much of the tradition flowing from the Axial Age. But one persuasive narrative would see this development as ultimately a failure, and thus a distinct case of decline. The Enlightenment, in opposition to metaphysics and Christianity, replaced the old theology of history with a progressivist philosophy of history (Voltaire, Diderot, Condorcet) to be followed by 19th-century positivist philosophies of history (Comte and Spencer). On a grander scale, Hegel could claim to supersede all previous viewpoints in his System, by explaining the dialectic of history in terms of the eternal self-making of the Absolute (which Marx turned ‘on its head’ in his dialectical materialism). When the modern grand-scale speculative philosophies of history, so the narrative goes, had in a speculative frenzy apparently exhausted themselves, the energy was carried by neo-positivist, neo-Kantian, pragmatist, and analytic philosophies to the epistemological philosophy of historical method – in clear opposition to ‘antiquated’ classical notions of science and scholarship. And when the ‘epistemological turn’ seemed to lose the human element by consigning it to a cage fashioned for it by modern objectifying and alienating ‘methodologies’, the existentialists (such as Heidegger in <italic>Being and Time</italic>) could resuscitate the philosophy of history in a hermeneutical explication of history as a constituent of human being. But the ‘ontological turn’ only sparked a post-modern revolt against the philosophy of history, insofar as it attacked the cognitive subject and history as an object of inquiry. So the modern period has not been without its ambiguities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0725513613482222">Löwith 1949</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0725513613482222">Berlin 1976</xref>: 145–216; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0725513613482222">Gardiner 1959</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0725513613482222">Gooch 1959</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0725513613482222">Heidegger 1962</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0725513613482222">Iggers 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0725513613482222">Mandelbaum 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0725513613482222">Mazlish 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0725513613482222">Meyerhoff 1959</xref>).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0725513613482222">2</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Indeed there is a feeling in the contemporary situation that modernity, with all its serious flaws, has truly run its course but that, at the same time, there can be no easy retreat to Axial Age outlooks because modernity, its flaws notwithstanding, has marked an irrevocable break with the past. There is a further sense that post-modernity is a kind of transition to something new. It can be seen as acting as a brake on modernity to slow down, take stock, and head in another direction.</p>
<p>Lonergan, who was of the generation just prior to the more well-known post-modernists, followed something like this task. He considered himself part of a ‘not numerous center’ that would refuse to live in a world that no longer exists but that would equally refuse to be taken in by the latest fads, intellectual fashions, and hasty pronouncements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0725513613482222">Lonergan 1988</xref>: 245). His lifelong aim was to re-establish a viable philosophy of history (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0725513613482222">Mathews 2005</xref>: 88–92; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0725513613482222">Lonergan 1999</xref>: 5–35; 1974: 271–2). This meant that he could not simply reject the Axial Period out of hand. It was still axial. He would have to build upon its achievements. But he would also have to go beyond its limits. For he saw in modernity the prospects of addressing more adequately and thematically the unresolved problems from the Axial Age regarding history and philosophy if, and only if, the genuine discoveries of modernity could be disentangled from the erroneous assumptions that had dominated intellectual life for centuries. This was, to be sure, a bold enterprise. To carry out this delicate surgery would demand a philosophy of history rooted in a comprehensive philosophy – a philosophy that could tackle the entire range of philosophical issues. No half measures would do (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0725513613482222">Lonergan 1992</xref>: 6–7, 24). This would have to be philosophy on the scale of Plato, Aristotle, Aquinas, Descartes, Kant, or Hegel. Lonergan operated on that level. How could he hope to do so? For he started out with neither the old metaphysics nor modern epistemology, and yet he addressed basic issues in metaphysics and epistemology. He recognized historicity while rejecting historicism. He applauded historical objectivity without falling prey to scientism and objectivism. He constructed grand-scale ideal-types without claiming to have penetrated to the essence of history (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0725513613482222">Lonergan 1972</xref>: 284–5, 287–8, 292–3; 1992: 569–72, 587–93).</p>
<p>The key to Lonergan’s philosophy – and to his philosophy of history – is his uncovering of the pervasive confrontation theory of truth that has dominated late medieval and modern thought up to the present, and his finding an alternative not in a theory, but in the differentiation of interiority. If the First Axial Age witnessed the ‘discovery of the mind’, what Lonergan calls the Second Axial Age has seen the ‘discovery of the self’ (arguably reaching its full articulation in Kierkegaard) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0725513613482222">Lonergan 2001</xref>: Part 2, 141–215; 1985: 165–83; 1974: 69–86, 232–45). Lonergan’s own distinct contribution to this narration of interiority is to focus on the self as cognitional agent. His own discovery is that the ‘cognitive subject’ is not a disengaged <italic>cogito</italic> but an agent fully engaged in the drama of history as an inquirer. To set up an opposition between objectivity and historical existence is to assume the bifurcation of subject and object that flows from the confrontation theory of truth, which is discredited by the actual performance of the self in the process of inquiry. Norms are found not in fixed conceptual contents but are operational and dynamic in a self-transcending process open to transcendence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0725513613482222">Lonergan 1992</xref>: 404–5; 1972: 265, 292). This allows for a new way for intellectual culture to conceive of integrating human living. Being fully objective means living in a world oriented to mystery while also meaning a ‘heightened grasp of historical origins’ so as to promote progress and reverse decline, thereby assuming responsibility for the direction (though not absolute control) of history (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0725513613482222">Lonergan 1992</xref>: 266). Lonergan, then, does not ‘overcome’ history by standing outside it. He would have us negotiate what he terms the ‘tension of limitation and transcendence’ by following the self-transcending norms of inquiry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0725513613482222">Lonergan 1992</xref>: 650–3, 745–50). Collectively, this would lead to an academic praxis that would functionally relate critical history, philosophy, and social policy in an ongoing engagement with the historical past to consider the direction of the future, thus reflecting human historicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0725513613482222">Lonergan 1972</xref>: ch. 5-11).</p>
<p>Keeping in mind that a philosophy of history requires explication of both terms in the phrase, let us examine Lonergan’s understanding of these terms. We can consider first a ‘Lonergan narrative’ of the discovery of <italic>history</italic> in the First Axial Age, its problematic, and the response made available by the differentiation of interiority in the Second Axial Age. We can, then, consider Lonergan’s analysis of the discovery of the <italic>mind</italic> in the First Axial Age, its problematic, and the new perspective of philosophy concomitant with the discovery of the self in the Second Axial Age.</p>

<title>History and the two Axial Ages</title>
<p>Every human society, certainly since the exercise of speech at some point in the Paleolithic period, has a ‘lived history’, a collective or communal memory, perhaps at first recounted in campfire lore, commemorated at ceremonies, and celebrated at rituals. This spontaneous, ‘lived history’ was part and parcel of the spontaneous cultural infrastructure of clans, tribes, and villages for millennia. It entered into the spontaneous self-interpretation of these societies as carriers of the meanings and values that informed human living. And eventually in the early civilizations, written records of lists and annals were added to these interpretations, thereby providing a new type of interpretation of the past or even interpretations of interpretations. We can also say that, clearly, the ‘lived history’ and the spontaneous cultural infrastructure of human societies were constituted by human acts of meaning, valuing, and deciding – all of which were conscious (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0725513613482222">Lonergan 1996</xref>: 73–4; 1992: 725–35; 1972: xi, 41–7, 185; 1974: 21, 91–2, 103–4).</p>
<p>But when we examine the contents of the culture of most human society for most of what we call human history, we are surprised if not shocked – if we take the contents seriously. For the aspect of lived history seems of no great significance. Meaningful events and activities are those that are suffused with higher purpose and integrated with higher cosmic and sacred import. Drama, poetry, music, and other forms of cultural expression, which were later differentiated, were all part of the dance, and the dance primordially was an attunement with the elemental rhythm and movement of the cosmos and the mysterious divine order behind it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0725513613482222">Van der Leeuw 1963</xref>: 13). The representative human in early-precivilized societies was the shaman, whose techniques of ecstasy carried him literally beyond the mere human into the sacred realm, ensuring order in human society by this connection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0725513613482222">Eliade 1964</xref>). Later, in the early civilizations of Mesopotamia, Egypt, the Indus, China, the Andes, and Meso-America, the institution of sacral kingship succeeded the figure of the shaman, where the priest-king, pharaoh, or emperor assured order in human society by periodic and ritual attunement with the cosmic-divine order. Relevant ‘history’ was the sacred history whose narrative was recited and dramatized and recounted in myth. So, according to the Sumerian King List, kingship ‘was first’ in the city-state of Eridu, ‘when kingship was lowered from Heaven’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0725513613482222">Pritchard 1969</xref>: 265; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0725513613482222">Frankfurt 1948</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0725513613482222">Eliade 1963</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0725513613482222">1959</xref>: ch. 2). Relevant time, therefore, was the sacred time of the beginnings. The annual recitation and reenactment of the creation story at the New Year’s festival was to assure cyclical integration with cosmic order. Relevant causality in human affairs, accordingly, was vertical causality coming from ‘above’ – from the gods, fate, or destiny (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0725513613482222">Jacobsen 1976</xref>: 86–91). Historiography was primarily associated with sacred kinship in the narration of the great deeds of the mediators of the sacred and the human.</p>
<p>Lonergan would join Voegelin in depicting these early cultures under the ideal-type of ‘undifferentiated consciousness’ rather than through the prism of any narrow ideological construction, such as progressivism, that would not take myth seriously and would indeed consign it to <italic>Urdumheit</italic>, primitive stupidity, driven principally by fear. To be sure, myth was the primary form of cultural expression in these societies, and myth could easily merge with magic and pseudo-explanations. But myth in its pure form was a story told, and a drama enacted, to explore and represent the mystery of the human condition and the mystery of being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0725513613482222">McPartland 2010b</xref>: 120–8). As such, nothing since in the history of consciousness has superseded – that is, made irrelevant – myth. The real challenge is to identify the conditions for the cultural emergence, out of this undifferentiated consciousness, of a position that takes seriously human history as a field of genuine inquiry. And those conditions are not exactly as progressivism has portrayed them. As we have stated above, they are the conditions historically effective in the period Jaspers designated the Axial Age, and led to what Bergson calls the ‘open society’. But the Axial Age, at least as Jaspers conceived of it, ended two thousand years ago. Lonergan has spoken of the modern shift to interiority and historicity as perhaps constituting a second Axial Period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0725513613482222">Lonergan 1988</xref>: 226–7; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0725513613482222">Voegelin 1990</xref>: 268; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0725513613482222">2000a</xref>: 89). As the subtitle suggests, the ‘existential connection’ associated with interiority is that human existence is historical existence, where historical existence is a normative project of self-transcendence, at once dialectical and hermeneutical, human and divine. If the full differentiation of interiority, according to Lonergan, comes in his Second Axial Age, it was present nevertheless in a relatively more compact form in the First Axial Age.</p>
<p>‘History’ is a term introduced by Herodotus to refer to his inquiry (<italic>historia</italic>) into the great deeds that, he claimed, were worth preserving. The great deeds were worthy of recollection because they were part of the dramatic convulsions of the Persian Wars. Something must have been peculiar to these convulsions, for the inquiry of Herodotus placed his work on a plane well beyond that of a mere chronicle, which might chart the genealogy of a prominent family. The unprecedented nature of his inquiry reflected the unprecedented nature of the events. Indeed, it was obvious to Herodotus that the events were of unparalleled magnitude in terms of the scale of peoples involved and the sheer size of the Persian Empire, as detailed in the first books of the inquiry. These wars could even dwarf the fabled Trojan War.</p>
<p>But why not write an epic on a more grand scale than that of Homer rather than an inquiry? Herodotus, it is clear, sees as a storyline the clash of civilizations, symbolized in the conversation of the exiled Spartan king, Demaratus, with the Great King, Xerxes. The Persian monarch is a tyrant who proudly proclaims that his soldiers will fight out of fear of him, while the Spartans, so their exiled king declares, will fight more bravely out of a freedom born of their obedience to the law of their polis (Herodotus, <italic>Histories</italic>, 7.101–4). But, according to Voegelin’s astute analysis, Herodotus knew there was something more at stake than simply the story of the freedom of one’s homeland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0725513613482222">Voegelin 2002</xref>: 319; 2000b: 237–40). For, as he made plain in his narrative, some Hellenic <italic>poleis</italic> were also tyrannies, and only 31 out of countless Hellenic <italic>poleis</italic> chose to oppose the Persians rather than submitting by the relatively painless method of presenting tokens of earth and water to Persian representatives (the ‘Medes’). There was indeed at work a higher cosmic and moral law, namely, the ordination that human happiness, whether of a great city, a great man (a Croesus), or a great empire, is fleeting, and that pride in greatness invites disaster. So the prideful Xerxes, who whipped the waters of the Hellespont for insubordination, later suffered the ignominious defeats at Salamis and Plataea. That this tragic dimension of human existence took on the force of a universal and objective law suggests why the epic genre was not suitable to Herodotus and what the clash of civilizations was ultimately all about.</p>
<p>The Hellenic civilization was a carrier, however precariously, of an emerging cultural superstructure that recognized a universal transcendent, and rational, order of being. Herodotus grew up in Asia Minor, the heartland of Greek intellectual culture, and recited his inquiry at Athens during the age of the Athenian Enlightenment. While he was a not a self-identified philosopher or thinker of the stature of Plato (who represented the significance of the Socratic conflict with Athens and the new authority of noetic consciousness as the new historic age of the god Nous), Herodotus was nevertheless a pioneer among the creative minority of Greek intellectuals and, accordingly, had some sense of the direction of the new form of culture. ‘History’, then, was a narrative and interpretation of human events that took its mass and momentum from the inherently meaningful struggle for survival of a burgeoning culture committed to the universality of reason pitted against the sheer power (as Herodotus saw it) of an empire with both universal aspirations and virtual universal physical domination. Herodotus’ story is itself part of the larger story of the differentiation of consciousness in Jaspers’ Axial Age.</p>
<p>Historiography likewise arose in China in the wake of the development of Chinese moral philosophy. Chinese philosophy matured during the confusion, chaos, and breakdown of the later Zhou period, particularly during the Age of Warring Kingdoms (481–221 BC). Confucius (living at the dawn of this period) was arguably the leading figure in this movement. Although he urged the restoration of the neglected moral traditions of the ‘gentleman’ through a proper balance of inner attitude of soul and outward behavior and decorum, he would establish the sage as a source of order in society. The sage would not replace the institution of sacral kingship, but Confucian philosophy saw harmony with the moral order of the Heavens as the consequence of an inner attitude, and not as the automatic result of institutional mediation.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0725513613482222">3</xref>
</sup> The Confucian achievement, and with it the traditional moral order of society, was seriously threatened by the establishment of a universal empire reigning over, in the Chinese conception, the entire civilized world, the <italic>Tian</italic> <italic>Xia</italic>. When the Qin clan-state defeated all its rivals and established imperial rule under Shih Huang-ti in 221 BC, it carried out one of the most dramatic and far-reaching political transformations in human history. Following the advice of the Legalist philosopher and chief minister Li Si, the Qin eliminated the age-old clan states, replaced them with a centralized government administered by Legalist bureaucrats, and conducted extensive and costly public work projects, including the building of the Great Wall. Any opposition to the imperial edicts, or to the official philosophy of the empire, would be dealt with in the harshest of terms. The official Legalist philosophy was a strident Machiavellianism that saw the cosmos as devoid of any moral purpose. Meaningful order in human society was established solely by ruthless exercise of power and preserved by the same brutal techniques. Qin policy was to exterminate utterly Confucianism and Confucians.</p>
<p>So here we see a mortal conflict between, on the one hand, the representatives of moral transcendence and of a cultivated sense of human responsibility and, on the other hand, the universal empire committed to love of power, as enshrined in the memorial of 209 BC of the Grand Councilor Li Si, who argued bluntly that the sole <italic>raison d’être</italic> for the state was the ruler’s sheer exercise of power. The regime’s actual pursuit of this policy under its Second Emperor only fanned the flames of rebellion, and eventually led to execution of Li Si himself by the mindless emperor. Within a year rebels treacherously murdered 200,000 Qin troops, burned the capital city, and forced the emperor to commit suicide, ending the dynasty dramatically in flames (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0725513613482222">Cotterell 1981</xref>: ch. 7; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0725513613482222">Yu-Lan 1952</xref>: vol. 1, ch. 13). The moral lesson of the Legalist minister Li Si and the moral tragedy of the collapse of the Qin were not lost on the Grand Historian Sima Qian, a Confucian (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0725513613482222">Qian 1993</xref>: vol. 1, 179–206). His historiography provided moral edification and was motivated by criticism of the Qin threat to civilization. We witness, then, in the Chinese case such urgency about the historical record because it played out the meaningful drama of the soul. The threat to the carriers of self-transcendence, in this case, was not an external universal empire but an indigenous growth of power that replaced the traditional clan-states with a centralized locus of power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0725513613482222">Voegelin 2000c</xref>: ch. 6; 2002: 319).</p>
<p>Historiography was also a keen feature of ancient Israelite culture. To be sure, the historiographical materials seemed to be intertwined with such other genres as creation myths, folktales, wisdom literature, and psalms, in marked contrast to the more objective historical reporting of Herodotus and Sima Qian. And yet the motivating factor behind the burst of historiography in Israel was an intense, and radical, appreciation of history as future oriented. The key event that constituted the people of Israel as a distinct community was the Exodus from the great power of the region, Egypt. The Exodus was indeed unique as an event, not because it was caused by the irruption of divine agency – for the archaic mentality tended to view all significant changes in human affairs as the result of vertical causality operating from ‘above’ by the lords of nature who themselves were partners in the cosmic order – but because the divine intervention in this case came from a Lord of History who operated beyond the rules of the cosmos and could transform history, creating a distinct ‘before’ and ‘after’. Meaningful events were not restricted to those associated with the cyclical restoration of archaic foundations. Meaningful events could occur on the stage of history in a linear fashion. If the past could have been changed fundamentally and qualitatively, then so, too, might the future, ‘when swords will be bent into plowshares’. The gods, or God, of the beginning were present in natural recurrence; the God of the beyond was present in history and in the future. The motivating experience of the Exodus made the Israelites carriers of the experience of transcendence. Their sense of historical narrative centered on the struggle to remain faithful to this calling. Much of Israelite historiography was written in the period of the Exile or in the post-Exilic period and projected back onto the remote past. The main story-line concerned the opposition of the true community of Israel, often a ‘remnant’, against the threat posed by the surrounding powers of Assyria and later Babylon. The parallel to the context of Herodotus’ narrative should be evident. Perhaps ironically, though, the Israelite historians saw the Persians as actual agents of divine providence by freeing the Israelite remnant from exile in Babylon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0725513613482222">Eliade 1959</xref>: 102–12; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0725513613482222">Voegelin 2001</xref>: chs. 4–6: 157–228; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0725513613482222">Voegelin 2002</xref>: 319)!</p>
<p>The existential condition, then, for the emergence of history as a meaningful field of investigation in Hellas, China, and Israel was the experience, with varying texture, content, and intensity, of the historical differentiation of the realm of transcendence and of the epochal struggle to maintain the precarious carriers of the experience in a state of fidelity to its truth.</p>
<p>This differentiation of consciousness has indeed raised new and severe challenges to human existence by creating new tensions. The old myth of eternal return screened archaic societies from the ‘terror of history’, its finitude, and its uncertainties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0725513613482222">Eliade 1959</xref>: ch. 4). By contrast, the differentiation of the realm of transcendence opened humanity to the anxiety of existence, since the experience itself was of openness to the beyond – as Solon described it, to the ‘unseen measure’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0725513613482222">Voegelin 2000b</xref>: 267).</p>
<p>And ever since the Axial Age, there have been two polar opposite attempts to escape from the tension of existence consequent to the differentiation of transcendence. On the one hand, the experience of transcendence and history has been muted by the reintroduction of social attunement to a static cosmic hierarchy. When the Israelites clamored to ‘give us a king like other nations’, they sowed the seeds of discord and threatened evermore the purity of their religious tradition, since if they were to be ‘like other nations’ they would have to install the mediating institution of sacral kingship. Herodotus, interestingly enough, failed to understand that the Persian royal family was committed to a spiritual tradition, Zoroastrianism, which viewed history as participating in a cosmic struggle of the one God, Ahuramazda, against Ahriman, the devil. But the Persians, as the synthesizers of the ancient Near Eastern culture, placed their political rule solidly in the tradition of sacral kinship – indeed with a vengeance, for the conception of one God above, the ‘creator of yonder heaven and of earth’, required by the principle of attunement that there be one ruler of all mankind below, the Great King of Persia, as we see in the inscription of Darius I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0725513613482222">Pritchard 1969</xref>: 316–17). And this was almost the identical formulation of the Byzantine autocrats centuries later in the context of the Christian experience of transcendence, although at one point the Christian doctrine of the Trinity caused some political commotion. </p>
<p>The Byzantine court ceremony symbolized the hierarchical layers of the cosmos in the ritual movements of the court officials. This same ceremony was adopted in the Catholic West as the ritual formula for the Solemn High Mass prior to the Second Vatican Council. In the West, of course, the paramount political symbol for centuries was that of the <italic>sacrum imperium</italic>, which embraced the regal power of the Holy Roman Emperors who vied with the Papacy for authority in Christendom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0725513613482222">Dempf 1954</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0725513613482222">Tellenbach 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0725513613482222">Tierney et al. 1977</xref>). The political failure of the Holy Roman Empire only reinforced the assumption of sacral kingship by national monarchies. The case of China is unique because the Confucian sages as a class became integrated into the empire, whose ruler, the Son of Heaven, had the task of ensuring integrating with cosmic order. This lasted until 1911.</p>
<p>On the other hand, claiming that the goal of historical process had been realized, or would be realized, could abolish the tension of historical existence. This claim can take on a variety of forms, ranging from contemplation to social activism to radical revolution. So the Jewish zealots spearheaded a revolt against the Romans as they anticipated the coming of the Messiah. Millennialists during the Middle Ages and Reformation sought to institute the Third Realm of the Spirit. Cambridge Platonists in the 17th century reinterpreted the <italic>eschaton</italic> as the gradual moral improvement of the human race through the progress of reason. German Idealists engaged in speculative gnosis to penetrate the mystery of the divine and historical process, while Marx, in their footsteps, proclaimed he had solved the riddle of history. Radical revolutionaries sought to transform human nature by establishing the Republic of Virtue, the Third Reich, or a People’s Democracy. Maoists in China unleashed the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, in continuity with the Taiping Rebellion of the 19th century which cost millions of lives in the attempt of a self-proclaimed member of the Christian Trinity to establish his Kingdom of Heaven (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0725513613482222">Spence 1996</xref>). The Taiping Rebellion itself was in continuity with the Red Turbans of the 14th century, who combined elements of Zoroastrianism and Buddhism, and also in continuity with the Yellow Turbans of the second century, who sought to re-establish the harmony of the Taoist Great Peace. Muslim Shiites await the return of the Mahdi, and Islamicists seek the restoration of the Caliphate.</p>
<p>One normative principle of historical existence, therefore, emerges here: historical existence is a challenge of negotiating between the extremes of anti-historical immobilism and superhistorical fulfillment. While the modern world supplies many examples of the extremes, particularly of the latter, decline is not the whole story of modernity. We need to trace how the ‘discovery of the self’ (or the ‘subject’) has shed new light on historical process without, however, abolishing the tension of existence. In fact, the new light is precisely an illumination of the complicated tensions that need to be negotiated; of how the negotiation is an ongoing hermeneutical enterprise with its internal norms; and of how the activity of negotiation is a drama with its own affective criteria that confers dignity on the process.</p>
<p>It is often overlooked that the modern scientific revolution ushered in profound changes in the understanding of history. The Copernican theory, in its shift to a heliocentric universe, toppled the Aristotelian – and basically common-sense – schemes of qualitatively different levels of a static hierarchical universe. For implicitly, there is no center to the universe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0725513613482222">Collingwood 1960</xref>: 97). Indeed, the cosmos is a universe because it exhibits universal laws, which were increasingly conceived as mathematical in form and perhaps mechanistic in character. The exorcism of teleology from the natural sphere created a huge gulf between nature and history. To be sure, archaic societies could contrast the terror of history – the void of sheer contingent, profane facts – with the meaning of lasting cosmic order; but it was successful integration with the cosmos that allowed teleology to enter human affairs. After the scientific revolution, humans faced a new terror in the experiences, poignantly portrayed by Pascal, of living in the cosmic abyss between the infinitely large and the infinitely small (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0725513613482222">Pascal 1966</xref>: no. 199 [no.72 in Brunschvicg standard edition]; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0725513613482222">Löwith 1966</xref>: ch. 6).</p>
<p>Pascal’s warning of excessive enthusiasm for scientific method went unheeded by the thinkers of the Enlightenment. The project of the Enlightenment was to apply the method of modern science, which had been so successful in uncovering the true laws of physical nature, to the study of human society and human history in order to uncover, for the first time, the laws of social process and the laws of history. This project, however, appealed to nature as the norm, and when it became apparent that such an appeal, as an instance of the naturalistic fallacy, would fail adequately to account for the prescriptive character of moral and social life, thinkers increasingly turned to history as the norm. For, as Vico first pointedly asked, where could one turn to explain the origins of meaning and values save in the historical world, which is precisely a process of constituting meanings and values? We need not dwell on how this project could turn into historicism and wreck on the shoals of the genetic fallacy. Nor need we stress too much the obvious: the whole tenor of modern culture had been framed within the Cartesian dualism of subject confronting object. So we witness the ongoing dialectic of Enlightenment, committed loosely to methodological control of objects, and Romanticism, reacting against the Enlightenment in the name of spontaneity, individuality, images, and affects – but obviously purged of objectivity. Whitehead, Heidegger, Lonergan, and post-modernists have, of course, along with others, railed against the Cartesian framework. But it is not so easy to escape. Karl Löwith, for example, claims that Heidegger still worked within that framework and that only Hegel and Schelling surmounted it (which may be disputed) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0725513613482222">Löwith 1966</xref>: 18). We need not belabor the point, then, that modern reflections on history have often been participants in a process of intellectual decline. Still, what is most pertinent to note here is the fact that modern interest in history has generated profound and massive insight into historical existence.</p>
<p>Let us turn then, briefly, to consider four main sets of insights that in their totality mark a ‘before’ and ‘after’ in human self-knowledge. First, the subject of history is, in a qualified sense, ‘the subject’, a philosophical concept arguably unknown until modern times. Hence we can speak of a discovery. Leibniz spoke of the ‘individual notion’ of each monadic substance. The ‘individual notion’ included, to use the traditional categories, both substance and accidents. Each monad had its teleology of development, where past experiences influenced future anticipations. Breaking from the Cartesian separation of mind and matter, Leibniz saw a continuum of consciousness, or apperception, from the most primitive monads to the complex communities of monads with intellect and spirit. Notwithstanding the weaknesses in Leibniz’s system – the conceptualism, the concrete deductivism (which placed the career of each monad in the necessity of the best of all possible worlds), and the idea of pre-established harmony – he had hit upon fundamental principles of historicity. His deep impact on German philosophy is such that it is impossible to understand Kant and Hegel without recourse to Leibniz. Kant’s noumenal world (with its ‘kingdom of ends’) may, in fact, bear some resemblance to Leibniz’s monads, but Kant does not enter that territory. Instead he deduces a ‘transcendental ego’, a pure unity of consciousness without content. Hegel endows this ‘transcendental ego’ with life. He differentiates subject from substance, for what the subject is follows as a function of the subject’s own self-making, objectification, and conscious appropriation. We need not accept Hegel’s absolute idealism, theosophical influences, and dynamic conceptualism to acknowledge the compelling nature of this bold distinction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0725513613482222">Leibniz 1968</xref>: Discourse on Metaphysics, 8, 9, 13; Monadology, 7, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 22; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0725513613482222">Rescher 1967</xref>: ch. 5; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0725513613482222">Kant 1965</xref>: A107; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0725513613482222">Hegel 1967</xref>: 80).</p>
<p>Second, this ‘subject’ is implicated in a large-scale historical process of performance and interpretation. This, too, was an insight of Hegel, which he formulated in his pregnant notions of subjective spirit and objective spirit. Again, these notions shorn of the idealist trappings have had an enormous impact on subsequent reflections on the hermeneutical nature of historical life, as we see, for example, in Dilthey’s critique of historical reason, where he charted the various social and cultural systems of interaction that objectify – and interpret – what he called the activity of Life. Heidegger, of course, argued for the hermeneutics of self-interpretation as a constitutive factor in human being.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0725513613482222">4</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Third, the subject is a self-choosing self. Schelling in his later work opposed his ‘positive’ philosophy to Hegel’s merely ‘negative’ philosophy. Hegel was concerned with essence and possibility. Schelling wanted philosophy to consider existence and actuality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0725513613482222">Löwith 1966</xref>: 41–50). Schelling, for example, posited God creating the world out of complete freedom (although this freedom was explained using terms from Jacob Boehme’s theosophy). In the audience awaiting Schelling’s much-heralded Berlin lectures was Kierkegaard, who was horribly disappointed by Schelling’s presentation of his positive philosophy in terms of his philosophy of mythology and revelation. Kierkegaard eventually formulated his own positive philosophy and, arguably, discovered the ‘self’. For what are the dynamics of the subject’s actual existence? Kierkegaard answers that the subject must leap through acts of freedom into actual selfhood. The self must negotiate the tensions of existence. Each human is a synthesis, or relation, of the finite and the infinite. But the relation of finite and infinite is not the self. The self must relate itself to the relation of finite and infinite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0725513613482222">Kierkegaard 1980</xref>: 13–14). The finite is limitation; the infinite is transcendence. The relation to the relation is the negotiation of the tension of limitation and transcendence. The negotiation is done through freedom but not absolute freedom. For the relation that relates itself to itself is a derived relation. Kierkegaard is referring here to the relation of the self to God – and not a confrontational relation of subject and object. He has therefore articulated what Lonergan calls the ‘tripartite tension of existence’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0725513613482222">Lonergan 1992</xref>: 749). Thus the human subject is not the only subject present in historical process. Ironically, this was the position of Schelling, and his philosophy of mythology and revelation was intended to develop this position from the standpoint of process theology (his <italic>Potenzlehre</italic>), which attributed ‘finality’ to nature in a fashion not altogether different from that of Lonergan. But Schelling’s history of mythology suffered from too many <italic>a priori </italic>constructions. Voegelin’s <italic>Order and History</italic>, we might say, was intended to carry on Schelling’s project, but with greater devotion to empirical control and interpretation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0725513613482222">Day 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Fourth, the negotiation of the dialectic of performance and interpretation by both individuals and historical communities must carry with it norms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0725513613482222">Lonergan 2001</xref>: ch. 14). But unless one frames the issue within the Cartesian confrontation of subjects and objects, one must conclude that the norms can neither lie outside the process nor be dissociated from the call to objectivity. Habermas has correctly chided Nietzsche, Heidegger, Derrida, and Foucault, who all sought to overcome the subject-object problematic, for not taking seriously enough propositional truth and for using reason while simultaneously attacking it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0725513613482222">Habermas 1990</xref>: 92–105, 185–210, 279–82). The norms of the negotiation of the tensions of human existence are ingredient <italic>in the process of inquiry</italic> (and inquiry is <italic>historia</italic>, as we recall from Herodotus’ term). Explicit recognition of these norms does not abolish history, but it does play a role in the drama of history as it enters into the dialectic of performance and interpretation. It can foster a critical and normative historiography that is part of a cultural superstructure which can differentiate concretely progress and decline. The collaboration of functional specialties and disciplines would then enter into the concrete, ongoing negotiation of the tensions of historical existence. The data of human consciousness thus enter into the dialectic of performance and interpretation with a heightened sense of historical responsibility. The history that is written becomes a factor in lived history. The criteria reject both objectivism and subjectivism. Objective behavior is no final measure of authenticity in negotiating particular challenges and circumstances out of the context of particular abilities and opportunities. Nor are good intentions necessarily the same as the intention of the good. The criteria transcend the ideas of both the Enlightenment and Romanticism as incoherent lower viewpoints. The criteria are, at once, objective and artistic. The intelligent, reasonable, and responsible negotiation of the tensions of existence under concrete circumstances is a work of art and confers dignity on the drama of history (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0725513613482222">Lonergan 1992</xref>: 210–12). And, in words that remind us of Schelling, Lonergan describes that source of inquiry and its accompanying existential moods as a tidal wave of consciousness arising from the unconscious (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0725513613482222">Lonergan 1985</xref>: 174–5).</p>
<p>This is the existential connection. We have already framed our discussion of it in terms of Lonergan’s philosophy of history. We must now turn to the second epochal breakthrough in the First Axial Age: the differentiation of philosophy, which was itself tied, as was historical consciousness, to openness to transcendence. As the sense of history carried with it tensions and challenges, so the emergence of philosophy as a distinct way of life and cultural form created new tensions and problems – which, in Lonergan’s view, could only be handled adequately by philosophy through the further differentiation of interiority as the ‘appropriation’ of the self as knower.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0725513613482222">
<title>Philosophy and the shift to interiority</title>
<p>Lonergan sees the rise of philosophy in Hellas in terms of the emergence of a ‘cultural superstructure’ which is the dimension of culture that identifies, reflects upon, and criticizes the more spontaneous apprehensions and communications of meaning in the ‘culture infrastructure’ found in all human societies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0725513613482222">Lonergan 1974</xref>: 21, 91–2, 103–4). The task of the cultural superstructure was incarnated in the Socratic enterprise of ‘controlling meaning’ through the activity of questioning the meaning of terms used in Athenian society. Socrates not only questioned ordinary Athenians about the words they used, such as justice, piety, and courage, but he also, and more characteristically, questioned the participants in the cultural superstructure, the intellectuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0725513613482222">Lonergan 1988</xref>: 235–7). So in philosophy the cultural superstructure reflects on itself. With the differentiation of a cultural superstructure comes, according to Lonergan’s analysis, the differentiation of the intellectual pattern of experience and, along with it, of distinct modes of investigation, communities of investigators, institutional support systems, and realms of meaning. Riding on the sophisticated linguistic achievements of the epic and lyric poets, theorists investigated the fields of nature, society, and history (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0725513613482222">Lonergan 1972</xref>: 90–2, 261, with reference [90] to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0725513613482222">Snell [1960]</xref>). But the proliferation of theories gave rise to further questions about the standards of a true theory. Philosophy addresses these issues. So Plato and Aristotle dealt with metaphysical and epistemological problems. Lonergan agrees with Voegelin that the Hellenic philosophers conducted philosophy as a way of life, and were animated by their own distinct experience of the sacred through the ‘inner light’ of questions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0725513613482222">Lonergan 1985</xref>: 193). Lonergan thinks Plato and Aristotle were correct in identifying the objective of philosophy as complete intelligibility, however that was to be conceived.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0725513613482222">5</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>The cultural infrastructure, we should recall, is a ‘living history’ that informs human living through interpretations of the past – interpretations not in the mode of historical narrative or scientific history but by way of story, ritual, and celebration. The cultural superstructure, then, adds another layer of interpretation upon the spontaneous self-interpretations of the cultural infrastructure. Its theoretical culture offers interpretations of the self-interpretations. As such, the cultural superstructure is a moment within the historicity of human society. But in the ancient and medieval worlds, the cultural superstructure did not tend to so interpret itself. And this anti-historical immobilism was only reinforced by a view of the cosmos as static and hierarchical. Indeed within this scheme, as Lonergan points out, Aristotle would first investigate what is most comprehensive and lasting, and then, in light of the more comprehensive and lasting, work his way down the hierarchy of being (from being as being, to being as changing, to being as self-changing). As a result, Aristotle treated the dynamics of human thinking and inquiring within the terms of his faculty psychology, rooted in his physics and metaphysics, and this obscured his insights (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0725513613482222">Lonergan 1972</xref>: 95–6, 279–80, 310–11; 1974: 72–3, 139–40, 201, 235–6; 1988: 238–9; 1992: 151–2, 431–2; 1997: 4–5, 27; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0725513613482222">McPartland 2010b</xref>: 128–36).</p>
<p>Moreover, according to Lonergan, the fascination with logic, the splendor of concepts, and the stupendous achievements of the great philosophers tended to obscure the dynamism of questioning and the role of pre-conceptual understanding. Lonergan finds even within Aristotle this tension between inquiry and logic. In the Hellenistic period, the creative edge of philosophy was lost and the schools argued over stale dogmas, leading to a skeptical reaction. The latter only reinforced an anti-philosophical humanist culture, as in the school of Isocrates, which offered an eclectic, polished view of a cultivated person (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0725513613482222">Jaeger 1943</xref>–5: vol. 3, 46). Lonergan calls this the ‘classicist mentality’, with its standardized view of a civilization for all time defined by its canons and models. This quaternary process was repeated in the Western medieval period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0725513613482222">McPartland 2010b</xref>: 147–8). Following the creative reappropriation of theoretical culture by the scholastics leading up to Aquinas, late medieval philosophers engaged in acrimonious debate, evoking the skeptical reaction of nominalism and fostering the anti-scholastic culture of Humanism. To some extent, the dialectic of dogmatism and skepticism of the Late Middle Ages was inherited in modern philosophy in the battle of rationalism against empiricism – only to be canceled out by Kant’s much more modest role for philosophy. (Lonergan in <italic>Insight</italic> sought to counter Kant by penetrating behind the arguments of dogmatists and skeptics, not by transcendental deductions but by a focus on the self as concrete inquirer prior to objectification). In these trends, which cover almost two millennia, we discern no appreciable interest in the philosophy of history. This, to be sure, is a tendency, an ideal-type. It is not meant to ignore the brilliance of Augustine, for example, in reflecting on the theology of history, or the interest in the meaning of history by writers inspired by Jewish, Christian, or Muslim experiences. But the topic is not of serious concern for most of the major ancient and medieval philosophers. As we have claimed above, the effort to establish speculative, epistemological, and ontological philosophies of history have flourished in the last three centuries, only to flounder. If the culprit, for Lonergan, is the confrontation theory of truth, we must examine what it is and how Lonergan’s alternative – arguably itself a ‘Copernican revolution’ – can establish a new approach to the philosophy of history, and indeed requires a new philosophy of history. Let us begin with the basics of Lonergan’s approach to the issue.</p>
<p>What is obvious in knowing is perhaps that it involves something like looking. After all, simply as a human animal I am in contact with the world (‘already-out-there-now-real’) through my sensations, including looking. As a human knower, I aspire to have my ideas correspond to what is ‘out there’.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0725513613482222">6</xref>
</sup> Even the term ‘insight’, so favored by Lonergan, conveys the sense of ‘looking into’. It is not surprising, then, that most philosophers have adopted theories of knowledge based on at least the analogy of knowing as a kind of perception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0725513613482222">Lonergan 1992</xref>: 426–55; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0725513613482222">McPartland 2001</xref>: 85–94). Empiricists, literally, restrict knowing to seeing and other perceptions. Although some empiricists espouse the metaphysics of materialism, the more consistent empiricist approach would be phenonemalism and skepticism, mitigated or otherwise. Opposed to this skepticism, idealists, conceptualists, and rationalists argue that understanding goes beyond experiencing because the mind has an ‘intellectual’ look. Whatever we may conclude about the status of Plato’s Ideas, he did use the metaphor of the ‘eye of the mind’.</p>
<p>One of the most sophisticated theories of conceptualism was propounded by Duns Scotus, who posited an unconscious look at the connection of concepts as the genesis of understanding. His viewpoint was similar to that of the later rationalists (Descartes, for example, claiming a look at clear and distinct ideas). The critics of Scotus were the nominalists, who increasingly adopted an empiricism. The British empiricists were the opponents of the rationalists. Kant sought to cancel out both rationalism and empiricism, but he still assumed as his criterion of metaphysical truth an intellectual intuition. Since such an intellectual intuition is lacking, he concluded that metaphysical knowledge is impossible. Much of post-Kantian philosophy in the past two centuries has worked from within this framework, heading, with notable exceptions (particularly the German Idealists), towards more and more skepticism. Even the German Idealists incorporated the confrontation theory into their systems when they made externalization and objectification a necessary moment in the self-making of the Absolute. And, whatever else may be said about Hegel, he offered a dynamic conceptualism. </p>
<p>The advocates of scientific objectivity continue to appeal to the confrontation theory, as when logical positivists reduce all scientific propositions to sense experiences, or others extol how science salvages objectivity by methodological control of objects. The latter claim is denounced by existentialists (who basically follow in the wake of Kant’s<italic> Critique of Practical Reason</italic>) as dehumanizing. Husserl offered a way to surmount the epistemological difficulties of his age by an appeal to the data of consciousness (for which Lonergan has only praise). But his project, according to Lonergan, was really a ‘highly purified form of empiricism’, where ‘animal extroversion is attenuated from sensible perceptions to intuition of universals’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0725513613482222">Lonergan 1992</xref>: 440). Heidegger sought to counteract Husserl’s model of a transcendental ego confronting a world of objects by his emphasis on being-in-the-world, and Derrida sought to preserve language from being an object in the self-possession of a monadic subject in a monological dialogue by his recourse to semiotics. Such is the continuing sway of the confrontation theory of truth.</p>
<p>In philosophy of history, the confrontation theory spawns numerous problems and conundrums. If, on the one hand, investigations are to be objective, there can be no imposition from the horizon of the investigator. Anything like an evaluation would be precluded, and any assessment must be narrow. Historiography would be disengaged from historical life. If the approach were a purely positivist one, it would be restricted to the more palpable externals of a period under investigation, and tread gingerly lest it lose objectivity in the murky world of thought. If it could enter more fully into the horizon under investigation, it would set it out as an object equal to other historical objects (other horizons). The net effect would be a contemplation of the utter diversity of worldviews in history with no hope of a critical standpoint. The inevitable result would be to foster some kind of historical relativism. If the historical investigator, on the other hand, went from description to explanation to assessment to evaluation in the effort of taking a critical standpoint, then the investigator would be guilty of subjective intrusions, prejudices, and biases – and thus forsake objectivity. This would only support another kind of historical relativism, the relativism of the investigator. In the extreme, historiography would be either hopelessly subjective or utterly useless. Lonergan thinks Husserl was on the right track. To discern the real relation of subject and object we must attend to the data of consciousness, but do so in a more throughout and even radical manner than did Husserl.</p>
<p>‘What is obvious in knowing is not what knowing obviously is’, writes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0725513613482222">Lonergan (1992</xref>: 441). Sense experience indeed plays a role in most knowing, but it is only an element of a complex dynamic structure. If Lonergan has found an alternative to the confrontation theory of truth, then he must have different notions of ‘subject’ and of ‘object’, and of their relation. He finds the right approach in the position of Aristotle that in the act of knowing there is an identity of knower and known (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0725513613482222">Lonergan 1997</xref>: 85, 192–3, 196, 197, 202). Perhaps Hegel and Schelling were attempting to recapture this notion and escape from the confrontation theory in their philosophies of identity. But Lonergan finds the most developed version of this position in Aquinas – to the shock of many Thomists.</p>
<p>According to Lonergan, Aquinas not only follows Aristotle and has cognition start with sensations to move beyond to understanding, but he explicitly differentiates <italic>intelligere</italic> (understanding) from (<italic>dicere</italic>) (inner word, or concept) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0725513613482222">Lonergan 1997</xref>: 136, 150, 152, 188). Whereas Scotus has understanding follow from seeing the nexus of concepts, Aquinas has the opposite epistemology. Understanding is pre-conceptual; concepts are the <italic>formulations</italic> of insights (understanding) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0725513613482222">Lonergan 1997</xref>: 38–9). And Aquinas, Lonergan discovered, does more. He reduplicates the process. For understanding is also at work in making <italic>judgments</italic> about the concepts, and the expression of this ‘reflective’ understanding is the ‘yes’ or ‘no’ of judgments. Aquinas makes clear – and Lonergan emphasizes this – that the process is always in response to questions, either questions for intelligence (What is it?), or questions for judgment (Is it so?) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0725513613482222">Lonergan 1997</xref>: ch. 2). Much of Lonergan’s philosophical work was devoted to transposing Aquinas’ account of cognition out of his Aristotelian faculty psychology into the language of phenomenology, and to showing how the cognitional structure of experience, understanding, and judgment, as underpinned by questions, is present and operative in scientific inquiry, scholarly investigations, common-sense projects, and artistic endeavors. The contents of cognition differ in the different patterns of experience, they differ in different inquirers, and they differ in different historical periods. The methods differ in the different patterns of experience. But the basic structure is the same.</p>
<p>Moreover, Lonergan (in light of the discovery of the self) expands the levels of consciousness beyond cognition. The question of what is worthwhile to do with respect to my knowledge leads to moral inquiry, moral insights, judgments of value, and decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0725513613482222">Lonergan 1974</xref>: 69–86; 1972: 9–10, 30–41). Although the contents of the deliberations, evaluations, and decisions differ from person to person, community to community, age to age, the structure is the same. The operations, the structure, and the underpinning questions are, therefore, transcultural. They are also normative. For where else can one appeal to norms and standards? One cannot go outside the process of inquiry. To raise a question about the process is to engage in it. Objectivity is fidelity to the process of inquiry, both cognitive <italic>and</italic> moral. Lonergan, in fact, calls objectivity ‘authentic subjectivity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0725513613482222">Lonergan 1972</xref>: 265, 292). If one is attentive (to data), intelligent (in formulating concepts, definitions, theories, interpretations), reasonable (in making judgments), and responsible (in making evaluations and decisions) – if one faithfully pursues these ‘transcendental precepts’ – then one is being objective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0725513613482222">Lonergan 1972</xref>: 20). The performative criterion for objectivity becomes whether there are any further relevant questions (and in moral inquiry this is conscience) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0725513613482222">Lonergan 1972</xref>: 35; 1992: 309). An ‘object’ is not that which stands over against the inquirer, but that about which the inquirer questions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0725513613482222">Lonergan 1974</xref>: 121–4). There is an immediate relation of subject to object in the question, the meaning of which is inherently self-transcendent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0725513613482222">Lonergan 1988</xref>: 213).</p>
<p>We have gone over Lonergan’s alternative to the confrontation theory rapidly – and Lonergan is candid that identifying precisely what one does when one knows and decides is not easy, particularly since gaining insights cannot, strictly speaking, be imagined. But we have explained it sufficiently to draw conclusions about Lonergan’s philosophy of history. We can focus on four points.</p>
<p>First, the structure of inquiry, Lonergan emphasizes, must not be reified. It is the structure as operative in a concrete person engaged in the historical process. The person is a level of integrations (organic, psychic, and intellectual) who performs within a concrete horizon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0725513613482222">Lonergan 1992</xref>: 494–504, 538–43). This horizon is the result of past experiences, insights, judgments, evaluations, decisions as selected and interpreted in light of a range of meaningful, relevant, and significant questions to the person in the drama of existence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0725513613482222">Lonergan 2001</xref>: 205, 198–9, 288; 1972: 235–6). The person, through acculturation, socialization, and education, enters into a communal horizon (or many communal horizons), which is externalized and objectivated in technological materials, institutional cooperations, and cultural sedimentations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0725513613482222">Lonergan 1985</xref>: 106, 196–7; 1992: 232–7; 2001: 209–10, 301–5). The communal horizon is the resultant of self-interpretations of the community based on its performance in the drama of history. There is a dramatic element – and Lonergan identifies a dramatic pattern of experience – because individual and communal actors spontaneously ask about meaning, significance, and dignity as they engage in the ‘primordial drama that the theatre only imitates’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0725513613482222">Lonergan 1992</xref>: 211). There is a further element. The unrestricted nature of inquiry – about being and about the good – cannot rest except with a reality commensurate with the sweep of inquiry. The directional tendency of inquiry – Lonergan’s meaning of ‘intentionality’ – is oriented to transcendence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0725513613482222">Lonergan 1972</xref>: 101–3). And in addition to the structure of inquiry and its intentionality there is the existential state of being-in-love. Only being-in-love in an unrestricted fashion (experienced as an action and a passion, a call and a healing) can allow one to achieve full operative capacity in the process of inquiry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0725513613482222">Lonergan 1972</xref>: 105–7). Openness, then, is experienced as a gift (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0725513613482222">Lonergan 1988</xref>: 186–7). So at the heart of the historical process is a theological dimension, the experience of transcendence beyond the process. We have only touched upon the complexities of Lonergan’s analysis and the fruitful use of the resources of phenomenology and the sociology of knowledge (not to mention his theological work, which would take us beyond the philosophy of history proper). But amid all these complications, we can draw one firm conclusion. Lonergan’s philosophy of history would oppose any philosophy or ideology that would contract the complex field of historical existence, whether leaving out the person, society, nature, or the divine.</p>
<p>Second, Lonergan’s focus on the process of inquiry cuts through the disjunction of either rigid traditionalism or historical relativism. Inquiry is the source of historical difference. No technological innovation, no social organization, no political decision, no diplomatic effort, no scientific theory, no philosophical system, no historical interpretation – no answer or set of answers can exhaust or dry up or meet the demands of the process of questioning. But inquiry is also the factor of identity in history. The pattern of inquiry and the norms ingredient in the process of inquiry are transcultural. To the extent that individual agents and communities are faithful to the transcendental precepts, they are all linked as operating within ‘basic horizon’, the horizon defined by the pure desire to know and the intention of the good (McPartland 2001b: ch. 1) To the extent an historian is faithful to the exigencies of being attentive, intelligent, reasonable, and responsible, the historian’s interpretations, judgments, and evaluations are objective and not a subjective imposition on the material being investigated. To the extent the historian violates those precepts and succumbs to some kind of bias (neurosis, egoism, group prejudice, or common-sense short-sightedness), the historian is not objective and the interpretations, judgments, and evaluations are seriously flawed precisely because the historian is not operating within basic horizon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0725513613482222">Lonergan 1992</xref>: 214–31, 244–59). To the extent the historical horizon under investigation is the product of attentiveness, intelligence, reasonableness, and responsibility, the historical horizon and its social and political and cultural objectifications, its ideas and deeds, are manifestations of progress. To the extent the historical horizon under investigation violates the transcendental precepts, the historical horizon and its disordered institutions, misplaced policies, and distorted ideas are manifestations of decline (and in the limit would head for extinction). Historical scholarship can legitimately differentiate between progress and decline. Basic horizon is the source of transcendence in historical life.</p>
<p>But basic horizon never exists by itself in some transcendental world. It always operates within the relative horizons of concrete persons and concrete historical communities. Relative horizons reflect the contingencies, complexities, and challenges of specific geographical, demographic, technological, economic, political, and cultural circumstances, of personalities and events, of historical development. Relative horizons are the source of limitation. Historicity is precisely the negotiation of the tension of limitation and transcendence. And, as mentioned in the previous section, when Lonergan, as did Kierkegaard, adds the presence of a relation to the transcendent beyond, then the tension becomes tripartite. The tension cannot be evaded. Of course, there are attempts to do so – sometimes on a massive and horrible scale (empire building, radical revolution, mass diversions, grandiose conceptualist systems). But they are all futile attempts to change the human situation even as they generate their own rationalizations and faulty interpretations of the human condition. This is a stunning example of the cumulative process of decline, where inauthentic human performance leads to distorted interpretation, and distorted interpretation only contributes to even more inauthentic performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0725513613482222">Lonergan 1992</xref>: 8, 256–7, 259–60; 1972: 52–5). Here we would witness an ‘operative existential gap’ between authentic human existence and the distorted interpretations of human reality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0725513613482222">Lonergan 2001</xref>: 209–10, 298–300). The objective historical results of the existential gap are instances of the unintelligibility Lonergan names the ‘social surd’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0725513613482222">Lonergan 1992</xref>: 255). Though unintelligible, these historical results can be frighteningly real enough, involving catastrophic breakdowns and the deaths of millions.</p>
<p>Third, the dialectic of progress and decline creates the exigency for the cultural superstructure to intervene and close the existential gap. To meet the challenge the cultural superstructure must do so methodically, not by whim or chance. And here Lonergan’s detailed and nuanced cognitional theory can establish the principles of such collaboration across historical disciplines, the human sciences, philosophy, and social policy. Lonergan would see the functional link among research, hermeneutics, descriptive, explanatory, and narrative history, evaluative history, philosophy, social policy, and communications. This would be an ongoing process of encountering the past through experience, understanding, judging, and evaluation; coming to grips with basic philosophical positions as they are relevant to meeting the challenges from the encounter with the past; and developing the philosophical positions as they apply to social policies or cultural traditions in an engagement oriented toward the future. Hence the cultural superstructure would enter into the historical dialectic of performance and interpretation and display its own historicity. The ongoing and collaborative nature of the enterprise would help guard against systemic abuses. This project is rooted in Lonergan’s sophisticated epistemological philosophy of history. Thus his ontological philosophy of history (his philosophy of historical existence) grounds his epistemological philosophy of history. This enterprise bears some relation to Habermas’ notion of an ‘emancipatory’ intellectual culture committed to the open communication situation, as defined by his Kantian pragmatism. Lonergan would applaud Habermas’ defense of objectivity and his tendency toward philosophical realism, but would consider his claim that we live in a post-metaphysical age premature and too constricting on inquiry.<sup>

</sup>
</p>
<p>Fourth, differentiations in history pose the challenge of integration. As we have seen in the two previous sections, Lonergan’s speculative philosophy of history, a modest affair controlled by his epistemology (which requires constant cross-fertilization with historical investigations), discerns two great differentiations of consciousness in history, the transition from a culture dominated by myth to a theoretical culture with an emergent superstructure and the shift to interiority in philosophy brought about by modern science, modern historical scholarship, and the shift to the subject in modern philosophy. This is not a version of the positivist three-stage theory of history. The Age of Interiority has not superseded the Age of Theory any more than the Age of Theory has superseded the Age of Myth. The discovery of the self has not abrogated the discovery of the mind any more than the discovery of the mind has abrogated the efficacy of myth as a representation of mystery. As we have seen, in the first Axial Age, the great accomplishment was the differentiation (‘discovery’) of the mind and the differentiation of transcendence. With this accomplishment came a profound transformation in cultural perspective. A new integration gradually replaced, or sought to replace, the traditional integration of human society with the cosmic-divine order through the mediation of a shaman or king. The new integrating principle in the West was the mind. The mind was not a mirror of nature, but nature was a mirror of mind. Mind was the key to the dynamics of human nature. The well-ordered mind was the source of order in human society. God was pure mind. Nature was an intelligible, pre-established static hierarchy within which human nature flourished in its proper place within the hierarchy of human society. But, according to the compelling historical analysis of Louis Dupré in <italic>Passage to Modernity</italic>, by the 14th century the medieval synthesis was dissolving and nothing since has fundamentally altered the intellectual situation: ‘Modernity is an event that has transformed the relation between the cosmos, its transcendent source, and its human interpreter. To explain this as an outcome of historical precedents is to ignore its most significant quality – namely, its success in rendering all rival views of the real obsolete’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0725513613482222">Dupré 1993</xref>: 249; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0725513613482222">Blumeberg 1983</xref>).</p>

<title>Conclusion: The new integration</title>
<p>As the key to the First Axial Age, we argued, was the ‘discovery of the mind,’ so the key to its emerging successor, the Age of Interiority, is the ‘discovery of the self’ (or subject). Under the sway, however, of the confrontation theory of truth, there has gradually emerged modern versions of God, nature, and self. The critique of post-modernism is but one testimony to their inadequacy. Already in the late Middle Ages, under the influence of conceptualism and nominalism, the cosmos became an autonomous network of relations created by the arbitrary fiat of a voluntarist deity separate from the world. Human beings began to take on the trappings of the voluntarist deity. The world was no longer a mirror of mind but the product of – perhaps blind – will. The voluntarist creator would later become the distant Deist creator or would eventually be discarded as an unnecessary hypothesis or would be the object of attack by militant atheists, including the contemporary neo-atheism nourished by certain Enlightenment and positivist currents in the modern tradition (all relying on the most gross formulations of the confrontation theory, including Feuerbach’s or Freud’s theory of a projection of subjectivity onto an object). In modern reductionist culture, nature became either a machine to be dominated by world-alien human observers or a machine that could crush the independence of human objects (or perhaps a merely phenomenal reality, in which case human autonomy could be preserved). The self would either be reduced to a ‘spiritual machine’, which in the 21st century would be defined by claims of neuroscience, or the modern discovery of the self would be trivialized by numerous versions of an ‘ersatz self’, catalogued in abundant historical detail by Charles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0725513613482222">Taylor (1989</xref>). The contemporary version of the self goes beyond the earlier Romantic journey of finding one’s unique, true self, for the self is to be made, not discovered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0725513613482222">Fackenheim 1998</xref>: ch. 8). In the current interpretation, linked to a kind of crude voluntaristic subjective idealism, the self is pure self-creation, and the very activity of self-creation is its own end because the process bestows meaning on human existence. Not surprisingly, this self-creation is the goal to which all culture and politics must be subordinate.</p>
<p>Lonergan’s alternative to the confrontation theory of truth allows him to frame a new integration of self, nature, and God. We have already seen the dynamic principle of this integration. The authentic self is the person as engaged in self-transcending inquiry and negotiating the tension of limitation and transcendence. This self is not pure self-making, but must be chosen, and the choosing is a perpetual task. Authentic performance in the process of inquiry means following the norms immanent in the process but impelling the inquirer beyond. The tension extends to God as the full intelligibility and mystery (excess of intelligibility) sought in inquiry (but not reduced to human concepts), and is present in the undertow of consciousness in the experience of being in a state of unrestricted loving. The relation of the self to God strengthens the openness to inquiry and promotes fuller engagement and historical responsibility in loving openness to the universe and its emergent order. Nature is neither an object to be dominated by a subject nor a chaos of elements to which the subject must be reduced. Nature is a process, the immanent intelligibly of which is one of emergence and fuller being (Lonergan uses the term ‘finality’, drawn from Bergson).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0725513613482222">8</xref>
</sup> The human self is a participant in this process, and is indeed cosmic emergence taking responsibility for itself, in conscious co-responsibility with the divine partner.</p>
