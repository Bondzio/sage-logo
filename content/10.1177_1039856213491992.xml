<title>Conclusions:</title>
<p>The last half-century has seen major advances in psychiatry and in the roles and capacities of the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists. Over the same period, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australia has been transformed by social and political forces that have brought both benefits and disappointments to Indigenous Australians. Indigenous mental health has evolved from a marginal interest in an ‘exotic’ area to a recognised field with its own issues, competencies and training needs. In this paper, two College Fellows consider these decades of change, presenting their reflections through voices that reflect different vantages despite a common destination.</p>

<p>In 1963, the year that the (Royal) Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists emerged from the chrysalis of the Australian Association of Psychiatrists, the following table (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1039856213491992">Table 1</xref>) appeared in a pamphlet produced by the Sub-Committee on Legislative Reform of the Federal Council for Aboriginal Advancement. The pamphlet was part of a petition campaign in that year to draw attention to the lack of uniform rights for Aborigines across the nation and in support of the removal of discriminatory legislation and policies, which culminated in the Commonwealth Constitutional Referendum of 1967.</p>

<p>The 1960s began with Aboriginal affairs almost entirely controlled by states but with the Commonwealth beginning to shape a national direction across jurisdictions through the policy of assimilation that had been driven by Paul Hasluck. The referendum, carried by a 90% ‘Yes’ vote nationally, amended the constitution to enable the commonwealth to legislate in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs and to include Indigenous Australians in the national census. Nearly a half-century on, constitutional reform in support of the recognition of Indigenous Australians as the first peoples of this nation is again on the national agenda,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1039856213491992">1</xref></sup> an issue of sufficient importance that the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists (RANZCP) has declared its position and sought to influence the debate through an official position statement.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1039856213491992">2</xref></sup> In this paper, we consider how the practice of psychiatry and the College have evolved to this point of engagement and advocacy from being complicit in what Stanner<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1039856213491992">3</xref></sup> referred to as ‘the great Australian silence’ in relation to Indigenous Australians some 50 years ago. While the authors of this paper are both adult and child psychiatrists, each with clinical experience in Indigenous settings spanning decades, this paper reflects two quite different and personal views. There are, intentionally, two voices.</p>
<sec id="section3-1039856213491992">
<title>Outside looking in (Ernest Hunter)</title>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>My career in Indigenous mental health began 30 years ago in Borders Books in Ann Arbor, Michigan, where the ochre print on fern-green spine – colours redolent of tropical northern Australia – proclaiming <italic>Medicine is the law</italic>, halted my shelf-surfing. I bought that book, began corresponding with John Cawte and with his support undertook a fellowship in cross-cultural psychiatry in Hawaii (where he was a Distinguished Fellow at the East-West Centre and where <italic>Medicine is the law</italic> and <italic>Cruel, poor and brutal nations</italic> were published). (p. 170)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>So began an obituary by the first author<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1039856213491992">4</xref></sup> for John Cawte, who took up a position as a senior specialist in psychiatry at Prince Henry Hospital in Sydney under Professor Leslie Kiloh in the year of the College’s founding – 1963. Cawte’s contributions to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander mental health span nearly the whole half-century of the College’s history and he was the preeminent figure through the first 25 years as researcher, writer, editor and mentor. He was the first psychiatrist to develop a formal and sustained research agenda in Aboriginal Australia, and in the 1970s trained the first Aboriginal mental health workers and founded the <italic>Aboriginal and Islander Health Worker Journal</italic> – which continues to this day. His and his collaborators’ work appeared in the first issues of the <italic>Australian and New Zealand Journal of Psychiatry</italic> in 1967 and signalled the beginning of ‘transcultural psychiatry’<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1039856213491992">5</xref></sup> in Australia, a significant shift from earlier psychiatric engagement that has been typified as the ‘psychopathology of the exotic’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1039856213491992">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>The decade of the 1960s, then, provides an appropriate starting point to consider the roles of psychiatrists in the broader project of Indigenous mental health, fortuitously coinciding with the life of the College. Understanding their contributions demands considering two other important dimensions of change – social and political transformations on the one hand, and health and mental health sectoral development on the other. Acknowledging the impossibility of adequately representing these contextual complexities, in the following section one example of both from each decade will frame the discussion.</p>
<p>Without doubt, in relation to Indigenous affairs, the most important event of the 1960s was the Commonwealth Constitutional Referendum of 1967, which, as noted earlier, empowered the Commonwealth in Indigenous affairs – including health. The Commonwealth began to define a lead role through the Office of Aboriginal Affairs, which provided funds to newly established state Aboriginal health units. Although not exclusively (Edna Gault being an exception in Victoria), the work of psychiatrists up to and through the 1960s largely focused on remote settings, many being collaborators with Cawte, including MA Kidson, Ivor Jones, Leslie Kiloh and Barry Nurcombe. This pioneering work provided the first data on the range and burden of psychiatric disorders in remote settings.</p>
<p>Land rights became the key political issue of the 1970s following the Federal Court decision in the Gove case at the beginning of the decade, coinciding with beginning of the community controlled health services movement with the founding of the Redfern Aboriginal Medical Service and, subsequently, a national network and representative body – the National Aboriginal and Islander Health Organisation (NAIHO), the forerunner of the National Community Controlled Health Organisation (NACCHO). These were (are) powerfully political movements which defined themselves in opposition to mainstream interests and, in relation to NAIHO, as a response to the perceived failures of existing health services to meet the needs of Aboriginal patients, particularly in urban settings. These and wider tensions within the field of psychiatry are captured in the reflections of Cawte on the decade of the 1970s:<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1039856213491992">7</xref></sup><disp-quote>
<p>New red herrings are drawn across the trail for mental health. The activist group thinks that to discuss anything but land rights is sheer prevarication. The medical group fears that if mental health is supported, they will have less funding for physical health. The anti-psychiatry lobby thinks mental health programs are a plot anyway, designed to tranquillise Aboriginal people out of their anger over social oppression: psychiatry is the opiate of the masses. The alcoholism group is aware that mental health problems exist, but it feels that alcohol is the top priority. This may be right. The only thing that is not being discussed is mental health. Frankly, few people know the differences between depression and unhappiness, nor want to hear it. (p. 245)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>With the focus on remote populations continuing in the 1970s with Don Eastwell and Rod Morice in the Northern Territory joining those who had been active in the 1960s, a significant shift occurred with the sustained work of Max Kamien, John Cawte and Barry Nurcombe in Burke, which emphasised the impact of social disadvantage, and the potential of social interventions, including through early education and family relocation – approaches that fuelled accusations of assimilationist intent of psychiatry by certain Aboriginal political leaders (ironically, the Family Resettlement Program has been controversially identified as a ‘model’ for addressing particular contemporary remote Aboriginal social problems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1039856213491992">8</xref></sup>).</p>
<p>That was to change somewhat through the 1980s, particularly with the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody which brought national attention to the massive overrepresentation of Aboriginal people in custody and, consequently, to its ‘underlying causes’ (and their historical precursors). It also drew attention to Indigenous suicide, which had begun to increase from very low levels prior to the Royal Commission but accelerated dramatically in its aftermath. Psychiatrists responding to this emerging tragedy included Robert Goldney, John Spencer, Ernest Hunter and Andy Czechowicz. From 1983, with the graduation of Helen Milroy from the University of Western Australia, a trickle of Indigenous medical students and graduates coalesced to a national stream in the 1990s and the founding of the Australian Indigenous Doctors Association (AIDA) in 1998. However, arguably the most important development within the Indigenous health sector through the 1980s was the National Aboriginal Health Strategy Working Party, set up at the end of that decade and driven by Indigenous interests through NACCHO. While the report was not available until 1991, the national consultations emphasised the political context of Indigenous health and, among other outcomes, adapted a World Health Organisation definition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1039856213491992">9</xref></sup> for what is now the accepted, holistic, construction of Indigenous health.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1039856213491992">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>This was elaborated on in the early 1990s by Beverley Raphael, who with Pat Swan (later to receive the College’s Mark Sheldon Prize for her outstanding contribution to Indigenous mental health) completed a national consultancy into Indigenous mental health, Ways Forward,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1039856213491992">11</xref></sup> which states:<disp-quote>
<p>The Aboriginal concept of health is holistic, encompassing mental health and physical, cultural and spiritual health. Land is central to wellbeing. This holistic concept does not merely refer to the ‘whole body’ but in fact is steeped in the harmonised inter-relations which constitute cultural wellbeing. These inter-relating factors can be categorised largely as spiritual, environmental, ideological, political, social, economic, mental and physical. Crucially, it must be understood that when the harmony of these inter-relations is disrupted, Aboriginal ill health will persist.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Ways Forward reinforced the findings of the then recently completed National Inquiry into the Human Rights of People with Mental Illness (the ‘Burdekin report’), which identified the particular failings of mainstream systems to address Indigenous needs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1039856213491992">12</xref></sup> Two other important matters prominent later in the decade were also raised in Ways Forward. The first was the mental health consequences of policies of Indigenous child removal, which became the focus of a nationally important inquiry resulting in the ‘Bringing them home report’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1039856213491992">13</xref></sup> The second was the beginning of a definition of an alternative construction of mental health as social and emotional wellbeing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1039856213491992">14</xref></sup> Importantly, these developments were in parallel and linked to the Mental Health Strategy and the Promotion, Prevention and Early Intervention Plan in which Indigenous needs and the importance of social determinants were acknowledged. Psychiatrists active in the area through the 1990s included Beverley Raphael, Jane McKendrick (working through the community-controlled sector), Helen Milroy, Neil Phillips, Robert Parker and Graham Martin.</p>
<p>While psychiatrists were increasingly involved through submissions to the above reports, and with Indigenous mental health noted as an area of need within the National Mental Health Strategy, it was only in the mid-1990s that an ad-hoc committee was set up by Neil Phillips. The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Mental Health Committee was inaugurated in 1997 with the formation of two College Committees to represent binational Indigenous interests. The 1990s also saw the first registrars training in Indigenous mental health, one of whom was Mark Sheldon. Although Mark died in 1998 before completing training, his personal impact and unrealised potential are remembered through his dissertation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1039856213491992">15</xref></sup> and the Mark Sheldon Prize, which has been awarded annually since 2000 to recognise both College members and others for outstanding contributions to the field.</p>
<p>Two controversial social interventions in northern Australia dominated the political landscape of Indigenous affairs in the first decade of the new millennium. The Northern Territory Emergency Intervention (which involved suspension of the 1975 Racial Discrimination Act) and the Cape York Welfare Reform trial in Queensland were and are overshadowed by broader political issues and have resulted in profound divisions and debates that continue. Both are social interventions that have significant health implications. However, from a health perspective, the most important and unifying initiative was the Close the Gap campaign initiated in mid-decade after the release of an Oxfam report pointing to the need for national, coordinated investment to address persisting health asymmetries. Through this decade, psychiatrists joining those already working in the field have provided contributions to specific areas and populations, including offender mental health (Ed Heffernan), suicide (Diego DeLeo), mental health outcomes (Tricia Nagel), cognitive impairment (Dina LoGiudice), and epidemiological and population approaches (Scott Henderson, Aleksandar Janca and Tony Jorm).</p>
<p>With the beginning of the second decade of the second millennium constitutional reform is again, arguably, the key national debate, which, as with the 1967 Referendum, will be consequential for all Australians. A half-century on, then, Indigenous human rights<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1039856213491992">16</xref></sup> remains a work in progress. So, too, do all of the key issues noted above; service access remains inequitable, social disadvantage is intransigent (particularly in remote Aboriginal Australia), arrest and detention rates have continued to increase despite the recommendations of the Royal Commission, Aboriginal children are being removed from their homes at alarming (and increasing) rates, and the paternalistic social interventions in the Northern Territory and Cape York (which may be considered coercive and libertarian respectively) struggle on in a netherworld of insufficient support and dwindling commitment.</p>
<p>However, as a key Indigenous health development for the new decade, there are documented improvements in Aboriginal infant mortality rates for the first time since the 1970s (which at that time reflected service extension to remote Indigenous populations). Understandings of the critical role of pregnancy and early childhood in determining later life risk for chronic disease and early mortality<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1039856213491992">17</xref></sup> is helping to focus political and sectoral attention on early development and its social context – also the crucible of mental health and emotional wellbeing.</p>

<sec id="section4-1039856213491992">
<title>Inside looking out (Helen Milroy)</title>
<p>To write from ‘the inside looking out’ is to speak of and from a personal space and to do so as an Aboriginal person – in the first person. Ernest and I have worked and written together in the past and recognise that there are differences in the ways in which we consider or impose notions of ‘time’. This is not only about cross-cultural understandings,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1039856213491992">18</xref></sup> but about experience – about ‘being in history’. Colonisation, frontier violence, protection, assimilation, integration, self-determination… these are not just abstract terms suggesting some kind of ‘progress’ – they relate to lived experiences with tangible and personal consequences, including a widely held sense among Aboriginal people that little has really changed.</p>
<p>As a child growing up in the 1960s with an Aboriginal mother and grandmother, I learned that such ancestry in Australia meant a harsh reality and a difficult journey. In my lifetime there has been an ever-changing social and political landscape, with numerous reports, inquiries, recommendations, committees and advisory groups. Aboriginal journeys continue and it seems, at times, that we are trapped in the eye of a storm watching frenetic activity swirling around, but without direction or progress. This is despite existing knowledge about what should happen, what will work and how to do it. Why?</p>
<p>From the inside looking out, the impression is of a systemic psychosis with little hope of recovery. Although there have been gains in some areas of Aboriginal health and wellbeing, the overall outlook across the many domains reported on remains bleak. Yet despite this burden, communities, families and individuals live on within a culture that has endured since the beginning of time and continues to give meaning despite governments’ interventions – often, we are repeatedly informed, ‘in the best interest’ of Aboriginal peoples.</p>
<p>When I reflect back on what I was taught about Aboriginal Australians through primary and high school, university, and family medicine and psychiatry training, there was little content and poor understanding of what would prepare someone to work successfully with Aboriginal peoples, let alone as a clinician. Of course, there have been changes and one of the most significant advances during my career has been the development and implementation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander curricula within health courses and specialty training. In medicine, the Australian Medical Council has defined Indigenous health requirements for basic and specialist training across Australia and New Zealand for accreditation purposes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1039856213491992">19</xref></sup> This is a powerful message to universities not only to take Indigenous health seriously but to mandate competencies. The inclusion of recruitment, retention and support programmes to enable Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students to gain qualifications in health across a range of disciplines has been transformative. With the expanding Indigenous health workforce came Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health professional organisations, including AIDA, founded in 1998, the Congress of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Nurses in 1997, the incorporation of Indigenous Allied Health Australia in 2008 and the Australian Indigenous Psychologists Association in 2008.</p>
<p>Increasing mainstream competencies in Indigenous health and growing the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health workforce have promoted greater collaboration between Indigenous and non-Indigenous colleagues across multidisciplinary teams in health, as well as developing culturally safe systems of care. Indeed, the concept of ‘the other’ dissipates as the workplace becomes culturally inclusive and ideas, beliefs and strategies become part of ‘wise practice’. This has also served to demystify Indigenous health and practice, facilitating the shift within systems to accept cultural growth rather than to resist ‘exotic’ impositions.</p>
<p>This was particularly evident in the inclusion of traditional healing and traditional healers as part of mental health teams for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander families. From being ignored, demeaned or vilified through much of the last century, traditional healers have reclaimed respect within health systems. In 2009, Rupert Langkatjukur Peter and Andy Tjilari, both <italic>ngangkari</italic> from the desert lands of the tri-state area, were recognised at the College Conference in Adelaide with the Mark Sheldon Prize for their contributions to Aboriginal mental health. The RANZCP was the first medical college to recognise traditional healing in this way – a significant shift in understanding, acceptance and reconciliation in which the College led by example. Other notable contributions include: an apology to the Stolen Generations; a position statement on the role of Aboriginal mental health workers; establishing a website for Indigenous mental health education and training; the inclusion of Indigenous mental health presentations at Congress (with College subsidies for Indigenous mental health workers to attend); advocacy and submissions to government on land rights and the Northern Territory Emergency Response; and the ongoing development of Indigenous mental health training and curriculum as core competencies for all Fellows.</p>
<p>Taken together, cultural recognition and practice, mandatory training and curriculum development, Indigenous workforce development and the formation of organisations for representation and advocacy all contribute to innovative models of recovery and service provision to Indigenous populations across both mainstream and the Aboriginal community controlled sectors. While the RANZCP has been in the vanguard of these changes, there is a long way to go – the ‘gap’ is far from closed.</p>
<p>As a psychiatrist and an Aboriginal woman, I often need to draw on different voices to communicate concepts ‘from the outside in’ and ‘from the inside out’. For me, picture and story enable me to communicate between and across cultures at the same time. The following narrative was written to explore where we are in relation to broader notions of trust and safety in Australian society in order to understand healing and recovery (refer also to the front cover of this issue).</p>
<sec id="section5-1039856213491992">
<title>Talking to the moon: imagining recovery</title>
<p>Dingo and moon had been friends for as long as anyone could remember. They started off together full of joy and hope as a little pup and a new moon many years ago. Each phase of life brought different challenges. In the first phase life was wonderful and exciting and each night they would share their stories and laugh together. But in the second phase Dingo had been hunted almost to the point of extinction. At times he even had his ears cut off for a bounty of 5 shillings. For many years Dingo could no longer sleep in his country, the stench of blood in the landscape kept him awake. He cried out to moon and moon watched in despair. Moon tried to comfort dingo and remained true to her word. Moon would always be there waiting for dingo, listen to his story and send moonbeams to stay with him. In the third phase, things started to change. Dingo started to grow strong again but was still scared about what might happen. He slept with one eye open just in case. The world started to realise they needed dingo, he had a lot of knowledge and knew how to look after country. The moon looked on with renewed hope. In the fourth phase dingo and moon rejoiced once again. Although dingo was very old and tired he was at peace. He knew his children would be safe and grow even older than he was. He knew his grandchildren would remember the stories and feel proud and strong and the whole world would see how remarkable they really are. He knew his great grandchildren would walk this land and be leaders among men. Dingo had found his voice again and sang a beautiful love song to moon, thanking moon for always being at his side. Moon had grown full and bright and lit up the landscape with a golden glow surrounding dingo. Dingo smiled and said to moon, finally, I will sleep like a pup again tonight. He closed his eyes for the last time and fell into a deep sleep, dreaming of happy times. Moon smiled and watched over him, just as she had done since the beginning of time.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Over many decades, psychiatrists have listened to the stories and witnessed the lives of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples in Australia and provided enduring and supportive relationships. As such, we are a critical part of the healing journey. Perhaps our greatest contribution is yet to come in creating a sanctuary within our service environments and within the lives of our countrymen where we can rejoice together in the knowledge that we can all sleep well and wake to a safe and valued future.</p>
