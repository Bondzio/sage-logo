<abstract>
<p>Using music technology is a daily reality for music educators. The task may be as simple as readying a CD player for use in an elementary classroom or as complex as setting up a complete sound system—including microphones, mixer, amplifier, and speakers—for a live music production. One piece of music technology music educators constantly encounter is the audio mixer, usually referred to as “mixer.” Mixers, found everywhere sound is recorded or reproduced, are vital to the sound recording and reproduction process. Yet few teachers are prepared for making more than rudimentary sense of the mixer’s multiple knobs, buttons, and sliders. In this column, a framework is provided for understanding how music educators can better understand mixers by describing a mixer’s essential sections: the input, channel strip, buss, and output sections. This article also offers tips to better enable educators to use mixers.</p>

<title>The Big Picture</title>
<p>A mixer’s chief purpose is to combine different electronic sound sources for amplification, recording, or both. To accomplish this, every mixer has an input section with multiple types of audio connectors. In addition to permitting a variety of audio “plugs” (the connectors on the ends of audio cables) to be connected, the input section also increases the various “sound levels”—tiny voltages of electricity—to be compatible with the mixer. The sound signal then travels through a “channel strip” where, in addition to having its level adjusted by “faders” (sliding switches located near the bottom of the channel strip), the sound is “equalized”—that is, its timbre adjusted. From the channel strip, sound is routed to other places in the mixer via pathways termed “busses.” In this article, I will describe only the auxiliary and master busses, as those are the two that typically music educators need to know. Finally, the many signals traveling through the mixer are sent to the mixer’s output section, where the combined sounds are given a final level adjustment before being sent to another device such as an amplifier and speakers or sound recorder (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1048371312453310">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>Although all mixers share this same purpose, their complexity and size varies widely. For example, a mixer’s input section can feature as few as 2 or as many as 128 or more inputs, along with professional-grade microphone preamplifiers and specialized routing devices called “patch bays.” Likewise, a mixer’s channel strip may contain dozens of controls dedicated to equalizing a sound source. The mixer’s buss section can be simple or sophisticated, including anywhere from 2 up to 32 busses. And a mixer’s output section can feature analog, digital, or both types of outputs through which the mixed sound travels.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1048371312453310">
<title>Input Section</title>
<p>The first task of a mixer’s input section is to accept incoming audio signals from microphones or other electronic sound sources. At a minimum, a mixer must accept XLR and ¼-inch phone cables. An XLR male jack is most often found at the end of a cable commonly referred to as a “mic cable,” and on a mixer is an XLR female jack where the cable is connected. A ¼-inch male phone jack is most often found at the end of an audio cable commonly called an “instrument cable,” and on a mixer is the companion ¼-inch female phone jack. One more connection, generally present on compact mixers used in schools, is an RCA (or “phono”) jack, where signals from devices such as tape or CD players can be inputted into the mixer.</p>
<p>Though connecting an electronic instrument to a mixer is generally straightforward—connect the cable to an electronic instrument’s output jack and plug the other end into the “line in” ¼-inch phone jack on the mixer— connecting various microphones can be more problematic. To accommodate differences between two types of microphones—a “dynamic microphone” and a “condenser microphone”— a feature called Phantom Power is often included on mixers. A dynamic type microphone needs no batteries or power to function, and these are usually the microphones used in educational settings. A condenser microphone, on the other hand, needs an electrical current to function. A battery located in the microphone’s body sometimes powers this microphone type; other microphones of this type need current sent from the mixer through the mic cable to the microphone. The Phantom Power feature supplies this current to these microphones but should only be used as needed.</p>
<p>The second task of the mixer’s input section is to adjust the incoming sound levels. This is especially true with microphones, which, by nature, produce only a small electrical current that needs boosting to be compatible with the mixer. Such a device or circuit is called a “microphone preamplifier,” and its task is simply to boost the microphone’s small electrical signal. Frequently, this “mic preamp” is called the Gain Control and is located at the top of each channel strip. Correct adjustment of the Gain Control is essential to reduce the ever-present noise of electronic components while producing a strong, clean audio signal from a microphone. The amount of gain necessary to boost the audio signal depends on the sound source and microphone; a particular mixer’s operating manual will contain detailed instructions on how to set this control. The boosted signal from the input section next travels to the channel strip.</p>

<title>Channel Strip Section</title>
<p>Three critical tasks are accomplished with the mixer’s channel strip:</p>
<list id="list2-1048371312453310" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Equalization: altering the timbre of a sound source</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Audio levels: setting a channel’s audio levels relative to the levels of other sounds on others channels</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Balancing: placing the each channel strip’s sound in the stereo field</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Equalization—also known as filtering—is a process to emphasize or deemphasize particular sound frequencies. If, for example, the sound you are mixing has so much bass as to sound “muddy,” either by itself or when mixed together with other instruments, deemphasizing the lower frequencies will clarify the sound. Similarly, if a voice entering the mixer through a microphone seems “boomy,” decreasing the voice’s or microphone’s low frequencies can clarify that voice, both alone and “in the mix.” At the other end of the (frequency) spectrum, if a voice or instrument sounds “dull,” increasing the high frequency content of that sound, using the high frequency control on the mixer, can add “sparkle” and “presence” to the sound.</p>
<p>With respect to the mid-frequency portion of the sound spectrum—where most sound energy is located—equalization can be incredibly effective. Boosting the mid-range frequency content of an instrument or voice can add a sense of “girth” or “body” to sounds that may seem “thin.” Decreasing that same frequency content can often make a voice or instrument sound “clearer” with the other sounds traveling through the mixer. Mixing engineers often term this “making the sound sit better in the mix.” Beyond the basics, using equalization is more an art than a science, and the way to learn to use these types of controls is to listen closely during experimentation. The time invested in experimentation will result in successfully using the mixer as a tool to create a superior mix for performers and audiences.</p>

<title>Quick Equalizing Tips</title>
<p>The second vital task of the mixer’s channel strip section is setting sound levels in relation to the other sounds entering from other channel strips. Imagine a basic mix consisting of two channels of sound with one a singer and on the other a synthesizer playing the accompaniment. In most cases, the singer ought to be louder—that is, have a greater perceived audio level—than the synthesizer. A mixer accomplishes this by using faders, the sliding switches at the bottom of a mixer channel. Visually, the fader on the synthesizer’s channel strip will be set lower than the fader on the singer’s channel strip. Now imagine a larger mix that includes a synthesizer, soloist, and seven other “back up” singers. Now the decision-making process includes setting the synthesizer’s level in relation to the singers’ and the singers’ level in relation to the soloist. This is where mixing once again becomes an art, as the faders control the presence of a particular sound or sounds in relation to another sound or sounds.</p>

<title>Quick Level-Setting Tips</title>
<list id="list3-1048371312453310" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Make sure that all channel faders are down as cables are being connected.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>One approach to setting levels of various instruments is to first adjust the equalization and level of the most important instrument, such as a voice. From there, increase other instruments’ levels in relation to that central sound.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The channel strip’s third important task is balancing—placing various sounds within the stereo field. Humans naturally hear sounds in stereo as the sound enters through each ear; therefore, we do not interpret sounds as all coming from the same place directly in front of us (mono sound), but rather as coming from the left, right, and any point in between. The brain interprets sound in an even more complex way from the left and right (stereo) and many points, including above and below, in front and behind. Although a modern movie theater or a sophisticated “home theater” setup capitalizes on this ability to locate sounds spatially using increasingly sophisticated approaches to mixing and reproducing sound, the standard in recording and sound reproduction remains stereo—the illusion of sounds being located along a left–center–right continuum in front of us providing the illusion of height, width, and depth to sound. The pan or balance control on a mixer “places” a sound in the stereo field.</p>
<p>In a mix involving a synthesizer and solo singer, the synthesizer could be inputted into the mixer on two channel strips, with the one channel being “panned” all the way to the left of the stereo field and the other channel being “panned” all the way to the right. The singer, in contrast, could be “panned” to the center of the stereo field, thereby providing him/her center place in the stereo field. In the more complicated mix (solo singer, several backup singers, and synthesizer), the soloist could be placed in the center, the backup singers just off-center, and the synthesizer to the extreme edges of the stereo field. This would result in a mix that placed the soloist front and center in the mix, with the synthesizer enveloping the soloist and other singers. Once again, making such choices is an art rather than a science, and an audio mixer is the tool that enables these choices.</p>

<sec id="section8-1048371312453310">
<title>Buss Section</title>
<p>A mixer’s buss section is somewhat analogous to a bus station from which busses leave for a particular destination, with each vehicle taking a unique path to deliver passengers. In an audio mixer’s busses, the passengers are audio signals, and the buss is the particular path those signals take through the mixer. Because an audio mixer’s busses can be a source of great confusion, in this section I will discuss only the two most important busses for music educators:</p>
<list id="list5-1048371312453310" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>The auxiliary buss: sends an audio signal to monitor speakers on a stage</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The main stereo buss: the final mix of all the mixer’s sounds</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>On mixers, the auxiliary buss is located on the upper portion of the channel strip, directly above the equalization controls. On many mixers, this buss is labeled Aux 1; on other mixers this buss is labeled Monitor Send for extra clarity. Regardless of name, the buss serves the same function—sending signals from the channel strips to an amplifier that, in turn, is sent to monitor speakers on stage so that performers can hear themselves.</p>
<p>The advantage of using an auxiliary buss to send a signal to monitor speakers is that the mix created can be different from the main stereo mix sent to the audience through the main speakers. For example, if the singers need to hear themselves above the synthesizer and other instruments, those levels can be increased using the Aux 1 knobs, and the signal from the channel controlling the synthesizer level can be decreased. The levels you set for each channel strip using the Aux 1 knobs will not adversely change what the audience hears; the aux buss and the main stereo buss are separate paths through the mixer.</p>
<p>After the desired balance between the various sound sources is achieved using the faders near the bottom of each channel strips, these signals are sent to a Main Mix fader at the far right side of the mixer. This “master-over-all fader” controls the audio level sent from the main stereo buss to the mixer’s main outputs.</p>

<title>Quick Bussing Tips</title>
<list id="list6-1048371312453310" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>If a mixer’s Aux 1 buss knob has a switch labeled “pre” or “post,” set the switch to “pre.”</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Rarely, if ever, turn an Aux 1 above “unity gain” (labeled on mixer), or increase a channel fader above the “0” level (labeled on mixer).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Begin creating a new mix having all channel faders down completely.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Always turn on equipment with the Main Mix fader down completely.</p></list-item>
</list>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1048371312453310">
<title>Output Section</title>
<p>A mixer’s output section is where all the audio signals exit the mixer, and just as in a mixer’s input section, there are connectors for various cables. The most important connections are two male XLR jacks, one each for the left and right side of the stereo output, and two ¼-inch phone jacks, one for the left channel and one for the right. With both types of connectors present for the main stereo mix output, the output from the mixer will be compatible with most any amplifier or recording device. In addition, a second pair of RCA connectors—also known as “phono jacks”—is typically present to provide the main stereo mix output to a cassette recorder or similar consumer device. Although other esoteric connectors can be found on professional mixers—especially mixers that output a digital signal—these three types of connections cover the different situations that music educators encounter.</p>

<title>Demystifying Mixers</title>
<p>Modern audio mixers are among the most complex pieces of music technology that music educators encounter and use. Yet, even after reading a particular mixer’s operating manual carefully, many of a mixer’s features can seem inscrutable. In addition to 1) taping the operating 2) manual to the mixer so it does not become lost, and noting a colleague or parent who seems to have experience mixing sound, the best approach to learn the capabilities of a particular mixer are to experiment with the mixer’s basic features and learn to use the more complex features as needed. Taking this practical approach, a mixer’s dozens of knobs, buttons, and sliders can be demystified, and in the process a mixer will become a tool to enhance music.</p>
