<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Discrimination, unfair treatment based on personal characteristics or group membership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-0898264312440322">Williams, Yu, Jackson, &amp; Anderson, 1997</xref>), is a potential determinant of racial/ethnic health disparities among older adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0898264312440322">Anderson, Bulatao, &amp; Cohen, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0898264312440322">Clark, 2004</xref>). A recent meta-analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0898264312440322">Pascoe &amp; Richman, 2009</xref>) concluded that perceptions of discrimination<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0898264312440322">1</xref></sup> produce heightened stress responses and has a significant effect on health. Experiences of discrimination can be severe events such as being prevented from moving into a neighborhood, or routine hassles such as receiving poorer service than other people at restaurants and stores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-0898264312440322">Williams et al., 1997</xref>). Discrimination is an experience shared by most people but more often reported by racial/ethnic minorities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0898264312440322">Kessler, Mickelson, &amp; Williams, 1999</xref>), including older adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0898264312440322">Barnes et al., 2004</xref>). This may lead to a higher burden of stress among minorities that, over time, contributes to disparities in health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0898264312440322">Pearlin, Schieman, Fazio, &amp; Meersman, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0898264312440322">Sternthal, Slopen, &amp; Williams, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Interest in the relationship between perceived discrimination and health-related outcomes is apparent from several reviews of the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0898264312440322">Brondolo, Gallo, &amp; Myers, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0898264312440322">Harrell, Hall, &amp; Taliaferro, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0898264312440322">Krieger, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0898264312440322">Paradies, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0898264312440322">Pascoe &amp; Richman, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-0898264312440322">Williams &amp; Mohammed, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-0898264312440322">Williams, Neighbors, &amp; Jackson, 2003</xref>). Studies of older adults are more recent, with research finding that perceived discrimination is associated with mental health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0898264312440322">Barnes et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0898264312440322">Boardman, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0898264312440322">Jang, Chiriboga, Kim, &amp; Rhew, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0898264312440322">Jang, Chiriboga, &amp; Small, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0898264312440322">Lewis et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-0898264312440322">Taylor, Kamarck, &amp; Shiffman, 2004</xref>), physical health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0898264312440322">Barnes et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0898264312440322">Roberts, Vines, Kaufman, &amp; James, 2008</xref>), biological measures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0898264312440322">Albert et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0898264312440322">Friedman, Williams, Singer, &amp; Ryff, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0898264312440322">Lewis, Aiello, Leurgans, Kelly, &amp; Barnes, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0898264312440322">Lewis et al., 2009</xref>), and preventive service use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0898264312440322">Crawley, Ahn, &amp; Winkleby, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0898264312440322">Dailey, Kasl, Holford, &amp; Jones, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0898264312440322">Hausmann, Jeong, Bost, &amp; Ibrahim, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0898264312440322">Hausmann, Kressin, Hanusa, &amp; Ibrahim, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Within this growing body of research, the measurement of perceived discrimination is consistently noted as a limitation to better understanding its effects on health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0898264312440322">Blank, Dabady, &amp; Citro, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0898264312440322">Brown, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0898264312440322">Krieger, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0898264312440322">Paradies, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-0898264312440322">Williams &amp; Mohammed, 2009</xref>). Previous reviews have catalogued perceived discrimination measures by conceptual dimensions, exposure time frame, length, and administration type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0898264312440322">Kressin, Raymond, &amp; Manze, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0898264312440322">Paradies, 2006</xref>), assessed their psychometric properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0898264312440322">Bastos, Celeste, Faerstein, &amp; Barros, 2010</xref>), and considered their appropriateness for assessing health care discrimination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0898264312440322">Kressin et al., 2008</xref>). The applicability of measures for research within theoretical frameworks evoked in the racial/ ethnic health disparities literature, however, is less discussed.</p>
<p>The purpose of this article is to describe three theoretical frameworks—stress-process, life course, and the Public Health Critical Race (PHCR) praxis—that hold promise for explaining mechanisms by which perceived discrimination may affect the health of older adults, and to consider how these perspectives shape our understanding of the content and utility of different measures. These frameworks incorporate complementary and sometimes parallel concepts when describing the biopsychosocial factors that help explain racial/ethnic disparities in health. We discuss how discrimination would need to be measured to conduct research using each of these frameworks and review four well-known measures of perceived discrimination in terms of their applicability. In addition to identifying measurement issues in studying mechanisms by which discrimination affects health, our approach also illustrates the process of reviewing measures for appropriateness to particular research questions, including potential modifications that might be needed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-0898264312440322">Stewart, Thrasher, Goldberg, &amp; Shea, 2012</xref>).</p>

<title>Stress-Process Models</title>
<p>Conceptual models of the relationship between stress and health posit that chronic stress generates psychological and physiological responses that accumulate over time to produce poor health outcomes. <italic>Chronic</italic> stressors are persistent and ongoing whereas <italic>acute</italic> stressors are those occurring relatively infrequently, such as negative life events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0898264312440322">Cohen et al., 1998</xref>). Numerous studies have concluded that stress has a negative effect on an individual’s well-being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0898264312440322">Lazarus &amp; Folkman, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0898264312440322">Leventhal &amp; Nerenz, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0898264312440322">Segerstrom &amp; Miller, 2004</xref>). The effects of chronic stressors are considered more deleterious than acute stressors because of an increased likelihood of long-term changes in physiological responses that may lead to increased disease risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0898264312440322">Cohen, Janicki-Deverts, &amp; Miller, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0898264312440322">McEwen, 1998</xref>); our focus is thus <italic>everyday discrimination</italic>, chronic and relatively mundane experiences of unfair treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-0898264312440322">Williams et al., 1997</xref>). Stress-process models suggest that membership in social categories such as racial/ethnic minority groups, low socioeconomic status, and old age may make individuals more likely to experience stressors such as discrimination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0898264312440322">Dilworth-Anderson, Williams, &amp; Gibson, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0898264312440322">Pearlin, Mullan, Semple, &amp; Skaff, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0898264312440322">Son et al., 2007</xref>). For example, Black and American-born Hispanic adults living in Chicago had a higher prevalence of high scores across eight stress domains (including multiple types of discrimination) and greater clustering of high stress scores after controlling for socioeconomic status than Whites and foreign-born Hispanics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0898264312440322">Sternthal et al., 2011</xref>). Frameworks used to help explain health disparities such as allostatic load (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0898264312440322">McEwen &amp; Seeman, 1999</xref>), weathering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0898264312440322">Geronimus, 1992</xref>), and embodiment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0898264312440322">Krieger, 2005</xref>) consider the health effects of chronic social stressors in general whereas Clark and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0898264312440322">Clark, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0898264312440322">Clark, Anderson, Clark, &amp; Williams, 1999</xref>) describe a stress-process model specific to the health effects of perceived racism (discrimination attributed to race/ethnicity).</p>
<p>The stress associated with perceived discrimination has a negative effect on physical and mental health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0898264312440322">Pascoe &amp; Richman, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-0898264312440322">Williams &amp; Mohammed, 2009</xref>), but the relationship may not be a direct one. The original stress and coping model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0898264312440322">Lazarus &amp; Folkman, 1984</xref>) suggests that an individual’s overall level of stress and consequent psychological reactions is influenced by an interaction between an initial assessment of stressfulness (<italic>appraisal</italic>) and availability of resources to mitigate the stressor (<italic>coping</italic>). Appraisals of stressful events are often stronger predictors of health outcomes than the frequency of those events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0898264312440322">Gonyea, O’Connor, Carruth, &amp; Boyle, 2005</xref>). Worse appraisals of stress and a low sense of control are associated with poorer health and well-being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0898264312440322">Jang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-0898264312440322">Watson, Logan, &amp; Tomar, 2008</xref>). However, there is little empirical evidence to date that the stressfulness of perceived discrimination is related to health because most existing studies use measures that lack an appraisal component. This is a fruitful area for further study.</p>
<p>The way that individuals’ cope with perceived discrimination may also affect its relationship to health. Research has found that perceived discrimination is associated with both emotional (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0898264312440322">Brondolo et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0898264312440322">Hamilton, Agarwal, Carter, &amp; Crandell, 2010</xref>) and behavioral (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0898264312440322">Hamilton et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0898264312440322">Mwendwa et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0898264312440322">Rankin, David, &amp; Collins, 2011</xref>) coping. Furthermore, discrimination-related coping can be independently related to both poor health outcomes such as higher lipid levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0898264312440322">Mwendwa et al., 2011</xref>) and also mediate the relationship between perceived discrimination and poor health outcomes such as preterm birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0898264312440322">Rankin et al., 2011</xref>). For perceived discrimination, seeking social support can be considered a coping strategy along with approach and avoidance coping, problem-focused coping, and emotion-focused coping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0898264312440322">Brondolo, Brady Ver Halen, Pencille, Beatty, &amp; Contrada, 2009</xref>). Assistance received from an individual’s support network can be conceptualized in ways ranging from the size of an individual’s support network to an individual’s satisfaction with the assistance that he or she is receiving. Satisfaction with social support has been shown to be related to better outcomes in older adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0898264312440322">Clay, Roth, Wadley, &amp; Haley, 2008</xref>). As psychosocial resources that contribute greatly to group and individual differences in resilience to stressors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0898264312440322">Clay et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0898264312440322">Goode, Haley, Roth, &amp; Ford, 1998</xref>), the study of the health effects of perceived discrimination among older adults would benefit from greater attention to coping and social support.</p>
<p>Some implications for addressing stress-process concepts in discrimination measures include the following:</p>
<list id="list1-0898264312440322" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p><italic>Assess chronicity of reported discrimination experiences.</italic> A measure that includes a count of reported discrimination experiences does not necessarily address chronicity if it is not a potentially ongoing experience over weeks, months, or years. Negative life events (e.g., being fired from a job, being stopped by a police officer) are acute stressors even if they occur more than a couple of times over a lifetime. Although both types are important, measures should place greater emphasis on experiences of discrimination that are ongoing (e.g., regular race-related harassment by coworkers).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Assess stressfulness of reported discrimination (appraisal)</italic>. An individual’s appraisal of its stressfulness is a critical component of the experience of discrimination and a key domain of the stress-process model that is included in some but not most existing discrimination measures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0898264312440322">Landrine, Klonoff, Corral, Fernandez, &amp; Roesch, 2006</xref>). To be responsive to this model, measures should have respondents rate the stressfulness of each reported experience.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Assess coping strategies for reported discrimination experiences.</italic> Specific coping strategies may be effective for reducing the stress associated with perceived discrimination on some dimensions but have no effect on others. Therefore, for individuals who report perceived discrimination, it is important to assess how they dealt with the event (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0898264312440322">Brondolo et al., 2009</xref>).</p></list-item>

<title>Life Course Models</title>
<p>Health research among older adults requires study of conditions that affect individuals over their entire life span (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0898264312440322">Dannefer, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0898264312440322">Ferraro &amp; Shippee, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0898264312440322">Ory &amp; Chesney, 2002</xref>), such as exposure to discrimination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0898264312440322">Anderson et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0898264312440322">Glymour &amp; Manly, 2008</xref>). Life course perspectives on health are ideally suited to this task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0898264312440322">Fuller-Iglesias, Smith, &amp; Antonucci, 2010</xref>), although application to racial/ethnic health disparities research is relatively recent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0898264312440322">Lynch, 2008</xref>). The life course perspective can be traced to Glen Elder’s conceptualization of human development and aging as a product of transitions, turning points, and durations over the changing social contexts of individual lives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0898264312440322">Elder &amp; Johnson, 2003</xref>). The life course is composed of multiple, interdependent <italic>trajectories</italic> or pathways that describe changes over time in individual experience in a specific life sphere (e.g., work, family). Aging-related experiences over the life course arise from the interaction between human agency and social structure, varying within individuals and across groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0898264312440322">Elder &amp; Johnson, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0898264312440322">Settersten, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Theories of cumulative advantage/disadvantage and inequality describe how resources and risk exposures (negative or hazardous stimuli) build over time and are socially stratified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0898264312440322">Dannefer, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0898264312440322">Ferraro, Shippee, &amp; Schafer, 2009</xref>). These theories arose from Merton’s ideas about the how the advantaged use their resources to accrue more advantage, known as the Matthew effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0898264312440322">Merton, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0898264312440322">Rigney, 2010</xref>). Advantage not only reduces exposure to risks but also provides opportunities through access to networks, resources, and prestige (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0898264312440322">Dannefer, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0898264312440322">Merton, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0898264312440322">Rigney, 2010</xref>). Disadvantage increases exposure to risk and constrains access to networks, resources, and prestige (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0898264312440322">Dannefer, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0898264312440322">Ferraro et al., 2009</xref>). An example of this process is research showing that education confers less benefit to the health of Blacks than Whites and this discrepancy in benefit widens over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0898264312440322">Shuey &amp; Willson, 2008</xref>). Cumulative disadvantage or inequality thus is not only an outcome but also a process that produces inequalities across the life course (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0898264312440322">Dannefer, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0898264312440322">Ferraro &amp; Shippee, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Public health researchers drew concepts from life course sociology and cumulative advantage/disadvantage/inequality theories to develop the field of life course epidemiology, which considers how the timing and cumulative exposure to risks and protective factors influence health outcomes across groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0898264312440322">Alwin &amp; Wray, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0898264312440322">Ben-Shlomo &amp; Kuh, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0898264312440322">Kuh, Ben-Shlomo, Lynch, Hallqvist, &amp; Power, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0898264312440322">Lynch &amp; Davey Smith, 2005</xref>). There is strong conceptual and empirical support for the contention that childhood conditions influence adult outcomes including health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0898264312440322">Ben-Shlomo &amp; Kuh, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0898264312440322">Furumoto-Dawson, Gehlert, Sohmer, Olopade, &amp; Sacks, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0898264312440322">Glymour &amp; Manly, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0898264312440322">Hertzman, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0898264312440322">Lynch &amp; Davey Smith, 2005</xref>). Age at migration, for example, is one life course factor that may influence the accumulation of disadvantage and increased risk for ill health among elderly Mexican migrants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0898264312440322">de Oca, Garcia, Saenz, &amp; Guillen, 2011</xref>). Three models describe the different (though overlapping) pathways by which exposure to risk and protective factors accumulate over time and interact to influence health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0898264312440322">Ben-Shlomo &amp; Kuh, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0898264312440322">Hertzman, 2004</xref>). In a latent effect (chains of risk) model, early exposures to risk and protective factors are the primary determinants of future health outcomes. The cumulative model suggests that combined, repeated exposure to risk and protective factors across the life course produces a greater effect than exposure at just one point in the life course on future health outcomes. The pathway model suggests that early experiences set individuals on a life trajectory, modifiable by intervening factors, which produce future health outcomes. Such models as originally conceptualized may not fully capture the interactive nature of the social forces that help produce racial/ethnic health disparities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0898264312440322">Colen, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0898264312440322">Glymour, Ertel, &amp; Berkman, 2010</xref>). However they are an important starting point when exploring exposures (e.g., discrimination) that cluster by social characteristics such as race/ethnicity, age, gender, and socioeconomic status over the life course (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0898264312440322">Colen, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0898264312440322">Furumoto-Dawson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0898264312440322">Glymour et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0898264312440322">Hertzman, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0898264312440322">Hicken, Gragg, &amp; Hu, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>The life course perspective has important inferences for the study of discrimination and health among older adults. One is that the stress and other negative consequences of discrimination can be conceptualized as risks that accumulate over time. As the life spans of older adults are by definition long, life course models help to more fully account for the many exposures they have had that contribute to present health but that may be missed by cross-sectional assessments. Discrimination experienced in the past (e.g., ever occurred in one’s life) may have different effects on health than recently experienced discrimination (e.g., in the past year; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0898264312440322">Landrine &amp; Klonoff, 1996</xref>), as is seen with distal stressors that have an effect on health independent from the influence of more proximal stressors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0898264312440322">Ensel &amp; Lin, 1996</xref>). Life course epidemiology also describes factors that are potentially relevant to the study of perceived discrimination and the health of older adults: (a) the location of an individual in time and the place (<italic>context</italic>) in which the discrimination occurred; (b) periods of rapid individual change during which exposure to discrimination may more strongly effect development and subsequent disease risk than at other times (<italic>sensitive periods</italic>); (c) the extent to which continued, repeated exposure to discrimination causes body systems to age and become less amenable to repair over time (<italic>cumulative disadvantage</italic>, a narrower construction than the original sociology definition); (d) how discrimination affects changes in health over time (<italic>trajectories of health</italic>); and (e) the differing experiences of discrimination for those born at different points in history (<italic>birth cohort effects</italic>). Studies incorporating a life course perspective thus would explicitly address the role of time in producing the health effects of discrimination among older adults.</p>
<p>Some implications for addressing life course epidemiology concepts in discrimination measures include the following:</p>
<list id="list2-0898264312440322" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p><italic>Capture change in chronicity and stressfulness of discrimination over time (trajectories)</italic>. Trajectories can be modeled of outcomes (e.g., health) and risk exposures (e.g., discrimination). Trajectories are affected by human agency, personal experiences, or characteristics such as resiliency and coping, social support; available resources, and social conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0898264312440322">Elder &amp; Johnson, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0898264312440322">Settersten, 2003</xref>). Researchers should explore whether exposure to risk increases, decreases, or remains stable over the life course and the degree to which disadvantage is reversible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0898264312440322">Ferraro et al., 2009</xref>). Therefore, measures should ask participants to consider how their experiences of discrimination changed over time.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Specify the time frame in which the reported discrimination occurred, with particular emphasis on early life (sensitive periods)</italic>. Items that ask if a respondent ever had a particular experience in their lifetime do not differentiate an event that happened 50 or more years ago as a child from one that happened last week as an older adult. For example, racial/ethnic minority older adults have noted that it was not unusual for teachers to tell minorities that they did not have a bright future (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr104-0898264312440322">Yen, Stewart, Scherzer, &amp; Perez-Stable, 2007</xref>), and African American women have recounted the profound cognitive and emotional impact of childhood racism experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0898264312440322">Nuru-Jeter et al., 2009</xref>). Such discriminatory interactions occurring during early life may impact the way individuals perceive themselves and the world around them and should be explicitly assessed in measures of discrimination by linking experiences to specific time frames (e.g., “during childhood” or “before age 18”).</p></list-item>

<title>Public Health Critical Race Praxis</title>
<p>Another way to study the health effects of perceived discrimination is to use the PHCR. PHCR is not a behavior-change theory aimed at predicting causal relationships. Rather it is an antiracism methodology that outlines strategies and provides tools for systematically and rigorously applying critical race theory, which originated in the field of jurisprudence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0898264312440322">Crenshaw, Gotanda, Peller, &amp; Thomas, 1995</xref>), to the study of health inequities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0898264312440322">Ford &amp; Airhihenbuwa, 2010</xref>). There are four phases to PHCR research: (a) accurately assessing contemporary patterns of racial relationships; (b) considering how racial biases may inadvertently influence the immediate project (e.g., investigators’ a priori assumptions); (c) conceptualizing and measuring racism-related factors; and (d) intervening on the causes of observed disparities. PHCR is rooted in social justice; therefore, research based on the praxis aims not only to reflect methodological rigor—for example, in developing meaningful measures of concepts such as discrimination, racism, and race—but also to ensure that concerns of racial equity undergird the research process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0898264312440322">Ford &amp; Airhihenbuwa, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>A key concept of PHCR is <italic>race consciousness</italic>. Race consciousness means to be aware of and to explicate the ways in which racism may be operating. This approach contends that is impossible to identify the root causes of racial/ethnic disparities without explicitly investigating racism’s potential contributions to them. Race consciousness challenges the notion of colorblindness, which pervades the early 21st century and views racism as having minimal relevance to contemporary disparities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0898264312440322">Bonilla-Silva, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr103-0898264312440322">Winant, 2004</xref>). Color blindness attributes racial disparities fundamentally to socioeconomic factors or to people’s behaviors, whereas race consciousness emphasizes the mechanisms by which racism contributes to the disparities. PHCR studies demonstrate race consciousness in all aspects of the research process—from formulating research questions, to carrying out research in minority communities in ways that are respectful and empowering of them, to drawing on communities to interpret study findings. This approach therefore suggests that traditional studies of racial/ethnic disparities risk conflating race effects with racism effects. That is, because race is socially constructed, differences observed between racially defined groups generally reflect inequities stemming from racism, not race or racial differences. To be consistent with PHCR, disparities research should clearly explain the relationship linking any observed racial differences to the racism mechanisms hypothesized to generate them.</p>
<p>Three other PHCR concepts are particularly relevant to studies of discrimination and health among older adults: ordinariness; the need for racism measures to reflect the time periods of interest; and intersectionality. First, racism is an ordinary and integral aspect of the social environment in racially stratified societies such as the United States. This perspective, called <italic>ordinariness</italic>, challenges the widely held but contestable notion that racism exposures are rare, intentional, and discrete (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0898264312440322">Bonilla-Silva, 2006</xref>). Second, as with life course models, PHCR stresses that discrimination measures appropriately reflect the ways that discrimination functions during the time of interest to the study. Overt forms of discrimination such as segregated hospitals were common prior to 1965 and, therefore, are relevant when assessing older adults’ cumulative or early life experiences. In contrast, more subtle forms of discrimination (e.g., not being offered the same follow up care that other patients are offered) are common today. While the same term, discrimination, may describe both of these, the underlying nature of the exposures differs. Finally, <italic>intersectionality</italic> posits that individuals inhabit multiple, overlapping social statuses and more than one status may be marginalized or stigmatized (e.g., Black gay men). The effects of stressors on people who occupy multiple minority social categories (e.g., racial minority and sexual minority) may be synergistic, exceeding the independent effects of membership in each category (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0898264312440322">Meyer, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Some implications for addressing PHCR concepts in discrimination measures include the following:</p>
<list id="list3-0898264312440322" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p><italic>Employ race consciousness</italic>. A measure that explicitly assesses racism exposures is race conscious; however, the opposite is not necessarily true. That is, just because a measure does not explicitly assess racism does not necessarily mean it is not race conscious because race consciousness may lead to some other way (i.e., other than explicitly asking about racism) of assessing racism exposures. Another implication of taking a race conscious approach is the importance of using measures that reflect how discrimination actually functions “in the real world.” Historical research or policy analysis can inform the development of measures so that they meaningfully capture salient racial patterns in society. For instance, civil rights laws prohibit discrimination in hiring on the basis of race. Minorities, therefore, may be hired at comparable rates as their nonminority counterparts, but experience subtle forms of discrimination in which they are afforded few opportunities for promotion. Accordingly, measures should assess the subtle forms of discrimination (e.g., being hired but not promoted on the job) that more accurately capture the ways that discrimination is likely to operate currently.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Address the ordinariness of racism</italic>. Discrimination measures that operationalize racism exposures as ubiquitous, chronic, everyday stressors (e.g., being followed while shopping because of race) reflect this ordinariness concept.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Assess intersectionality</italic>. Measures that attribute unfair treatment to only one basis (e.g., race) may not account for the interlocking ways that other social categories (e.g., gender, immigrant status) compound the perceptions and experiences of discrimination. For example, unfair treatment attributed to language and perceived immigrant status may be of particular relevance to Latinos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0898264312440322">Perez, Fortuna, &amp; Alegria, 2008</xref>) and Asian/Pacific Islanders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0898264312440322">Gee, Ro, Shariff-Marco, &amp; Chae, 2009</xref>). It may be difficult to determine the extent to which perceptions and exposures to discrimination related to language use are distinct from those tied to perceived immigrant status or race/ethnicity. Although people may not always know which aspect(s) of their identity matter most for a particular discriminatory experience, allowing respondents to choose more than one attribute for their experiences helps to address intersectionality.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Operationalize discrimination measures so that they are specific to the time period(s) of interest to the study</italic>. For older adults, both overt and subtle discrimination should be assessed as their lives encompass historical periods when one or the other was more prevalent. As with the life course perspective, operationalizing discrimination measures so that they are appropriate for and specific to the time period(s) of interest is necessary to understand the underlying mechanisms by which discrimination contributes to disparities.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Understand how racial/ethnic minority groups differ in their experiences of discrimination.</italic> PHCR urges researchers to be cautious when choosing between group-specific discrimination measures or measures designed to be used across diverse groups. Some forms of discrimination operate universally across groups (e.g., exclusion of group members) but others may be group-specific (e.g., the process by which the systematic exclusion occurs) and reflect unique histories and circumstances. For example, Asian Americans are more likely to be stereotyped as immigrants and African Americans more likely to be stereotyped as criminals. Although both groups share the experience of being stereotyped, the implications may differ depending on the stereotype. Differences and similarities in the way discrimination operates across groups may also influence responses to race-specific items. For example, describing the phenomenon as racial/ethnic discrimination rather than unfair treatment attributed to race/ethnicity can affect the prevalence of self-reported discrimination, which participants report discrimination, and the relationship with health outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0898264312440322">Bastos et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0898264312440322">Brown, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0898264312440322">Shariff-Marco et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-0898264312440322">Williams &amp; Mohammed, 2009</xref>).</p></list-item>

<title>Using Theory to Select and Modify Measures of Perceived Discrimination</title>

<title>Everyday Discrimination Scale</title>
<p>One of the most commonly used measures in public health research on perceived discrimination and health is the Everyday Discrimination Scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-0898264312440322">Williams et al., 1997</xref>), which assesses “chronic, routine, and relatively minor experiences of unfair treatment.” The measure asks respondents the basis to which they attribute the unfair treatment (e.g., race/ethnicity, gender, socioeconomic status). The Everyday Discrimination Scale was designed for use across racial/ethnic groups. It was originally tested with primarily African American and White samples, but has demonstrated good internal consistency in other racial/ethnic groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0898264312440322">Gee, Ryan, Laflamme, &amp; Holt, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0898264312440322">Gee, Spencer, Chen, &amp; Takeuchi, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0898264312440322">Perez et al., 2008</xref>). An example of its use in aging research is a study that found that reports of everyday discrimination were associated with elevated diastolic blood pressure among African Americans but not Whites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0898264312440322">Lewis et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section11-0898264312440322">
<title>Stress-process models</title>
<p>The Everyday Discrimination Scale was specifically designed to assess <italic>chronic</italic> instances of unfair treatment, experiences that occur consistently over time. A key limitation to using this measure with stress-process models, however, is that there are no items to <italic>appraise</italic> the stressfulness of the chronic experiences. Thus, a potential modification would include such rating for each reported unfair treatment, e.g., “how stressful is this experience to you in general?” on a scale of 0 to 3 with 0 being not at all stressful and 3 being very stressful. Finally, the full version of the measure includes items addressing the strategies used to cope with discrimination.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0898264312440322">
<title>Life course models</title>
<p>Everyday Discrimination Scale items have no specific time frame associated with them, as respondents are asked if any of the chronic events “ever” happened to them. For application in life course studies of discrimination, a potential modification would be to address changes over time in the experiences of discrimination, that is, <italic>trajectories</italic> of perceived discrimination. The Jackson Heart Study Discrimination Instrument (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0898264312440322">Sims, Wyatt, Gutierrez, Taylor, &amp; Williams, 2009</xref>), partly based on the Everyday Discrimination Scale, includes an item comparing the frequency of unfair treatment from early life to present time. Another possible modification would be to frame each experience during a specific time period (e.g., childhood up to age 18, past year). This could help pinpoint <italic>sensitive periods</italic>.</p>

<sec id="section13-0898264312440322">
<title>Public Health Critical Race praxis (PHCR)</title>
<p>The ubiquity and chronicity of everyday racism that undergirds the PHCR concept of <italic>ordinariness</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0898264312440322">Delgado &amp; Stefancic, 2001</xref>) is reflected in the Everyday Discrimination Scale. As respondents may choose multiple options for attribution, the measure may be used to explore the intersecting effects of discrimination due to co-occurring social categories. The PHCR approach views racism as operating differently across groups and so a potential modification would be adding follow-up questions to obtain additional information about the nature of discrimination exposures and whether subtle differences exist across groups.</p>

<title>Experiences of Discrimination Scale</title>
<p>The Experiences of Discrimination Scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0898264312440322">Krieger &amp; Sidney, 1996</xref>) was one of the first measures developed specifically for public health research and demonstrates psychometric equivalence across racial/ethnic groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0898264312440322">Krieger, Smith, Naishadham, Hartman, &amp; Barbeau, 2005</xref>). Like the Everyday Discrimination Scale, the Experiences of Discrimination Scale was designed for use with racially diverse samples. The attribution for each experience is set at “race, ethnicity, or color” with no other options. An example of its use in aging research is a study that found that perceived discrimination was associated with more patient-reported problems with care among African American and White military veterans with diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0898264312440322">Hausmann et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section15-0898264312440322">
<title>Stress-process models</title>
<p>The items describe experiences in a variety of settings that are acute and chronic; adding more of the latter would strengthen its application to the <italic>chronicity</italic> concept. The measure does not include any way to <italic>appraise</italic> the stressfulness of each reported experience but does ask how participants generally <italic>cope</italic> with unfair treatment.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-0898264312440322">
<title>Life course models</title>
<p>A limitation of the Experiences of Discrimination Scale for life course research is that no specific time frame is provided for reports of discrimination.

<p>The Schedule of Racist Events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0898264312440322">Landrine &amp; Klonoff, 1996</xref>) was specifically designed for African Americans, and items attribute the reported experiences to respondents’ Blackness. The measure assesses the frequency with which African Americans encountered racial discrimination in the past year and over their lifetimes as well as the stress associated with any reported events. The General Ethnic Discrimination Scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0898264312440322">Landrine et al., 2006</xref>) is a modified version that changed the attribution for each experience from “because you are Black” to “because of your race/ethnicity.” An example of the use of the Schedule of Racist Events in aging research is a study that found that greater perceived racism was associated with depression among older African Americans with diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-0898264312440322">Wagner &amp; Abbott, 2007</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Existing discrimination measures have significantly contributed to our understanding of the determinants of racial/ethnic health disparities. The four measures reviewed in this article have been used successfully in research among older adults, and two have been validated in community-dwelling samples of older adults—Everyday Discrimination Scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-0898264312440322">Taylor et al., 2004</xref>) and Index of Race-Related Stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-0898264312440322">Utsey et al., 2002</xref>). These measures also incorporate (to varying degrees) features that enable them to use concepts from theoretical approaches relevant to research on the health effects of discrimination.</p>
<p>However, no discrimination measure has yet been specifically developed with an aging perspective that addresses older adults’ unique developmental and social circumstances. We recommend that aging researchers use cognitive interview pretesting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0898264312440322">Napoles-Springer, Santoyo-Olsson, O’Brien, &amp; Stewart, 2006</xref>) and other pretesting methods with their selected discrimination measure (modified or unmodified) to ensure that the items are understandable but more importantly applicable to the older adults in their study. Moody-Ayers and colleagues, for example, modified the Perceived Racism Scale to eliminate items identified in pretesting as not relevant to the older African Americans with type II diabetes in their study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0898264312440322">Moody-Ayers, Stewart, Covinsky, &amp; Inouye, 2005</xref>). Although we have suggested examples of modifications that address some conceptual gaps related to the stress- process, life course, and PHCR praxis frameworks, some changes could alter—sometimes radically—the measure developers’ original purpose (e.g., changing a group-specific measure to one that would be used in diverse groups; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-0898264312440322">Stewart et al., 2012</xref>). The ideal solution, of course, would be to develop discrimination measures specifically designed and validated for use in health disparities research among diverse older adults.</p>

<sec id="section27-0898264312440322" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Advancing research on the health effects of perceived discrimination in older adults will require thoughtful consideration of the measurement implications of theoretical frameworks relevant to the study of racial/ethnic health disparities. Researchers have a wide variety of perceived discrimination measures from which to choose, and employing the perspective of stress-process, life course, and/or the PHCR praxis frameworks may assist in the selection of the most appropriate measure for their study. Although we highlighted these particular frameworks, the process of evaluating the conceptual appropriateness of a specific measure described in this article can be used with any theory. Such considerations will help us to better understand how discrimination experienced over a lifetime contributes to racial/ethnic health disparities among older adults.</p>

<p>We consider discrimination to be an action or behavior that causes harm regardless of perception by the target individuals or groups. In this article, we are primarily concerned with <italic>perceived</italic> discrimination and its consequences when discussing theoretical linkages between discrimination and health, as well as <italic>self-reported</italic> discrimination when discussing implications for measurement. The latter is perceived discrimination that has been formally or informally acknowledged to others (e.g., submission of a grievance at work, answering a confidential survey, or discussed with friends and family). A long line of social-psychological research has explored factors that promote or inhibit reporting of discrimination, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0898264312440322">Crocker &amp; Major (1989)</xref>.</p>
