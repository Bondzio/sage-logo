<abstract>
<p>This article explores the different patterns of political transitions under two military dictatorships in Southeast Asia. Burma and Indonesia were former colonies which gained independence from the British and the Netherlands in 1948 and 1945 respectively. General Ne Win ruled Burma for over two decades (1962–88) and General Suharto ruled Indonesia for over three decades (1967–98). The article examines why Burma remained a military dictatorship after the downfall of the Ne Win-led Burma Socialist Program Party (BSPP) government, while Indonesia transitioned to a democratic society with the collapse of the Suharto-led New Order government. The article argues that a lack of a unified and established civilian leadership, coupled with the army’s reluctance to relinquish power, led to another military coup in Burma, whereas the military in Indonesia encouraged the emergence of a civilian government by establishing and strengthening bureaucracies.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>General Ne Win ruled the Union of Burma<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0021909611430936">1</xref></sup> for over two decades from 1962 to 1988 during which the country underwent significant changes. Similarly, General Suharto ruled Indonesia from 1967 to 1998 during which the country witnessed several reforms. On the one hand, at the end of the Ne Win era, the military entrenched its role within Burmese politics. On the other hand, at the end of the Suharto era, Indonesia transitioned to a democratic society. The consequence of Ne Win’s regime is the continued military dominance in Burmese politics until today. Conversely, the departure of the Suharto regime led to the emergence of the world’s third largest democratic nation. Why did Burma not become a democratic country after the resignation of Ne Win in 1988, unlike Indonesia which became a democratic country with the resignation of Suharto in 1998? Why was there no military retrenchment with the downfall of Ne Win when there was with Suharto?</p>
<p>In seeking to answer these questions, the article uses historical explanatory method to analyze materials from books, journals and biographies, magazine, newspapers, and internet sources. The article traces the historical events of the two countries to understand the causality of different patterns of regime change. It further attempts to answer why similar dictatorial regimes led to contrasting patterns of political transitions, despite a similar desire for democracy by a vast majority of the people. Another point of similarity between these two countries is that they were both under colonial rule. Burma was granted independence by the British on 4 January 1948, and Indonesia gained independence from the Netherlands on 17 August 1945. The comparison between the two cases will contribute to the existing literature on regime change and political transitions in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>Existing literatures on transition from dictatorial regime to democracy discuss several challenges confronted by the new governments. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0021909611430936">Herz (1978</xref>: 561), the most difficult choice is the dilemma ‘between policies of at least temporary discrimination, in order to eliminate the danger (from right or left) of restoration of dictatorship, and freedom for all groups and factions to organize and operate’. Some argue that civil society is a necessary condition for democratic transition. One among them is <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0021909611430936">Bernhard (1993)</xref> who asserts that:
<disp-quote>
<p>Modern democracy, as well as the limited forms of representative government that preceded it, have only existed in conjunction with a civil society. It constitutes the sphere of autonomy from which political forces representing constellations of interests in society have contested state power. Civil society has been a necessary condition for the existence of representative forms of government including democracy. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0021909611430936">1993</xref>: 307)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Is civil society always a necessary condition for democracy to emerge, if not flourish? Can this statement be generalized? Analyzing the condition of civil societies in Burma after the collapse of the Ne Win government and the downfall of the Suharto regime in Indonesia can help us to understand the role of civil societies in democratic transition.</p>
<p>The modernist approach on regime type or regime change considers broad structural factors that can be conducive to either authoritarianism or democracy. The most studied socioeconomic conditions linked to economic development or modernization are ‘level of per capita income, the extent of literacy and education, the degree of urbanization, and the quality and extent of communications media’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0021909611430936">Gasiorowski, 1995</xref>: 882). According to modernization theory, low levels of these socioeconomic factors are conducive to authoritarianism and its higher levels are conducive to democracy. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0021909611430936">Gasiorowski (1995</xref>: 892) in his article ‘Economic Crisis and Political Regime Change: An Event History Analysis’ argues that ‘economic crises trigger democratic transition in a manner that is similar to their effect on breakdown’. Can modernization theory or Gasiorowski’s argument explain the different patterns of political transitions in Burma and Indonesia? In order to analyze these differing patterns, the historical backgrounds of the two dictatorial regimes are studied here.</p>

<title>Burma under Ne Win</title>
<p>In order to understand the socio-political changes that took place under Ne Win, it is important to know his character and personality and the manner in which he came to power. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021909611430936">Aung-Thwin (1989</xref>: 144) describes the personality of Ne Win as a ‘superstitious and short tempered ruler who relies both on astrologers and the intense loyalty of subordinates, is likely to control Burmese political developments, no matter who is titularly at the helm of government’.</p>
<p>If this description were taken as a basis of reasoning, how and why could such an individual become a leader of an independent nation? Was his ascendancy to power because of his ingenuity? According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0021909611430936">Steinberg (1990</xref>: 90), Ne Win was someone who ‘has been in the limelight since the early 1940s, when he was trained by the Japanese for anti-British activities as one of the “30 comrades” along with Aung San – the father of Burmese independence’.</p>
<p>In the years leading up to the military coup in 1962, the government of the Union of Burma was confronted with several domestic challenges. Since its independence from the British in 1948, Burma had not engaged in any major conflict with any other countries. Burma’s major political problems have been within its borders – armed conflicts with ethnic minorities (erstwhile frontier peoples) and the communist insurgents. The political unrest and disturbances arising out of insurgency movements were too troublesome for the weak civilian government in Rangoon. In the spring of 1949, the insurgents had controlled most of the rural areas, and even controlled the capital Rangoon intermittently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0021909611430936">Liang, 1990</xref>: 19).</p>
<p>The armed groups made two different political demands. While the minorities demanded political autonomy under a federal system of government, the communists fought to replace the central government. The minorities felt that any negotiation with the Rangoon government was pointless unless the issue of federalism was tabled for a serious discussion. In an effort to build trust and establish reconciliation with the country’s minorities, Prime Minister U Nu offered to hold a dialogue, which was opposed by the Burmese military under the command of General Ne Win (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0021909611430936">Kipgen, 2010</xref>: 167).</p>
<p>The military government made three different attempts to reach ceasefire agreements with ethnic armed groups. The first talk between the government and the Karen National Union (KNU) took place during the military caretaker government between 1958 and 1960. General Ne Win initiated the second peace talk during his Revolutionary Council government between 1963 and 1964. Except for the surrender of a section of the Karen group and some communist leaders, the talk was unsuccessful. The third peace talk took place between Ne Win’s socialist government and the armed groups between 1980 and 1981. Ceasefire agreement with the Kachin Independence Organization (KIO) was reached but the government rejected most of the KIO demands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0021909611430936">Oo and Min, 2007</xref>: 8–11).</p>
<p>Some scholars argue that transition from a civilian government to military dictatorship can happen due to the incompetence of civilian leadership. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0021909611430936">Ricci and Fitch (1990</xref>: 56) argue that a civilian government needs leaders and bureaucrats who have experiences and skills on how to effectively communicate with the public. The government needs to understand the needs of the people and be able to provide them. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0021909611430936">Kipgen (2011)</xref>, however, argues that
<disp-quote>
<p>Experiences do not matter if leaders pursue failed policies, or when a few powerful individuals dictate policies. In authoritarian regimes such as Burma and North Korea, experiences or expertise do not really matter when it comes to policy decision-making because all major policies are decided by military dictators. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0021909611430936">2011</xref>: 52)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>While the problems of ethnic insurgencies and the communist armed campaign were largely responsible for the political instability in the country, there were also political divisions within the ruling Anti-Fascist People’s Freedom League (AFPFL) that threatened the U Nu government. The ruling AFPFL political party split into two factions – the Clean (led by U Nu and Thakin Tin) and the Stable (led by Ba Swe and Kyaw Nyein). The split of AFPFL further destabilized the civilian government. Consequently, Prime Minister U Nu invited General Ne Win (army chief) to form a caretaker government and hold a new election.</p>
<p>After 16 months of Ne Win’s interim government, U Nu resumed premiership after his party won a landslide electoral victory in the 1960 election. With his return to power, the prime minister planned to hold a meeting with ethnic minorities on the issue of federalism. Before U Nu could announce his peace proposals, Ne Win and his cohorts overthrew the government by a military coup on 2 March 1962 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0021909611430936">Human Rights Documentation Unit, 2000</xref>: 8). The Tatmadaw’s (armed forces) claimed that the 1958 military caretaker government was its first coup (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0021909611430936">Smith, 2007</xref>: 29).</p>
<p>Another reason for the military coup, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0021909611430936">Maung (1989</xref>: 40), was that the country under civilian government had not only become ‘factionalized’ and ‘ultranationalist’, but it had veered away from the principles of socialism, which General Aung San always stood for. As a ‘patriotic soldier’, Ne Win felt that it was his moral duty to protect the country from further deterioration. The military claimed that the coup was necessary to subdue ethnic insurgency and to prevent the country from disintegration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0021909611430936">Rajah, 1998</xref>: 135).</p>
<p>With the military in control of the government, the parliament was dissolved; all political parties and its associated activities were banned. A new government called the ‘Revolutionary Council’ was established under the chairmanship of Ne Win. The military formed its own political party called Burma Socialist Program Party (BSPP) in July 1962. Several drastic changes were implemented under the new government. Within a couple of years between 1963 and 1965, private institutions such as banks, industries and large shops were nationalized. The currency notes of 50-kyat and 100-kyat were devalued (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0021909611430936">Fink, 2001</xref>: 29–32).</p>
<p>Why was the Ne Win government successful in consolidating its rule despite opposition from the public? There were two important reasons behind the success of the military regime. First, during the military caretaker government from September 1958 to February 1960, General Ne Win earned the trust of many by appointing a number of civilian leaders in his cabinet. Moreover, as promised, he also allowed the election to be held successfully in 1960 and handed power back to U Nu, who was overwhelmingly re-elected for the prime minister post. Such political gesture from Ne Win earned him the trust of many people. Many got the impression that the army chief was not only a good soldier, but also could be a good administrator as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0021909611430936">Maung, 1989</xref>: 37–38).</p>
<p>The other important reason for the success of military dictatorship was because of its cohesive institution. When a military leadership hierarchy develops into a dominant and cohesive institution, individuals pay greater importance to a common cause than individual concerns. Even in the face of threats or dangers, the military personnel express their loyalty to the institution by upholding unity among themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0021909611430936">Guilmartin, 1997</xref>: 23–24).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0021909611430936">Kipgen (2011)</xref> explains the important reason behind the stability of the Burmese military government.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Despite the apparent internal grievances within the low ranking officers of the Burmese military junta, there is an established cohesive institution. This cohesiveness is mainly due to an entrenched repressive leadership with stringent regulations that makes it difficult for disgruntled officers to openly voice their discontents. Moreover, in the absence of alternative robust institutions, such as civil societies or elected democratic establishments, the cohesiveness of military institution has been difficult to penetrate. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0021909611430936">2011</xref>: 55)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>After a couple of decades, on 5 September 1987 the military government further announced the demonetization of 25, 35, and 75-kyat currency notes that had tremendous impact on the entire nation. About 60 to 80% of all the circulated money became worthless. The announcement came at a time when university students were to pay their fees. Affected students came out in thousands to protest the government’s sudden decree, and the protest turned into violence. To prevent further violence, the government closed down all universities across the country. In response to criticisms from different quarters, the government clarified that the decision was necessary to disrupt money laundering by insurgents and black marketers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0021909611430936">Lintner, 1994</xref>: 273).</p>
<p>With the introduction of the ‘Burmese Way to Socialism’, the BSPP was the only official political party in power. Although Ne Win was opposed to federalism, his government attempted to bring the different ethnic groups for a discussion during the 1963–4 ‘peace parley’. Different armed groups, mostly ethnic minorities, sent their representatives, including the National Democratic United Front (NDUF), red flag Communist Party of Burma (CPB), Kachin Independence Organization (KIO), KNU, and the newly-formed Communist Party of Arakan, Noom Suik Harn, and some other Shan forces. The NDUF was an umbrella organization of four different armed groups – CPB, Karen National United Party (KNUP), Karenni National Progressive Party (KNPP), and New Mon State Party (NMSP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0021909611430936">Smith, 2007</xref>: 32).</p>
<p>The parley failed to address the genuine concerns of ethnic minorities. The ethnic minorities complained that they were not invited for a discussion, but rather to give up their demand for federalism. Ne Win was concerned that making formal ceasefires with ethnic minorities would lead to disintegration of the country. Ne Win’s strategy was to ‘isolate Burma from the world, while establishing a centralized system of government under parallel Tatmadaw and BSPP structures that would radiate out from Rangoon into the ethnic minority borderlands’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0021909611430936">Smith, 2007</xref>: 32). The response to the policy was a proliferation of armed movements from ethnic minorities, including the Kayan New Land Party, Rohingya Patriotic Front, Palaung State Liberation Party and three Shan forces – Shan State Army, Shan United Revolutionary Army (SURA), and Shan United Army (SUA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0021909611430936">Smith, 2007</xref>: 32). Ne Win’s suppressive policy generated a ‘cycle of insurgencies’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0021909611430936">Smith, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>The BSPP policy of the Burmese ‘way to socialism’ failed to resolve insurgency problems. During the years from 1968 to 1975, the country witnessed some of its fiercest armed conflicts in decades. With the nationalization of all educational institutions, media and business establishments, the gap between the Burman-led Rangoon government and ethnic minorities was widened. No political parties were allowed to form and, as a result, there were no opposition groups other than the armed organizations in the territories of ethnic minorities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0021909611430936">Smith, 2007</xref>: 33).</p>
<p>Amidst the growing ethnic tensions, Ne Win pushed through his political agenda in a widely-disputed referendum. Subsequently, a new constitution was introduced in 1974 that demarcated ethno-political boundaries. The constitution, which was borne out of socialist ideologies, formally changed the country’s name to the Socialist Republic of the Union of Burma. The country’s political map was redrawn to create seven divisions and seven states. The divisions were areas dominated by ethnic Burmans, whereas the states were territories of ethnic minorities: Chin, Kachin, Karen, Kayah, Mon, Rakhine, and Shan. The whole strategy of the Ne Win-led BSPP government, which was dominated by retired or serving military officers, was viewed as a Burmanization policy by ethnic minorities. The mutual distrust between the Burmans and ethnic minorities escalated insurgency problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0021909611430936">Smith, 2007</xref>: 33–35).</p>
<p>The policy of the BSPP government continued to alienate ethnic minorities. The fundamental difference between the Burman-led Rangoon government and other minorities was due to the former’s refusal to the latter’s demand for a federal government where each ethnic group would enjoy autonomy. While the minorities perceived federalism as the only way to protect and safeguard their culture, language and identity, the government construed it as a harbinger for the disintegration of the Union of Burma.</p>
<p>The Ne Win-led government continued to explore possible ways to neutralize the demands of the ethnic minorities by devising different suppressive tactics. The ethnic armed groups soon realized that no single group was powerful enough to militarily confront the Burmese army in the long run. Such realization paved the way for the formation of the National Democratic Front (NDF), an alliance of different armed groups, in May 1976. It was the first of its kind in Burmese modern history in which ethnic minorities came together to resist the Burmese military aggression under one umbrella organization. In an attempt to earn the support of the international community and the majority of the Burman population, the NDF dropped all secessionist demands in 1984. The NDF began to set up joint battalions at three different fronts across Burma, and simultaneously sent its representatives to lobby the international community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0021909611430936">Smith, 2007</xref>: 37).</p>
<p>The socio-political problems deteriorated in the aftermath of the demonetizations in 1985 and 1987. One important objective of the Burmese way to socialism was to improve the economic conditions of the country and its people. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0021909611430936">Boot (2003</xref>: 5) describes the BSPP economic policy as ‘unsuccessful in mobilizing more resources or in increasing government budgetary expenditures relative to gross domestic product (GDP). By the mid-1970s, government revenues amounted to only about 12% of GDP, a sharp decline from the late 1950s’. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0021909611430936">Table 1</xref> shows the slow growth of economy, as compared to other Asian countries.</p>

<title>Transition from Ne Win Government</title>
<p>The leadership of Ne Win was immensely affected when the United Nations reduced the economic status of Burma to a ‘Least Developed Country’ in 1987. As this news spread, the Burmese people began to lose their confidence in Ne Win’s leadership, which served as a ‘catalyst’ for Ne Win to lose his cultural and political bases. Thousands of students organized protests in Rangoon and other cities across the country. Teachers, monks, children, professionals and trade unionists also joined in large numbers. Subsequently, Ne Win resigned from the BSPP chairmanship on 23 July 1988. Two fundamental reasons for the public outburst were due to ‘Ne Win’s maneuvering with cultural traditions or sanctions, and the bursting of the economic bubble under the mounting pressure of inflation and economic stagnation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0021909611430936">Maung, 1990</xref>: 615). Massive demonstrations finally brought down the BSPP government. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0021909611430936">Duch (1995</xref>: 152) says that ‘economic hardships led citizens to punish incumbents but have only limited impact on their support for democratic capitalism’.</p>
<p>The black market that was tolerated throughout Ne Win’s era got out of control. For instance, the price of rice in the black market had reached above 700% of the government rate in March 1988, which increased to over 800% by the time of Ne Win’s resignation. The price of other essential commodities such as cooking oil, fish, shrimp, and sugar also rose to over 500% of the official market price. There were shortages of essential supplies at the market, and the gap between elites and the public became unbearable. The economic misery was exacerbated by high inflation. The people had no choice but to protest in the streets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0021909611430936">Maung, 1990</xref>: 615).</p>
<p>Following continued massive pro-democracy demonstrations, Ne Win loyalists and supporters in the army violently suppressed the uprising. The worst single day of massacre happened on 8 August 1988 when soldiers fired upon unarmed marchers, leaving hundreds dead. The killing continued for days and thousands, mostly students, were killed (though official figures has never been released). Hundreds of demonstrators were arrested and many thousands more fled to neighboring countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0021909611430936">Ghosh, 2001</xref>: 160–161). The Ne Win era ended but the military stepped in to form a new party called the State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC), similar to the former BSPP. General Saw Maung, chairman of the SLORC who ordered the crackdown, claimed to have saved the country from disintegration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0021909611430936">Smith, 2007</xref>: 38).</p>
<p>Many believed that the man who called ‘the shots’ from behind the scene was still Ne Win (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0021909611430936">Thomas, 1997</xref>). Two Burmese native historians even suggested that Ne Win himself ‘triggered the uproar’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021909611430936">Aung-Thwin and Myint-U, 1992</xref>: 74). The SLORC government announced that it would hold general election to re-establish a democratic society. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0021909611430936">Tun (2011</xref>: 82) calls the military’s initiative an ‘effort of the government to gain legitimacy by letting the world know that they were working toward democracy’.</p>
<p>With the resignation of Ne Win and the collapse of the BSPP government, there were high hopes in the minds of many that democracy would prevail. Since no other political parties were officially allowed to function during the BSPP government, there was no civilian political party(s) ready to form an interim government. With the downfall of the BSPP government, several civil societies began to re-emerge. Actors, artists, civil servants, lawyers, and housewives formed several unions and joined the protests against the military regime. Even people who had worked for the BSPP government and several other military establishments for years resigned and joined the civilian movement. Different independent newspapers, magazines, and pamphlets were introduced. The media outlets did not only cover the ongoing political unrest but also provided fresh ideas on how to move forward with the country’s democratization process. Since the soldiers were confined to their barracks, maintaining law and order became a major problem. The Buddhist monks stepped forward to provide security and simultaneously encouraged the public to protest the ‘evil spirits’ of the country, indirectly referring to the military government (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0021909611430936">Fink, 2001</xref>: 58–60).</p>
<p>There was a leadership crisis in the aftermath of the BSPP government. Although there were several civil societies and professional unions at the local level, there was no recognized national organization to lead a new government. Students led the protests, but were not in a position to form a government on their own. In addition, there were differences of opinion among veteran politicians themselves. During these uncertain days, the former Prime Minister U Nu announced on 9 September 1988 that he had formed a government. However, most people no longer had faith in his leadership and disapproved of his cabinet appointees, many of whom were his family members or old friends. Meanwhile, rumors spread that the military was regrouping to stage another coup.</p>
<p>On 11 September 1988, the military announced that it would hold a multi-party election, thus abandoning its earlier announcement of holding a referendum first whether the people like a one-party or multi-party system. An imminent coup increased the sense of urgency in the students and veteran politicians who campaigned to end the military dictatorship. Sensing the urgency, student representatives and veteran politicians visited foreign embassies in Rangoon to seek their opinions on forming an interim government. After receiving some positive feedback from the embassies, they convened a meeting on 13 and 14 September 1988.</p>
<p>Five politicians, including U Nu and Aung San Suu Kyi, and the student community represented by Moe The Zun, attended the meeting where the student leader urged for the politicians to set aside their differences and form an interim government within 48 hours. Former Prime Minister U Nu insisted that everyone should support his government, which other attending leaders were unwilling to do. Some of the leaders wanted to wait and see if the military would fulfill its promise of holding a multi-party election. As a result, the meeting ended without reaching an agreement. The student leaders continued their mobilizations for forming an interim civilian government by holding meetings with different professional unions and leaders, including Aung San Suu Kyi. While the students were putting together different sets of ideas and plans, the military saw the absence of any formidable civilian government. Taking advantage of the prevalent situation, the military staged another coup on 18 September 1988, 38 days after the worst massacre (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0021909611430936">Fink, 2001</xref>: 60–62).</p>

<title>Indonesia under Suharto</title>
<p>Today, Indonesia is not only the most populous Muslim country on earth, but also the third largest democratic nation, only next to the United States of America and India. Indonesia declared independence from the Netherlands in 1945, but the country experienced internal political problems for many decades. Notably the era of Suharto from 1967 to 1998 was unforgettable for many. The dictatorial regime finally ended in 1998 paving the way for a democratic government.</p>
<p>What took over three decades to bring down Suharto and his cohorts? Was the prolonged survival of the regime due to its repressive tactics, or was it due to the absence of alternative political parties or civil societies? Did the Indonesian people prefer the dictatorial regime to other forms of government? How and why did the regime eventually collapse? Before delving into these questions, it is important to know who Suharto was and how he came to power. In his review of Suharto’s biography, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0021909611430936">Yee (2002)</xref> writes that:
<disp-quote>
<p>Suharto was born near Yogyakarta in Central Java, in 1921, but some mystery surrounds the details. He claimed to be from poor peasant stock but his education, connections with the lower echelons of government, and later indifference to his native village suggest he was the illegitimate son of someone relatively well-placed. During the war he joined Peta, the Japanese-organized Indonesian army, as a platoon commander. In the Indonesian Revolution he saw service around the headquarters of the Republic in Yogyakarta. This involved him in factional conflicts and coup attempts such as the 3 July Affair and the Madiun Affair, which contributed both to his distrust of civilian politicians and his opposition to communism.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The era of Sukarno (1945–66), Suharto’s predecessor, was marked by political factionalism and power struggle among three different parties, one of which was the Indonesian Communist Party. At that time, the party was the third largest communist party in the world. In the process of power transition from Sukarno to Suharto, approximately half a million communists were exterminated with the objective of dismantling and destroying the communist party and its supporters from Indonesian national politics.</p>
<p>Many have debated the legacy of the Suharto regime both domestically and internationally. On the one hand, some tend to highlight the excessive use of power during his dictatorial regime, which deprived millions of Indonesians’ of their fundamental democratic rights. On the other hand, some others focus on his economic successes and achievements for Indonesia. One among them is <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0021909611430936">Schwarz (1997)</xref> who notes in his article ‘Indonesia after Suharto’ that the Indonesian exports reached US$50 billion in 1996, double the value from 1991. He writes:
<disp-quote>
<p>During Suharto’s tenure, tens of millions of Indonesians have been rescued from poverty. A burgeoning middle class in the cities of Jakarta, Surabaya, and Medan lives in fancy new apartments and shops in gleaming malls. Foreign investors pour billions every year into new factories, putting the sons and daughters of poor farmers to work making everything from Reebok sneakers to Sony televisions. A stable and increasingly prosperous Indonesia provides ballast and leadership to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, with Suharto playing the role of the region’s elder statesman. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0021909611430936">1997</xref>: 119)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The Indonesian economy performed well in the 1970s with an annual growth rate of GDP of 5.4%. Its economic growth rate was better than those of other member states of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, and it was moving closer to the level of newly-industrializing nations. By 1995, the country was listed in the category of a middle-income class with per capita income of close to US$1,000, an increase from less than US$100 at the beginning of the Suharto’s New Order development plan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0021909611430936">Tirtosudarmo, 1997</xref>: 298). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0021909611430936">Table 2</xref> provides the growth of Indonesian economy during the era of Suharto’s New Order government.</p>

<p>Suharto’s ability to establish total control over the bureaucratic structure was primarily due to the solid support he received from the military. Moreover, his political opponents, who were deeply divided among themselves, were unable to build an alternative political force that could challenge his rule. Many of the growing middle class – although they wanted to see Suharto’s removal – were also worried about their own future since many of them had their fortunes linked to the regime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0021909611430936">Schwarz, 1997</xref>: 120–121).</p>
<p>Suharto began his army leadership in October 1965 following the assassination of all the army general staff at the unsuccessful 30 September 1965 coup attempt, during which he was army Major General. He commanded the army strategic forces and established himself as the supreme leader of the army, which thwarted a coup attempt at the presidential palace by the leftists in conjunction with leaders from the communist party. By the end of 1967, Suharto had accomplished purging the leftists and loyalists of President Sukarno and extended his power base to other bureaucratic services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0021909611430936">Said, 1998</xref>: 536).</p>
<p>Suharto apparently learned how to effectively put the army under control from his past experiences under General AH Nasution, the most important military leader in the 1950s and early 1960s. Nasution was unsuccessful in controlling the heavily politicized army during President Sukarno’s ‘Guided Democracy period’ (1959–65). To prevent the politicization of the army, Suharto initiated some significant steps by restructuring the armed forces. In doing so, he downgraded ‘the services’ chiefs of staff, eliminating power to command troops; disbanding intelligence, planning, budget, and political sections; and reducing the size of elite troops’. By implementing several structural changes, Suharto successfully consolidated maximum power and authority on the army leadership. The restructuring of the system also helped Suharto to unify and depoliticize the military as minister of defense in 1969 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0021909611430936">Said, 1998</xref>: 536).</p>
<p>In the process of strengthening army leadership in the government, Suharto removed army generals who were known to be ‘New Order Militants’. The military leaders HR Dharsono, Kemal Idris, and Sarwo Edhie Wibowo were once army commanders dominating the Java region, the power base of Suharto during his power struggle with Sukarno in the early days of the New Order government. Although these army officers supported Suharto, they also developed their own versions of New Order politics. Suharto appointed new political leaders whom he could trust and rely upon. The sweeping changes culminated in 1969, which gave Suharto greater power and control of the military command structure. By the 1970s, he became the ‘undisputed’ military and political leader (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0021909611430936">Said, 1998</xref>: 536–537). With the solid support from the army leadership, Suharto’s New Order government continued to focus on economic development. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0021909611430936">Table 3</xref> provides the distribution of workforce in different sectors for a period of nearly two decades.</p>

<p>General Suharto assumed the presidency of Indonesia in March 1967, and was elected to office by the People’s Consultative Assembly for five consecutive years for a five-year term each since 1968. After his re-election in March 1988, there were discussions as to who would replace him. Suharto hinted his plan to step down in 1993, but relinquishing the unhindered power and authority he enjoyed for over two decades was easier said than done. Whether he would name a successor to continue the authoritarian rule or pave the way for democracy was something many observers anxiously awaited. Given the solidity of his New Order regime, there were few who had hoped to see a democratic transition after the departure of Suharto. Some even suggested that representative democracy for the New Order leaders was incompatible with national unity and economic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0021909611430936">Liddle, 1992</xref>: 443–444).</p>
<p>For the first time since his ascendancy to power in the late 1960s, a political rift between Suharto and the army leadership became public over the selection of his vice-president at the People’s Consultative Assembly in 1988. Suharto picked his long-time patronage chief and minister for the state secretariat, Lieutenant General (retired) Sudharmono, but the army leadership openly rejected this. The army leadership disliked him for the simple reason that Sudharmono was an ex-army lawyer and not one of the uniformed generals. He was also accused of seeking civilian support in the bureaucracy and among the Muslims. After their defeat in the assembly, the army leadership took over the district and provincial branches of the <italic>Golkar</italic> party, signaling that the president would not have enough support at the party’s national congress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0021909611430936">Liddle, 1992</xref>: 455).</p>
<p>The Asian economic crisis in 1997 had a tremendous impact on the politics of Indonesia, particularly the fate of Suharto. Before the financial crisis hit Indonesia, the country enjoyed an annual growth of 7.5%. If it had continued to maintain the economic growth until 2005, the World Bank predicted that Indonesia’s gross domestic product per capita would reach over US$2,300 and become one of the world’s 20 largest economies. In an attempt to help sustain the Asian financial crisis, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) injected more money in October 1997. However, it could not prevent the crisis from happening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0021909611430936">Wibowo, 2001</xref>: 127).</p>
<p>In November 1997, 16 banks were closed on the advice of the IMF which sent an alarming signal to the public. In an attempt to protect the rupiah currency, the Indonesian central bank increased its interest rate to 50% which further forced smaller banks to close down because of their inability to keep up with the interest rate. The inflation rate rose significantly and reached 80% at one point. The worst economic panic came in January 1998 when the rupiah hit its lowest value at 17,000 to a dollar, from 2,400 six months earlier. As a result both domestic and foreign investors abandoned the rupiah currency. The value of the rupiah was stabilized a couple of weeks later, but people had lost faith in the stability of the currency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0021909611430936">Wibowo, 2001</xref>: 128–129).</p>

<title>Transition from Suharto Government</title>
<p>All the financial woes and the economic crisis were blamed on Chinese businessmen, who reportedly amassed greater wealth than all of Indonesia. In an effort to save the rupiah, the government-owned television was involved in escalating the tension. The Chinese were accused of causing or deteriorating the economic crisis that immensely affected the vast majority of the Indonesian people. There were reports that 3% of the Chinese population controlled 70% of the Indonesian economy. Such reports escalated ethnic hatred against the Chinese community. Consequently, Chinese establishments were attacked in several places across the country and attacks finally reached the capital Jakarta in May 1998. The Suharto government was unable to stop violence against the Chinese community and its establishments. The damage caused by the riots in Jakarta alone was estimated to be about 2.5 trillion rupiah, and 2,244 lives were lost (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0021909611430936">Wibowo, 2001</xref>: 129–130). Thousands of students protested outside parliament demanding the president’s resignation. Besides losing the support of the army, his ‘key ministers had deserted him’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0021909611430936">Donald, 2000</xref>). Amidst violence, Suharto resigned on 21 May 1998. He then named Bacharuddin Jusuf Habibie as his successor. Habibie was in power during the transitional government from 21 May 1998 to 20 October 1999.</p>
<p>Initial attempts to weaken the military’s influence in the government had begun in the early 1990s with the appointment of a civilian leader in Golkar, a political party of the military or the Angkatan Bersenjata Republic Indonesia (ABRI). Subsequently, the ABRI’s representation in the Legislative Assembly (also known as Dewan Perwakilan Rakyat or DPR) was reduced from 100 to 70 before the 1998 election. Because of the involvement of ABRI in the Suharto regime, the organization was renamed as Tentera Nasional Indonesia (TNI) in October 1998. To further weaken the political status of the TNI, the national police force was separated from the TNI in April 1999. The maintenance of internal security and other domestic issues came under the responsibility of the police and not the military. The changes were not only meant to deprive the military’s power of domestic security issues, but also to minimize possible ‘intensified’ political violence and to prevent the military from acquiring political mileage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0021909611430936">Ganesan, 2001</xref>: 11–12).</p>
<p>In January 1999, the representation of the TNI in the DPR was further slashed to 38 seats, with the eventual goal of total separation from the DPR. The share of TNI representations in the provincial legislatures was also reduced from 20 to 10%. Moreover, during the 1999 general election, the TNI showed its neutrality by not endorsing Golkar as its political party. The TNI had also agreed to end the dual-function role with Majelis Permusyawaratan Rakyat (MPR). Abdurrahman Wahid was then elected as the fourth Indonesian president who held office from 20 October 1999 to 23 July 2001. Wahid’s government broke the army’s control of the appointments of the commander of the armed forces (PANG TNI), minister of defense and security (MENHANKAM), and removed Daerah Operasi Militer or Military Operations Area (DOM) status from Aceh (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0021909611430936">Ganesan, 2001</xref>:12).</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0021909611430936">Lai and Slater (2006</xref>: 116) suggest that ‘Authoritarian regimes with stronger party institutions are more effective purveyors and organizers of elite patronage than regimes that lack them’. The military regimes in Burma and Indonesia were so effective and powerful that no political space was available for any opposition parties for decades. Ne Win was supported by the BSPP, while Suharto enjoyed the solid backing of the ABRI and the Golkar. The cohesiveness within the military hierarchical structure prevented any internal and external threats. However, at the end, two similar military dictatorships ended in two different political transitions.</p>
<p>The argument that the presence of civil society is a necessary condition for a democratic transition does not convincingly explain political transitions in both Burma and Indonesia. In the case of Burma, several civil societies and professional unions were formed after the collapse of the BSPP government, but none of them was able to withstand the repressive forces of the military. However, one can argue that the gap between the demise of the BSPP government and the September military coup was too short for a strong civil society to emerge. Although Ne Win resigned and his government no longer functioned officially, the military institution remained largely intact.</p>
<p>As soon as the BSPP government became dysfunctional, there was a political vacuum. However, there was no single civilian authority to lead the country. One important difference between the Ne Win era of Burma and the Suharto era of Indonesia was in their contribution to bureaucratic restructuring. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0021909611430936">Tun (2011</xref>: 88) ‘Suharto formed a bureaucracy consisting of competent bureaucrats and developmental elites’ which was absent in the Ne Win-led BSPP government in Burma.</p>
<p>Modernization theory says that low-level socioeconomic status can be conducive to authoritarianism, and its higher status to democracy. This argument also does not convincingly explain the pattern of political transitions in Burma and Indonesia. The socioeconomic status of the majority of people in both countries was very low on the eve of popular uprisings. The findings in this article partially support Gasiorowski’s argument that economic crises trigger democratic transition. In the case of Indonesia, economic crisis indeed triggered a democratic transition to pave the way for the emergence of the third largest democratic nation on earth, in terms of population. However, the economic crisis was the hallmark of another political crisis and military coup in Burma.</p>
<p>As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0021909611430936">Matthews (1998</xref>: 9) says, the Burmese military considered ‘the legitimacy of its mission as political ruler, guardian of the state’. The military considered itself as the only institution that could unite the country and rescue it from political and economic woes and, therefore, did not like to relinquish power. Except for the brief silence after the collapse of the BSPP government, there had been no military retrenchment since its coup in 1962. Conversely, the military power was gradually reduced through the years of Suharto’s presidency. Moreover, the military cooperated for a systematic establishment of a civilian government after the resignation of Suharto by encouraging and supporting the development of bureaucracies under civilian leadership. This was evident from the fact that the result of the 1999 general election was honored in Indonesia, but the May 1990 election result in Burma was nullified by the military, which <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0021909611430936">Seekins (2005</xref>: 259) calls the ‘triumph of vertical over horizontal power’.</p>
<p>Suharto’s conciliatory approach was evident from his resignation speech when he said ‘I express my deepest gratitude, and I express my deepest sorrow if there were mistakes, failures and shortcomings’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0021909611430936">Richburg, 1998</xref>: A01). Contrastingly, the tone of Ne Win’s resignation speech was threatening and intimidating when he said that the ‘army will shoot straight, not up in the air’ if the protesters continued (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0021909611430936">Tifft and Stewart, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>The central argument is that a lack of a unified civilian leadership of an established national organization in Burma gave the opportunity for another military coup. While former Prime Minister U Nu insisted that everyone support the government he formed with his old cronies and family members, other civilian leaders were unwilling to support such unilateral move. In addition, some civilian leaders were willing to wait and see the military’s action, whether the military would fulfill its promise of holding a multi-party general election and transfer power to a civilian government. Empirical evidence suggests pondering what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0021909611430936">Uhlin (1993</xref>: 518) says; that is, the most important obstacle to democratic transition is ‘the strength of the military and the authoritarian state’.</p>

<p>The military government (SLORC) had renamed Burma to Myanmar in 1989 but the Burmese opposition and the Western nations continue to use the old name. I personally prefer Burma and therefore it is used consistently throughout the entire article.</p>
