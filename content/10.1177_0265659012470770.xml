<p>As practitioners we recognize the importance of listening to children and young people. However, very little has been written about listening to those with speech, language and communication needs (SLCN). This thought-provoking book challenges practitioners in a number of ways. It begins by highlighting the reasons why it is important to listen, moves on to the challenges and complexity of issues to be considered when listening to children and young people with SLCN and concludes with an extensive range of real-life practical examples, challenging practitioners to consider creative and innovative ways to actively listen to children and young people.</p>
<p>The book is divided into three sections. Part I is written by advocates for children with SLCN and provides views about the importance of listening to children. It includes six short, easily readable statements written from across the sector, including a young person, a parent, the former Chief Inspector of Prisons and the Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists. Each statement calls practitioners to listen to children and young people. It begins with a powerful message calling practitioners to listen to children as early as possible to prevent longer term needs with examples of young people within the criminal justice system. The most striking statement is written by a parent who gives a very frank and sincere account, sharing her personal experience of living on a ‘bridge between the world of the disabled and the world of the fully functioning’ and describing the reality and challenges of inclusion.</p>
<p>Part II is divided into 11 sections dealing with the complexities and issues surrounding listening to children and young people with SLCN. The first section includes a brief introduction to the wider context, to SLCN, and considers past work in this area, citing previously published techniques including interviews, questionnaires, art-based approaches and observations. The limitations of the research so far are identified: most projects have included children as participants, listening to them and seeking their views but rarely involving them in the decision-making process. This section challenges practitioners to consider the reasons why we listen to children and the impact of what we hear. To what extent does listening really influence decisions? Is there any impact on service delivery, provision or development? It is suggested that children are often consulted; however, they are not involved in the full cycle of service development. How to create a communicative action space between practitioners and children with SLCN is described, along with the need for informal approaches where children can feel supported and confident to voice their concerns. This part of the book also includes a useful section on ethics and consent covering three areas of risk:</p>
<list id="list1-0265659012470770" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>the risk of failing to offer children the opportunity to be heard, related to access and diversity issues;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>the risk of involving and engaging with children without their consent; and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>the risk of listening to children and misunderstanding or misinterpreting what is being communicated.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The final section identifies the cognitive and linguistic factors that need to be considered when interviewing children and young people with SLCN.</p>
<p>Part III contains 17 real life practical examples of listening to children and young people through structured reports of research and clinical projects. This section is extensive in that it includes examples from across the range of SLCN: listening to children with language impairment, young people who stammer, teenagers who use alternative and augmentative means of communication (AAC), 4–5-year-olds with speech impairment, children with cleft lip and palate and adolescents after traumatic brain injury. It also includes examples of listening to improve services, listening to children and young people talk about their desired outcomes, listening to siblings, listening to children’s views of their experiences of the people who work with them and of child care. This section is packed full of innovative, creative ways to listen to children including the use of art-based approaches, interactive activities such as fishing games, rating scales such as a ‘diamond ranking activity’, use of ‘babycams’, computer technology and film-making.</p>
<p>This book challenges practitioners to consider how they are listening to children and young people with SLCN, children’s involvement in decision-making and the impact on service delivery and development. It provides both the theoretical background and practical examples, clearly demonstrating how theory can be applied to practice. This book encourages practitioners to be creative and develop new ways of listening to children and young people.</p>
