<title>Background</title>
<p>This qualitative study examined experiences of relatives of people suffering from depression. Unipolar depression is often a recurrent disease that leads to significant reduction of the ill person’s social and occupational functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0020764012438478">National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE), 2009</xref>). The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that unipolar depression is the third global burden of disease and will take the lead by 2030 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0020764012438478">WHO, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Involvement of relatives has long been assumed to be an important factor in shortening the illness trajectory and in optimizing treatment and rehabilitation of depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0020764012438478">Fadden et al., 1987b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0020764012438478">Highet et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0020764012438478">Keitner et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0020764012438478">McNair et al., 2002</xref>). On that basis, there are current health political interests in the involvement of relatives in treatment and rehabilitation in order to reduce the societal costs linked to depression (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0020764012438478">NICE, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>In cohabitant families, where a family member is depressed, the interpersonal and psychological environment is often negatively affected by the burdens connected to living with a depressed family member (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0020764012438478">Benazon, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0020764012438478">Benazon &amp; Coyne, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0020764012438478">Fadden et al., 1987b</xref>). These families are often characterized by conflict, hopelessness and reciprocal negative attitudes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0020764012438478">Badger, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0020764012438478">Coyne et al., 1987</xref>). The relatives’ experience of their subjective burden and their development of ways of coping can affect the psychosocial environment in the families positively or negatively depending on whether they facilitate recovery or add to the strained interactions within the family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0020764012438478">Badger, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0020764012438478">Highet et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0020764012438478">Nosek, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0020764012438478">Stjernswärd &amp; Östman, 2008</xref>). Studies even indicate that psychosocial burdens in some families can add to strained interactions capable of maintaining and prolonging the depressive state after treatment is initiated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0020764012438478">Stjernswärd &amp; Östman, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0020764012438478">van Wijngaarden et al., 2009</xref>). However, these results should be read with some caution, as there are significant intransparencies regarding their sampling procedures(cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0020764012438478">Badger, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0020764012438478">Rehman et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0020764012438478">Stjernswärd &amp; Östman, 2008</xref>). Coping strategies may include how the relatives make personal sense of the depression and their own identity and therefore it is relevant to investigate the experiences of cohabitant relatives.</p>
<p>The aim of the present study was to gain new insight into how Danish cohabitant relatives make personal sense of living with their depressed family members and negotiate their social identity as relatives to a depressed family member.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0020764012438478">
<title>Theoretical perspective</title>
<p>The study was designed within a symbolic interactionist perspective. This asserts that meaning and social identity develop through an interactional process between a human being’s personal attitudes and the human being’s social environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0020764012438478">Charon, 2010</xref>). The social identity or self is a social object and arises as an object from the actor’s social interaction with the environment, others or him/herself. In this vein, social identity is a dialectic sense-making process where the human being’s personal understanding of selfis highly dependent on its social context as the human being’s interpretation of self is constantly negotiated withthe environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0020764012438478">Charon, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0020764012438478">Goffman, 1959</xref>). Sociologists <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0020764012438478">Goffman (1959)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0020764012438478">Karp (1996)</xref> refer to the development of identity as a social career where human beings develop personal but typical social identities and definitions of their situation through time.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>The data collection took place in the autumn of 2009 and consisted of eight semi-structured interviews and one focus group containing five informants. An individual qualitative interview is a purposeful conversation that is carried out in order to generate descriptions of the interviewees’ life world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0020764012438478">Kvale &amp; Brinkmann, 2009</xref>). A focus group interview is an interactive group conversation in which four to eight participants discuss a common topic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0020764012438478">Morgan, 1997</xref>). This triangulation of methods was well suited to generating rich descriptions of peoples’ subjective experiences and personal sense-making of their identity and interactionwith others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0020764012438478">Holstein &amp; Gubrium, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0020764012438478">Morgan, 1997</xref>). Furthermore, the interview topics were potentially precarious and intimate for the informants and the interpersonal dynamics associated with the different methods could facilitate several types of responses from the informants. Before the study, the interview guides were tested in an individual interview and a focus group. These tests were performed to try out the relevancy of the content of and the dynamics created by the interview guides. The combination of methods was aimed at producing data on the study’s two research questions that were constructed on the basis of background literature and were in line with the theoretical perspective:</p>
<list id="list1-0020764012438478" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>How do relatives negotiate their social identity and how do they make personal sense of their everyday life after the onset of their family member’s depression?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>What are the social consequences of the relatives’ negotiation of personal meaning and social identity?</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>An open interview guide was constructed for the individual interviews to facilitate and convey the relatives’ personal narratives of how they made sense of the depressed person’s illness and how they responded to the situation. After the individual interviews, three emerging themes were explored in the focus group: (1) changes in everyday life; (2) collaboration and support from surroundings; and (3) relatives’ personal well-being. The individual interviews ranged from 68 to 113 minutes and lasted on average for 91 minutes. The focus group lasted for 175 minutes. All interviews were audio-recorded. The first author transcribed the recordings verbatim.</p>
<sec id="section9-0020764012438478">
<title>Sample</title>
<p>A purposeful criterion sampling strategy was used to select ‘information-rich’ informants who could yield in-depth insight into the research issue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0020764012438478">Patton, 2002</xref>). The inclusion criteria were that the informants were adult relatives living with a person who had suffered a depressive episode within the previous two years.</p>
<sec id="section10-0020764012438478">
<title>Individual interviews</title>
<p>The informants were recruited from a prospective study of adherence to antidepressant medication after hospitalization for major depression. In this larger study, 16 patients were recruited from three psychiatric wards during a five-month inclusion period. Nine of these 16 patients had cohabitant relatives who were invited to participate in the present interview study with the consent of the depressed person. Eight relatives agreed to participate after receiving oral and written information about the study.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0020764012438478">
<title>Focus group</title>
<p>The focus group was arranged in collaboration with a psychiatric outpatient unit. Depressed persons with cohabitant relatives were asked for their consent to invite their relatives to join a focus group. Six relatives accepted and five eventually participated.</p>
<p>The sample size was decided on to balance a trade-off between a smaller data set suitable for detailed analyses and the breadth and variety in a larger number of interviews.</p>

<title>Analysis</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0020764012438478">Crabtree and Miller’s (2000)</xref> principles for editing and immersion/crystallization analysis informed the explorative interpretative process. The process included four steps: immersion, coding, categorization of smaller units of data, and validation of the interpretation’s internal validity. The analysis was supported by NVivo 8.0 software for handling and analysing qualitative data.</p>
<p>Step 1: while having an open and reflexive attitude to the data, the first author immersed himself in the audio recordings and the transcripts in order to gain an in-depth understanding of emerging themes and patterns. A psychosocial transformation process emerged, where relatives changed their sense of self in relation to their life with their depressed relative. The emerging process included a development of two distinct social identities: the ‘absorbed’ identity and the ‘integrated’ identity. Step 2: bearing the two identities in mind, meaningful units of data were systematically and openly coded to identify patterns and 38 codes were found. Step 3: the codes were categorized into the themes ‘Explanations of depression’, ‘Interactions with the social environment’ and ‘The joint relationship’. These were linked together by a psychosocial process whereby the relatives changed their ‘absorbed’ identity to a more ‘integrated’ identity. Codes that did not fit into the emerging pattern were used to challenge the categories. This led to several adjustments of the categories and to linking them until the interpretation was coherent and there was a sense of saturation. Step 4: in order to optimize the internal validity of the analysis, the coherence of the categories was validated by testing and comparing them to the initial data set (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0020764012438478">Crabtree &amp; Miller, 2000</xref>). Throughout the research process the authors critically discussed emerging codes and categories and these reflective discussions were continually used to challenge the validity of interpretations until consensus was reached.</p>

<title>Ethical considerations</title>
<p>The study was approved by the regional Research Ethics Committee of the Region of Southern Denmark. In accordance with the Act of Processing Personal Data, the Danish Data Protection Agency was notified about the study. All ethical requirements concerning informed written consent, confidentiality and utility of data were met.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>A psychosocial transformation process was identified, in which relatives’ sense of self changed in relation to theircontinuing life with a depressed person. Initially, the relatives had an ‘absorbed’ identity where their sense of self was entirely or partially taken over by their strong commitment to and close relationship with their ill relative. Later they developed an ‘integrated’ identity that involved learning how to control the extent of their ‘absorbed’ identity by developing self-preservation strategies. This process emerged as three themes, accounting for the context and consequences of the transformation:</p>
<list id="list2-0020764012438478" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>The psychiatric system conditioned the development of the relatives’ identity because their relationship to the professionals inhibited the development of the process. This occurred when the professionals encouraged the relatives to adhere to an ‘absorbed’ identity, full of conflict.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Personal attitudes toward the depressed person.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Stigma in relation to the community.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The latter two were the twin challenges driving the psychosocial process.</p>
<sec id="section15-0020764012438478">
<title>Contextual challenges in relation to psychiatric professionals</title>
<p>The relatives explained how they experienced two decisive challenges in their relationship to the professionals, where they were either: (1) marginalized in the treatment and rehabilitation of the depressed person; or (2) held partially responsible for treatment and rehabilitation.</p>
<sec id="section16-0020764012438478">
<title>Marginalized</title>
<p>The relatives described how they had often made numerous and conscientious attempts to draw the attention of psychiatric professionals and physicians to the fact that their relative was ill. Although it was often the relatives’ recognition of the fact that the depressed person was undeniably ill that led to admission and treatment, they generally felt left to their own devices. In spite of their intense isolation, frustration and powerlessness, they fought for involvement by demanding dialogue with professionals, by threatening to go to the press or management, or by seeking help or advice outside the psychiatric system.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-0020764012438478">
<title>Held responsible</title>
<p>The relatives were often heldpartially responsible as they were used to convince the depressed person to commence or adhere to treatment, such as medicine or electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). This took place during admission or in the following outpatient treatment where relatives were given psychoeducation about different interventions, such as principles for antidepressive treatment, or how to use tools such as weekly schedules to support the depressed person’s everyday life.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>They [the nurses] confronted me every time there was a decision to be made. And I really didn’t have a clue about it. When he was due to start his ECT treatment they also contacted me. I was supposed to make sure that he agreed. And well, I didn’t even think they used that kind of treatment anymore. Then one was supposed to sit there and convince one’s husband to take this treatment when I didn’t even know what it was. (Focus group, informant 4)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The relatives and the depressed person often had diverging perceptions of the right way of coping with the depressive state. This could, for example, be when the depressed person did not adhere to a given treatment, while the relatives wanted them to exercise or take medications. These diverging perceptions often gave rise to the relatives having ambiguous thoughts and feelings such as love, sympathy, spitefulness and hatefulness because they felt that the ill person did not try sufficiently to return to their previous life if he or she did not adhere to treatment. This often led to conflict and reciprocal negative attitudes.</p>
<p>The relatives’ involvement and strong commitment became less important over time. As the depressive state came and went, the relatives recognized that their efforts to control the depressed person would lead to conflict and negativity and that their commitment and involvement was only pertinent when the depressed person was in an acute recurrent depressive state. As they recognized this they experienced a greater need for ideas for ways of coping instead of generalized knowledge about the disease.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-0020764012438478">
<title>Challenges in the personal sense of self</title>
<p>The relatives presented the depressed person’s illness as the consequence of work-related stress or different somatic diseases such as appendicitis, flu or knee injury. In this way they legitimized their preconception of the depression by claiming that the depressed person essentially had a weak personal character, whose psychological development was incomplete.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>In the beginning I didn’t really respond [to her illness] very much because I’ve always or at least for many years considered Margaret as a nervy person. [She is] easy to scare and slightly nervous, right. … It meant a lot to her to please other people. Of course that stems from her childhood. (Individual interview, informant 1)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The relatives’ sense of self was characterized by their perception of themselves as being the opposite of the depressed person’s weak, nervous and depressive character. This perception of being a strong character meant that the relatives controlled and undertook all tasks and duties in the family. In this way their sense of self was ‘absorbed’ by the depression.</p>
<p>In time the relatives’ lonely struggle to counteract the depressed person’s social withdrawal and lack of improvement led to seclusion and to crushed personal dreams of life with the depressed person. This strong commitment and constant vigilance led to relatives feeling emotionally exhausted and developing ambiguous thoughts and feelings such as frustration and spitefulness.</p>
<p>These circumstances also gradually drove the relatives to recognize that they could neither expect to control the depressed person or the depression, nor to return to their previous lives before the onset of depression.</p>
<p>In time the relatives gradually developed a new ‘integrated’ identity where it became increasingly valuable to them to have a balanced relationship with the depressed person and to live out their personal dreams at work or through recreational hobbies, such as singing or riding.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-0020764012438478">
<title>Challenges in the community</title>
<p>Parallel to the challenges in the relatives’ personal sense of self, the challenges in their community involved their ways of balancing stigma in relation to their family, friends and colleagues. These challenges emerged when the relatives legitimized the depression with reference to socially acceptable explanations, such as work-related stress or somatic illness, as a consequence of the ill person’s weak character.</p>
<p>The legitimization served as a strategy to protect themselves from (self-)stigma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0020764012438478">Goffman, 1963</xref>), which led them to only reveal the special challenges, limitations and ambiguous thoughts and feelings they experienced in their life with the depressed person to significant friends, family members or colleagues. However, their attempts to protect themselves and the depressed person from stigma and social condemnation led to social isolation in their community, which gave them a strong sense of loneliness and loss of personal freedom because they became isolated in their home with a person who had changed due to the depression.</p>
<p>In recognition of living an isolated and highly conflicted life, of which they had never dreamed, the relatives re-established contact to trusted old friends and started to appreciate new or previous interests, such as their job or hobbies.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>[In my work] I can live out my dream about life, and when I get home, I don’t come home to my dream about life. Well I do in relation to my children, but not in relation to my dream of my family life. I return home to find a husband sitting on the settee. (Individual interview, informant 4)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>By presenting how they lived out their personal dreams, for instance at work or doing their hobbies, the relatives constructed an ‘integrated’ identity, where they could endure sharing their life with a person who was changed by the depression. Their integrated identity allowed them to protect the depressed person at a time when he or she was acutely depressed, while maintaining a satisfactory and meaningful life in relation to other personal dreams.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The following critical discussion entails methodological considerations about the study’s internal validity and discussions of the external validity of the results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0020764012438478">Malterud, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>A data-driven analysis was conducted within the symbolic interactionist framework. In spite of the risk of reproducing previous conclusions due to the theoretical framework (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0020764012438478">Crabtree &amp; Miller, 2000</xref>), the analytical process was structured theoretically in order to strengthen the coherence and reliability of the study (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0020764012438478">Malterud, 2001</xref>). The interviews were concerned with personal and private issues about living with another person and therefore it is possible that some precarious issues were not articulated in this study. A future approach to such issues could include repeat interviews that could facilitate the trust needed to talk about these issues. The informants in the study were recruited because their depressed family member had been admitted to hospital. It is possible that relatives to less-depressed persons may have different experiences of living together and future studies may use alternative sampling strategies to include this large group of relatives. In order to analyse relatives’ experiences in greater detail than this small-scale study, there is a need for designing future studies that include study samples that specify informants’ gender, age, severity of depression and the relatives’ experience according to depressed persons’ overall illness trajectory.</p>
<p>In order to discuss a study’s external validity, findings may be compared to previous studies from similar settings, for example studies of relatives of depressed people, or people with other mental illnesses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0020764012438478">Malterud, 2001</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0020764012438478">Nosek (2008)</xref> showed the cyclical nature of the psychosocial process, because relatives often experienced the depression as a recurrent and unstable condition. However, the present study differentiated how the psychosocial process involved a significant development in the relatives’ sense of self in relation to the depressed person, to their families, friends and the psychiatric professionals, which could be conceptualized as a social career (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0020764012438478">Goffman, 1959</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0020764012438478">Karp, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>In line with previous studies, the present study showed that relatives’ personal experience of losing their dreams of their life with the depressed person and their attempts to control the depression often led to subjective burdens, as they developed negative and/or conflicting thoughts and feelings about the depressed person (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0020764012438478">Stjernswärd &amp; Östman, 2008</xref>). Despite these similarities, the present study emphasized critical aspects in relatives’ sense-making and identity work when they felt hatred, shame and worry due to the burden of their ‘absorbed’ identity, and later developed feelings of hope and empathy in relation to the depressed person (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0020764012438478">Stjernswärd &amp; Östman, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>The present study resembled <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0020764012438478">Karp and Tanarugsachocks’ (2000)</xref> extensive study of relatives of mentally ill people. This study reported that relatives had similar, ambiguous feelings when a person was diagnosed as being ill and when they recognized that the illness was recurrent and chronic. However, their recognition of not being able to control the illness or the ill person could lead to a weakened commitment to the ill person’s suffering, which could facilitate restoration of their social identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0020764012438478">Karp &amp; Tanarugsachock, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0020764012438478">Badger (1996)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0020764012438478">Nosek (2008)</xref> identified that relatives of depressed people develop a constant vigilance that intensifies or decreases in or between depressive episodes. However, the present study differentiated between how vigilance was related to relatives’ sense of having a role involving responsibility for controlling and treating the depressed person, and how the development of the sense of self was decisive to their coping with the subjective burden of living with the depressed person. In balancing their relationship with the depressed person, the relatives’ restoration of identity became pivotal because their execution of control and power, along with their ambiguous thoughts and feelings such as hatefulness and bitterness, potentially undermined their relationship with the depressed person (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0020764012438478">Stjernswärd &amp; Östman, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>This study highlighted relatives’ troublesome experiences of being marginalized and held responsible for treatment when they were dealing with health-care professionals. This finding differed from Stjernswärd and Östmans’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0020764012438478">2008</xref>) study, which reported both negative and positive experiences. Several studies report that relatives feel marginalized, not taken seriously, stigmatized and being seen as a part of the problem by health-care professionals. The relatives experience a lack of information and interest from personnel and exclusion from treatment, which leads to severe frustration and isolation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0020764012438478">Badger, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0020764012438478">Highetet al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0020764012438478">Nosek, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0020764012438478">Stjernswärd &amp; Östman, 2008</xref>). Although social inclusion is a political area of interest, findings from the present study highlighted relatives’ marginalization and exclusion from treatment and the rehabilitation process. Consistent with previous research, this implies that relatives were seen as resources for treatment and rehabilitation rather than partners in treatment (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0020764012438478">Rowe, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0020764012438478">Stjernswärd &amp; Östman, 2008</xref>). In line with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0020764012438478">Chiu, Wei and Lee (2006)</xref>, this may suggest that the broader health policy discourses on relatives’ participation in rehabilitation may unintentionally have negative influences on the relatives’ experiences of balancing their commitments towards their ill relatives.</p>
<p>It must be stressed that professionals’ psychosocialsupport of relatives can improve relatives’ psychosocial care and rehabilitation of mentally ill people (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0020764012438478">Rowe, 2011</xref>). In line with previous studies, this study suggests that professionals could promote psychosocial care and rehabilitation by supporting relatives’ coping with theburden associated with depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0020764012438478">Fadden et al., 1987a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0020764012438478">Rowe, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0020764012438478">Stjernswärd &amp; Östman, 2008</xref>). Psychiatric professionals should support relatives’ reconstruction of an integrated identity and how they cope with negative emotions, conflict and isolation, as well as provide knowledge about depression and treatment in order to support.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>After the onset of depression, relatives went through a psychosocial transformation process where they negotiated the extent of their involvement. A strong commitment could lead to added burdens of living with a depressed person. The burdens entailed conflict, constant vigilance, negative emotions, stigma and isolation. In time the burdens drove the relatives through a social career where they altered their sense of self. The social consequences were that they learned to balance their relationship with the depressed person in order to maintain a meaningful and satisfactory life, while protecting him or her during acute episodes. Specific challenges in relatives’ relations to psychiatric professionals could condition and inhibit the social recovery process when the relatives were not supportedin coping with the burdens of living with a depressed person.</p>
