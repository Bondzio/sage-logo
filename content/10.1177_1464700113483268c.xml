<p>In <italic>Gender &amp; Culture</italic>, Anne Phillips provides a comprehensive analysis of the intricacies, policies, practices, and constraints of women’s agency in universal discourses. This stimulating collection of previously published articles reflects the central tenet of Phillips’ work which is to critically analyse, contest, reformulate, and change conceptions of culture and agency. From a spectrum of topics including democracy, gender justice, and debates about equality, Phillips masterfully provides a coherent, if sometimes divergent, narrative that explores the depths and contentions of gender and culture.</p>
<p>The book engages in, as its back cover suggests, an ongoing debate about the intersections of multiculturalism, gender, and agency. Parallel to her definition of feminism as change, Phillips’ substantive concepts, including cultural relativism, multiculturalism, and universalism, are continually re-interpreted because they require constant contextualisation, reflecting her tendency to evaluate and re-evaluate commonly held beliefs and norms about gender and culture. It is not to say that she is contradictory, on the contrary, Phillips has a clear sense of her opinions and conveys them in a way that is readily understandable to her readership. However, with no straightforward answers, and a wealth of often divided feminist literature the best we can do is engage in the dialogue and continue asking questions about agency, gender, and multiculturalism in feminist discourse.</p>
<p><italic>Gender &amp; Culture</italic> reads like a dynamic conversation that addresses feminist scholarship, including Butler, Benhabib, De Beauvoir, and, in particular, offers a cogent response to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1464700113483268c">Okin’s <italic>Is Multiculturalism Bad for Women?</italic> (1999)</xref>. Phillips also provides concrete, timely examples of the intersections, tensions, and alliances of feminism and normative culturalism. Her second chapter, ‘Multiculturalism, universalism, and claims of democracy’, provides a rigorous point of departure for the rest of the chapters’ discussions in forcefully challenging the popular ideology of multiculturalism, questioning its participation in the reification of cultural stereotypes. As Phillips observes, ‘if multiculturalism is to mean anything, it must mean recognizing that there are many different ways of organizing one’s life, and that no one person or group has a monopoly on what is right’ (p. 125). However, the chapter also acknowledges the ‘family relationship’ between feminism and multiculturalism, namely in addressing the central issues of inequality and oppression. Phillips notes that ‘in each case [feminism and multiculturalism] the failure to recognize people as equals seems to be bound up in some way with the inability to accept difference’ (p. 21). She maintains that hyperbolic discourses of cultural difference lead to ethnic reductionism and the hierarchisation of what is traditional and what is modern. Using this outline, Phillips continues to call into question the uses of multiculturalism and feminism in an attempt to acknowledge both their importance and their shortcomings in tackling inequalities.</p>
<p>At times, the combination of nuance, critique, and examples proves to be a challenging progression to follow, but Phillips ensures that she clarifies her concepts and organises her ideas through the repetition of key points. The revision of her academic work for publication as a text allows for a synthesis of information and an overall coherence, despite the wide range of topics subsumed under ‘gender’ and ‘culture’. In under 200 pages, Phillips packs a heady flow of information including the themes of female genital cutting, forced marriage, and cultural defence. The real-world examples make her core concepts accessible to those interested in women’s rights and multiculturalism.</p>
<p><italic>Gender &amp; Culture</italic> is not the text that one might expect in that Phillips’ brave engagement with contested and oft disputed concepts tackles difficult questions instead of rehashing straightforward concepts in feminist theory. It is a welcome contribution to feminist studies and is, in my view, an invaluable resource for feminist scholars.</p>
