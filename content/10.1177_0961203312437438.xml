<p><italic>Objectives</italic>: Twenty-four hour urine collection has been the foundation for monitoring patients with lupus nephritis. However, the use of protein to creatinine ratios in spot urine samples is now widely used. We aimed to evaluate the validity of this method cross-sectionally and longitudinally. <italic>Methods:</italic> A cross-sectional retrospective study was conducted. Records of 486 lupus nephritis patients were searched for paired results of 24-h quantification of urinary protein and a random spot urine protein to creatinine ratio and were examined over a three-year period. <italic>Results and Conclusions:</italic> Ninety-five lupus nephritis patients had paired results and were included in the final analysis, male/female 14/81, mean age 36.5 years. Over a three-year period there were a total of 137 samples from 95 patients. For the entire dataset, there was a significant correlation between protein:creatinine ratio and 24-h urine collection protein (mg), Spearman Rho correlation coefficient was 0.869, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001 with (<italic>R</italic><sup>2 </sup>= 0.504). There was also a strong correlation for longitudinal data, <italic>n</italic> = 14 at two-years Rho 0.910, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001 with (<italic>R</italic><sup>2 </sup>= 0.878), <italic>n</italic> = 8 at three-years Rho 0.909, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001and (<italic>R</italic><sup>2 </sup>= 0.73). We have shown for the first time in a UK population of lupus nephritis patients, well trained in producing 24-h collection, that the spot protein:creatinine ratio correlates well with 24-h urinary total protein excretion. Having a simple, reliable, reproducible and cost-effective test such as the spot urine protein:creatinine ratio is therefore a valuable tool with which to monitor disease progression.</p>

<p>This cross-sectional and longitudinal retrospective audit study was conducted at the Louise Coote Lupus Unit, St Thomas’ Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK. The records of 486 patients diagnosed with lupus nephritis were searched for paired results of 24-h quantification of urinary protein (mg) and a random spot urine protein:creatinine ratio (mg/mmol per litre). The study examined anonymized results over a period of three years (2004–06). Statistical analysis was carried out using SPSS (version 13, SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).</p></sec>
<sec id="sec3-0961203312437438" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title>
<p>Ninety-five lupus nephritis patients had paired results and were therefore eligible to be included in the final analysis. Eighty-one patients were female (87%) and 14 male (15%) with a mean age of 36.5 years (SD: 12.8). Forty-three patients had biopsy proven lupus nephritis (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0961203312437438">Table 1</xref>).

<p>Over a three-year period there was a total of 137 samples between the 95 patients. The mean 24-h urinary protein quantity was 1245.4 mg (range: 60–8010; SD 1465.1). The mean spot ratio was 192.6 (range 8–1002.8; SD 190.2). For the entire dataset, there was a significant correlation between protein:creatinine ratio and 24-h urine collection protein quantification (mg).

<sec id="sec4-0961203312437438" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title>
<p>Quantifying proteinuria plays an important part in monitoring disease response to treatment in lupus nephritis. Until recently, this has been accomplished by 24-hour collections of urine which are inconvenient for patients and prone to inaccuracy.</p>
<p>It is known that the ratio of protein:creatinine in an untimed urine sample has a strong correlation with 24-hour total protein excretion in diabetic and non-diabetic nephropathy,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0961203312437438">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0961203312437438">12</xref></sup> but until very recently, this tool had not been validated in lupus nephritis.</p>
<p>We have shown that the spot urine protein:creatinine ratio is highly correlated with 24-hour protein measurement. The patient group was typical of those seen in any lupus clinic. All patients over the time period 2004–06 who had paired samples were included in the analysis. Therefore the group of patients was heterogeneous with lupus nephritides in all WHO classification subsets. In addition we have not excluded patients on cyclosporin A, cyclophosphamide or any drugs known to alter creatinine clearance. Whilst this could be seen as a limitation of the study, we believe this adds credence to the use of the protein:creatinine ratio in routine clinical practice.</p>
<p>Despite the above considerations, our data corroborates that of Leung et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0961203312437438">15</xref></sup> who show similar correlations in a slightly smaller cohort of 82 lupus nephritis patients based in Hong Kong. We too have shown an increased deviation from the line of identity with increasing levels of proteinuria. This may reflect changes in creatinine clearance with increasing proteinuria or could simply reflect differences in the muscle bulk of the patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0961203312437438">16</xref></sup> Small changes in both parameters will result in marked changes to the ratio and one must therefore question the validity of this tool at higher levels of protein excretion.</p>
<p>However, our limited longitudinal data does suggest that the protein:creatinine ratio is reproducible and continues to show excellent correlation, as shown in the scatter plot of 14 patients with two-year follow-up and data of eight patients with three-year follow-up (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0961203312437438">Figure 2</xref>). The degree of correlation does indeed suggest that on an individual basis the protein:creatinine ratio accurately assesses change in protein excretion over time. This is in keeping with follow-up data from large cohorts of transplant patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0961203312437438">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>We have shown for the first time in a UK population of lupus nephritis patients that the spot protein:creatinine ratio correlates well with 24-hour urinary total protein excretion. The population of lupus nephritis patients was of a heterogeneous nature and no patients were excluded from the analysis. We believe therefore that our results reflect routine clinical practice. We have also demonstrated that the protein:creatinine ratio in lupus nephritis is reproducible over a three-year time period although we accept that the longitudinal data presented represents a small cohort.</p>
<p>One of the limitations of this study was that only 43 patients had their diagnosis confirmed by renal biopsy. We feel that this reflects clinical practice. Patients with a low and stable level of proteinuria without other measures of active lupus disease or other pathology may not undergo renal biopsy in routine clinical care. Having a simple, reliable, reproducible test such as the spot urine protein:creatinine ratio is therefore a valuable tool with which to monitor disease progression.</p></sec>
