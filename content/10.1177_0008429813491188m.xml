<p>There is little doubt that the clerical abuse of minors is a most serious issue facing the Roman Catholic Church. Already, in many parts of the world, revelations and cover-ups have had a devastating impact on the church, not only financially, but also in terms of credibility and overall attendance. Some are wondering if Catholicism, as we have known it, will survive the scandal. With a new pope at the helm, expectations are running high that long overdue corrections will be made to how the church has managed the situation thus far. This is indeed a grave moral crisis for worldwide Catholicism.</p>
<p>Much has been written about the abuse of minors by Roman Catholic clergy—its causes, extent, and manifestations. Some of it is theologically sound and engaging, some of it more journalistic and sensationalistic, while much of it takes the form of first-person accounts written by the victims themselves. Various authors propose different theories as to the why and the wherefore. On such a sensitive and inflammatory topic, it is, in fact, quite difficult not to overindulge in a bit of melodramatic rhetoric. Marie Keenan does not, and that is the truly exceptional merit of her ground-breaking work.</p>
<p>Keenan teaches at University College Dublin and is a licensed psychotherapist. Her book bears the imprint of this dual identity: that of the serious and demanding scholar, and that of the equally credible mental health professional. Contrary to much of what is available in the field, this book is the result of several years of serious and concerted therapeutic research with clerical abusers themselves. She interviewed and worked with seven priests and two brothers, all Irish. What emerges from this uniquely rich research environment is a book which, without in any way trivializing or minimizing the devastating impact of child abuse, manages to infuse the current debate with a sense of fairness and urgency. Keenan argues quite eloquently that one cannot truly understand the clerical sexual abuse of minors, and thereby hope to correct it, without also taking into account how gender (especially understandings of clerical masculinity) and power are deployed in Roman Catholic organizational culture. This is a seldom-explored perspective, and one that goes to the very heart of the current crisis and the apparent inability of Roman Catholic authorities to deal effectively with it. Too much appears to be at stake for them.</p>
<p>But Keenan’s <italic>Child Sexual Abuse and the Catholic Church</italic> contains, in fact, much more. It is also a fine historical and methodological text. For those unfamiliar with the vast complex of theories purporting to explain sexual abuse, the author does an excellent job of summarizing this dense material in part II, thereby providing much context for the varied and sometimes contradictory attempts at elucidation. Her command of the various government reports investigating incidents of abuse (most notably the Irish reports and the American John Jay College report) is also quite impressive, as is her ability to place child abuse in a historical context. Overall, Keenan has done her homework, and the results are both noteworthy and refreshingly instructive, all the while avoiding the rhetorical excesses that characterize so much writing on this serious topic.</p>
<p>Of note is the fact that Keenan, while remaining staunchly critical in her outlook, never fails to treat the various actors—victims, perpetrators, and church authorities—with the utmost care and respect. She never wallows in cheap shots or inflammatory wordiness. She cautions us about giving-in to such language, as easy and comforting as it may be. Her ultimate goal is not so much to punish as to rehabilitate, not so much to blame as to heal, not so much to ostracize as to include. In fact, her bold suggestions for what the Roman Catholic Church now needs to do, and how it must shift some of its fundamental values and <italic>modus operandi</italic>, speak eloquently to her cautious, yet critical, outlook and frame of mind. Remarkably enough, and although she is not one, Keenan can also speak with the voice of a confident theologian.</p>
<p>Such a book should be required reading in all Catholic seminaries, though it probably never will be. Equally, it would make an excellent text (though perhaps a bit expensive) for graduate classes or seminars looking at aspects of contemporary Roman Catholicism, or for methodology courses in religion or sexuality studies. In an ideal world, Pope Francis would make it required reading for Roman Catholic prelates and priests—that, however, would appear to be an illusory dream for now.</p>
