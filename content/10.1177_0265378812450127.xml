<p>Roland Allen’s grandson and the author of <italic>Roland Allen: Pioneer, priest and prophet</italic>My grandfather was endlessly patient with anyone who lacked education or who was in any way mentally retarded. But he was impatient, to the point of intolerance, with people who seemed to him to be too lazy to think for themselves, and who were ready to accept uncritically whatever ideas were fashionable at the time. Most of his published books and articles were designed to challenge such people, and to oblige them to think through, much more thoroughly, ideas that they had been contented to take for granted.</p>
<p>Among his unpublished papers are a series of studies of Jesus’ parables, in which Roland sought to help ordinary people, not scholars, to think for themselves by seeking to imagine how bystanders – not only of the time of Christ, but also of our own time – might have reacted to those stories. He explains in a preface,
<disp-quote>
<p>I sat down to write what men in the crowd who heard the Parables of Christ said about them… None of them…recognized the Speaker as the Son of God… Some called him ‘this fellow’, some ‘this teacher’, some ‘this speaker’, some regarded him as a great prophet, and some were plainly in doubt about him… That the comments of such men should often sound profane in the ears of modern devout Christians did not surprise me. They were only saying what many men think, and I put it down… I think my readers will recognize many of those ideas as familiar… I myself found that listening to those men made me think, and I hope that it may make others think.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0265378812450127">1</xref></sup></p>

<p>Only one of these studies – <italic>The Good Samaritan –</italic> has ever been widely published.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0265378812450127">2</xref></sup> Here is another one.</p>

<title>Two Men Heard the Parable of the Prodigal Son</title>
<p><italic>One said</italic>, This man seems to be peculiarly fond of evil livers. He always talks as if publicans and harlots were nearer the Kingdom of Heaven than anyone else; and he keeps them company. In this story it is perfectly clear which of the two sons was best beloved. Don’t you think so?</p>
<p><italic>The other said</italic>, Yes, I agree. It is often so. Fathers are often more fond of young rascals who squander, than of sober, quiet, diligent sons; but it doesn’t seem rational. I am jolly glad that my son is not a waster. He is a good decent lad and will make a good decent man. If I had another who was a wild blackguard, I suppose I might still love him, but I shouldn’t tell a tale to set him over his brother’s head, even if he did learn sense in penury and wanted to come home. That is going too far altogether.</p>

<sec id="section5-0265378812450127">
<title>Two Men Heard the Parable of the Prodigal Son</title>
<p><italic>One said</italic>, I wish he had told us a little more. I should like to have heard what life was like in that home for the next five years. As it stands the story is just like the novel which ends with the marriage bells, when you feel pretty certain that the troubles of the bridal pair are really just beginning, not ended. That is good enough for a fairy tale, or a cheap novelette, but in life, my friend, you can’t cut off the troubles of sentimental lovers like that.</p>
<p><italic>The other said</italic>, There’s nothing unreasonable in a tale which reaches a climax, even though it doesn’t resolve every issue. The story which ends with wedding bells is not necessarily a bad story because other troubles may follow. The story-teller is setting out a definite history up to that point, and – if he does that well – it is not reasonable to demand that he should tell another story. In this case the story of this young wastrel reaches the climax of his repentance and return quite properly, and quite properly ends there. It is only the introduction of the elder brother’s annoyance which raises your question; but that throws into relief the father’s attitude, and his explanation of it. Perhaps that was what it was meant to do. To fix attention on the elder brother is surely to miss the mark? The story is a story of a man’s repentance and return, and of the father’s attitude to the repentant returning son. If the attitude of the elder brother throws into relief the father’s attitude, it is in its place and does its work. It seems to me unreasonable to ask more, and to make that a peg on which to hang a question which – so far as the main issue of the story is concerned – does not arise. To do that only distracts from the proper point of the story. The real point is: what is the attitude of God to a repentant sinner; and the speaker told us that.</p>

<sec id="section7-0265378812450127">
<title>Two Men Heard the Parable of the Prodigal Son</title>
<p><italic>One said</italic>, In all our religious history, the first movement towards advance or recovery has always come from God. The Law and the Prophets reveal that truth at every point. Now, in this story the first step seems to have been self-initiated. The Prodigal ‘came to himself’ before he came to the father: the whole movement is presented as proceeding from the son. You try to write the history of our race like that! You will begin by saying that when our forefathers came to themselves, they saw that certain sins produced misery, so they repented and God received them and gave them His Law, as the father in this story gave the son clothes and shoes that he might walk fairly. Now that won’t do. You cannot read our Scriptures like that.</p>
<p><italic>The other said</italic>, That seems to me a very one-sided view of the story. The son was the son of his father before he went astray: that generation did not proceed from him, did it? When he came to himself, what did he come to? Was it not to a sense of his father’s goodness? Did that proceed from him? Then what followed? A determination to return. But what was the basis for that determination? Surely a hope that he would be received? Was that hope rooted in himself, or in his father’s character? I cannot understand it as a story of the essential goodness of men. We are persons, and persons must act as persons. God gave our fathers the Law, but our fathers had to receive it. God revealed His will to our Prophets, but that did not avail until our fathers accepted his message. So here the son was really all the time face to face with his father’s love. He cast it aside, then he responded to it, and then finally he entered into the fullness of it. I think it would be more true to say that the story is a story of the working of the father’s love, than that it is a story of the power of human beings to recover themselves by themselves. But the opposition is a false one, and ought not to be suggested. The suggestion simply tears the story in two; as told to us it was a unity.</p>

<sec id="section9-0265378812450127">
<title>Three Men Heard the Parable of the Prodigal Son</title>
<p><italic>One said</italic>, That is the sort of story which sloppy sentimental people delight in. Did you notice the faces of the crowd? They were all carried away with it. Some of the women were positively crying, with the sort of tears which they love to shed. ‘Sob stuff’ I call it – an appeal simply to the emotions. Now in religion what we want is sense and intelligent conviction. Mere emotion is very evanescent: you cannot build on it. I’m surprised that a Teacher who generally gives us hard argument should make that sort of appeal.</p>
<p><italic>The second said</italic>, Don’t underrate the power of emotion. If men are to know rightly, or to think truly, or to attain to the right action, their emotions must be rightly directed as well as their thought. Men are not mere intelligence. You can see that every day. Intellectual conviction by itself does not control them. You find it hard to persuade a man of any truth unless his feeling – and desire moved by feeling – is on the side of your truth. When the speaker appealed to the people’s feelings, so that the welcome given to the son came upon them with a feeling of delight as the ideal response to his penitence, he was really not appealing to their emotion alone: the feeling was in harmony with the essential reality of the case, and when they thought about it, their intelligence perceived that it was so, and agreed with it and supported their feeling. That is an appeal to the whole person, not merely to a sort of detached sentimentality. What you call ‘sob stuff’ is not like that; the feeling moved by it is not like that. There, the feeling induced is irrational and false, and the moment that reason gets to work on it, it is seen to be irrational – out of harmony with the real facts. I don’t think you can call this sort of story ‘sob stuff’. It goes down to the essential realities. It is an appeal, not to empty feeling, but to the whole man. I myself was moved almost to tears; but my intelligence approved and had its place in my sense of the divine rightness of the story. I never before heard anything which seemed to knit up my whole self into one act of approval and joy as this story did. I think the speaker got down to the eternal verities in his expression of the relation between penitence and forgiveness.</p>
<p><italic>The simple minded man said</italic>, I didn’t reason it out as you did, but all I know is that I felt exactly as you do about it.</p>
