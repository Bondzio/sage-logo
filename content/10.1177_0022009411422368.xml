<abstract>
<p>For the duration of the Cold War, hundreds of thousands of people descended on Plovdiv, Bulgaria for at least two weeks out of every year as spectators and consumers. During these weeks the Plovdiv International Fair grounds were like a portal through which the Iron Curtain was permeated and East-West interaction and exchange took place. The fair offered an array of images and goods that broadcast messages of power and plenty from a variety of states, most notably Soviet but also American. Bulgarian socialism, however, was really the main thing on display, and for all its failings it didn’t fail to impress domestic and international visitors on and off the fair grounds. While much remains to be studied about how visitors experienced the various exhibits at the fair, the trials and achievements of the annual Plovdiv International Fair readily illustrate how central spectacles of plenty and consumption were to East-West engagement.</p>

<p>If only I could walk the broad avenues of the Plovdiv fairgrounds in, say, spring of 1972. With détente and the Bulgarian rose gardens still in bloom, an international party would be taking place on the banks of the Maritsa River. Tens of thousands of visitors would be wandering the fair paths and alleys seeking out spectacles of style and technology. They would stop only to gorge on Bulgarian <italic>kebabche</italic> (meat balls) and <italic>shopska salata</italic> (tomato and cucumber salad with feta) washed down by rakia (plum brandy) or wine, and followed by a special blend Bulgarian cigarette. But alas, I can only read records and accounts of the Plovdiv International Fair, describing its physical arrangement and displays as well as attendant improvements of the surrounding city; continually re-groomed for the big event. Such sources help reconstruct, at least in part, the changing ways in which Bulgarians and other participants sought to represent themselves at such exhibitions. They help us understand how the US–Soviet Cold War confrontation took in myriad forms outside diplomatic circles, that is in pavilions and on the fair grounds. But narratives of the fair <italic>experience</italic> are few and far between, leaving the more elusive question of how the fair was read, enjoyed and lived by both locals and foreign visitors largely unanswered. Fair reception, in fact, is a notoriously fraught subject.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0022009411422368">1</xref></sup> The veracity of existing sources from the period, such as comment books, can be questioned on a number of political grounds, while retrospective oral histories are hopelessly entangled with the knowledge of communism’s collapse and the experience of the transition. Even if ‘reliable’ sources were available, it is likely that there were as many readings of the fair as visitors, defying a systematic treatment of Bulgarian or foreign reception of the phenomenon. Still the Plovdiv fair days, or perhaps fair daze, can and should be unearthed; its meanings, significance and experiences illuminated to the greatest extent possible.</p>
<p>World’s fairs had provided a popular stage for East–West and other kinds of global encounters since Britain’s Crystal Palace in 1851. During the late nineteenth century world’s fair heyday, fair tableaus of power and plenty projected state and/or corporate visions of power, namely Western imperial or national authority, to an international array of spectators.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0022009411422368">2</xref></sup> Such messages were readily consumed by masses of spectators, though at times they also provoked alternative readings and anti-Western resistances.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0022009411422368">3</xref></sup> As inherently participatory and interactive events, fairs had the potential to act as complex and intensified contexts for exchange and ultimately change, via new sensory and consumer experiences. In the Cold War period, such processes took place under a very different set of domestic constraints and geo-political conditions. In the emergent ‘two camp’ world, the Cold War fair was a context for confrontation, negotiation, systemic competition and direct encounter. In the years after Stalin’s death, in particular, Soviet and Bloc liberalization under the rubric of Khrushchev’s ‘peaceful coexistence,’ facilitated face-to-face engagement and fairs became central sites for direct East–West, and especially American–Soviet, competition and engagement. By the time such fair encounters were underway in the late 1950s, the arms or space race was supplemented, if not supplanted, by competitive displays in a range of aesthetic fields, mostly notably consumer goods.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0022009411422368">4</xref></sup> Cold War rivalries were on display at Cold War fairs and comparing spectacles of plenty – Soviet, American, Bulgarian or other – were part of the overall fair experience.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0022009411422368">5</xref></sup> Many of these fairs were one time events, like the Brussels Expo of 1958, where Cold War competitors had a fleeting historical moment to flaunt their wares.</p>
<p>But in a certain sense the grandiose efforts from both East and West in the Brussels fair of 1958 were the launch party for an era in which <italic>annual</italic> Cold War trade fairs would provide a sustained context for recurrent and heightened East-West contact.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0022009411422368">6</xref></sup> While more spectacular world’s fairs and exhibitions continued to punctuate the period, recurrent trade fairs in Plovdiv, Poznan, Leipzig and other Eastern Europe cites arguably had a greater impact on Bloc populations. It was here at annual fairs that socialist citizens were able to watch the increasingly direct East–West engagement – and more pointedly American-Soviet rivalries – unfold, in the increasingly politicized arena of consumer offerings. But it was also a site in which the achievements of Bulgarian socialism and the domestic ‘good life’ was flaunted for Bulgarians to enjoy and foreigners to admire.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0022009411422368">7</xref></sup> Indeed, the Bulgarian ability not just to display a cornucopia of goods, but to provide amusement and pleasure to domestic and foreign visitors was central to the anatomy of the Plovdiv fair and its relative success in the post-war period.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0022009411422368">8</xref></sup> Admittedly, the Plovdiv fair, like other annual trade fairs behind the Iron Curtain, aspired not just to impress but to school the modern socialist consumer in proper style, good taste and restraint.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0022009411422368">9</xref></sup> In the end, however, the fair was a ‘school’ in which discipline and restraint were in short supply. Instead, the fair offered Bulgarian visitors a deserved break from the everyday, a carnival of consumption that reinforced socialist legitimacy, even as it held the potential to undermine it.</p>
<p>For Bulgarians – especially residents of Plovdiv – the fair experience punctuated their year, a consistent annual event since 1947 and biannual since 1958. And while the fair undoubtedly made quite an impression on Bulgarian spectators, I have yet to find a detailed account of the event in the postwar period; the fair just does not seem to be the stuff of memoirs, only fond memories. So imagine my delight (and envy) when I found ‘So Long at the Fair,’ a detailed description by British travel writer, Leslie Gardiner, of the 1972 Plovdiv fair, published in <italic>Blackwoods Magazine</italic>, a popular British monthly. Gardiner’s lively descriptions, though clearly through a ‘Western’ lens, bring the 1972 Plovdiv fair to life, inviting us to vicariously experience its curiosities in a period of warming relations between East and West.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0022009411422368">10</xref></sup>
<fig id="fig1-0022009411422368" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Spectators at the Phillips Company, Inc pavilion at the Plovdiv Fair, circa 1960s.

<p>Leslie Gardiner’s tale of his trip to Plovdiv was first and foremost evocative of a Cold War escapade, an intense narrative heightened by the setting, patently ‘Eastern’ in more ways than one. Amidst fantasies of Orpheus and the Orient Express, his first impressions were a montage of hay-carts, a ‘veiled’ woman, a ‘Tatar encampment.’ Overwhelmed by the feeling of going back in time, Gardiner pondered the Plovdiv past, namely Bulgaria’s ambitious first International Trade Fair in 1892, when ‘Western visitors must have had visions of a gathering of Scythian clans’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0022009411422368">11</xref></sup> But these visitors, he ruminated, must have been confounded when they found in Plovdiv a stock exchange, international banks and a booming commercial center.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0022009411422368">12</xref></sup> Eighty years later, Gardiner still conceived Bulgaria as a stop on the Orient Express, though with a decidedly Cold War twist. Finally past the ‘Tatars,’ Gardiner was stopped at the fair gate that was blocked by a ‘strong military contingent’ suggestive of an authoritarian communist police state. After being shuffled off on an inexplicable wild goose chase through the city, Gardiner was assigned a ‘guide,’ a Mrs. Petrovna, whom he glibly portrayed as a ‘middle-aged, dwarfish lady, with flat feet and a sweet humble expression’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0022009411422368">13</xref></sup> In a period in which openings in the Iron Curtain were just appearing, there were still apparent road blocks, gates and walls, impediments to contact. Once in, however, Gardiner seemed to have the run of the fair, albeit supervised by the rather agreeable Mrs. Petrovna. Tactfully, Gardiner visited the Bulgarian pavilion first (to which we will soon return), but it was the Soviet and American pavilions that came to dominate the pages of his fair recollections.</p>
<p>For Gardiner, as for other spectators, the Soviet–American stand-off was in many respects the main event in Plovdiv in 1972. Soviet-American fair face-offs had been regular occurrences since Expo 1958 in Brussels, and indeed were a central feature of Cold War fairs in the ‘East’ as well as ‘West.’ But unlike in Brussels, where both the Soviets and Americans were centrally located and given spatial parity, in Plovdiv, the Soviet pavilion had by far the most commanding position on the fair grounds. Dominating the central mall of the fair grounds, the Soviet pavilion encompassed some 400,000 square meters of interior space and covered 26,000 square meters of ground. Flanked by seven towers which were 46 meters tall, it was crowned by a needle-like steeple topped by a star, perched atop a portico with stone columns in a high Stalinist neo-Classicist style.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0022009411422368">14</xref></sup> The Soviets clearly presided over the East European Bloc pavilions which flanked the central mall of the fair city leading from the main entrance up a broad boulevard to the Soviet Pavilion, which was visible from virtually any corner of the fair. This building, as the newly arranged fairgrounds themselves, was emblematic of post-war reconfigurations of power. Though obliquely building on a tradition of past fairs – not only 1892 but also annual fairs held in Plovdiv from 1933-1943 – the Plovdiv fair grounds were symbolically relocated in 1947 from central Plovdiv to a spacious new site on the left bank of the Maritsa River. This became the permanent site for what was known as the ‘fair city,’ a cluster of permanent buildings that mushroomed and were expanded in the decades that followed.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0022009411422368">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>Interestingly, the Russians made their first appearance at a Plovdiv fair only in 1940, in the midst of its short-lived alliance with Nazi Germany. Russia had not been part of the array of nations that participated in the 1892 fair because of a diplomatic dispute with Bulgaria in that period. When the Plovdiv fair was resuscitated in the interwar years, Bulgaria’s German diplomatic-trade orientation was quite evident in visible German participation at the fairs. Then, as later, fairs became a microcosm of a given state’s commercial and diplomatic relations, which became physically and materially encoded in buildings and displays of goods.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0022009411422368">16</xref></sup> In 1940, when the Bulgarian state was decidedly right-wing and openly pro-German, it must have been quite a sight for the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics to paint a large CCCP in red on the front of their grand white pavilion in central Plovdiv. In a country where the Communist Party had been illegal and underground since 1925, but was temporarily tolerated as result of the Nazi–Soviet pact, the Soviet display of their flag, red star and a grandiose statue of Lenin was decidedly provocative. You can only imagine the horror of the Plovdiv authorities as thousands of local workers gathered to assist in the setting up of the Soviet display. According to memoirs from the period, these sympathizers secretly kissed the Soviet flag and then brazenly clapped when the flag was raised, even under the watchful eyes of the municipal police.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0022009411422368">17</xref></sup> These same local authorities reportedly arrested the main Bulgarian planner who coordinated the Soviet pavilion, causing quite a scandal and seriously hindering progress on the exhibits.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0022009411422368">18</xref></sup> Nevertheless, the Soviet pavilion went off as planned, and it, along with the Soviet films that were screened, were apparently quite popular attractions, especially among left-wing intellectuals and working class sympathizers.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0022009411422368">19</xref></sup> Bewildered at how to deal with this Trojan horse of communism, Plovdiv’s police reportedly carried off the Soviet ‘comments book,’ which was later mysteriously returned. At any rate, the first Soviet appearance in Plovdiv was in an atmosphere of considerable political strain.</p>
<p>In the post-Second World War years the Soviet place in Plovdiv would change dramatically. With a still relatively fluid diplomatic situation, the 1947 Plovdiv fair had a host of participants, which included the USA, the UK, France, Sweden and Switzerland, in addition to the expected Yugoslavia, Romania, Hungary, Czechoslovakia and Poland. But of the 16 international participants in 1947 the Soviets were by far the most prominent, marking their territory with 6000 square meters of interior space and displaying, among other things, an entire airplane.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0022009411422368">20</xref></sup> Vasil Kolarov, the foreign minister of Bulgaria, opened the 1947 fair with a speech that pinned Bulgaria’s future on the now ‘national’ and ‘rational’ control of Bulgarian resources under the tutelage of the Soviet Union, who was poised to save Bulgaria from a past of ‘waste and abuse’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0022009411422368">21</xref></sup> In the Bulgarian communist mind, under obvious political constraints, the Soviets were defined as neither ‘foreign’ nor exploitative, but rather were symbolically positioned at the center of the exhibition. For at least some, Bulgaria’s shift left – and the fair’s shift to the left bank – was indeed the harbinger of a bright future. As Traicho Kostov – Bulgaria’s Minister of Finance (and the most prominent victim of the 1949 Bulgarian show trials) – was quoted as saying, ‘A person leaves the exhibition elated and full of hope. Bulgaria will be an industrialized country’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0022009411422368">22</xref></sup> For Bulgarian Communists, the Soviets were the great white (or rather, red) hope and their central presence was a visible expression of Bulgarian political and economic cooperation and socialist emulation.</p>
<p>Without a doubt the Soviet Union styled its pavilion and contents with the goal of broadcasting Soviet power, and providing a direct model for Bulgarian and Bloc industrial development. Throughout the 1950s the Soviet Pavilion housed artifacts reflecting technological accomplishments, accompanied by a host of political messages about ‘socialist achievement’ and superiority. In 1958, for example, the central hall was dominated by a three dimensional model of a rocket in flight and a copy of sputnik, which 700,000 visitors reportedly visited in 15 days.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0022009411422368">23</xref></sup> In 1962 Georgi Titov, a Soviet Kosmonaut, made a guest appearance and wandered the ‘fair city’ like a living and interactive display of Soviet success and Soviet–Bulgarian friendship.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0022009411422368">24</xref></sup> Industrial and technological wonders dominated Soviet displays, as Gardiner described in 1972:
<disp-quote>
<p>A pantheon, not a pavilion, a ribbed mountainland of steel canyons, lined with solid machine-gods. You are awestruck at the transportation problems that must have been solved to plant this slice of Russian heavy industry on soil a thousand miles away. If you are Bulgarian, you must wonder whether it is here to stay.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>And perhaps many Bulgarian citizens, much like Gardiner, were impressed by the scale of Soviet achievement that so dwarfed the feats of a small nation like their own, even if they harbored ambivalence towards the Soviet presence.</p>
<p>In 1972, these Soviet ‘mountains’ were ubiquitous, not only filling much of the pavilion space but also spilling onto the open fairgrounds. A Soviet diesel locomotive sprawled on the lawn in front of the pavilion, drawing a crowd of curious onlookers. But as Gardiner ruminated, ‘A stern authoritarian chill surrounds it; the train is too static and too expensive to play with. You shrink a little inside your skin. It is hard to imagine a human being, a flesh-and-blood creature, boarding that cold monster of railroad perfection’. Similarly, inside the pavilion Gardiner marveled over the ‘modern engineering’ but ultimately recoiled at what he concluded was the result of a ‘drab, dehumanized endeavor, Stakhanovite dedication to the work deity.’ Ultimately feats of technology were overshadowed for Gardiner by what they seemed to represent, ‘a race which labors sixteen hours a day and goes home to queue in the sleet for a crust of black bread’. With a clear political implications, Gardiner claimed that the Soviet pavilion only had doors marked ‘vkhod’ (entrance), that there were no ‘EXITS’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0022009411422368">25</xref></sup> Gardiner’s insights most likely would have been shared by other ‘Western’ visitors, who alternated between admiration and projections of evil onto Soviet technological and aesthetic achievement. But it is highly unlikely that all Bloc visitors would have shared in such categorical rejections of Soviet gigantomania. It might even, I suppose, have been awe-inspiring to see the 30 times bigger than life-sized socialist-realist heroes, ‘granite loins, a cliff of pectoral muscle’. Though dwarfing real humans, like the blow-up figures in a Macy’s parade they were still awe-inspiring and certainly a break from the everyday. Even for Gardiner, his lust for Cold War intrigue, and the adrenalin rush at strolling into the mouth of the beast are palpable. And large crowds were routinely present at the Soviet pavilion, in spite of its presumed dehumanization.
<fig id="fig2-0022009411422368" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Bulgarian man in national dress looking at an electric typewriter, circa 1970s.

<p>In part, this was surely because by 1972 the Soviet pavilion housed much more than just gargantuan statues and machines. As early as 1947, the ‘Moskvich’ and other consumer goods were put on display, though greatly overshadowed by agricultural and industrial machinery. In the years that followed, and particularly after 1956, caviar, vodka, textiles and other such goods were an increasingly visible element in the pavilion. The widely noted post-Stalinist ‘shift’ to light industry and consumer goods that occurred after the death of Stalin was apparent in the Soviet Pavilion in Plovdiv as elsewhere in and outside fairgrounds.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0022009411422368">26</xref></sup> Khrushchev’s famously cited aim from a speech in 1956 ‘to bury’ the West, required an increasingly overt focus on socialist abundance made evident at Bloc trade fairs.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0022009411422368">27</xref></sup> By the mid 1950s displays of power were also necessarily connected with a profusion of goods, as the state power to <italic>provide </italic>coexisted with and critically bolstered the power to protect or build socialism. While Gardiner makes no mention of consumer goods during his first pass through the Soviet pavilion, documents suggest that the Soviets displayed the Zhiguli (later called Lada) cars, radios and other consumer wares.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0022009411422368">28</xref></sup> But in the shadow of the massive machines and statues, such displays did not draw Gardiner’s eye for comment. Walking past the pavilion a second time, however, a Soviet fashion show in front of the structure captured his attention:
<disp-quote>
<p>The model, a silvery-haired grand duchess in leathery tunic and skirt, strides out, turns about, and strides back. The same model in a sable-trimmed maxi-coat, reappears … Give the Russians their due, this fashion parade is something new and daring, and it had caught on – until the Cadillac goes by again and all heads turn, all attention is riveted.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>As Gardiner conceded, the Soviet Union was by no means a one trick pony and certainly could draw audiences to witness their elaborate show of ‘progress’ and plenty. Far from alienating, such displays may have seduced the Bulgarian viewer and instilled confidence in their Soviet mentor. Having said that, a passing American ‘Cadillac’ was also likely to turn heads.</p>
<p>‘The Cadillac’ apparently turned not only Bulgarian heads, but Gardiner’s. In fact, he first spotted the almost alien craft when his vehicle was caught in a traffic jam behind an over-turned hay-cart on approach to the fair grounds. As Gardiner described, the ‘large black American automobile, last year’s model, low slung and softly sprung’ appeared as almost a mirage. Its appearance directly followed Gardiner’s report on the hay-cart, which reminded him of ‘those fragile Eastern structures you see pictures of, with coolies trotting over, bearing strings of fish on long bamboo poles’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0022009411422368">29</xref></sup> The contrast between the Cadillac and its surroundings must have been slightly less stark inside the fair grounds, but still, heads likely turned as this figment of the capitalist world moved by ‘with the silent, opulent roll and swagger that American cars in a certain price bracket have’. It is almost comical to imagine this beast of 1970s American consumerism rolling through the fair city with its ‘white-walled tires’, American flag fluttering on its wing, and two bald men in dark suits reading the <italic>Wall Street Journal</italic> nonchalantly in the back.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0022009411422368">30</xref></sup> According to Gardiner, the Cadillac – the only car allowed to drive inside the fairgrounds – drew crowds like a pied piper towards an ‘oasis of movement and light’. They were drawn ‘West’ in the imaginative sense, to the American pavilion, which was not actually a permanent structure but rather a temporary ‘astrodome’ of some unspecified aluminum-colored material. Tucked neatly away behind the grand Soviet pavilion, a trek was required to reach its synthetic splendor. But it was apparently well worth it. According to Gardiner, ‘if the U.S.A. is represented by no more than that Cadillac and this astrodome it will have scored a triumph’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0022009411422368">31</xref></sup></p>
<p>Ironically, the American presence at the Plovdiv fair had a longer history than the Russian one. Although there was no official American pavilion in 1892, Singer sewing machines and one of Edison’s phonographs made quite an impression on turn of the century Bulgarians at the Plovdiv Fair. American companies, unlike Soviet enterprises, also participated in Plovdiv trade fairs throughout the 1930s guaranteeing a small but noteworthy technological and trade exchange.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0022009411422368">32</xref></sup> But for the Americans, 1947 would be their only fleeting post-war chance to sell the American dream in Plovdiv, and it was understandably meager. After the US broke off relations with Bulgaria in 1948, they were notably absent from the fair from 1948 until 1960 when relations again resumed. This was several years later than other ‘Western’ participants – namely France, Austria, West Germany, Belgium, Switzerland and Sweden – who cautiously reappeared in 1958, the early spring of Khrushchev’s peaceful co-existence. The 1960 American debut was rather limited in scope, primarily a demonstration of the latest medial equipment from the X-ray to a heart-lung machine; by no means a sensation among Bulgarian audiences.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0022009411422368">33</xref></sup></p>
<p>With Bulgarian-American relations still tentative, it was not until 1962 that the American presence would become a consistent feature of the fair. Throughout the 1960s both the United States and Bulgaria had reservations about full-fledged contact and exchange. Still, both the Bulgarian leader, Todor Zhivkov, and the various American leaders of the 1960s saw potential benefits in mutual cooperation that over-rode the concerns of domestic Cold Warriors. In many ways, Bulgaria was the more insistent of the two sides. During Zhivkov’s visit to the US for a month in 1960, for example, he actively lobbied for resumed trade relations at a time when Americans were still cautious about East–West trade. US initiatives in Bulgaria gained momentum only in the Kennedy years (1961–3) through the activities of the ambassador Eugenie Anderson, who was the first American official ever to go on Bulgarian radio and TV, addressing the public haltingly in their own language. Anderson became famous for her stand-off with Bulgarian officials at the Plovdiv Fair in 1962 over a pamphlet that the US embassy had produced for distribution at the fair, with a picture and innocuous message from President Kennedy. Though Anderson went through proper channels and put the pamphlet through a rigorous censorship process, Bulgarian authorities still tried to seize the 150,000 pamphlets produced for the event, which Anderson hid and then refused to relinquish. Ingeniously she handed one to Zhivkov himself when he visited the pavilion and was forced to accept it graciously. Subsequently, Bulgarians stampeded the pavilion for copies as if the Americans were ‘passing out dollar bills’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0022009411422368">34</xref></sup> Predictably, the American pavilion was the site of some controversy in these years because of the Bulgarian confiscation of brochures, surveillance of visitors diplomatic and press criticism of the American exhibit – with its ubiquitous messages of freedom of press, speech and immigration – made these early years of Bulgarian–American fair encounters exceedingly uneasy.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0022009411422368">35</xref></sup></p>
<p>Indeed, Bulgarian officials directed American organizers to focus on ‘non-political,’ ‘trade’ oriented displays and refrain from the explicitly political. Without a doubt, this provoked the American turn to explicitly consumerist exhibits, which gained momentum in these years. Of course it was not only the Bulgarian requests to ‘depoliticize’ displays that directed an American shift in focus. While opposition to trading and fraternizing with the communists was still common currency in the US, high placed politicians argued that consumerism could be a weapon in and of itself. American politicians, diplomats and commercial interests advanced a range of reasons as to why this would serve American interests in the long term. Anthony Solomon, for example, one of the most influential financial policy advisors of the Cold War, gave the following advice to the Lyndon B. Johnson inner circle:
<disp-quote>
<p>It is clear to me that it is in our best interest to take actions which help bring about a diversion of their resources from military and space programs to consumer goods. Let me put it to you this way. Who here would not sooner have Yugoslavia growing tobacco than producing munitions? Who among us would rather have Soviet workers making passenger cars instead of missiles?<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0022009411422368">36</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Along these lines, a report to Solomon from congressman Thomas Rees cited the consensus of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) and the CIA who are ‘very much in favor of … mov[ing] the Soviets toward a more consumer-oriented economy’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-0022009411422368">37</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Plovdiv fair, as other Cold War fairs, became a context in which American consumer products were dangled in front of curious socialist citizens. In 1962 American displays featured a modern American kitchen and a high fidelity music system, while in 1964 a mini-supermarket, a potato chip machine and a jeep station wagon were exhibited.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-0022009411422368">38</xref></sup> Although tucked into the back corner of the fair, such exhibits reportedly drew large crowds of interested spectators, curious for a glimpse of the ‘West’ on their territory. The Bulgarian regime, and at times American exhibitors, in fact, were alarmed by the large crowds that gathered to see these spectacles of American consumerism. On one occasion in 1966, for example, the exhibit was even closed for two hours in mid-day because huge crowds raised ‘safety issues’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-0022009411422368">39</xref></sup> 1972 was no exception to this. As Gardiner corroborated, the American exhibit was packed with inquisitive onlookers, mostly Bulgarian and Russian, who repeatedly walked through a maze of interactive exhibits where you could ‘restock your fantasy world’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-0022009411422368">40</xref></sup> Unlike the Soviet counterpart the American exhibit was pure fun, with ‘parlour games’ and an ‘orgy of button-pressing, microphone-talking, and electrickery’. There was also a golf cart, a squadron of Harley Davidson racing motorcycles and a speedboat that sped around the United States’ own marina, from which wafted the ‘scent of something barbequed’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-0022009411422368">41</xref></sup> Gardiner contemplated the joy of the Bulgarian youth left in charge of the boat while the Americans ate lunch: ‘Eighty miles an hour’, he told a wizened hill-farmer in an astrakhan cap. ‘For work?’ the man asked. ‘Of course not. For pleasure’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-0022009411422368">42</xref></sup></p>
<p>It goes without saying that it is extremely difficult to know how Bulgarians and other Eastern Bloc spectators <italic>read</italic> the American exhibits in 1972, or any other year for that matter. According to Gardiner, Bulgarians and Russians emerging from the American maze immediately re-entered for a second run. He also described a psychological change: ‘A change is noticeable in the dogged expression of the East Europeans. Brows uncloud, eyes are lit with anticipation. As we converge on the colored hemisphere we meet others who have been inside and their delight is infectious’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-0022009411422368">43</xref></sup> But even though Gardiner himself was more than a bit disdainful of this American ‘orgy’ he also recognized that ‘In this astrodome they are giving away dreams along with hot dogs and doughnuts’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-0022009411422368">44</xref></sup> But were the dreams of the American pavilion merely a mirage of their own type? A montage of goods from a very distant and untouchable world that was surely accessible only to the very rich and famous within that world?<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-0022009411422368">45</xref></sup> Was East European delight like the buzz one might experience after Disneyland? Impressed by the fantasy, but knowing that it is not real?

<p>In sharp contrast to the American fantasy land or the Soviet pantheon, the Bulgarian exhibit was exceedingly <italic>real</italic>. By this I don’t mean that there was not a certain element of imaginary in the numerous Bulgarian pavilions, featuring more elaborate displays and goods than would have been available in the average Bulgarian shop in the 1960s and 1970s. But rather that the Bulgarian pavilions featured profusions of plenty that were within the realm of possibility.</p>
<p>After all, Bulgaria enjoyed some of the highest economic growth rates in post-war Europe.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-0022009411422368">46</xref></sup> These were decades of relative abundance under Bulgarian socialism, an abundance that represented a huge improvement in the standard of living for most average Bulgarians.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-0022009411422368">47</xref></sup> The Bulgarian displays were far from pure fantasy, though it was certainly the best of new Bulgarian product lines, many not yet distributed to Bulgarian stores.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn48-0022009411422368">48</xref></sup> While Bulgarians had no Apollo or Sputnik to exhibit, they did have a vast and growing variety of consumer goods and services to display both inside and outside the fair grounds. In short, though perhaps less spectacular than Soviet and American pavilions, the Bulgarians put on a good show in Cold War Plovdiv for domestic as well as foreign visitors.</p>
<p>Even Leslie Gardiner seemed charmed by the Bulgarian displays, which unlike the Soviet (and even American) ones, he described as simple, tasteful, even somehow meaningful and fun for Bulgarian visitors. As mentioned, a Bulgarian national pavilion (the Ministry of Light Industry) was Gardiner’s first stop. After grumbling about crumpled signs with slogans and a failed hot-air balloon replica – to commemorate the eighty year anniversary of the first fair in 1892 – Gardiner soon had a change in attitude:
<disp-quote>
<p>The national pavilion cold shoulders yesterday. The watchword is forward. This is what the fun of the Fair consists of for native Bulgarians: walking round the neat little furnishing layouts, the mosaics of canned goods, the fur coats and tufted rugs and sportswear and anticipating the day when these commodities will actually be seen in the shops.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn49-0022009411422368">49</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Concluding jab aside, Gardiner was duly impressed by the carefully arranged contents and the genuine ‘fun’ experienced by Bulgarian visitors. As described by Gardiner, Mrs. Petrovna experienced a kind of ‘reverence’ as they approached the furniture hall, with its sumptuously displayed examples of Bulgarian ‘woodworking ingenuity’. Even Gardiner was seduced by the ‘Rose room’, which he described as a ‘cataract of pink and white rosebuds through which authentic attar, at thirty pounds an ounce, is carelessly trickling’. The effect was mesmerizing, a scent one could ‘smell all over Plovdiv’. And then there was the music, ‘like the music of Orpheus’ which lured Gardiner and Mrs. Petrovna into a darkened hall where color slides of Bulgaria were shown. Inspired, Mrs. Petrovna joined in song while Gardiner mused, ‘the simple song, so fresh and gay, with its innocent echoes … had tremendous sentimental appeal’. In spite of its shortcomings, the Bulgarians did deliver a fair experience in 1972 that made an impression, even on a rather jaded traveler like Gardiner.</p>
<p>Bulgaria, in fact, was well positioned since at least the mid-1950s to deliver her agricultural cornucopia with a flourish, and more importantly as <italic>modern,</italic> that is wrapped, packaged and even <italic>served</italic> with a smile. Hence in addition to displays of raw fruits, vegetables, nuts and aquariums of Danubian fish, there were sausages, cheeses, 14 varieties of cigarettes (as early as 1956!) with flashy names like ‘Diplomat’, ‘Luks’, ‘Derby’, ‘Travel’ and ‘Rila Sport’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn50-0022009411422368">50</xref></sup> The Bulgarians displayed their tobacco, filtered, blended, aromatized, packed, branded and wrapped in cellophane. Bulgarian rose oil and other herbal essences were also on exhibit, though increasingly infused into a ‘rich assortment’ of oils, soaps, toothpaste, perfumes and other modern hygiene products produced by the state firm Aroma.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn51-0022009411422368">51</xref></sup> Food products were jarred, smoked, packaged and served up by waiters, from whom the state demanded good service. In a 1955 ad for ‘Naroden Restorant’ (National Restaruant), for example, customers were promised ‘tasty food, ample <italic>skara </italic>(grill), a rich selection of cold snacks, hors d'oeuvres, salads, deserts and a high quality selection and rich assortment of beverages, all with exemplary cleanliness, quick and cultured service and a pleasing atmosphere’. <sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn52-0022009411422368">52</xref></sup> Bulgarian food was to be consumed in modern settings and the restaurant experience in and outside the fair city was to be an integral part of the fair experience. In 1972 <italic>Fair News</italic> boasted the opening of 150 new restaurants and shops, and major renovations for old ones.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn53-0022009411422368">53</xref></sup> The power of the Bulgarian state – perhaps more than its Soviet counterpart – because this was its <italic>only </italic>raison d’etre – was most effectively expressed through its power to provide quality food, cigarettes, wine, as well as resort hotels and restaurants to Bulgarians and foreign visitors.</p>
<p>As early as 1955, the Bulgarian state – as its partners in the Bloc – began to openly pursue a restrained variety of socialist consumer culture, well before the United States appeared at Cold War trade fairs, and the CIA planned to ‘provoke’ such a shift. Certainly Bulgarian, Bloc, (and even Yugoslav) socialist consumer culture had far more modest and circumscribed, though rather ambiguous, boundaries. Most importantly, the ultimate goal and rationale were quite different, articulated as a need to supply worthy ‘workers’ and even respond to their changing demands. As a 1955 article in <italic>Plovdivski Panair</italic> suggested: ‘With the growth of the material and cultural well-being of workers the demands for quality and assortment of good have also risen’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn54-0022009411422368">54</xref></sup> Changes in the character of the fair, the article argued, ‘reflect the growth of new demands and buying power of our nation’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn55-0022009411422368">55</xref></sup> Indeed, the machinations of the specific industries of the period – like the Bulgarian cigarette industry – show the extent to which the regime was <italic>responding</italic> to consumer demands, as much as it was trying to shape them.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn56-0022009411422368">56</xref></sup> But shaping such demands – and hence shaping consumers – was also clearly part of the Bulgarian socialist project. In the perhaps contradictory words of the newspaper, <italic>Plovdiv Fair</italic>, ‘the influence of the fair over the Bulgarian consumer has obvious and direct relationships to socialist commerce … It raises the taste of our workers’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn57-0022009411422368">57</xref></sup> Having a population that was ‘modern’ in style, taste, hygiene and mindset was always a critical part of the socialist project in Bulgaria as elsewhere.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn58-0022009411422368">58</xref></sup> Creating a modern citizen – even a socialist one – necessitated rooting out backwardness and creating a population of modern consumers.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn59-0022009411422368">59</xref></sup></p>
<p>Indeed an ‘international bazaar’ section of the fair had also been set up where the flocks of guests were encouraged to shop for a wide variety of Bulgarian and foreign goods. The fair was not just showcasing what socialist citizens, who made up the majority of guests, could <italic>theoretically</italic> consume. It was actually a venue for mass consumption, not just of restaurant delights, but a wide variety of consumer goods – from souvenirs, to shoes, children’s toys and fabrics. Admittedly not everything on display was for sale, and this may have made many socialist citizens more acutely aware of their everyday shortages or question socialist progress as a mere ‘illusion’. But even if such questions were raised, ‘Western’ exhibits too would have been seen as part of the fair fantasy. Meanwhile, from 1960-1966 alone the ‘fair city’ doubled in size. The grounds were expanded and beautified, and numerous new pavilions were built, including specialized pavilions for various Bulgarian ministries and industries as well as for foreign exhibitors.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn60-0022009411422368">60</xref></sup> Expanded space and pavilion specialization, allowed separation of the more utilitarian machinery and chemical exhibits from the more popular and showy displays of consumer goods, primarily in the pavilion of the Ministry of Light Industry. Here a plethora of goods were elaborately arranged in quite intricate and artistic displays. Everything from textiles, finished clothing, leather goods,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn61-0022009411422368">61</xref></sup> dishes and furniture met the eye, while thematic exhibits, such as ‘People and Free Time’ and ‘The Modern Home’, carried both political and consumerist messages.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn62-0022009411422368">62</xref></sup> The Ministry of Light Industry boasted that it was ‘studying the development of fashion across the globe, about the culture of clothes’ to make sure that the character of their collections ‘correspond with the demands of fashion’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn63-0022009411422368">63</xref></sup> In many ways the fair itself became a school for both displaying and studying ‘global’ aesthetics – a product of East-West interaction – for integration into local design.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn64-0022009411422368">64</xref></sup></p>
<p>Agricultural products, however, remained central to Bulgarian exhibits as did their ability to wine and dine fair visitors, socialist citizens or the growing trickle of visitors from the West. In some respects, the very ability of Bulgaria, and more specifically the city of Plovdiv, to host and <italic>feed </italic>hundreds of thousands of guests was in and of itself a ‘socialist achievement’. Just weeks before the opening of the 1956 fair, for example, one of the headlines of the <italic>Plovdiv Fair</italic> confidently announced, ‘The Feeding of Guests in Plovdiv is Assured’, followed by details on the variety of food, drink and services arranged for the thousands of visitors that would soon descend on Plovdiv:
<disp-quote>
<p>Two modern restaurants were arranged and outfitted in the fair city near the palace of the Ministry of heavy industry which will work every day until midnight and can serve 18–20,000 people a day. In the foyers of the restaurants there will be buffets which offer guests cold and hot snacks as well as all kinds of alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks. On the fairgrounds nine pavilions will serve consumers with a rich assortment of snacks, refrigerated drinks: carbonated water, lemonade, and different kinds of fruit drinks and beer. These offerings will be spread far and wide. Ten carts will offer visitors ice cream and special vendors will carry around fresh snacks and sweet treats.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn65-0022009411422368">65</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Advertisements for the state agency <italic>Naroden Restarant</italic> (National Restaurant) became common features of this and other fair publications, with a focus on refreshment variety, availability and notably ‘courteous service’. City authorities even called for a vigilant watch over restaurants, hotels, drivers and other services to make sure there was no ‘over-charging and that the promised “courteous service” was provided’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn66-0022009411422368">66</xref></sup></p>
<p>But food and accommodation, though critical, were just one part of Bulgaria’s offerings. Indeed, for two weeks every September Plovdiv was transformed into an elaborate party in and beyond the fair, where sporting events, concerts, outings to the coast or mountains, films and other distractions were available for dizzying crowds to explore.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn67-0022009411422368">67</xref></sup> And the guests poured in. Facilitated by half-price domestic and regional train fares, by 1956 more than 750,000 Bulgarians and foreigners walked the lanes of Plovdiv’s now impressive ‘fair city’,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn68-0022009411422368">68</xref></sup> In addition, the Soviet Union and undoubtedly other Bloc partners ran popular all inclusive ‘excursions’ from Moscow and Kiev to the fair. <sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn69-0022009411422368">69</xref></sup> The number of Western visitors was also on the rise in this period, as the Bulgarian regime actively worked to promote Bulgaria as a tourist site to Americans and West Europeans. At the fair itself, visitors were lured with images of the ‘velvety sands’ of the Black Sea coast and other tourist locales beyond the city.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn70-0022009411422368">70</xref></sup> With few products that could be sold in the West and continued trade restrictions or prohibitive tariffs, tourism was one of the most promising ways for Bulgaria to earn hard currency in the short term. Bulgarian state agencies began to produce and sell pamphlets, books and periodicals in English that sold Bulgaria as a tourist destination – the Black Sea, its verdant mountain ranges, mineral baths and its unique history and architectural monuments, including those in Plovdiv. At least some Westerners took notice and by the mid-late 1960s, travel pieces on Bulgaria began to appear in the <italic>New York Times</italic> touting Bulgaria as both beautiful and inexpensive. Far from complaining about bad service or low quality goods, the authors were enamored by Bulgaria’s layered history, its ‘magnificent beaches’ and even its range of accommodations and restaurants.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn71-0022009411422368">71</xref></sup> But while Bloc tourists did flock to Bulgaria, though generally more for the beaches than the fair, Western visitors (especially American ones) remained considerably more elusive. Those who did come were surely the more adventurous, willing to suffer some discomfort and uncertainty for a taste of the East, a Cold War adrenaline rush.</p>
<p>Western tourists, especially those unprepared for a certain amount of discomfort or difference, were undoubtedly less than satisfied by the overall tourist experience in Bulgaria, at or beyond the fair. Gardiner, for example, when he finally made his way to the restaurant at the Hotel Maritsa where he way staying, quipped about the loud ‘gypsy band’ and the menu, ‘the seventeenth carbon copy of a mistyped Cyrillic bill of fare’. But even he was drawn into the general atmosphere of excitement as some 60 nationalities gathered in the spacious restaurant: ‘Here in the big hotel at mealtimes the real Fair is happening, the round-about of sales talk mesmerically rotating, the swings of technical one-upmanship rising and falling’. In fact, most of his complaints were reserved for ignorant and patronizing tourists, like a ‘blue-rinsed Canadian woman’ who complained that the ice water was too cold. Ultimately Gardiner unwittingly treated a student from Sofia University to drinks and food while he smoked ‘everyone’s cigarettes but his own’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn72-0022009411422368">72</xref></sup> But he seemed to love every minute of it. The setting was lively, the liquor was flowing, and under the circumstances the Bulgarians provided amply. Other foreign visitors echoed this sentiment, as Edouard Calic, a French journalist and visitor in 1964 remarked: ‘Foreigners invade the restaurants and the pleasure haunts, and on the terraces and in the courtyard of my hotel I have seen over 2000 people, foreigners and local people, mix freely. They even danced the twist.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn73-0022009411422368">73</xref></sup></p>
<p>But Westerners aside, the expectations of Bulgarian organizers and visitors often exceeded the actual ability to provide basic goods and services during the fair weeks. Such missteps were openly critiqued in the official press, through the jauntily critical humorous section of <italic>Plovdiv Fair </italic>entitled ‘<italic>Vesel Panair</italic>’ (Fun Fair), with its obvious instructional objective. In the decade and a half that the column ran, from at least 1955–1969, the Bulgarian ‘thaw’ allowed jabs to be directed at the lack of good and services, their quality, and the Plovdiv providers who took advantage of the needs of fair visitors. Images of people stuffed like sardines into buses and trains headed for Plovdiv may have flatteringly alluded to the fair’s popularity, but they also spoke to transportation issues that were apparently rife.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn74-0022009411422368">74</xref></sup> Lodging was clearly also in short supply, according to frequent jokes about legions of distant relatives descending upon Plovdiv residents, people sleeping at concerts, on park benches and, in one case, ‘on a pool table’ for 8 lev an hour.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn75-0022009411422368">75</xref></sup> Much to the dismay of state officials, Plovdiv residents seemed to take advantage of the shortage of space and provisions during the fair weeks to make a tidy profit out of their vulnerable guests. In another caricature in <italic>Plovdiv Fair, </italic>a horse and cart driver quoted an outrageous price for a ride to a waiting customer who asked ‘Are you selling the whole cart?’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn76-0022009411422368">76</xref></sup> Even restaurants were a frequent target of friendly fire. In one oft repeated joke a man asked another who was seen waiting at a restaurant, ‘Have you been waiting long?’ His reply: ‘Since the last fair’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn77-0022009411422368">77</xref></sup> Another joke featured a sick guest who was looking for a warm drink to soothe his sore throat and was directed to ‘go to the restaurant and order a beer’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn78-0022009411422368">78</xref></sup> Still another fair guest joked that ‘all at the fair was big and new except for the sandwiches and <italic>kebapche</italic> (meat patties)’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn79-0022009411422368">79</xref></sup> As these caricatures explored, goods and services providers at the fair and in Plovdiv left something to be desired.</p>
<p>But it was the Bulgarian consumers, not the providers, who were most frequently chided in <italic>Plovdiv Fair </italic>for their questionable behavior. As expressed in one satirical pictorial narrative, for example, a truck driver named Stanimir showed up at the fair with money to buy a new truck that he envisioned in a cartoon bubble floating above his head. But after alighting at a table to drink away his money, the image of his planned purchase (again in the bubble) quickly transformed into a more modest purchase, a car. As the bottles piled up under his table the bubble image transformed into a motorcycle and in the final frame he appeared at his door to show his horrified wife a bicycle, purchased with what remained of his money after his drunken binge.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn80-0022009411422368">80</xref></sup> Stanimir, the drunken truck driver, was just one of a parade of Bulgarian men, whose drinking hindered their productive role as spectators and consumers at the fair. One anecdote entitled ‘He Calmed Down’ offered a similar critique:
<disp-quote>
<p>One drunkard who was sitting on the sidewalk of the main street of Plovdiv asked a passerby, ‘Hey friend, there with the light on, is that a beer hall?’ ‘No. A shoe store’. Oh, then there is no danger! If the shoe stores are still open, then my wife has surely not returned to the hotel! And with that the drunkard set off to find a beer hall.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn81-0022009411422368">81</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Although outside the ‘fair city’ itself, this scene was indicative of the perception of problems with both male and female consumption in the context of the fair weeks and beyond. For men the critical point was clear and oft repeated. Men were drinking (and smoking) away the fair days in the beer halls and restaurants inside and outside the fair grounds to the detriment of their ability to properly consume fair messages and the vast array of goods. But the Bulgarian female was also a potential problem as an avid shoe-shopper and ‘material’ girl. A barrage of other images from <italic>Plovdiv Fair </italic>of women over-shopping at and during the fair were far from flattering. At the same time however, this critique was relatively gentle, light-hearted, and undoubtedly few Bulgarians actually saw themselves in these hyperbole images.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn82-0022009411422368">82</xref></sup> But what they did see was an attempt by the state to engineer socialist consumer culture, which was clearly defined both by a sense of active involvement and restraint. While men needed to avoid excess drinking, women’s active participation in the fair and socialist consumption was something desirable, but also something that needed to be kept in check.</p>
<p>In reality, however, Bulgarian state actors hardly had the means to carry out any elaborate engineering of everyday consumer practices. Beyond half-hearted abstinence programs, Bulgarians were welcome to consume heartily from the table of Bulgarian socialist (and to a certain extent Bloc) abundance, as limited (compared to the West) as it might have been. And for all the glitz and glamour of the American displays and the grand scale of the Soviet displays, it was ultimately the Bulgarian displays that were the most <italic>real</italic>, not just to Bulgarians but perhaps also to other visitors, especially those (like Gardiner) who were not citizens of either of the two super-powers. As Gardiner summed up about the 40-odd competing nations in 1972, ‘Russia is the most bleak and formidable’, while ‘The United States has been far and way the greatest success in winning friends’, but ‘Bulgaria has tried the hardest’. These efforts were not in vain. Though Bulgarian socialism ultimately collapsed as a system, along with the Bloc that it was a part of, the Plovdiv Fair can hardly be viewed as a portent of failure. If anything, its success was part and parcel of Bulgarian socialist success, which is best understood on its own terms – from the vantage point of the Plovdiv fairgrounds.</p>
<p>For two weeks out of every year hundreds of thousands of people descended on Bulgaria’s second largest city as spectators and consumers. The Plovdiv fair grounds were like a portal through which the Iron Curtain was permeated and interaction and exchange took place. The fair offered an array of images and goods – messages of power and plenty from a variety of states, most notably, the Soviet Union and the United States. But Bulgarian socialism was really the main thing on display, on and off the fair grounds. Much remains to be studied about how visitors to the fair read the variety of messages associated with Bulgarian (as well as Soviet, American or other) exhibits at the fair, let alone off-site experiences. It is unclear to what extent the fair, or even its prominent Soviet and popular American pavilions, were read or experienced in overtly political ways. For most, amusement and pleasure undoubtedly obscured the politics that flowed beneath the surface of the everyday fair experience. Nevertheless, the trials and achievements of the annual Plovdiv International Fair, readily illustrate how central spectacles of plenty and consumption were to East-West engagement, though for the ‘East’ this was decidedly on their own terms. Arguably, their ultimate goal was not to produce an 80-mile-an-hour power boat or a fleet of Harleys, but rather a realistic and restrained system of consumption, to which most could aspire. Undoubtedly there were as many readings of the fair as there were spectators. For most, though, I would venture to guess that the fair was more about relaxing over <italic>kebabche</italic> and <italic>rakia</italic> than assessing the relative merits of communist or capitalist political systems. If intense Cold War politics can be discerned in the deep layers of the fair experience, on the surface it was still just a leisure experience – complete with fashion shows, food and drink, restaurants, sidewalk cafes and an abundance of cigarettes. And though a few Bulgarians in those years may have dreamed of a ride on an American powerboat, few would have been willing to trade <italic>kebabche</italic> for hot dogs.</p>
