<title>Technical Notes</title>
<p>As its title suggests, <italic>Smith in Palestine</italic> is intended to be a collection of private theatrical events, the idea being that <italic>Smith in Palestine’s</italic> dispersed readership will perform the roles of all of the actor(s) in <italic>Smith and Palestine</italic> – as well as its audience – simultaneously. However, unlike most theatrical productions that involve audience participation, the audience for each production of <italic>Smith in Palestine</italic> is unlikely to extend beyond the individual reader. This is primarily because instructions for the staging of <italic>Smith in Palestine</italic> – which are found on the following pages – can generally only be engaged with by one reader at a time. It <italic>is</italic> logistically possible for the text to be performed at the same time, in one place, by any number of different people, although it is unlikely that many individuals will choose to gather together in order to perform the text in this way. However, if this were to happen then it would be interesting to consider what form such an event might assume. Similarly, it is not inconceivable that the reader may wish to perform <italic>Smith in Palestine</italic> in the company of another, although I suspect that in most cases, and for various reasons, this is also unlikely.</p>
<p>Despite its theatrical pretensions, <italic>Smith in Palestine</italic> appears to have more in common with film than theatre. It looks very much like a screenplay, except that it includes photographs, which the conventional screenplay never does. This indicates that <italic>Smith in Palestine</italic> is not actually a screenplay at all, or at least not one that most of us would be familiar with. The author’s stated intention that the text should be ‘read aloud, in its entirety’ seems to confirm this because it appears to prohibit <italic>Smith in Palestine</italic> from ever being what most regular screenplays always implicitly want to become: a film.</p>
<p>Although the reader/performer is expected to vocalize all of the written material contained in the text, including the technical instructions – scene headings, shot descriptions, etc. – it is impossible for the performer to directly translate Smith’s photographs into speech. This may be problematic. In short, one might be able to use words to describe or analyse photographs, but one cannot translate them in the same way that one can translate a written word into a spoken one. Thus one of the effects of photography in <italic>Smith in Palestine</italic> is to remind the reader/performer that, despite the author’s injunction to read the text ‘aloud, in its entirety’, part of the text will always apparently remain beyond them and that, moreover, should they repeatedly choose to pursue their desire to carry out the author’s instructions, then their desire will be repeatedly frustrated.</p>
<p>Because the reader is expected to perform all of the text ‘in its entirety’, he or she is therefore, required to do with the screenplay what the conventional actor would never do: give voice to the technical instructions contained therein. In so doing, the reader of <italic>Smith in Palestine</italic> will transform these instructions, which are scattered throughout the text, into one of <italic>Smith in Palestine’s</italic> main characters. Thus, in addition to the task that technical instructions always perform in a screenplay – indicate what the screenplay would look and sound like if it actually became a film – the technical instructions in <italic>Smith in Palestine</italic> will, during the reader’s articulation of them, have a prosodic function as well as an indicative one.</p>
<p><italic>Smith in Palestine’s</italic> musicality, the persuasiveness of which is contingent on the individual reader’s performance, is in part a consequence of the tension that exists between the sound that the technical instructions make when spoken and the sound of those passages of speech that are attributed to humans: Smith, Willing, Mohammed, etc. That scene headings often contain abbreviated words and are usually punctuated with hyphens means that articulating lines of technical instruction can generally be given only in a relatively abrupt and disconnected way. This means that the interruption of specific passages of regular rhythmical speech (articulated by most of the human characters in <italic>Smith in Palestine</italic>) by staccato lines of technical instruction causes the reader to frequently experience intermittent shifts from tonal regularity to dissonant irregularity. This is not something that the reader only experiences intellectually; for the reader-as-performer it is also physically embodied. In this way, the reader, like the story itself, is corporeally propelled by the rhythms of the text. In the same way, perhaps, that the story of the ongoing conflict in Palestine and Israel is often propelled and perhaps even, in part, constituted by the aural, visual and narrative rhythms of, for example, a television news broadcast on al-Jazeera, Fox or the BBC.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Smith is a photographer. Willing is an anthropologist.</p>
<p>Since 2006 Smith has taken a lot of photographs at places that are either already associated with the phenomenon known as ‘dark tourism’, or might in future come to be associated with it.</p>
<p>To date, Smith has produced photographs at: (a) former Nazi death camps in eastern Europe including Auschwitz-Birkenau, Sobibor and Belzec; (b) favelas in Rio de Janeiro; (c) Bhopal in the Indian state of Madhyar Pradesh which, in 1984, was the site of the world’s worst industrial accident; and (d) Palestine.</p>
<p>As an anthropologist and ethnographer, Willing’s primary interest is in the way in which Smith behaves in challenging environments and difficult situations.</p>
<p>What follows is what remains of a film that was shot in Palestine, by Willing, between 12 to 17 August 2009. Willing’s film was almost entirely destroyed by Smith, shortly after their return to England.</p>
