<title>Background</title>
<p>Monitoring the conduct of clinical trials is recommended by International Conference of Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice (ICH GCP) guidelines and is integral to trial quality assurance. On-site monitoring, that is, visiting trial sites, is one part of this process but little is known about the procedures that are performed in practice.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1740774512467405">
<title>Purpose</title>
<p>To examine and summarise published on-site monitoring methods for health-care clinical trials, including evaluations of their benefits and costs to trials.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1740774512467405">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>A systematic literature review identified all articles reporting the methods and practices of on-site monitoring of randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Articles were categorised into (1) reports from research groups and organisations, (2) reports from individual RCTs, (3) randomised trials of on-site monitoring interventions, (4) cost simulations, or (5) surveys of trial staff and monitors. Data were extracted on the characteristics of the trials and groups reporting on-site monitoring (e.g., geographical origin, sponsor, and trial focus). Information from articles in categories (1)–(3) was summarised on the frequency and scope of site monitoring visits, monitoring team size and composition, activities during site visits, and reporting structures. Evaluations of the benefits and disadvantages of on-site monitoring were examined for all included articles.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1740774512467405">
<title>Results</title>
<p>In total, 57 articles were identified, comprising 21 articles about the on-site monitoring practices of 16 research groups, 30 articles from 26 RCTs, 1 on-site monitoring intervention RCT, 2 cost simulations, and 3 surveys. Publications in categories (1)–(3), mostly originated from the United States (33/52, 63%) or Europe (15/52, 29%), were predominantly describing non-commercial organisations or trials (45/52, 87%), with heart disease (9/26, 35%) or cancer (5/26, 19%) the commonest focus of individual RCTs. The frequency of visits ranged from every 6–8 weeks up to once every 3 years, with mostly all trial sites visited. The number of monitors visiting a site varied between 1 and 8. The most common on-site monitoring activity was verifying source data and consent forms, with a focus on data accuracy. Only six articles evaluated their on-site monitoring process, with improvements observed in recruitment rates and protocol adherence but with direct costs and staff time viewed as the major disadvantages. The on-site monitoring RCT ended prematurely so preventing full assessment.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1740774512467405">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>Trialists and organisations may utilise additional unpublished on-site monitoring systems. The varied terminology used to describe monitoring may have limited identification of some relevant articles.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1740774512467405">
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>This review demonstrated that on-site monitoring is utilised in trials worldwide but systems vary considerably with little evidence to support practice. These on-site monitoring practices need to be evaluated empirically, including costs, to provide robust evidence for the contribution of site visits to trial performance and quality.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) are the optimal research design for evaluating health-care interventions. International standards provide guidance for the conduct of trials, set by the International Conference of Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice (ICH GCP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1740774512467405">1</xref>]. The ICH GCP guidelines were developed to provide standards for clinical trials across the United States, the European Union, and Japan, and the recommendations have been adopted by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) since 1996 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1740774512467405">2</xref>]. In 2001, the European Clinical Trials Directive (2001/20/EC) (EUCTD) was enacted for trials of investigational medicinal products (IMPs), based on these guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1740774512467405">3</xref>].</p>
<p>Monitoring the conduct of a trial is one aspect of the ICH GCP guidelines. The purpose is to verify that reported trial data are accurate, complete, and can be accounted for by source documentation, and to ensure that the conduct of the trial complies with the protocol, GCP, and other necessary regulatory requirements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1740774512467405">1</xref>]. The guidelines state that ‘in general there is a need for on-site monitoring before, during and after the trial’, although sufficient assessment of GCP and data verification may be possible through central monitoring methods, investigator meetings, and controlled sampling in ‘exceptional circumstances’ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1740774512467405">1</xref>]. On-site monitoring – defined hereafter as visiting sites that recruit trial participants – has been conducted for many years prior to the implementation of ICH GCP guidelines. For example, on-site monitoring has been a requirement since 1982 for US National Cancer Institute (NCI)-sponsored trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1740774512467405">4</xref>], while frequent site visits have been the norm for pharmaceutical-sponsored studies for several decades [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1740774512467405">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1740774512467405">6</xref>].</p>
<p>General guidance is available on quality assurance for multi-centre trials, including suggestions on how to conduct site monitoring visits and recommendations on the procedures to perform [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1740774512467405">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1740774512467405">8</xref>]. Source data verification (SDV) and the opportunity to observe study procedures and data collection are some of the perceived benefits of site visits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1740774512467405">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1740774512467405">10</xref>]. However, on-site monitoring poses logistical and financial challenges [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1740774512467405">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1740774512467405">12</xref>], and the EUCTD monitoring requirements have contributed to the increased complexity of conducting trials in the United Kingdom, as shown by a study of the impact of the 2001 Directive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1740774512467405">13</xref>] and recognised by leading trialists working to produce sensible guidelines for the conduct of large RCTs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1740774512467405">14</xref>].</p>
<p>Despite the long-standing practice of on-site monitoring and its adoption worldwide, little is known about the methods that are utilised. This systematic literature review summarises the reported practices for on-site monitoring for randomised trials in health care and sought to identify the advantages and disadvantages of on-site visits as a component of site monitoring, focusing on any evidence of the benefits and costs to trials.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section9-1740774512467405">
<title>Information sources and search strategy</title>
<p>Searches for articles were conducted in November and December 2009 using four methods. First, an electronic search strategy was applied to MEDLINE and EMBASE databases provided <italic>via</italic> the OvidSP platform. Keywords to describe monitoring and related terms were used, and the search was filtered by combining ‘randomised controlled trials’ or ‘clinical trials’ as topic terms (see Appendix 1, supplementary material). No date or language restrictions were applied. Second, the content pages of electronically available issues of three key journals that publish methodological details of clinical trials were hand searched to identify articles where site monitoring practices were reported as part of the description of a trial and its conduct but were not the main focus of the article. Searched journals were <italic>Clinical Trials</italic> (from inception in January 2004 to December 2009), <italic>Controlled Clinical Trials</italic> (from the first online issues in February 1995 to December 2004, when the journal ceased), which became <italic>Contemporary Clinical Trials</italic> (from February 2005 to November 2009), and <italic>Trials</italic> (from the date of commencement in January 2006 to December 2009). The reference lists of retrieved full-text articles were also manually searched to identify additional studies, and finally, articles were sourced from the authors’ personal knowledge.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1740774512467405">
<title>Article selection – one reviewer (R.C.M.)</title>
<p>Duplicate records were excluded from the electronic search, and the titles and abstracts of the remaining citations were screened for eligibility by one reviewer (R.C.M.). Records that had the potential to include the reported practices of on-site monitoring for the conduct of health-related trials were retained. No limitations were made on the type of article, except for conference proceedings and abstracts which were prospectively excluded due to anticipated lack of sufficient detail. Full-text articles were obtained electronically, through interlibrary loans or directly from authors, and were assessed for details of on-site monitoring. Translations of 13 articles (6 in German, 4 in Japanese, and 3 in French) were made by members of staff at the authors’ research institution who were native speakers or fluent in the required languages. Further exclusions were made with reasons recorded, that is, articles solely reporting centralised monitoring, articles referring to monitoring of aspects unrelated to trial conduct (e.g., blood pressure monitoring), articles relating to statistical monitoring methods or monitoring data for safety purposes, and articles which mentioned on-site monitoring but with insufficient detail to assess the methods. General summaries or generic guidelines that were not reports of on-site monitoring practices for a particular trial group or an individual trial were excluded. Articles in which the authors explicitly used the term audit were included if the practices and objectives of the site visits were to assess trial conduct through an ongoing interactive process, rather than a retrospective check that did not affect trial practices or future performance. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1740774512467405">Figure 1</xref> summarises the article selection process. Any uncertainties on article inclusion were resolved by discussion with a second reviewer (A.L.). There was no screening of the articles found through non-electronic searches as they were assessed for eligibility during the process of sourcing.</p>

<title>Data collection process – three reviewers (R.C.M., A.L., and A.D.B.)</title>
<p>Data extraction forms were designed and piloted by three reviewers (R.C.M., A.L., and A.D.B.). The final data extraction was undertaken by one reviewer (R.C.M.), and a purposively sampled 21% (n = 12) of the articles were checked for accuracy and completeness by one of the two other reviewers (A.D.B. and A.L.). Included articles were categorised as either (1) on-site monitoring methods of research groups or organisations, (2) on-site monitoring methods relating to a specific individual RCT, (3) trials of on-site monitoring interventions, (4) simulations of costs of monitoring methods, or (5) surveys of staff involved in on-site monitoring practices. Where applicable, details of the trial being monitored were collected, such as disease area, type of trial intervention, sponsor, sample size, and trial duration. Available information about on-site monitoring processes was recorded, including location and number of sites, percentage visited, composition of the monitoring team, frequency and timing of visits in the course of the trial, the on-site monitoring activities and techniques, and visit reporting structures. From all articles, any information provided on the benefits or disadvantages of the monitoring visits was extracted (including financial and resources costs), and any formal evaluation of the monitoring process was examined.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1740774512467405">
<title>Analysis</title>
<p>Available information from each article was entered into a Microsoft Access database. The information extracted was primarily of a descriptive nature; therefore, a meta-analysis was not possible. To summarise information and permit comparisons across studies and research groups, activities were tabulated separately for trial organisations and individual RCTs. Where information was missing or unclear, this was recorded as unavailable or with the publication text in quotation marks.</p>

<title>Search results and article characteristics</title>
<p>The search results are shown in the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1740774512467405">15</xref>] flow diagram in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1740774512467405">Figure 1</xref>. The electronic search identified 678 unique records. Initial screening of titles and abstracts excluded 526 records that were unrelated to on-site monitoring practices for the conduct of health-related trials. A further 121 records were excluded after examination of the full-text articles, with reasons described (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1740774512467405">Figure 1</xref>).

<p>The characteristics of the 57 publications included in the review are summarised in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1740774512467405">Table 1</xref>. Most publications related to individual trials (n = 30; 53%) or from research groups and organisations (n = 21; 37%). In addition, there was one RCT of an on-site monitoring intervention, two cost simulations, and three surveys. The majority of the trials and research groups were based in the United States or Europe, and there was an overall increase in number of publications over time.</p>

<title>RCT of site monitoring (n = 1)</title>
<p>The randomised study of on-site monitoring was nested in a large breast cancer chemotherapy trial, sponsored by the European Association of Research in Oncology (AERO) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1740774512467405">31</xref>]. Sites (n = 135) were randomised to site monitoring visits (conducted at site initiation, ongoing visits, and at site closeout) or the control of no visits. At initiation visits, on-site monitoring activities included a review of the protocol, patient inclusion and exclusion criteria, randomisation procedures, case report form (CRF) completion, study planning, and drug management. Ongoing monitoring visits included a review of patient eligibility, protocol compliance, adverse event reporting, and SDV. The study aimed to assess the impact of initiation and ongoing visits on patient recruitment, attrition, and data quality and quantity. Site initiation visits had no effect on these outcomes, but the trial sponsors terminated the monitoring study prematurely after a decision to limit on-site monitoring to centres with identified problems. As a result, a full evaluation of the impact of repeated site visits could not be made.</p>

<title>Monitoring visit structure</title>
<p>Frequency of monitoring varied widely from visits at least once every 3 years (e.g., NCI groups) to every 6–8 weeks in trials sponsored by the pharmaceutical industry. The frequency of visits was modified by some groups according to the type of trial and intervention (e.g., Comprehensive International Programme of Research on AIDS (CIPRA) and National Institute of Drug Abuse Clinical Trials Network (NIDA CTN)), or if site performance from previous visits was unsatisfactory (e.g., NCI groups and EORTC). Most groups visited all sites and reviewed a proportion of patient records when monitoring. There were similarities in the composition of the monitoring team, which typically included trial staff or staff from the sponsoring organisation, although occasionally, external staff were also employed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1740774512467405">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1740774512467405">64</xref>]. The number of monitors per visit typically ranged from one to two, but was up to eight for visits to larger institutes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1740774512467405">43</xref>]. Monitoring was coordinated by a dedicated team from some groups, such as the VA Cooperative Studies Programme (CSP), Site Monitoring and Review Team (SMART) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1740774512467405">65</xref>], and the NCI Clinical Trials Monitoring Branch (CTMB) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1740774512467405">4</xref>].</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-1740774512467405">
<title>Monitoring visit activities and reports</title>
<p>The focus of most on-site monitoring for research groups was SDV and checks of study documents (mentioned in 19 (90%) of the articles), as well as other checks of protocol adherence such as eligibility and consent, and drug accountability. The Asthma Clinical Research Network (ACRN) also included a site tour. Some groups held an exit meeting with discussion of preliminary findings with the study staff at the end of the visit. The VA CSP utilised a structured checklist of GCP items at site visits, which was also adopted by the CIPRA, and formed the basis of the visit report. A written report was customary, although the content and the dissemination of findings varied. Some articles described the visit report to summarise deviations and to include recommendations for improvements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1740774512467405">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1740774512467405">71</xref>], while some NCI cooperative groups gave sites an overall rating.</p>

<title>Individual trials (n = 30 articles; describing 26 trials)</title>
<p>Information on the on-site monitoring practices for individual RCTs came from trial protocols, design and methodology articles, and trial results papers (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1740774512467405">Table 3</xref>). Nine trials related to cardiac research (35%) and five to cancer (19%), with the remaining trials relating to different diseases. Fourteen trials were sponsored by the US National Institutes of Health (NIH). Trial sample sizes varied from 140 to 148,000 and study durations from 1.5 years up to 22 years.</p>

<title>Monitoring visit structure</title>
<p>Repeated site monitoring visits were common for most trials, with visits stated as being at least annually for nine trials, whereas others were described as ‘regular’, ‘periodic’, or unspecified. Trials sponsored by the NCI followed their policy of a minimum visit of once every 3 years. The timing of the monitoring visits in the trial lifetime also varied between trials although, where reported, most visits were made throughout the duration of the trial rather than solely during recruitment. A high proportion (20 trials; 77%) reported or implied that all sites were visited, even for multinational trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1740774512467405">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1740774512467405">47</xref>]. However, one large trial selected sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1740774512467405">26</xref>]. Most monitors were staff from the trials, including research nurses or trial coordinators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1740774512467405">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1740774512467405">67</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1740774512467405">70</xref>], or a quality control committee or staff from the sponsor’s organisation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1740774512467405">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1740774512467405">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1740774512467405">61</xref>]. However, external monitors were more often used for trials sponsored by a pharmaceutical company or a university. Information of the number of monitors involved in the site visits was sparse, typically seeming to be between one and three, but some trials implied that the team could consist of at least five members [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1740774512467405">56</xref>].</p>

<sec id="section22-1740774512467405">
<title>Monitoring visit activities and reports</title>
<p>The most commonly reported on-site monitoring activity for individual trials involved SDV and document checking (reported in 13 (43%) articles) and checks of other GCP criteria – consistent with that described in the reports of the practices of research groups. However, there was a greater mention of observations of study procedures and staff, including staff training (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1740774512467405">Table 3</xref>). Details on the reporting structure were sparse or absent in many articles relating to the individual trials, but discussions with staff (exit interview) and a report were typical, with suggested site improvements. Three trials described the use of a checklist or form [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1740774512467405">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1740774512467405">61</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1740774512467405">67</xref>], and two trials made reference to the generation of a performance score [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1740774512467405">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1740774512467405">50</xref>].</p>
<p>Six trials were associated with research groups who had published their systems for on-site monitoring, which were included in the current review (NCI cooperative groups, NIDA, MRC, VA CSP, and Bayer), and the on-site monitoring practices for these individual trials seemed to concur with the systems reported by the groups.</p>

<p>One survey provided descriptive statistics of on-site monitoring for 114 NIH Phase III clinical trials surveyed in 1994 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1740774512467405">60</xref>], 97 (85%) of which had on-site monitoring procedures, mostly funded by individual grants or cooperative agreements. On-site monitoring was typically conducted at least annually by the trial coordinating centre. Another survey assessed the views of National Cancer Institute of Canada (NCIC) research nurses and data managers on the impact of pharmaceutical company involvement in trials, and the perceived benefits and burdens of site visits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1740774512467405">36</xref>]. The third survey assessed the role of clinical research associates (CRAs) in Spain, with the average CRA having responsibility for 11–20 sites per year, which were frequently visited once per month [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1740774512467405">19</xref>]. Cost estimations for clinical trial scenarios under different monitoring strategies were published in two articles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1740774512467405">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1740774512467405">54</xref>], which demonstrated savings of more than 40% if the frequency of site visits could be reduced alongside shorter CRFs and a decrease in site payments.</p>

<title>Benefits and costs of on-site monitoring (all publications)</title>
<p>Twenty-three publications (40%) described some perceived benefits or disadvantages of on-site monitoring for clinical trials. These benefits included identification of problems at sites, errors or confusion about the protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1740774512467405">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1740774512467405">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1740774512467405">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1740774512467405">42</xref>], improved adherence to the protocol and GCP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1740774512467405">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1740774512467405">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1740774512467405">65</xref>], opportunities to share best practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1740774512467405">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1740774512467405">70</xref>], identifying staff educational needs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1740774512467405">22</xref>], and improved communication between study staff [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1740774512467405">55</xref>]. Reported disadvantages generally related to the financial costs and staff time spent on site visits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1740774512467405">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1740774512467405">64</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1740774512467405">67</xref>]. The NCIC survey of data managers and study nurses showed that over half of the respondents found site visits from industry monitors annoying [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1740774512467405">36</xref>]. Fourteen publications provided some assessment of the financial costs or resources attributable to site visits. Typically, each site visit involved a day at each site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1740774512467405">70</xref>], although one publication reported each visit totalled 4 days of time when including preparation, travel, and report writing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1740774512467405">29</xref>]. Financial estimates of a single site visit were approximately US$800 for EORTC visits in 1991 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1740774512467405">42</xref>] and US$1500 for NIDA visits in 2009, excluding staff time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1740774512467405">64</xref>].</p>
<p>Overall, there was very little objective empirical evidence of the clinical or cost-effectiveness of on-site monitoring to trials. Only six articles (11%) summarised results in terms of trial performance. The RCT of on-site monitoring terminated prematurely, but showed no impact of an initiation site visit on patient recruitment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1740774512467405">31</xref>]. The Digitalis Investigation Group (DIG) trial compared recruitment and retention rates in Canadian and US sites. A regional nurse made site visits from the start of the trial in Canada, whereas US sites were not visited until the trial was well underway, which the authors suggested contributed to the stronger trial performance by the Canadian sites. Four articles assessed trial performance over consecutive years. The VA SMART process improved adherence to GCP over a 3-year period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1740774512467405">65</xref>]. Likewise, an analysis of the first 3 years of the NCI’s site monitoring programme for clinical cooperative groups reported a significant decline in ineligible participants, treatment deficiencies, and departures from informed consent, as well as a reduction in the number of institutions with problems with institutional review board (IRB) approval requirements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1740774512467405">58</xref>]. The NCI Cancer and Leukaemia Group B (CALGB) observed notable improvements in administrative and regulatory requirements and eligibility from 1982 to 1992 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1740774512467405">43</xref>], and the NCI Paediatric Oncology Group (POG) reported an improvement in the number of patients registered for trials over the period from 1981 to 1991 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1740774512467405">38</xref>].</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This systematic literature review provides evidence of the on-site monitoring practices used in clinical health-care trials, but also highlights substantial variation in systems between host organisations, sponsors, and trial designs. Diversity occurred in the frequency of site visits, monitoring personnel, trial factors being monitored at sites, assessment methods, and reporting structures, although limited detail was available to identify factors that may influence such variation in practice. Many authors commented on the perceived advantages and disadvantages of site visits, including the effects on trial performance and ways for potentially reducing monitoring costs, yet there are very little evaluation data available to support these subjective views. Most articles were of a descriptive nature, with the one randomised trial of the effectiveness of on-site monitoring terminated early [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1740774512467405">31</xref>].</p>
<p>This is the first systematic review focusing on the published literature of on-site monitoring to our knowledge. A more general systematic review of trial conduct published in 1999 only included a brief section on the problems of on-site monitoring [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1740774512467405">72</xref>]. The main sources for information comprised two electronic databases and four key trials journals, with electronic searches unlimited by date, language, or article type. Supplementary methods identified over half of the additional publications, including hand searching relevant journals, although hand searching was not performed for publications predating 1995. The PRISMA statement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1740774512467405">15</xref>] was utilised, where applicable, to conduct and report this review.</p>
<p>The current investigation focused on published information, whereas trialists and organisations may utilise other monitoring systems that have not been published, such as standard operating procedures. Noticeably, most groups and organisations were non-commercial yet pharmaceutical companies are known to use on-site monitoring regularly, so it is possible that the monitoring systems for these organisations are under-represented in this review. Care should also be taken when considering the representativeness of the articles for monitoring practices on a trial level: the articles from research groups and organisations summarise the practices of many trials, whereas other articles refer only to individual trials. The details of on-site monitoring were often minimally or poorly described by authors, and 60 publications were not included as they only contained a few words on the topic. There was also inconsistency in the reporting and sparseness of some information in the included publications, so preventing any meta-analysis of data and hindering comparisons across studies and articles. The terminology used to describe on-site monitoring was also challenging for identifying relevant publications as ‘monitoring’ and ‘auditing’ are often used interchangeably [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1740774512467405">5</xref>], and may have resulted in some publications being omitted. Monitoring involves prospective oversight of an ongoing trial, compared to auditing which involves a retrospective check of trial data to ensure correspondence with actual events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1740774512467405">11</xref>]. Based on this definition, search terms for ‘audit’ were not used in the electronic search. However, publications using the term ‘audit’ that were still identified from the search, but defined the audit with an aim to identify needs and improve practice during the trial lifetime, were included, due to the comparability with monitoring objectives. Likewise, site visit activities in trial process evaluations were also included if they had similar objectives to monitoring. The evaluation of the effects of on-site monitoring was based on observational data, so could not be attributed solely to site visits, as other factors may have enhanced study performance. For example, the VA publication noted that increased education and experience of GCP are also likely to have played a role in improvements, in addition to the site reviews [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1740774512467405">65</xref>]. The majority of the publications identified in the review follow the introduction of the ICH GCP guidelines in 1996. However, it is impossible to say whether this observation is due to a change in expectations and practice, or because of a change in reporting and publication tendencies. In part, the hand searching of key journals (which identified 17 articles) may bias these findings, as electronically available editions did not pre-date these years.</p>
<p>Over 10 years ago, a systematic review of factors that influence the quality, number, and progress of RCTs led to recommendations that there should be explicit mechanisms in place to monitor trial conduct, and suggested different intensities of quality control should be evaluated for their effect on trial performance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1740774512467405">72</xref>]. Several generic guidelines and position papers provide recommendations for on-site monitoring for multi-centre trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1740774512467405">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1740774512467405">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1740774512467405">73</xref>]. Despite this, the current review demonstrates that there is a general acceptance of on-site monitoring systems and methods without any formal evaluation. Some aspects of trial conduct can only be verified by site visits, such as SDV and observation of trial procedures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1740774512467405">74</xref>]. However, on-site monitoring is resource intensive and can be inefficient for identifying errors that could compromise patient safety or bias study results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1740774512467405">75</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1740774512467405">76</xref>]. A comprehensive chart review – in which all the patient records were subsequently evaluated by the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP) for four phase III studies – did not add significantly to the integrity of the trial database, implying that the existing monitoring procedures had been sufficient and such a detailed, expensive analysis was not justified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1740774512467405">66</xref>]. As noted in the experiences of the NIDA CTN, many processes carried out at sites may have been more efficiently managed by central processes such as validation checks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1740774512467405">64</xref>]. The need to visit every site participating in the trial has also been challenged by trial specialists, suggesting that rigorous central monitoring and selective site visits may provide similar quality assurances [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1740774512467405">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1740774512467405">76</xref>]. While it is recognised that quality assurance procedures need to be tailored to different types of trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1740774512467405">7</xref>], the information to determine an adequate and appropriate on-site monitoring strategy is limited by the small evidence base [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1740774512467405">72</xref>]. The consensus among leading trialists working to establish sensible guidelines for conducting RCTs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1740774512467405">14</xref>] is that there is generally a requirement for on-site monitoring, with the proposal that the monitoring strategy is determined on a risk-adapted basis for the trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1740774512467405">75</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1740774512467405">77</xref>]. Risk-adapted monitoring is also recommended by the Clinical Trials Transformation Initiative (CTTI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1740774512467405">78</xref>], a partnership between public and private organisations to identify practices to increase the quality and efficiency of clinical trials, and FDA draft guidance on risk-adapted monitoring has recently been made available [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1740774512467405">79</xref>]. However, the effectiveness of such a strategy is yet unknown, and both the Adapted Monitoring study (ADAMON) and Optimal Monitoring study (OPTIMON) trials (randomised studies designed to compare a risk-adapted on-site monitoring programme with current intensive monitoring strategies) are ongoing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1740774512467405">77</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1740774512467405">80</xref>].</p>
<p>To incorporate new research that has been conducted in this area, the electronic literature search was rerun in September 2012. A further six relevant studies were identified. First, a CTTI survey of 65 international academic, industry, and government organisations confirmed this review finding that on-site monitoring is common in trials, but with variation in the activities and differences between organisations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1740774512467405">81</xref>]. The results of four new research studies that evaluated site monitoring visit findings support a proportionate approach to monitoring, tailored to the risks of the trial. Analysis of reports from a selection of site visits in the international Microbicides Development Programme trial (MDP301) classified only two findings as critical/major (0.7%), and these were considered unlikely to have had a direct impact on the trial results if they had gone undetected. In addition, the vast majority of reported findings (255/268, 95%) were, or potentially could have been, identified using central monitoring techniques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1740774512467405">76</xref>]. On-site monitoring and SDV in a multinational urinary tract symptoms treatment trial found that errors in electronic CRFs were mostly transcription errors with minimal impact on outcome measures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-1740774512467405">82</xref>]. These authors recommended a risk-based approach to trial monitoring when using electronic data capture to prevent inefficient SDV procedures. A peer review intervention for monitoring and evaluating sites in a UK multi-centre prostate cancer treatment trial enhanced trial performance through annual site visits and observation of procedures rather than focusing on resource-intensive activities such as SDV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-1740774512467405">83</xref>]. Frequent data errors and protocol variations identified from monitoring reports from 57 US NCI Gynecologic Oncology Group institutions triggered educational initiatives to improve staff training and prevent future deviations, as well as implementing methods to assist staff such as web-based dose calculation tools [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-1740774512467405">84</xref>]. Finally, the risk-adapted monitoring plan developed and validated for use in the OPTIMON study is also now available [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1740774512467405">80</xref>]. The diversity of recent on-site monitoring research highlights that this remains a central area of trial conduct research, with ongoing efforts to tailor monitoring to an appropriate level for individual trials.</p>
<p>In conclusion, this review demonstrated variability in systems for on-site monitoring of trial conduct, with a paucity of evidence to support practice. Trials should be conducted at a reasonable cost without compromising patient safety or data quality, and systems for planning on-site monitoring are needed to maximise resources, especially for trials without IMPs. On-site monitoring procedures, such as the frequency of site visits and intensity of activity (e.g., SDV), need to be evaluated empirically to provide direct evidence for the benefits and disadvantages for trials, for example, in randomised studies nested in existing trials. The findings from studies evaluating risk-adapted approaches to trial monitoring will contribute significantly to the evidence base.</p>
