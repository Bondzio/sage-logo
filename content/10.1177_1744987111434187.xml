<p>This theoretically focused and discursive paper explores the role that participatory media can play in the field of nursing research and subsequent knowledge dissemination. There is an increasing drive for researchers to form collaborative initiatives in order to drive their research activity. As long ago as 1975, Mulkay et al. were highlighting that the second phase of any research network development was marked by increasing social and intellectual integration. We hypothesise that this intellectual collaboration has been fundamental to all investigative activity throughout history. This would mean that the accelerated growth in communication media that began with the proposal for the World Wide Web in 1989 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1744987111434187">Berners Lee, 1999</xref>) is a further evolution in the role that participatory media plays in the role of research rather than a complete new issue.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1744987111434187">Haigh (2010)</xref> has noted that the information gathering and sharing opportunities, referred to as participatory media, offered by the second generation of web design that allow for information sharing – known as web 2.0 – have expanded our horizons beyond academia to the whole of the global research and education community. Participatory media include (but are not limited to):

<p>Nursing research has been accused of both elitism and insularity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1744987111434187">Murray, 2007</xref>) and the concern is that these traits will mean that the advantages of participatory media collaboration will be slow to be recognised, let alone to be implemented in nursing research practice as a means of convening and disseminating research within and beyond their research community.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-1744987111434187"><title>Information ages: From analogue to digital</title>
<p>Being able to gather information, sieve through it, access the latest developments in the field and produce new information is a core part of the academic researcher’s role. Moreover, it could even be argued that for centuries it has been knowledge workers’ main tangible work currency. Indeed, the information age is not exclusive of the networked society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1744987111434187">Castells, 2000</xref>). The need to create, record and provide information has permeated different moments of history, almost as a continuum, even though it was made through different techniques and means, that is, through the technologies of the time. Throughout history, people have used and appropriated the technologies emblematic of their era to create affordances where information is concerned. Thus, the industrial revolution may have been one of the most prominent periods of history when it comes to producing new channels of information. However, this was not the only time humankind has shown the need to improve their information means and tried to advance in that area. The oldest example of writing comes from Mesopotamia around 3300 BCE and was further developed by the Ancient Egyptians, who were inveterate record keepers and letter writers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1744987111434187">David, 2003</xref>). The 15th century saw another important tipping point with the development of printed dissemination. Through the hands of Gutenberg the spread of information acquired a new dimension with the printing press and the possibility of mechanical reproduction of written information. The development of the telegraph, in the 18th century, was a response to the demands of an expanding society, which was increasingly accelerating its pace and demanding more and faster access to information. The invention of the transistor, a semiconductor device used to amplify and switch electronic signals, has also been considered to be a key player of the evolution of the information age. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1744987111434187">Riordan and Hoddeson (1997)</xref> have even suggested that it is the genesis of the information age. The computer, the internet and the web as we know it today have also shown similar impact. They have affected society in general and brought about cultural and economic transformations that have been quickly and seamlessly assimilated into everyday life. Each iteration of information technology, either as theory or hardware, has had an impact in its time and served society with the affordances it provided. Hence, we would argue that the so-called ‘information age’ has been around for as long as humankind (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1744987111434187">Headrick, 2000</xref>) has shown a need to express themselves. Producing information is a way of recording knowledge and experience with the purpose of passing it on for the benefit of others, as well as for the advancement of what is documented. In the current times the debate of the information revolution has also acquired new dimensions. Notably, the latest of technological advancements, the participatory web, is a place for congregation of social capital in distributed environments. We would even argue that this new era has moved the main topic of debate from ‘information provision’ into the one of ‘communication sharing’. Interactive, real-time, as well as diffused peer communication and collaboration is now possible in ways we could only have dreamt of before the advent of the internet. The participatory web, and the potential it presents to knowledge workers and society in general when it comes to creating new forms of communication and engagement, has definitely been setting the tone in that direction. The multi-channelled, multi-actor, individual-centred web provides new possibilities for academic practice. With the web, technology stops being a conduit for the mere transmission of information to become an environment for the congregation of people interested in debating the information produced further and thus creates new content. An example of this is Twitter – a social network/micro-blogging site in which status updates of up to 140 characters can be shared with followers. In the five years in which twitter has been live, it has evolved from simply a platform with which to share one’s thoughts with the wider community to the creation of web chats, scheduled, topic-focused events that are attended by Twitter users around the world. Moreover, activity such as this can potentially become an extension of the current work environment, in which the individual is able to establish new collaborative links and capitalise on old ones, foster new debates of ideas concerning their topics of interest, promote their practices, share the latest advancements as they happen, and cultivate their socio-professional network in an interactive, continuous way.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-1744987111434187"><title>Networking in the current changing environment</title>
<p>It is widely acknowledged that the ability to network and cultivate spheres of influence play a fundamental role in any individual’s social and professional life. One of the key skills of our times is the ability to readily communicate with our target audiences, our peers and also the wider community. This is equally true for academic researchers. Communication and dissemination of research and practice is at the heart of academic enterprise. Although networking amongst academics is far from being a new topic, the participatory web has shed a new light upon it. In particular, in the last two decades, the progressive advancements of the web as a social space have permitted the distributed congregation of individuals in collaborative environments. Groups of interest, communities of practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1744987111434187">Wenger, 1999</xref>) and learning networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1744987111434187">Siemens, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1744987111434187">Bell, 2010</xref>) have started to flourish in cyberspace. In this sense, individuals become connected entities with a historical digital footprint that will contribute to their social digital identity.</p>
<p>In an age dominated by digital technologies, discussion about networking is almost always associated with participation in SNSs. In reality, although networking is not an activity only concentrated in cyberspace, online environments are becoming a predominant part of one’s networking activity. We cannot forget that our society has become more mobile than ever, and collaboration across institutions, across professional disciplines and across countries is almost a mandatory activity in many sectors. Furthermore, SNSs have increasingly become a trend regarding the way we socialise and connect to other people and that has clearly had an impact on our professional lives too. Still, research in this field points out that the take up of SNSs as part of one’s social networking activity is far from being mainstream, especially amongst academics and knowledge workers. Hence, it presents an exciting opportunity for research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1744987111434187">Boyd and Ellison, 2007</xref>). The next section will give a brief account of networking in an academic environment, and the value participatory media brings to it.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1744987111434187"><title>Academic networking</title>
<p>The need to share and communicate research activity with people in the field has a long tradition. Networks have always been an important element of anyone’s practice and learning, even before digital technologies were in place. For example, notable academic social networkers include the following.
<list id="list2-1744987111434187" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Erasmus (1466–1536) was one of the first scholars known for having established his personal network of scholars via correspondence (Berkvens-Stevelinck et al., 2005).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Newton (1643–1727) developed his theory of the 1680 great comet’s trajectory via a full correspondence with Flamsteed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1744987111434187">Hartley, 1960</xref>).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Voltaire (1694–1778) is another example of a networked researcher with more than 1000 European correspondents (Pehn, 1999).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Darwin (1809–1892) moved to London to take advantage of the intellectual network lead by Charles Lyell, which helped him to formulate and refine his own theories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1744987111434187">Darwin Correspondence Project, 2011</xref>).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Florence Nightingale (1820–1910) promoted both her own achievements and her theories of nursing care via judicious use of the media and countless philanthropical societies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1744987111434187">Williams, 2008</xref>).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The Fifth Solvay Conference (1925) was a real world social network of notable scientists working in the then developing field of theoretical physics. So successful was this conference as an incubator of ideas that 17 of the 25 delegates become Nobel Prize laureates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1744987111434187">Bacciagaluppi and Valentini, 2009</xref>).</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>Thus it can be seen that networks for correspondence and debate were of critical importance to the intellectual achievement of previous centuries. Letters were a powerful form of communicating with the wider world. They also represented an effective way of keeping in touch with an individual’s distributed community and cultivating links with the outside world in a personal way. This form of communication, although rather informal, slow for our time, and mainly peer-to-peer, became a meaningful way of sharing ideas, constructing knowledge and connecting (to) like-minded people in different geographical locations. The most typical and prominent example of the benefits of having a personal network to cultivate a scholarly community is without doubt Charles Darwin, who used the epistolary genre to effectively share his findings and firm his theories amongst his scientific community, while away researching on the other side of the globe.</p>
<p>Today, with the advent of the participatory web, peer communication and networking have taken on a new dimension. Although it could be argued that the fundamental principle remains the same, that of sharing and developing ideas with peers, if nothing else, participatory media amplifies the voice of the individual. This is crucial, as evidence from research funding bodies would suggest that the day of the lone researcher is over, whilst the importance of a coherent voice from focused clusters of investigators is ever more important. Research is moving on from the old scenario of isolated individuals undertaking similar studies simultaneously to organised groups investigating modern issues intelligently and efficiently. Research reach is a hundred times wider and faster than during the times of the examples highlighted above. Moreover, it allows for interactivity with multiple agents. Networked technologies have highlighted the importance of the single person’s network and both their informal and formal activity as part of their lifelong learning and professional practice. Furthermore, participatory media takes human agency to a new level, as it empowers individuals to become more autonomous within collective spaces, in which a culture of sharing and collaborative practices are encouraged and modelled. Consequently, one’s online activity influences individuals’ professional profiles as they promote and advance their practice in environments that extend their research reaches beyond the walls of academe. Nevertheless, the participatory web has still not permeated academia to its full potential. Many and different practices co-exist in an environment that is modelled by different approaches, disciplines, attitudes to technology and traditions.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that networked technologies have been claimed to be of great benefit for knowledge workers and scholarship endeavour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1744987111434187">Pearce et al., 2011</xref>), previous research points out that the use of these new tools to start and sustain new learning environments has not been rolled out across the entire education spectrum, with the rates of adoption in academia being fairly low in comparison to expert predictions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1744987111434187">Squires et al., 2000</xref>). In addition, with international and national ICT (Information and Communication Technologies) policies focusing mainly on the teaching and learning agenda, little attention was initially given to research as an area that can also benefit from the advancements of the web. Moreover, most of the studies linking the web to research practice focus on the use of the internet as a platform to make finished research publications available. Such is the case of studies on institutional repositories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1744987111434187">Johnson, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1744987111434187">Foster and Gibbons, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1744987111434187">Swan, 2010</xref>) or online research journals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1744987111434187">Swan, 2005</xref>). However, very little is known about more interactive forms of communication (Palmer, 2005) and the way academic researchers are deploying participatory media as part of their research capacity in an environment increasingly dependent on new technologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1744987111434187">Kemp and Jones, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>The participatory web is indeed an effective channel for communication of scholarly knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1744987111434187">Pearce et al., 2011</xref>). Higher education institutions are slowly starting to pay attention to the role of networked technologies in assisting research collaborations and dissemination. Particularly in the last two years, a new emphasis has been put on digital scholarship and the use of participatory media to produce new forms of research impact. Funding bodies, such as the JISC (Joint Information System Committee) and the European Commission, and research support organisations such as Vitae, have been pushing forward the idea of virtual research environments (VREs), digital laboratories and scholarly driven networks and communities as a form of supporting and promoting academic practice and research. In addition, community engagement has become a critical item in the agendas of higher education institutions. New forms of maximising research input and creating impact are being developed. The create SSBR project, VREs such as myexperiment (sic) and the Open Access Movement, just to name a few current projects, are examples of this. Networked technologies offer an additional channel for sharing and engagement with academic knowledge and researchers.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1744987111434187"><title>Participatory networks</title>
<p>This all sounds extremely positive; universities are becoming more aware of the benefits that participative technologies can offer and students are becoming exposed to such technologies whilst still in compulsory education. It could be argued that we are in the midst of a paradigm shift, as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1744987111434187">Kuhn (1970)</xref>. Writing from a hard science perspective (he was a physicist), Kuhn argued that an epistemological paradigm shift, such as we are experiencing, as methods of collaboration and communication change leads the way for ‘Scientific Revolution’ as the features of the knowledge landscape that individuals recognise change around them. When sufficient changes have accrued, Kuhn suggests that this leads to a crisis in which old ideas are discarded and the new paradigms are adopted. Importantly, Kuhn insists that the new paradigm is ALWAYS superior to the one it has replaced.</p>
<p>However, the greatest challenge to the current paradigm shift is the reluctance of some areas of academia to embrace the virtual world as a legitimate environment for research communication. We have made the point that the major scientific discoveries of the 18th and 19th centuries were developed and communicated by using the social networking of the day, which served to promote an intellectual environment of discourse and debate. The suspicion with which a number of disciplines view virtual networking mean that they are effectively excluding themselves from the scientific revolution that is in progress; if they come from a discipline that does not have a tradition of vigorous debate, such as nursing, then there is a danger that they may de-evolve to a simpler and more primitive version of themselves that cannot compete in the new intellectual world. This will lead to them being over taken and subsumed into other, more proactive professions.</p>
<p>There was a brief period, a golden age, when the potential of networking via technology was considered as a useful tool for nursing; there was an excitement about using online learning platforms but this quickly peaked and faded away. Now it is not uncommon to hear lecturers and research dismiss SNSs such as Facebook as irrelevant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1744987111434187">Folorunso et.al, 2010</xref>) and it is almost seen as a badge of honour to be ignorant of their working. At the same time the research community is becoming increasingly frustrated with thinking of ways to enhance both collaboration and public engagement with the research process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1744987111434187">Ackland, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>This last point may the one that convinces nursing academia to re-engage with social networking from a more positive mind set. Firstly, the use of platforms such as YouTube allows for the presentation of information for the benefit of potential research participants. This has the advantage that some seldom accessed groups, such as people with learning disabilities or younger children, can be provided with the information they require to make an informed decision about participating in research projects without being faced by reams of closely printed information, with the advantage afforded by smart phones of being able to review such information wherever and whenever they please. Researchers in the UK are already finding it difficult to recruit research participants from certain clinical and ethnic groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1744987111434187">Howard et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1744987111434187">Godden et al., 2010</xref>) and the use of social media tools has been indicated as effective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1744987111434187">Hammond and Cooper, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>It is further acknowledged that one of the biggest challenges facing researchers is the dissemination of their research and subsequent new knowledge to the widest audience possible. This challenge is further complicated by the increasing difficulty that clinicians and academics have in accessing opportunities to dialogue face to face in meetings or conferences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1744987111434187">Haigh et al., 2010</xref>). However, this is a larger issue than just intra-researcher communication, since the demand for public and patient involvement at all points of the reproach process, with dissemination of new knowledge, is seen as critical. The role of social networks and participatory media can present research knowledge in a format that is accessible and relevant to today’s digital society.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-1744987111434187" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title>
<p>If we accept the premise that the use of social networks in the development of ideas is one that has a long and distinguished pedigree, then it can be seen that the role of participatory media is the latest iteration in its evolution. What makes this development such a challenge for nursing research in particular is that whilst nursing academia generally remains suspicious of the advantages offered by technology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1744987111434187">Damsgaard and Scheepers, 2000</xref>), little attention has been paid to the consequences of not being more open to sharing research online and interacting with the wider community.</p>
<p>For the majority of people in the developed world, the internet is the first place they look for information. In healthcare, there are a plethora of websites, YouTube channels and Wikipedia entries on every health-related topic under the sun. In the United Kingdom Research Excellence Framework, the impact of research is one of the variables assessed, but researchers often chose obscure, discipline-specific, paper-cased journals in which to publish their findings, effectively rendering such findings invisible to service users, students and the majority of clinicians.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we would argue that the next 10–15 years will see an increase in the chasm between the existing research community and the next generation of researchers. This has been attributed to the difference between the two groups in their approach and attitude to technology. The digital residents, arguably anybody born after about 1980 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1744987111434187">Bennett et al., 2008</xref>), who have grown up accustomed to sharing their music, their photographs and their thoughts with the wider community, and who have been used to accessing free resources in cyber space, are a very different tribe from the digital tourists who make up the current research establishment and who need urgently to update their approach to social networking and participatory media. However, we would argue that this metaphor is becoming increasingly redundant and that White’s hypothesis that digital identity depends upon individual tendencies, personality, epistemologies of practice and one’s personal and professional goals is more applicable to current practice. Rather than digital residence/tourism being age or gender dependent, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1744987111434187">White (2011)</xref> hypothesises that other issues impact upon whether one is a visitor (one who logs on to the virtual environment, performs a specific task or acquires specific information, and then logs off) or a resident (one who has an ongoing, developing presence online). The time is right for nurse researcher to exploit the opportunities afforded to them by participative media and social networking if they are to meet the expectations of the current consumers of research and wider society.</p>
