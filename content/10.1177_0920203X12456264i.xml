<p>The unique political and social reality in China renders freedom of information an intriguing and complex issue. Ever since China introduced legislation on freedom of information in January 2007, social scientists and China watchers have viewed the issue from different perspectives. Why did China adopt such legislation? To debunk the received wisdom that accords primacy to the roles of economic growth and anti-corruption efforts, Weibing Xiao’s <italic>Freedom of Information Reform in China</italic> takes an alternative route. In Xiao’s view, social, technological, political and legal factors carry more weight in explaining the phenomenon. At the centre of Xiao’s project is the method known as ‘information flow analysis’, an innovative analytical framework used to locate the driving forces behind China’s freedom of information reform.</p>
<p>In order to move beyond descriptive case studies, Xiao employs information flow analysis. It is an effective tool to focus on information flow between government and citizens according to social, political, legal and economic factors. In Chapter 2, he spells out the background and utility of this analytical device. Following this idea, the ensuing three chapters detail three separate contributing factors that pave the way for freedom of information reform in China. Chapter 3 focuses on how the advancement of communication technologies contributes to the formation of multiple paths for information flow between government and citizens. Chapter 4 then focuses on the role of the long-term, albeit gradual and limited, democratization process in facilitating reform. Xiao argues that while keeping freedom of the media at bay, the government initiated experiments such as openness in village affairs (村务公开) and openness in government affairs (政务公开) that helped lay the groundwork for freedom of information reform. Chapter 5 argues that administrative law reform in China presented an opportunity to increase the flow of information. Given his argument in the foregoing three chapters, Xiao relegates the two dominant explanatory factors – economic growth and anti-corruption – to a secondary role in Chapter 6. The book then goes on to describe the gradual legislative process with respect to freedom of information in Chapters 7 and 8. In Chapters 9 and 10, the author moves from the ‘structural’ side to the ‘agency’ side, documenting how individual actors such as rights activists and legal professionals push for freedom of information reform and how the government controls the flow of information by imposing various hurdles in the access to information.</p>
<p><italic>Freedom of Information Reform in China</italic> makes a distinct contribution to both China studies and research on freedom of information. The book shines in a number of aspects. First and foremost, as I alluded to earlier, the author adopts an analytical device that underlines the dynamics of information relationships. The method is capable of capturing the trajectory of government receptivity to freedom of information and offering a cross-national comparative base. As a result, the information-flow-centred framework brings in a variety of explanatory variables at the macro-social level, namely, technological (Chapter 3), political (Chapter 4) and legal (Chapter 5), giving the project an interdisciplinary nature and connecting the dots that have been ignored by previous scholarship. Furthermore, by attending to multiple macro-societal level antecedents, the author ventures beyond the received wisdom and develops a more nuanced and sophisticated understanding of the phenomenon of freedom of information in China. However, despite an innovative framework, the project stops short at the point where more emphasis is required. The type of information flow analysis conducted by Xiao seems to lack concrete operationalizations. The study focuses more on identifying social and political antecedents that facilitate or defer information flow than on tracking the information flow between government and citizens. The project would have been more convincing if objective measurements had been set up and if data regarding citizens’ use of governmental information had been presented. Data as such might be difficult to obtain, but surveys could be one method of supplementing the evidence presented in the book.</p>
<p>Xiao’s book is a very accessible, scholarly text geared to readers in a wide range of disciplines. Public administration and legal scholars will find new and eloquent arguments explaining the emergence of legislation on freedom of information in China; for political science scholars, the book’s in-depth portrait and analysis of the ensuing legislative process offer another case illuminating the complexity and intricacies of China’s reform; and for media and communication scholars focusing on freedom of the media, the book introduces a closely related but less studied subject: freedom of information.</p>
