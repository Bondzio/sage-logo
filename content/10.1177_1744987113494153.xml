<p>The starting point of palliative care knowledge is an appreciation of the experience of confronting a life-limiting or life-threatening illness. To fulfil this responsibility, we need to have some understanding of the perspectives and expectations of those who find themselves in this position. This is the issue taken up by Munikumar R. Venkatasalu et al. in their paper on the perspectives of older South Asians living in London. Their powerful message is that the experience of death and dying is culturally mediated. This means that our assumption that a good death is one that has been openly discussed and prepared for may need to be radically revised to meet the needs of people who find such candidness distressing.</p>
<p>An important component of appreciating the experience of illness is an understanding of the factors that help or hinder people’s ability to cope with the circumstances they are faced with. Using participants recruited from two New York hospitals, Adelaida Zabalegui et al. examine the relationship between the perceived social support enjoyed by people with advanced cancer and their ability to cope with the challenges that living with such an illness raises. The positive relationship that they identify provides further evidence to support our intuitive understanding of the importance of social environment to well-being. One of the reassuring findings of the study was the authors’ observation that the perception of social support was higher than they expected, given evidence from the literature that long periods of treatment tends to undermine support.</p>
<p>Measuring how people cope with the challenge of chronic illness is no easy matter. Yet if palliative clinicians are to adequately care for those with life-threatening illnesses, they need to have a good understanding of the complexities of coping strategies that their patients use, and an appreciation of what they can do to support them. Lene Bastrup Jørgensen et al.’s methodological paper on the use of a multi-modal grounded theory approach that combined physiological, cognitive, affective, and psychosocial parameters to examine how people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease dealt with the problems of breathlessness in their daily lives provides a novel and fruitful methodology that has the potential to be adapted to the examination of coping with other life-limiting diseases.</p>
<p>Palliative care is not only challenging for its recipients, it can also put a considerable burden on those who provide it. Sue J. Neilson et al.’s UK focussed paper addresses the experience of providing such care in a community setting. It highlights the pressures that can be put on nurses if the way in which their work is organised does not enable them to provide the level of care they feel they should be providing. When sub-optimal inter-professional working relations are added to this mix, matters are all the more challenging. Neilson et al.’s work makes clear the importance of formal standards of care and working practices to the provision of optimal and sustainable palliative care.</p>
<p>The crucially important issue of adopting appropriate palliative care policies is also addressed by Victoria J. Kain and Dominic J. Wilkinson in relation to neonatal palliative care. Examining the Australian context, they argue that it is high time that policy frameworks are put in place to ensure access to specialist perinatal and neonatal palliative care. They note that health professionals have an important role to play in ensuring that concerns for this population move from rhetoric to reality.</p>
<p>In our final themed paper, we move beyond what many palliative care practitioners would deem the boundary of their caring activities into the area of assisted dying. As the United Kingdom’s Royal College of Nursing puts it, ‘there is a clear distinction between the therapeutic end of life decisions taken as part of palliative care, and actively taking actions to end life which is a feature of assisted suicide or euthanasia’ (2011: 5). Yet, we have to recognise that there are patients who actively consider this option and many of them will look to the World Wide Web for guidance. Carol Haigh and Cristina Costa examine the nature and quality of the information that those looking to the web for information about assisted dying would find. Their findings that the quality of the content and rigour of information were generally poor are dispiriting. Because of the very variable quality of information, Haigh and Costa suggest that ‘it may be incumbent upon healthcare professionals to take the trouble to identify a variety of sites that they are confident will supply or supplement key information in a way that is accessible to service users’. However, anyone taking this approach should do so with considerable care. While international legislation differs on this issue, we return again to the advice of the Royal College of Nursing: ‘It is inappropriate and potentially illegal to provide … website addresses for organisations that promote or provide support for people wishing to commit suicide’ (2011: 17).</p>
<p>It is gratifying to note that the papers in this issue highlight the breadth of concerns associated with palliative care. In terms of disease trajectory, they range from addressing end-of-life care to the care of those with life-limiting chronic illnesses such as COPD. They also emphasise the importance of taking account of both the micro-level of individual experience and the macro-level of policy formation for the development of optimal palliative care.</p>
