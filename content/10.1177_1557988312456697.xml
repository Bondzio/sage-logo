<abstract>
<p>The human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine was recently approved for use in males. Certain groups, such as men who have sex with men (MSM), are at increased risk of HPV infection. The purpose of the study was to understand perceptions of HPV and the vaccine among adolescent and young adult males, both heterosexual and MSM. Seventy-six males (45 heterosexual, 31 MSM) completed a questionnaire and participated in a focus group. Overall, 42% had heard of HPV and 39% had heard of the HPV vaccine. Males had moderate to favorable attitudes toward vaccination, although intentions to vaccinate were more neutral. MSM were more knowledgeable, aware, and in control of the decision to vaccinate than heterosexual males. Increasing awareness and knowledge about HPV and the vaccine may be necessary to encourage vaccination; certain subgroups of males may be more receptive to HPV vaccination than others.</p>

<title>Background</title>
<sec id="section2-1557988312456697">
<title>HPV and the HPV vaccine</title>
<p>The human papillomavirus (HPV) is the most common sexually transmitted infection (STI) in the United States and worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1557988312456697">Dunne &amp; Markowitz, 2006</xref>). HPV Types 6 and 11 cause approximately 90% of the more than 500,000 cases of genital warts that occur each year in the United States among sexually active men and women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1557988312456697">Hoy, Singhal, Willey, &amp; Insinga, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1557988312456697">Hu &amp; Goldie, 2008</xref>). Direct medical costs related to genital warts are estimated at $200 million per year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1557988312456697">Hu &amp; Goldie, 2008</xref>). In addition, genital warts can have an adverse impact on quality of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1557988312456697">Woodhall et al., 2009</xref>). HPV-associated cancers in males include certain anal, penile, oropharyngeal, and oral cavity cancers caused primarily by HPV 16 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1557988312456697">Parkin &amp; Bray, 2006</xref>). Men who have sex with men (MSM) are at higher risk for HPV infection than heterosexual males because of risky sexual practices, such as unprotected anal sex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1557988312456697">Jin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1557988312456697">Joseph et al., 2008</xref>). This leads to an increased risk of anal HPV transmission and higher rates of anal and penile cancers among MSM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1557988312456697">Dietz &amp; Nyberg, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1557988312456697">Guilano et al., 2008</xref>). Additionally, MSM with HIV are at even higher risk of developing anal cancer than MSM who are not HIV positive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1557988312456697">Shiels et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>In 2009, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) licensed a quadrivalent HPV vaccine, previously licensed for females in 2006, for use in males aged 9 to 26 years, in an effort to reduce the incidence of genital warts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1557988312456697">FDA, 2009</xref>). In December 2010, the FDA added prevention of anal cancer in males and females as an indication for vaccine use. Data from vaccination trials has shown reductions in persistent HPV infections and genital warts among vaccinated males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1557988312456697">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2010</xref>). As with females, HPV vaccination likely offers the greatest benefit when administered before the onset of sexual activity and HPV exposure, hence why it was licensed for males as young as age 9 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1557988312456697">Hildesheim &amp; Herrero, 2007</xref>). The vaccine was recently endorsed by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, who recommended routine use for males aged 11 and 12 years, as well as for males aged 13 to 21 years who had not already received the vaccine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1557988312456697">CDC, 2011a</xref>).</p>
<p>A growing number of studies have been conducted with males to assess their awareness, attitudes, and intentions to receive the HPV vaccine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1557988312456697">Allen, Fantasia, Fontenot, Flaherty, &amp; Santana, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1557988312456697">Ferris et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1557988312456697">Gerend &amp; Barley, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1557988312456697">Gilbert, Brewer, Reiter, Ng, &amp; Smith, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1557988312456697">Jones &amp; Cook, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1557988312456697">Petrovic, Burney, &amp; Fletcher, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1557988312456697">Reiter, Brewer, McRee, Gilbert, &amp; Smith, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1557988312456697">Reiter, Brewer, &amp; Smith, 2010</xref>). The studies have generally reported low levels of knowledge and awareness about HPV and the vaccine among adult males. Some males are aware of the vaccine’s existence, although many are not aware that it is available to males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1557988312456697">Katz, Krieger, &amp; Roberto, 2011</xref>). Knowledge and awareness of the virus and the vaccine appear to be higher among MSM than among males with female sex partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1557988312456697">Gilbert et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1557988312456697">Reiter, Brewer, McRee, et al., 2010</xref>). Across all male populations, interest in vaccination is relatively favorable, although not as high as it is for females, possibly because of lower levels of knowledge and awareness. Predictors of vaccine acceptability for males are similar to those that influence intention to vaccinate among females and include perceived susceptibility to HPV infection, sexual activity, perceived benefits of the vaccine, and perceived norms for vaccination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1557988312456697">Liddon, Hood, Wynn, &amp; Markowitz, 2010</xref>). However, self-reported estimates among males of vaccine uptake, albeit less than 1 year postlicensure, were quite low, roughly 2% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1557988312456697">Reiter, McRee, Kadis, &amp; Brewer, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Few studies involving males have included adolescent males, both heterosexual and MSM, exactly at the age when they are now encouraged to make a decision, either independently or with a parent, about vaccination. This study specifically targeted African American, urban males living in low-income, low-resource environments, in part, because of the increased prevalence of STIs and risky health behaviors among this population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1557988312456697">CDC, 2011b</xref>). Exploring awareness of and attitudes toward HPV vaccination among adolescent males is necessary if the goal is to increase HPV vaccination among this age group and ultimately reduce the burden of genital warts and HPV-related cancers in males. While the adolescent male may not be making the decision to vaccinate, their understanding and awareness of the vaccine may trigger discussions with a parent or provider, which could have a positive influence on the decision maker.</p>

<sec id="section3-1557988312456697">
<title>Theoretical Framework</title>
<p>The theory of planned behavior (TPB) posits that an individual’s intention to perform a given behavior, in this case one’s intention to get an HPV vaccine, is based on one’s attitudes toward the behavior (positive or negative evaluation of performing the behavior), subjective norms (perception of the social pressures to perform or not perform the behavior), and one’s perceived behavioral control (perception of the ability to perform the behavior; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1557988312456697">Ajzen, 1991</xref>). Behavioral beliefs produce a favorable or unfavorable attitude toward the behavior; normative beliefs result in perceived social pressure or subjective norm; and control beliefs give rise to perceived behavioral control. The TPB is a useful model for predicting a wide range of behaviors and behavioral intentions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1557988312456697">Montaño &amp; Kasprzyk, 2008</xref>). Educational and public health initiatives designed to increase awareness and intention to vaccinate should be based on the identification of factors linked to the intention to receive the HPV vaccine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1557988312456697">Kahn et al., 2008</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section4-1557988312456697">
<title>Study Purpose and Design</title>
<p>The purpose of the study was to understand knowledge, attitudes, and intentions toward vaccination in a sample of adolescent males, both heterosexual and MSM. The study used a multimethod, exploratory study design to assess factors that could potentially influence young males when deciding about HPV vaccination. Factors were modeled after constructs in the TPB. Self-administered questionnaires and focus group discussions were used to quantitatively and qualitatively explore factors most associated with intent to vaccinate. Although other studies have assessed males’ perspective of the HPV vaccine, none, to our knowledge, have included the voices of a young minority population at elevated risk of HPV infection.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section6-1557988312456697">
<title>Study Population</title>
<p>Five neighborhoods in Philadelphia were preselected because they had predominately low-income populations. Median household incomes in these five neighborhoods ranged from $13,906 to $37,714, and the percentage of African American adults living in each neighborhood was greater than 75% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1557988312456697">U.S. Census Bureau, 2000</xref>). We recruited a convenience sample of males aged 13 to 21 years within these neighborhoods during the summer and fall of 2010. Participation in the study was not limited by HPV vaccination status, but none of the males self-reported HPV vaccination. Males self-identified as being primarily heterosexual or MSM and were invited to a particular focus group based on this information. Study sessions were held in the neighborhoods where the males were recruited, at places they were familiar with such as recreation centers, public libraries, nonprofit organizations, and the local community college. All participants gave written consent after research staff read and explained the informed consent document. Because this study was considered low risk and anonymous, parental consent was not warranted. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at Thomas Jefferson University.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1557988312456697">
<title>Self-Administered Questionnaire</title>
<p>At the beginning of each study session, participants completed a self-administered questionnaire about HPV knowledge and awareness, as well as attitudes, subjective norms, perceptions of behavioral control, and intentions regarding the HPV vaccine. The questionnaire included a brief description of the HPV vaccine so that participants who had no prior knowledge of the vaccine were able to answer some questions related to attitudes and intention to vaccinate (“The vaccine is a series of three shots that can protect against human papillomavirus, or HPV. HPV is known to cause almost all cases of genital warts in males, as well as certain cancers like those of the anus and penis”). Awareness of HPV and the vaccine was measured with two items: “Have you ever heard of HPV?” and “Have you ever heard of the HPV vaccine?” We included five items to assess knowledge of HPV and the vaccine (listed in a table in the Results: Questionnaire Data section). Intentions to vaccinate were measured with a single item: “How likely are you to get the HPV vaccine in the next 12 months?” Items consistent with the TPB that measured attitudes, subjective norms, perceived behavioral control, and intentions are listed in a table in the Results: Questionnaire Data section. These items were measured on a 5-point Likert-type scale with “1” representing the most negative response, “3” representing a neutral response, and “5” representing the most positive response.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1557988312456697">
<title>Focus Group Discussions</title>
<p>Focus groups were moderated by males who had extensive public health training or were graduate students in public health at the time of the study. The moderators were African American, Asian American, or Mexican American and represented the demographic and cultural backgrounds of the adolescent male population. This was intended to increase feelings of familiarity between the moderator and participants, which would foster an environment where an honest discussion on sensitive sexual health topics was possible. Moderators were trained by the principal investigators and the investigator’s team in all aspects of the study protocol, such as obtaining informed consent, administering the questionnaire, and moderating focus groups.</p>
<p>The research team developed the focus group script to elicit discussion around HPV and HPV vaccination, guided by the constructs of the TPB. This included topics such as susceptibility to HPV infection, behavioral, normative, and perceived control beliefs about getting vaccines (in general, and specifically about the HPV vaccine), and decision making about health care in general and HPV vaccination specifically (who makes decisions about your health; where does one look for information when making decisions). If participants were unclear of HPV and the vaccine, the moderators had information that they could read to participants, so that the group could have an informed discussion about the topic. Four of the focus groups consisted exclusively of MSM aged 13 to 21 years, while 6 focus groups consisted of heterosexual males aged 13 to 18 years. Participants were grouped into younger or older males to foster equal participation and avoid domination by older males during the discussions. The same general script was used for all focus groups; slight modifications were made to scripts for each group to make them relevant and culturally appropriate. All focus group discussions lasted roughly 2 hours and were audio recorded. Participants were compensated $20 in cash and two tokens for public transportation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1557988312456697">
<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>For survey items, means, frequencies, and distributions were calculated when appropriate. Bivariate analyses were used to evaluate differences between the two groups of males. A knowledge summary score was calculated for each participant by summing the number of items (out of 5) that were correct; each correct item was worth 1 point and total scores ranged from 0 to 5. Questionnaire items were analyzed using SPSS Version 19.</p>
<p>For focus groups, word document transcripts from the audio-recorded focus groups were produced verbatim by a professional transcription service and verified for accuracy by a moderator that attended the focus groups. Any discrepancy in transcribing was corrected by the moderator so that accurate transcription files were used in analysis. Transcripts were then analyzed by iterative rounds of coding by at least two members of the research team, where specific themes and trends were identified within each transcript and discussed by the research team until final consensus was reached. Themes were identified as topics that consistently occurred across transcripts as well as similarities and differences between transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1557988312456697">Ryan &amp; Bernard, 2003</xref>). Quotes that appear in this article were selected based on their ability to represent typical responses during the discussion and/or provide insight into the thought process of the adolescents. They do not represent the flow of discussion within one group but are compiled of the most representative responses to the same question across all groups.</p>

<title>Awareness and Knowledge of HPV and the Vaccine</title>
<p>From the questionnaire, 42% of all participants had heard of HPV, and 39% had heard about the HPV vaccine. There were significant differences in awareness of HPV and knowing someone who had been vaccinated between the two subpopulations of males. For example, only 18% of heterosexual males had heard of HPV compared with 77% of MSM (χ<sup>2</sup> = 27.0, <italic>df</italic> = 2, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). Only 22% of heterosexual males had heard of the vaccine compared with 61% of MSM (χ<sup>2</sup> = 11.4, <italic>df</italic> = 2, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). Close to 20% of MSM knew someone (either male or female) who had been vaccinated compared with 5% of heterosexual males (χ<sup>2</sup> = 4.0, <italic>df</italic> = 1, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). In terms of knowledge, the mean number of correct items (out of 5) among all participants was 1.66 (<italic>SD</italic> = 1.4). Among the full sample, 26% percent got all 5 knowledge questions wrong; only 5% of males got all 5 items correct. Males were most likely to know that getting the HPV vaccine would not protect you from other infections such as HIV and were least likely to know that getting the HPV vaccine would not cure you if you already had HPV. Heterosexual males were significantly less knowledgeable about HPV and the vaccine than MSM (<italic>t</italic> = 4.1, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001).

<title>Awareness and Knowledge of HPV and the Vaccine</title>
<p>Although half of all males had reported awareness of HPV during the questionnaire, discussions in the focus groups revealed that a thorough understanding of the virus and the vaccine was rare. Males in the MSM focus groups were more likely to know that HPV was an STI and that a vaccine was available. Fewer heterosexual males had heard of HPV; some had heard of it by name but were unsure of its meaning or that a vaccine was available to them. For some males who had heard of HPV, it was evident that their exposure had been through vaccine pharmaceutical advertising for females. Therefore, some males thought that the vaccine was strictly available for females. There were frequent misunderstandings about the purpose of vaccines in general, with many males believing that vaccines cure, rather than prevent, disease. Below is a sample of discussion from focus groups illustrating the points mentioned above.</p>

<title>Risky Health Behaviors and HPV Risk Perception</title>
<p>When moderators explained that the HPV vaccine was a form of protection against an STI, participants reported that almost all young adults in their neighborhoods were sexually active. When asked to name STIs that came to mind, males recalled more commonly known STIs such as HIV, chlamydia, and herpes but rarely mentioned HPV. Group discussions with the heterosexual males frequently centered on young men having multiple sexual partners and making poor decisions, such as trusting their partner’s sexual fidelity or apparent lack of disease and agreeing to unprotected sex. MSM also reported risky behaviors among their peers, such as unprotected or improperly protected sex, but seemed to be more aware of the implications of their behavior, possibly because of the history of HIV and prevention efforts in their community. When asked whether they felt that young males are at risk for HPV infection, the general consensus was that they were highly at risk, mostly because of their unprotected sexual behavior. Some males did not feel that they, personally, were at risk because they felt that they were cautious when choosing a sexual partner or had limited experiences for which to be exposed to HPV. The following represents dialogue during the focus groups about risk and perceptions of STI’s in general and HPV specifically.</p>

<title>Attitudes, Norms, and Intentions to Vaccinate</title>
<p>In almost all focus groups, regardless of sexual orientation, males presented a similar mix of positive and negative attitudes toward HPV vaccination. In terms of positive reasons to be vaccinated, participants primarily cited issues of protection against a disease that has no cure. Some males considered risk to be an important factor when thinking about intentions to vaccinate. They suggested that males who were at increased risk of contracting HPV, primarily from risky sexual behavior, should more strongly consider vaccination than males who were at lower risk. In terms of negative attitudes toward HPV vaccination, the possibility of side effects was the most common response to why a male might not want to get the vaccine.</p>

<title>Decision Making About HPV Vaccination</title>
<p>During the focus groups, participants frequently cited parents or guardians as people who would be influential in their decision to get vaccinated. A few participants mentioned that some parents, notably fathers, would be less aware of their intentions of getting vaccinated because they felt that fathers were less informed about the purpose of the vaccine. Moreover, for MSM, fathers may be less willing to support their decision to be vaccinated because some do not approve of their sexual identity. Health care providers were also mentioned as an influential source, but to a lesser extent than parents or guardians. Some males felt that they could make the decision about vaccination on their own. This belief was more salient among MSM, who may have made their own health care decisions in the past, particularly related to sexual health. However, other participants noted that in order to make a decision about something, they wanted to be informed about it, and many did not feel sufficiently informed about HPV vaccination to make a decision on their own.</p>

<p>The focus group moderator also enquired about how participants would feel if their sexual partner (either male or female) had received the HPV vaccine. Among the heterosexual males, knowing that a female had received the HPV vaccine generated different types of conclusions. For some, knowing that their female partner had received the vaccine elicited a positive response that she was taking care of her own health. In addition, males saw a benefit to her being vaccinated because it alleviated the possibility that he could infect her with HPV or vice versa. However, some males had a negative reaction to hearing that their partner was vaccinated. Some concluded that if a girl had received the HPV vaccine, it must be because she is sexually promiscuous, or “dirty.” The MSM participants generally concluded that if their partner had gotten vaccinated, that it was a positive benefit to them, in terms of protection from infection. One participant summed up the general consensus of the MSM participants: “Well if he’s getting vaccinated, then I don’t have to worry about it because he’s protecting me as well.”</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This is one of the first multimethod studies to involve young adult males, both heterosexual and MSM, from low-income, low-resource neighborhoods to better understand their thoughts about HPV and the vaccine. The study used both quantitative and qualitative data to provide insight into cognitions that might influence intent to receive the HPV vaccine. Our exploratory research questions were firmly guided by behavioral theory, in this case the TPB, which is a strength of the study. Additionally, the study went beyond the constructs of the theory to include additional elements of knowledge, awareness, and key influencers of decision making. Few studies, to our knowledge, have provided such in-depth insight into the decision-making process about HPV vaccination among underserved adolescent males who are eligible to receive the vaccine.</p>
<p>The study revealed that many adolescent males, particularly those who were heterosexual, had never heard of HPV or the HPV vaccine prior to being involved in the research study, which is similar to what has been reported with adult males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1557988312456697">Gilbert et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1557988312456697">Reiter, Brewer, McRee, et al., 2010</xref>). MSM participants were significantly more aware and knowledgeable about HPV and the vaccine, possibly from their more frequent exposure to messages about HIV and other STIs or more frequent discussions about health issues among their friends and peers. A higher level of awareness and knowledge about the vaccine among gay/bisexual males has been reported in other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1557988312456697">Reiter, Brewer, McRee, et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1557988312456697">Simatherai et al., 2009</xref>); however, not with males as young as those who participated in our study. Additionally, MSM participants were significantly more likely to feel in control of the decision to vaccinate than heterosexual males, but this may because MSM participants may have more experience in taking care of their sexual health or being tested for HIV.</p>
<p>It is important to note that although knowledge of HPV and the vaccine was quite low, this did not appear to affect vaccine acceptance. Once males were educated about the high prevalence of HPV and the health consequences of infection, attitudes toward vaccination and intentions to vaccinate were moderate to favorable. This has been reported in other studies, although the males were significantly older (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1557988312456697">Ferris et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1557988312456697">Gerend &amp; Barley, 2009</xref>). This suggests that public health campaigns to educate males about the vaccine are warranted and may cement their interest in wanting to protect their health by vaccination. However, a better understanding of how to increase intentions, the precursor to behavior and the hallmark of the TPB, is necessary, even when attitudes are favorable.</p>
<p>Because HPV vaccination likely offers the greatest benefit if administered before sexual activity, in early adolescence, it is important to understand the attitudes and influences of males who may actually be facing the decision about vaccination. Knowing who the males would involve in the decision-making process, and who influences their normative beliefs about vaccination, is an important first step in creating an educational intervention. The majority of heterosexual males agreed that close relatives, especially females, would influence their decision making about HPV vaccination. The influence of female caregivers over male caregivers in the health care decisions of adolescent males has been documented in the past (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1557988312456697">Blum, 2002</xref>). To a lesser extent, a doctor’s or their partner’s recommendation would also influence their decision making. In other studies involving older adult males, a physician recommendation was a strong influencing factor in decision making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1557988312456697">Jones &amp; Cook, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1557988312456697">Lenselink et al., 2008</xref>). It may be that younger males have easier access to family members than health care providers, and the shift to involving a provider in decisions comes with older age. This may be what occurred, as the heterosexual males, who tended to be younger in age, were more likely to report that a female caregiver would be influential whereas the MSM participants, who tended to be older in age, were more likely to report that their health care provider would be an active decision maker.</p>
<p>Despite the numerous strengths of the study, it is not without limitations. While the study was deliberately designed to hear the voices of young urban males who are at increased risk of infectious diseases, this unique sample may limit the generalizability of the findings. Furthermore, the study was cross-sectional in nature, so it was not possible to determine if intentions among the nonvaccinated lead to actual behavior. Last, the sample size was too small to distinguish which constructs of the TPB were most likely to influence the males’ intent to be vaccinated. However, this study serves as a starting point for documenting how urban adolescent males, both heterosexual and MSM, are thinking, learning, and deciding about HPV vaccination.</p>
