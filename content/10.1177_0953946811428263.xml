<abstract>
<p>The purpose of this paper is to suggest that sport can be understood as a form of engagement with the fundamental contingency and vulnerability of the human condition, and as such that it expresses a yearning for meaning in a modern society that offers only the illusion of meaning. Sport, at its most profound, is argued to be a negative liturgy, in the sense that it highlights an absence of meaning, rather than offering a positive alternative. The paper draws on an analysis of contemporary society, and resultant defence of the potential role that liturgy might play in restoring meaning and a sense of transcendence to society, that is offered by the Radical Orthodoxy theologian Catherine Pickstock.</p>

<p>The purpose of this paper is to explore the relationship between sport<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0953946811428263">1</xref></sup> and liturgy. This relationship is not to be understood as a mere analogy. It will be suggested that the place occupied by sport in contemporary society allows it to be understood as an expression of the absence of—and yearning for—meaningful liturgical structuring in everyday social life. In sport the competitor and spectator confront the contingency, waste and potential meaninglessness of human existence, not least as they risk failure in the tasks that sport assigns to them. The paper will proceed by taking Pickstock’s analysis of the liturgy as a framework for exploring and understanding the place of sport in modernity.</p>
<sec id="section1-0953946811428263">
<title>Modernism</title>
<p>Pickstock argues that the grounding of society in liturgical practice would serve to stave off the fragmentation—or diremption—of contemporary society.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0953946811428263">2</xref></sup> Her analysis of the ills of modernity is largely congruent with those of the founders of modern social theory (classically Marx, Durkheim and Weber) and their synthesisers in the tradition of Western Marxism (not least Lukacs, Benjamin and the Frankfurt School), through to the work of those associated with the journal <italic>Telos</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0953946811428263">3</xref></sup> Her response is broadly within the framework of the Durkheimians—who advocated the rebuilding of the shared moral grounding of society through the collective conscience (or mechanical solidarity), for example through the revival of medieval guilds as a defence against anomie<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0953946811428263">4</xref></sup>—and contemporary communitarians, such as MacIntyre and Lasch.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0953946811428263">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>For Pickstock, liturgy, in the form of the ‘lifeworld’, is a necessary aspect of all societies. This is, at its most basic, to stress the inevitably communal and social nature of humanity. The concept of the ‘lifeworld’ was initially proposed within phenomenology by Husserl, but taken up within social theory by Husserl’s pupil, Alfred Schutz.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0953946811428263">6</xref></sup> It is the stock of knowledge and skills that enables and structures the competent social agent’s engagement with their social world. It is composed of the basic abilities to interact with other human beings and to manipulate objects in one’s environment. Because of its deep embeddedness in our very natures, the lifeworld is expressed pre-reflectively in practice, rather than through conceptual articulation. It nonetheless shapes a fundamental worldview, so making possible a specific understanding of the world and an idea of appropriate moral deportment within it. The lifeworld is therefore the ultimate source of meaning for the competent social agent. Indeed, it is through the lifeworld that the agent understands not just the world around them, but crucially also who they are and how they fit into that world.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0953946811428263">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>The lifeworld is acquired in the main through early socialisation, and thus largely taken for granted as if it were a natural and inevitable capacity. Encounters with those socialised into different lifeworlds are often puzzling and embarrassing for this reason—one does not quite know how to go on. Different cultures, precisely because they interpret and live their lives differently, will rest upon different lifeworlds. This opens up a problem of cultural relativism. No one lifeworld clearly has a priority, epistemologically or morally, over any other. To identify liturgy, and specifically Christian liturgy, as a lifeworld is, in effect, to give that lifeworld precedence, and to argue that it has a transcendence and universality in the worldview that it engenders that other lifeworlds lack.</p>
<p>The failure of modernism, for Pickstock, lies in its denial of the lifeworld—the refusal of liturgy. Crucially, this is not a suspension of the lifeworld, for no society can be formed and function without one. It is rather to suggest that modernism distorts and parodies the liturgical lifeworld that it has inherited from the European middle ages and Catholicism. Genuine liturgy is replaced by ‘anti-liturgy liturgy’—a generation of illusory meanings and values. It may immediately be noted that, for Pickstock, liturgy is not then to be understood as a remedy that may be imposed from without upon an ailing society, but rather, akin to Durkheim’s mechanical solidarity, as a trait of society that is always already there, but that may be weakened or neglected.</p>
<p>If liturgy is understood, as Pickstock wishes, as a pattern of activity that infuses social action as a whole, and further if it is expressive of potentially transcendent meaning rather than being the empty repetition of mere ritual,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0953946811428263">8</xref></sup> then it is in this that the lifeworld is genuinely liturgical. The repetition of pre-reflective practices creates and consolidates the agent’s place within the cosmos. To refuse the lifeworld, and thus the liturgical base of society, is to strip meaning from social life and thus endanger the individual’s sense of place. This occurs in modernity primarily through a process of quantification<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0953946811428263">9</xref></sup> whereby what were previously understood as qualitative and meaningful differences and relationships between events are reduced to mere differences of quantity. The pilgrimage of a liturgically understood space and history—where every point contains the potential for epiphany and the individual and the community can move towards the possibility of redemption<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0953946811428263">10</xref></sup>—is lost in either a merely backward looking reminiscence, or in an endless repetition of the same. Pickstock analyses this process at a number of levels, in arguments that may be seen to build upon a tradition of social thought that runs from Marx and the analysis of commodity fetishism (including Lukacs’ generalisation of this as a theory of reification), through Durkheim’s analysis of anomie and Weberian disenchantment, to Habermas’s account of the colonisation of the lifeworld.</p>
<p>Quantification is experienced as units of time become interchangeable, so endangering any sense of narrative development to life or history. Classically, the extreme division of labour that continues to characterise many capitalist production processes reduces any given worker’s task to the simple repetition of an action, divorced from its place within the making of the whole product. The day thereby becomes the repetition of identical gestures. In the week, Sunday is made available for work or consumerism and thus is increasingly undifferentiated from other days. While the year may still be marked by secularised festivals (such as Christmas, New Year, and Thanksgiving), these festivals are stripped of any transcendent narrative structure, while the possibilities of modern production and transport isolate the consumer from seasonal cycles by making foodstuffs permanently available. At a more expansive level, history is reduced to a mechanical progression, whereby the logic of technological innovation is worked out (in what Habermas or Luhmann would term system differentiation<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0953946811428263">11</xref></sup>). While some festivals may still act as moments of historical remembrance, history is secularised and backward looking. There is no promise of redemption or transcendence. Political grand narratives, let alone those of the church, that might pose critically the problem of the nature of the good life to be pursued, are thereby undermined. Time, for Pickstock, has thus become spatialised, as a mere repetition of the same.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0953946811428263">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>This quantification intrudes radically into the lifeworld, as it shapes the socialisation of agents, distorting, Pickstock claims, the very structure of language as well as our expectations and the possibilities that we can imagine.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0953946811428263">13</xref></sup> The increasing dominance of <italic>asyndeton</italic> in language construction, so that conjunctions and clausal hierarchies are made unavailable, at once inhibits the agent’s ability to challenge an experience of the repetition of the same, while allowing them to function within a fragmented and spatialised world.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0953946811428263">14</xref></sup> Here Pickstock echoes the more pessimistic moments of Adorno. In his condemnation of what he terms ‘identity thinking’—the positivistic assumption that concepts can map neatly onto the world, identifying its atomic elements without remainder—he argues that the very structures of supposedly competent thought have become so constricted that critical and imaginative reflection are marginalised.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0953946811428263">15</xref></sup> A positivistic or scientistic mentality further privileges certain forms of knowledge, crowding out more humanistic alternatives. Again it is those forms of knowledge that quantify (<italic>mathesis</italic>) that are dominant.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0953946811428263">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>Fundamentally, the ‘anti-liturgy liturgy’ that makes possible modernity is a lifeworld that prepares the social agent to live and function within a society that lacks any appeal to transcendent meaning. Agency is not thereby destroyed, although the agent is sundered from genuine subjectivity. While the pre-modern lifeworld would equip the individual with the ability to interact qualitatively and meaningfully with other individuals, and indeed to understand themselves precisely in terms of the sense of community formed thereby, the modern lifeworld facilitates primarily the individual’s ability to manipulate quantitatively their relationships with others. Interaction is typically governed, not through meaningful negations and conversations, but rather by obeying the expectations of the market, bureaucracy and other systems (as Habermas calls them<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0953946811428263">17</xref></sup>). For Pickstock, this reduces the human agent to a ‘cyber-intelligence’, as one learns merely to obey the formal logic that is inherent to capitalism.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0953946811428263">18</xref></sup> At best, it may be suggested that this intelligence is expressed in the atomised decision-making of the liberal individual, for whom the good, true and beautiful are decided merely in terms of subjective preferences, that require no further rational justification or argumentation—and thus acts of what Taylor calls ‘weak evaluation’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0953946811428263">19</xref></sup> or MacIntyre ‘emotivism’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0953946811428263">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>In a final, but for sport crucial, element of modernity, Pickstock identifies the spectacle as a compensation for the impoverishment of the contemporary lifeworld.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0953946811428263">21</xref></sup> Either periods of carnival interrupt everyday routines, or aspects of play and eroticism are supposedly fused with work. Pickstock’s criticism of these phenomena is that they merely reproduce the emptiness and repetition of work, rather than transfiguring or giving meaning to it. Even the arts offer the audience only a time and space separate from the world, but as such they are nothing more than a private refuge, lacking any critical connection to the public world.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0953946811428263">22</xref></sup> There is a hint here of an argument from the Marxist sociology of sport and leisure, to the effect that sport serves as a relaxation from the rigours of work, but also as a training for work, in so far as the physical and mental skills honed in sport are congruent with those required in capitalist production. In either case, the sporting carnival is functional to capitalism, rather than disruptive or redemptive. Perhaps more profoundly, Pickstock is also suggesting that carnival, play and the erotic in capitalism give the illusion of meaning, but crucially a meaning that remains superficial and fragmentary, and unable to touch the reality of modernism. Here again is a suggestion of Adorno, and in particular his account of the culture industry. An industry that embraces advertising as well as the entertainment media does not simply create demand. Rather, it offers the products that consumers need in order to make life within modernity bearable. Consumerism is a rational response to the irrationality of modernity, albeit one that serves only to reproduce the system, not to transcend it.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0953946811428263">23</xref></sup></p>

<title>Sport and Liturgy</title>
<p>Plato’s ideal city of the Magnesians, as presented in the <italic>Laws</italic>, provides Pickstock with an initial model of a liturgical society. Plato stresses the liturgical use of music and dance in the education and moulding of the Magnesians—beginning with children’s play (797a-b)—but also in the sustaining of the citizen’s sense of belonging, and not merely to the city but within the cosmos as a whole. On every day there will be at least one official festival sanctioned by the state (828b), so that a liturgical year is clearly articulated. The twelve tribes within the city, along with all the tribes’ divisions and subdivisions, will each have their own god to honour (771d), and each month of the year will be dedicated to a different god, with festivals of ‘chorus performances and cultural and gymnastic contests’ (828c). The association of gods with particular divisions presumably serves to integrate each division, and each member of a division, into the Greeks’ mythology—akin to the totemic systems of tribal societies. The festivals are sacrifices, in which the Magnesians give thanks to their god, precisely for the possibility—or gift—of their identity.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0953946811428263">24</xref></sup> When members of a tribe come together at festivals they will thus ‘recognize and greet each other … in mutual friendship’, because a common upbringing and participation in liturgical practices will have given them a shared character and outlook on life (738d-e). Liturgical practices shape not merely the citizen’s intellectual understanding of what is good and true, but more importantly their feeling of pleasure before the good and pain before the bad (654d). Their understanding is thus embodied as much as it is conceptually articulated. Myths are lived and practised, and not merely known and remembered. The Magnesians’ life is, in sum, deliberately structured to shape and reinforce a sense of meaning and value, through life-long and daily liturgical observances.</p>
<p>Centrally the present paper is concerned to ask after the place that sport might play in a liturgical redemption of modernism. It may be noted that gymnastics plays a central role in Magnesian liturgy. Indeed, Plato suggests that while music and poetry might touch the soul, gymnastics and dance are necessary to affect the body similarly (672e-673b). This begins to indicate that sport may have a place in liturgy, albeit that Plato’s conception of gymnastics is perhaps closer to the German tradition of <italic>Turnen</italic> than to modern (Anglo-American) ‘sport’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0953946811428263">25</xref></sup> The earliest Western accounts of sport, the funeral games for Patroclus in the <italic>Iliad</italic> (Book 23), also situate sport in liturgical practices. In particular, funeral games may be understood not merely as a way of honouring the dead, but also as part of a liturgical economy,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0953946811428263">26</xref></sup> where the games become a means for redistributing goods, as prizes to victors, within the community. Indeed, in so far as Achilles intervenes to give additional prizes than those promised to the winner—including prizes to those, such as Agammenon, who would have won had they contended—the games serve to reinforce the aristocratic hierarchy of the community.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0953946811428263">27</xref></sup> The Olympic Games themselves were liturgical offerings to Zeus, and were held on a sacred site. The need to provide a mythical account of the Games’ origin—for example with Pindar attributing them to Heracles<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0953946811428263">28</xref></sup> and Pausanias presenting them as a recreation of Pelops’ chariot race against Olnomoas<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0953946811428263">29</xref></sup>—is itself significant as indicative of the need for the Games to have not merely a narrative context, but a narrative that transcends human history.</p>
<p>Ethnographical evidence from outside Europe suggests a similar entwining of sport and liturgy. The most spectacular, and most studied, example is that of the Meso-American Ballgame. Archaeological evidence, in the form of ball courts, equipment and figurines representing players, allows the origins of this game to be dated to at least 500 <sc>bc</sc> in what are today the Veracruz and Tabasco states of Mexico. While the game takes many forms, all involve the use of a rubber ball, and in its classic version, the ball can only be hit with the hip or buttocks. Players wear protective waist bands or yokes that are also reproduced in stone, as highly decorated symbolic objects. Crucially, the game is tied into a Mayan creation myth (Popul Vuh). Two human ballplayers, Hun Hunahpu and Vucub Hunahpu, are tricked by the gods into competing with them in the underworld. They are defeated and sacrificed, by decapitation. The magical offspring of Hun Hunahpu, Hunahpu and Xhalanque, are even better ballplayers, and defeat the gods and their tricks. In victory they are able to restore their father and uncle as the sun and moon.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0953946811428263">30</xref></sup> The game may thus be understood in terms of themes of death and resurrection. In so far as Hun Hunahpu is also the maize god, it may be linked to fertility and the regeneration of crops—and indeed, given that in Mayan myth humans are made from white and yellow maize, to the creation and regeneration of humanity itself. To play the game is therefore to perform a liturgical act that participates in the mythical events. Mythical heroes become present in the bodies and actions of the ballplayers, and the game’s arena becomes the meeting place of this world and the spirit world. The relief carvings and wall paintings that accompany the game also indicate that it culminated in human sacrifice.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0953946811428263">31</xref></sup> Whether it was the winners or the losers who were sacrificed remains unclear.</p>
<p>The evidence of the Meso-American Ballgame, the ancient Olympics and other examples<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0953946811428263">32</xref></sup> suggests that what is now understood as sport had its origins in liturgy.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0953946811428263">33</xref></sup> Such a suggestion invites an inquiry into what differentiates liturgical play and modern sport. Bernard Suits has attempted to characterise sport in terms of its goals and the means allowed for their achievement.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0953946811428263">34</xref></sup> He distinguishes between what he calls the pre-lusory and the lusory goals of a game. The pre-lusory goal would be captured in a naïve description of the purpose of a game, made without reference to its particular rules. Thus, the point of golf is to get a ball into a hole, with the initial position of the ball being separated from the hole by several hundred yards. If that is all golf is, then it is a peculiarly facile activity (and, as Mark Twain observed, a good walk spoiled). For the initiate, golf is far more than that. The point of golf lies not in its pre-lusory goal, which can be achieved very simply, for example by picking up the ball and carrying it to the hole. Golf makes sense as a sport only, Suits argues, because of the peculiarly inefficient means that alone are sanctioned for the achievement of that pre-lusory goal. Hence, the lusory goal of a game characterises the purpose and nature of golf with full reference to those inefficient means. So, one must get the ball into the hole only by hitting it with specially designed sticks (that initiates call ‘clubs’), and more precisely, the player must strive to achieve this goal with the minimum number of such strikes. To play a game is thus ‘the voluntary attempt to overcome unnecessary obstacles’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0953946811428263">35</xref></sup> The rules of a sport are thus understood to be constitutive of sport as an activity. The rules of golf make putting, driving, hooking and shanking possible. Outside of those rules, and indeed outside the institution of golf, one is just hitting a ball with a stick.</p>
<p>Suits’ approach is an example of what is known as formalism in the philosophy of sport, and while this approach is problematic in certain respects, it will suffice for present purposes to make the distinction between modern sport and liturgical games. Formalism entails that the nature and purpose of a sport can only be understood from within an acceptance of the rules. To put this slightly differently, one cannot typically justify the nature of a component element of a game without ultimately referring to the rules as the final arbiter. Thus, to ask why one can only carry fourteen clubs in one’s golf bag is to invite the answer, because that is what the rules say. While rules within the game need to be consistent with each other, in order to make the game playable, there is an ultimate contingency about the game’s system of rules as a whole. One might still inquire into the history of the game, and thus into the motivations that brought about the introduction of particular rules. Rules are indeed refined and developed over time, and changes may sometimes be introduced on instrumental grounds—to make the game safer for players; to punish foul play; to make the game more entertaining for spectators or more testing for elite athletes. But rules typically have a fundamental and irreducible arbitrariness. They could have been different. Thus there are perhaps two types of inquiry at stake. One appeals to a historical and cultural narrative of the game; the other merely to the nature of the game as played. Formalism focuses upon the latter.</p>
<p>This in turn leads to questions about the meaning of a sport, or the meaning of participating in a sport. If one is to ask what a modern sport means—what it is about—then, given a formalist perspective, one cannot obviously refer beyond the rules themselves. The rules focus a particular test of human dexterity and character—to run or throw or catch, say. They invite one to play with certain properties of physical objects—such as the elasticity of rubber or the pliability of willow. They invite one to endure and manipulate different spaces and time periods—the five days of test cricket as opposed to the few seconds of the Sumo bout. The meaning of a particular action within the game can only be interpreted in terms of the intrinsic requirements of the game (and, again, to the pursuit of lusory goals). Thus, a player is executing a cover drive, attempting a cross court backhand, blocking an offensive tackle. Drives, backhands and blocks have no references to the non-sporting world.</p>
<p>To ask this same question of liturgical games, such as the Meso-American Ballgame, is to invite a fundamentally different answer. To ask what the Ballgame is about is to ask after the mythology that informs and shapes it. A modern sport responds to a rubber ball simply in terms of its elasticity and its capacity to bounce and rebound; for the player of the liturgical Ballgame, the ball additionally and perhaps more fundamentally represents the movement of the sun and moon—and in one version of the game, the ball is set alight and hit with sticks, in an even more graphic representation of the sun. Alternatively, the ball may be the decapitated head of a hero—and again, there is a version in which the balls contained a human skull.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0953946811428263">36</xref></sup> Suits’ formalist account of sport therefore suggests that meaning in sport is simply a matter of syntax. Rules have an internal consistency and cross-reference, but do not refer beyond themselves. There is no symbolism to be attributed to the golf ball or soccer ball, the cricket bat or the tennis racquet. Liturgical games in contrast have a semantics, precisely because liturgical practice is necessarily mediated by mythical and transcendent narratives.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0953946811428263">
<title>Contemporary Sport</title>
<p>This seemingly augurs badly for the liturgical defence of modern sport. On a purely formalist account sport would be little more than spectacle, and the empty repetition of mere ritual—‘mechanical repetitions … divorced from any informing reason or narrative’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-0953946811428263">37</xref></sup> At some level, sport does nevertheless appear to protest against the fragmentation of modern society, and indeed against the spatialisation of time that Pickstock attributes to modernity. Sport would seem to offer the participant and spectator a defence against anomie. Liturgy, Pickstock suggests, should allow the public and private to mediate each other, so that the individual can ‘live with themselves and in public at the same time’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-0953946811428263">38</xref></sup> Perhaps uniquely among secular cultural events, the sports match allows this mediation. The community of supporters celebrates or mourns together, much as Plato indicates in his description of the meeting of a tribe. Further, the members of the sports community do so more profoundly then say the audience for music. The very nature of sport is such that the result is in doubt. While the audience may collectively celebrate a musical performance, that performance is a given. The audience member might be especially jubilant at a remarkably good performance, or profoundly disappointed by a poor one, but is never crushed by humiliating defeat, or exultant at unexpected victory. Sport seemingly gives rise to extreme shared emotions. Yet, even in the case of the sporting community, this may be insufficient to establish genuine resistance to liberal individualism. The community remains one community among others—supporters of one team, followers of one sport. Sport seems therefore to lack the moment of universality expected of Christian liturgy. Indeed, precisely because the mediation of public and private emotion seems to rest upon moments of victory and defeat, it would seem divisive. Further, the individual who is not good at sport or who is uninterested in it is seemingly excluded—and sports communities may in large part form a sense of self-identity precisely through their opposition to such outsiders. Sports communities would therefore seem to fall before the criticism that Pickstock makes of Schmitt’s neo-conservatism.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-0953946811428263">39</xref></sup> The sports community is merely the liberal subject writ large, and the subject’s emotivism is thereby projected onto the particular community. Communities express merely subjective and ultimately arbitrary preferences, and while they may tolerate each other, they do not ultimately have any tendency to form a universal.</p>
<p>If the communal nature of sport is a weak defence, then possibly the temporal experience of sport may serve as a response to the spatialisation of time, by which Pickstock characterises modernity. The seasonal nature of many sports sustains a sense of qualitative temporal progress over the year (or, given the four-year intervals between stagings of such events as the Olympic Games and the Soccer World Cup, perhaps even longer). For the individual athlete, a season or even a match may represent the culmination of a lifetime of training and preparation. The season itself is not the mere repetition of interchangeable weeks, as the rest of the secular and working year may be, but is a gradual building of narrative tension. More significantly, sports seasons are not as arbitrarily situated as a formalist account might suggest. Cricket and baseball, for example, require reasonably clement summer weather to be played at all, while other sports take on a certain character from the point in the yearly cycle in which they are played. The confining of the American Football season to the Fall serves to give the game a certain temporal and emotional colouring. Games begin in the last good days of the year, and early matches are coloured by the remnants of summery optimism. The challenges, defeats and set-backs, victories and promises of the season continue with, or in the face of, the decline into winter. Post-season games, leading to the Superbowl in February, have about them something of the air of a celebration of the turning of the year. Increasingly, this sense of temporal rightness is being challenged by commercial interests, and as such is indicative of the spatialisation of time, and the decline of sport into mere spectacle. The commercially motivated extension of the baseball season has been condemned precisely for violating a sense of when it is appropriate to play the game. The same might be said of the English and Scottish soccer seasons, and of the attempt to establish rugby league in the UK as a summer game.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-0953946811428263">40</xref></sup></p>
<p>The temporal experience of sport goes beyond the sense of a season. On a finer dimension, the match will give structure to the day. Within the game itself, different sports offer different temporal experiences. This is not merely a question of the different durations of the sporting competition, noted above, but rather of the way in which time is articulated. Sport offers something that is perhaps akin to music. There are significant differences between the long Romantic periods of more or less continuous play offered by soccer or rugby—although even here there is a subtle difference between the experience of rugby union, structured through set pieces such as scrums and line outs, and rugby league, beginning anew but quickly after each tackle—and the miminalist divisions of rounds in boxing, downs in American football, balls and overs in cricket. Again, just as time is experienced differently in different sports, so too is space. The magnificent open space of the Australian Rules pitch, that is not even complicated by anything as inconvenient as an off-side rule, contrasts as much with the natural unpredictability of the surfer’s wave, as with the geometrical confinement of the squash court. Wrestlers can circle each other within a ring (albeit now a square ring), while fencers lunge and recoil along a narrow, virtually one-dimensional, strip. Off-side rules add peculiarly metaphysical complications to this experience, when a ball that is perfectly within physical reach becomes untouchable (say for the rugby player at the ruck, when a ball untouched and open to view is still strangely in possession of the opposition).</p>
<p>It may yet be protested that such features of sport are at best superficial distractions from the quantification and spatialisation of time characteristic of modernity. At best, the temporal and spatial experiences of sport offer the private solace for which Rozenzweig condemns non-liturgical music.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-0953946811428263">41</xref></sup> They may offer an alternative to the dominant experience of space and time, but they do not impact upon that experience. Indeed, it may be suggested that the sports season actually reproduces spatialisation, precisely because each season is the same, and thus interchangeable. If a sport is granted a history, then it is typically a history of statistical progress, taking the form of the documentation of quantitatively defined record breaking.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-0953946811428263">42</xref></sup> As such, sport mirrors and reproduces the merely technological progress of capitalism—and records themselves are frequently best explained in terms of technical improvements in playing surfaces and equipment, or possibly of new training techniques and sports science, than is what might be thought to be genuinely human accretion. Sport as spectacle further tends to celebrate only victories, and this is turn distorts sport’s sense of history. Genuine context is lost, as histories highlight only transitory champions, and little of the process that went into forming that champion—including all importantly the loss and waste of all those contemporaries who failed on the same quest—and little of the period of decline and marginalisation after a champion’s period of dominance is over. History is fragmented and historical time spatialised. At best, if sports are given genuinely narrative histories, then these are still local histories, which is to say histories of specific communities, and as such fall foul of the objections made against the community above. Such histories are backward looking, remembering and celebrating past events, and crucially being confined to their community; they lack the moment of transcendence or engagement in the universal that would, for Pickstock, characterise the narrative mediation of liturgy.</p>
<p>The above arguments suggest that particular sports fall short of what is required of liturgy. To focus on sports is, however, to neglect both a higher level, which is to say sport per se, and a lower level, the sports match. Put otherwise, there is a level of universality and at once a more restricted level of particularity. It may then be suggested that sport as a universal offers an ideal, an ‘intimation of transcendence’ as Pickstock expresses it,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-0953946811428263">43</xref></sup> albeit one that can only be realised imperfectly at the local level, in specific matches. Further, while formalism may adequately grasp the contingency of the rules that constitute any given sport, it fails to account for either the substance of sport as such, or the narrative richness of the particular match. It is in the tension between these extremes that sport emerges as what may be termed a ‘negative’ liturgy. This will be to argue that in sport the participant and spectator alike potentially confront and engage with the lack of transcendent meaning in modern life.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-0953946811428263">44</xref></sup></p>
<p>Sport per se is creative and open. It is composed of an extraordinarily wide range of tests of human ability (both physical and psychological), and more can be and will be invented in the future. Sports test the limits of human strength, endurance, co-ordination, and in doing so invite the competitor to risk not merely the humiliation of failure, but also physical and mental injury and even death. Sports probe moral weaknesses, tempting illegitimate short-cuts around Suits’ unnecessary obstacles to success. They do all this by constituting environments within which chance plays a greater or lesser role, and where the outcome of the competition is necessarily undecided before the start of the game, and the player must make their peace with unlucky bounces, mechanical breakdowns and just having a bad day. The athlete is thereby invited to confront their physical and mental limitations. Sport as a whole, paradoxically thanks to that very degree of abstraction, may then be understood as an embodied exploration of the human condition. The particular sport, as the concrete manifestation of this universal, may fall short of the ideal. The particular sport may be characterised by the divisiveness noted above. Players and clubs may seek to humiliate each other, and express mutual rivalry and even hatred. Non-players may be ridiculed. Sport as a universal, in contrast, precisely because of its openness and inventiveness, can create environments that provide tests for all. The para-Olympic movement magnificently demonstrates the inclusivity that is inherent in sport per se. To ridicule and exclude a potential athlete or competitor is to deny the universal, and so to corrupt the particular sport.</p>
<p>This argument can be pursued further, firstly by considering the relationship of the individual athlete to the particular sport and to sport as a whole. A particular sport may be understood as constituting the athlete, in the sense that, as formalism suggests, without the rules of sport, particular sporting actions, and thus the sporting agent him or herself, are not possible. The athlete is not simply the agent, but rather the agent shaped and focused in terms of specific, lusory, goals. Here already is a glimpse of an alternative to modernity’s superficial entwining of work and play. The athlete must work for their success, but they do so in the face of a profound risk of failure and suffering. To mediate work and play is not then simply to sugar the pill of work, but rather to engage seriously in an arbitrary contest that entails confronting the universal vulnerability of the human being. It is through this personal confrontation that sport is manifest. The athlete thereby comes close to being Pickstock’s ‘middle-voiced’ agent of liturgy,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-0953946811428263">45</xref></sup> where liturgy offers a subtle transformation of the position of agency in modernity. That agency was described above as a ‘cyberintelligence’, as agents flourish only through their adaption to the rules of social systems. The middle-voiced agent of liturgy is similarly shaped and made possible by rules, albeit those of the liturgy. The subject is mediated by liturgical practice. The athlete stands between the two extremes of the meaninglessness of modern systems and the universality of liturgy, in so far as he or she chooses their sport. The rules of any given sport may be arbitrary and as such make no substantive claim to a universal truth. The agent has, nonetheless, made a voluntary decision to be constituted in terms of them. There is here a suggestion of authenticity. Sport as a universal implies that there is for the individual athlete the possibility, if not the requirement, to choose the sport that tests them most profoundly, be this test physical, mental or moral. A comparison between the athlete and the actor is invited. The athlete, unlike the actor, does not merely adopt a role or persona. Pickstock, in her criticism of art in terms of its ultimate divorce from mundane practice, observes that the actor’s identification with their character is always ironic. The actor can always step away from the character, and what happens to the character does not happen to the actor. Hamlet dies, yet the actor escapes unharmed.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-0953946811428263">46</xref></sup> Precisely the same argument has been made by David Best in a criticism of the identification of sport and art.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-0953946811428263">47</xref></sup> The point here is that, once constituted as an athlete, the agent will suffer the consequences of the athlete’s actions. Agent and athlete are identified in a way in which actor and character can never be. So, if the athlete wins, the agent celebrates, but if the athlete fails, it is the agent who is humiliated. The athlete risks real injury and even death upon the sports field. There is an embodied vulnerability in sport at which theatre and art can only hint. In that sport is a career or even vocation, defeat can represent the waste of months or years of training. At its extreme, it is the waste of youth, if (as is more likely than not) early promise is not fulfilled. Here is the first hint of sport as negative liturgy—for sport is ultimately about humanity’s failure before the tests it sets itself.</p>
<p>Athletes play matches, and so sport is necessarily manifest in particular matches and contests. Most matches are ultimately forgettable. They are ephemera that readily succumb to empty repetition and the spatialisation of time. Yet, in their very performance, they hold open the possibility of something exceptional. The match is the context within which the athlete excels (or, indeed, in which they fail spectacularly). Crucially here, excellence is not to be understood quantitatively. Excellence is not mere record breaking. Mohammed Ali’s ‘rumble in the jungle’ against George Foreman broke no records, but Ali’s extraordinary ‘dope on the rope’ tactic explored great depths of human endurance and psychological strength. Similarly, there was little exceptional about Manchester City’s 3–1 win in the 1956 FA Cup final, apart from the fact the goalkeeper Bert Trautmann played the last 15 minutes with a broken neck. Excellence may further be understood in terms of the match’s occurrence within a specific historical and cultural setting. (It is this aspect of sport that formalism tends to neglect.) All matches occur at a particular point in a season, at a particular point in a player’s career, or more importantly at a particular point in a nation’s or global history. Every match thus has, thanks to its historical context, the possibility to be more than ephemera. Thus, Suzanne Lenglen, Billy Jean King, and Hassiba Boulmerka, in their different ways and against different cultural backgrounds, challenged preconceptions of gender and gender politics. The boxing matches between Joe Louis and Max Schmelling in the 1930s could not but come to symbolise the political differences between democratic America and Nazi Germany. West Germany’s victory in the 1954 World Cup equally symbolised the country’s rehabilitation as a European nation.</p>
<p>Such examples—and they are innumerable<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn48-0953946811428263">48</xref></sup>—still ground sport in local narratives. Something more telling occurs in other examples. In 1942, FC Start, a team formed of forced labourers from the Kiev bakeries, played a select German XI, in what has come to be known as the Death Match. FC Start won 5–3, despite the brutal tactics of the Germans and the bias of the referee. Humiliating the Germans placed the FC Start players’ lives at risk (and all were subsequently arrested, tortured and sent to labour camps). Crucially, FC Start played sport, living up to the ideal, with extraordinary courage, in the face of Nazi brutality. That is to say that, despite the obvious risks, FC Start respected the demands of sport as such, and their story thus aspires to something greater than a local narrative. Sport thereby begins to comment upon the human condition, in all its glory and viciousness. Something similar, albeit less tragic for the players involved, happened when the NY Yankees failed to win the 2001 World Series. The Arizona Diamondbacks paid New York the ultimate compliment, and did not let the local narrative of 9/11 interfere with their commitment to sport. But such an outcome is uncomfortable, for there would have seemed to be an intuitive justice in a Yankee win. The Yankees represented a beleaguered and wounded America, and their defeat frustrates a good story.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn49-0953946811428263">49</xref></sup></p>
<p>The example of the Yankees’ defeat highlights sport’s place as transcendence, and as negative liturgy. Sport can give meaning to human life, and not merely in the illusion offered by spectacle, and anti-liturgy liturgy. Imbuing the discipline of work with the playful universality of sport can offer a genuine alternative to such illusions, albeit perhaps typically in the form of local narratives. More profoundly, if sport refuses the spectacle’s concentration on winners and triumphs, and seeks to embrace defeat and failure too, then it forces a confrontation with the potential meaninglessness and contingency of life. Losses, such as that of the Yankees, resist easy story-telling, and perhaps force one to accept and bear real suffering. Losses may make no sense, and nor do years of wasted training or teenage athletes having nervous breakdowns because of pressures to compete. Ultimately, all athletes face defeat, as their bodies become incapable of responding to the demands placed upon them. Even victory itself is ephemeral—although this is what spectacle would seek to conceal. Next season there will be another champion, and what is so special about this year’s victory fades in the memory, or is lost in an empty repetition of the same. Yet, sport invites us to live, rather than merely narrate, that meaninglessness, and equality to live a yearning for meaning, carrying on in the face of suffering and vulnerability. This occurs not simply at the level of the elite athlete, albeit that their stories are better known. The fun runner who struggles through cramp, or falls exhausted a hundred yards from the finishing line of a half-marathon, has lived and practiced that same confrontation with what it is to be human, just as has the club tennis player, golfer or Sunday league soccer player in experiencing their endless defeats and frustrations alongside their personal triumphs.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>If contemporary society is to be understood in terms of the dominance of an anti-liturgy liturgy, as Pickstock suggests, then sports at once participate in that dominance, and offer a moment of resistance against it. While historically sport may have emerged from liturgical practices, modern society appears to have stripped sport of any extrinsic, let alone transcendent, meaning. A sport is constituted from a largely contingent set of rules, with its purpose remaining intrinsic to that rules system. Sports may then readily be reduced to spectacles that offer only an illusion of meaning. This occurs not merely in the excitement of the particular game, but also the cycle of the season and the accumulative history of the sport. Sport is at its most insidious as spectacle when it submits to division and exclusion, and to a narrow obsession with achievement (and in particular quantitatively measured achievements such as records). Yet, even at the level of spectacle, sport responds to a yearning for meaning in modern life. Its very popularity may be taken to be grounded in an obscure recognition of the lack of transcendent meaning.</p>
<p>It has been argued above that sport, as a universal, is an ideal that offers this moment of transcendence, and thus it is here that the yearning manifest in spectacle is transfigured. If sport per se is understood as an open and creative testing of embodied human capacities, and if such testing entails the genuine risk of failure on the part of participants, then sport offers a unique engagement with both the potential and the vulnerability of the human being. The repetitive cycle of matches keeps present the possibility of the exceptional expression of that engagement. As negative liturgy, sport reveals not merely the capacity for achievement, but demands that humanity confronts the meaninglessness of defeat and failure, and the transitory nature of victory. To focus, as spectacle tends to do, upon the moment of victory, is to limit the perspective of sport, and to deny both participants and spectators the possibility of living its more profound challenge. Perhaps even simple acts, such as long-term loyalty to a club or devotion to the practice of a sport, through victories and defeats, are indicative of the human strength to confront adversity and to strive for meaning. The mechanical repetition of the next season is thereby transfigured into the recognition of the possibility of a hoped-for transcendence.</p>
