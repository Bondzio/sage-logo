<p>According to Nigel Biggar, recent Christian ethics has been characterised by a rift between two competing lines of thought. On the one hand, Biggar notes, there are those Christian ethicists (they are often labelled ‘conservative’) who take the Bible and the traditions of Christian moral thought very seriously, but who often fail to speak to the wider world. Instead, they consider it more important to develop an alternative and specifically-Christian ethos within the churches. In this regard, Biggar refers to Barth (who is an important source of inspiration for Biggar) and to post-Barthian Christian ethical thinking. On the other hand, there are those Christian ethicists (those who are often labelled ‘liberal’) who address the world outside the churches, but who often lack ‘biblical and theological seriousness’ and who, as a result, easily end up with simply repeating ‘current liberal-left common sense’ (p. xvii). As examples of this second trend, Biggar refers to <italic>Faith in the City</italic> and <italic>Changing Britain</italic>, two documents published by the Church of England in the second part of the 1980s. The aim of Biggar’s <italic>Behaving in Public</italic> is therefore to steer a middle course between these two one-sided options and to find a way of doing Christian ethics with biblical and theological seriousness while also engaging in public debate.</p>
<p>Biggar develops his argument in five chapters. In chapter 1, he begins by mentioning the growing attention and concern of post-World War II Christian ethicists for that which makes Christian ethics specifically Christian, namely its <italic>theological</italic> dimension. Moreover, Biggar adds, there has been an increasing awareness among Christian ethicists that it is not enough to simply have an ethics with a religious or theological dimension (for instance, a reference to creation or Jesus’ exemplary love) in order to have a full-blown <italic>Christian</italic> ethics. Rather, ethics can only be considered as Christian when it is, as Biggar puts it, ‘governed by the <italic>whole</italic> [Christian] story, including those christological and eschatological parts of it that attest the salvific presence of God in history and in its conclusion’ (p. 3). In this regard, Biggar speaks of ‘theological <italic>narrative</italic> integrity’ (p. 3, original italics). He subscribes to the importance of this integrity, but also adds that integrity has to be distinguished from distinctiveness. The latter can and often will be the result of the former, but it should not be a goal in itself. There is no reason the church should always differ from ‘the world’. Moreover, it is also important to allow for sufficient distance between theology and moral argument because theology often does not offer a ready-made answer in particular cases. Therefore, it is important to allow for the contribution of common sense and non-theological reflection. Or, as Biggar puts it, Christian ethics is more than ‘the squeezing of dogmatic tenets for the juice of ethical concepts, leaving to others the task of figuring out how these generic or specific concepts should bear on concrete conduct and issue in particular judgments’ (p. 22).</p>
<p>At the outset of chapter 2, Biggar returns to the point that distinctiveness should not be a goal in itself for Christian ethics. On the contrary, there are many situations in which Christians and non-Christians can find common ethical ground, and there is nothing objectionable about that. In this context, Biggar falls back on the concept of ‘natural law’, which he interprets as meaning ‘that there is a form of flourishing that is given in and with the nature of human being’ and ‘that reflection on human nature can [therefore] achieve an understanding of that flourishing and its component basic goods’ (pp. 41-42). To put it differently, human beings are capable of knowing what is good, virtuous, and right by natural means alone. Or, at least, they are able to know the good to some extent in that way, though not fully. This is why, despite natural law, revelation is not ethically redundant at all. For it is only in light of God’s salvific action towards humankind that these natural goods receive their full significance. This also implies, Biggar adds, that every consensus between Christians and non-Christians is provisional and partial. He explains this assertion by opposing Augustine to John Rawls. Consensus between Christians and non-Christians is, <italic>pace</italic> Rawls, not the finding of a common minimal denominator, not the discovery of some universal core that can be had in isolation from Christianity, but precisely a consequence of the fact that all human beings <italic>qua</italic> created—or, to put it in Augustinian terms, as inhabitants of the earthly city—share some common interests. However, from Biggar’s Augustinian perspective, this consensus in the earthly city can never be a goal in itself because earthly life is not the ultimate horizon of human existence. As a result, any this-worldly consensus among human beings on what it means to be good, just, etc. always remains subjected to the ultimate realisation of the goodness that is beyond our grasp as long we live in the earthly city.</p>
<p>After arguing that Christians should engage in dialogue on ethical matters with non-Christians, and should even look for consensus with them (although always a provisional and occasional one), Biggar begins chapter 3 by raising the issue of ‘the proper nature of Christian participation in public deliberation about ethical matters’ (p. 45). The bulk of chapter 3 deals with the question of whether or not the ‘public’ in contemporary Western democracies is ‘secular’. Biggar proceeds by way of a discussion and criticism of the claim put forward by the German philosopher Jürgen Habermas, that publics <italic>are</italic> and <italic>should</italic> be secular. This means, in Biggar’s reading of Habermas, that public debate should be conducted in purely secular terms and that religious people are therefore expected to ‘translate’ their religious convictions in such a way that they become understandable to those citizens who do not share them. Biggar offers three reasons Habermas has for defending this view. First, there is the fact that contemporary Western societies are predominantly non-religious, and as a result, religious idiom is unintelligible for a majority of the citizens. From this immediately follows a second reason: given the fact that religious people are only a minority in society, it is a matter of respect and fairness that religious minorities translate their religious convictions in non-religious terms. A third reason for the necessity of translating religious language is the requirement that the State should remain neutral vis-à-vis worldviews and can therefore not allow religious arguments to play a role in public debate. Allowing such arguments to enter public debate ‘untranslated’ threatens to undermine political stability. Chapter 3 of Biggar’s book basically amounts to an argument against these three reasons. With regard to the first reason, Biggar defends that ‘it cannot be presumed that a democratic majority [in contemporary Western societies] is impervious or hostile to religious discourse’ (p. 55) and that therefore ‘a genuinely <italic>descriptive</italic> sociology of Western democracies currently does not recommend…a political rhetoric that supresses theology as such’ (p. 56, original italics). When it comes to the second reason, Biggar wonders why the respect and fairness requested by Habermas only implies that believers should respect non-believers by ‘translating’ their religious idiom. Why is the reverse not also required? And finally, with regard to the third reason, Biggar defends the position that political stability does not require a public language purged of all religious references, and moreover, that such a ‘neutral public language’ is an impossible ideal, something which ‘is simply not to be had’ (p. 61).</p>
<p>Having shown that there are no reasons to ban religion and theology from the public sphere, Biggar tackles in chapter 4 the issue of how theological arguments should ‘behave’ in public. He does this in two steps. First, Biggar deals with <italic>what</italic> is said. In this regard, he points out that it is important to take into account to which audience one is speaking. For instance, whether one is talking to an ecclesial or secular public. Second, Biggar also draws attention to <italic>the way</italic> something is said. In this context, he presents a ‘moral ideal of conversation’ (p. 75). This ideal comprises virtues such as docility, tolerance, respect, benevolence, critical candour, patience (except in the face of ‘grave and shameless vice’ [p. 75]), willingness to forgive and readiness to repent. But, as Biggar emphasises, these virtues are not an alien imposition on Christianity; to the contrary, they are deeply motivated by the Christian tradition.</p>
<p>In his last chapter, Biggar makes explicit the ecclesiological presuppositions behind the previous four chapters. Already in chapter 1, Biggar noted that Christian ethics is not merely an intellectual affair, but that it is also serving a community, the church (see p. 6). Now, Biggar adds that it is important not to oppose ‘Church’ and ‘the world’ too rigidly, and to keep in mind that the true church may be present outside the visible church (p. 82). This, Biggar concludes, invites those belonging to the visible church to remain open to those who are outside of its walls. However, Biggar also stresses that this openness should not keep the church from proclaiming the gospel or from making explicit what it considers to be the truth. Finally, Biggar concludes his book by characterising his position in terms of a British-Anglican Barthian Thomism. The noun ‘Thomism’ is chosen because of the importance Biggar attributes to the doctrine of creation, which, in his view, implies that there is a natural law, a natural order, that can be known by human beings to some extent (see above). The adjective ‘Barthian’ qualifies the importance of the doctrine of creation by adding that the Christ event both clarifies and fulfils this natural order. Beyond this, ‘British-Anglican’ is further added because Biggar considers experience to ‘be formative of moral reasoning’ and to ‘exercise a kind of legitimate moral authority’ (p. 111), an ‘empirical bent’ (p. 111) which he takes to be ‘a typically British, Anglican turn’ (p. 110).</p>
<p>Biggar’s <italic>Behaving in Public</italic> has much to commend: his attempt to combine theological/biblical seriousness and openness to the world, his innovative ideal of conversation, and his distinction between the visible and the true church, which itself implies that Christians should be open to the truth that comes from outside, but without giving up on proclamation and witness. In this way, Biggar offers an alternative to one-sidedness and polarisation. However, while I fully agree with Biggar that there is no reason publics should be considered secular, I remained puzzled as to his precise view on the neutrality of the State. The reason for this is that there is a certain discrepancy between Habermas’s third reason (as quoted by Biggar on p. 59) and the way Biggar responds to it (on p. 61). On p. 59, Biggar mentions the requirement ‘that state power must be neutral with regard to worldviews’, but on p. 61 he only speaks about the impossibility of a ‘neutral public language’ <italic>and</italic> about the impossibility of having a ‘public space free of persistent conflict’. What does this twofold impossibility mean for the role of the State and its possible neutrality? Closely connected to this ambiguity is the following concern: Biggar mentions that contemporary Western democracies are ‘plural’ or ‘polyglot’, yet it is unclear how far this fundamental insight has truly affected the content of his book. Specifically, I am struck by the fact that Biggar gives hardly any reference to the presence of multiple religions in our democracies and no reflection on what this might mean for the neutrality of the State. So, my most important question for Biggar after reading his <italic>Behaving in Public</italic> would be this: Should the State be neutral? Can it be neutral? And if not, in which way can it be committed to a particular religion or worldview without disadvantaging adherents of other worldview traditions?</p>
