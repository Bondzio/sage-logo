<abstract>
<p>Compensation &amp; Benefits packages in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries, despite some local nuances, follow some common characteristics. Most of the population is made of “expatriates”, mostly hired on local contracts. The local nationals often represent a small fraction of the overall population and tend to work in highly-paid and prestigious government jobs. The local governments are making efforts to promote the employment of their citizens in the private sector, which is often a challenge due to cultural and financial reasons. Packages, even though under local law, are focused on cash and built similarly to international assignee packages: basic pay, various allowances from housing to transportation, education or furniture. Benefits such as pension and subsidized healthcare may be mandated for local Nationals, and more rarely offered to expatriates. Variable pay is less prominent than in Western countries, whether in the form of Short- or Long-Term Incentives.</p>

<p>There is a high level of interest, and few reliable sources, on compensation, benefits and related work life practices in the Middle East and specifically the countries that have joined to form the political and economic organization, Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0886368713485040">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0886368713485040">2</xref></sup> The GCC includes the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman, United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Qatar.</p>
<p>The GCC countries have many commonalities in the way they approach compensation, so unless specified otherwise, comments related to the UAE also apply to the other GCC countries. This article provides an overview of the common practices.</p>
<sec id="section1-0886368713485040">
<title>The Workforce</title>
<p>Depending on the state, local nationals in the population account for 10% to possibly a maximum 15% of the total. The balance of the workforce are expatriates, commonly referred to as “expats.”</p>
<p>In the rest of the world, an expat is usually someone who, temporarily or permanently, works and resides in a country other than that of his or her passport. In many cases, expats are maintained in the social security and retirement system of their home country.</p>
<p>The first major difference to understand about the GCC is that all expats are actually recruited on local contract terms and not maintained on their home country social system.</p>
<p>So all employees have a UAE or Bahrain or Qatar . . . local contract.</p>
<p>The average duration of employment for an expat in these countries is just a few years (a government source in Abu Dhabi suggested it is 3 years), even though some anecdotal evidence suggests that given the current bad economic climate, there is a trend toward longer durations in-country.</p>
<p>Population numbers are notoriously hard to come by and not always accurate in the region. Here are the latest demographic estimates: There are 3.62 million expatriates in Dubai versus 864,000 nationals. That breakdown is apparently typical. Roughly 65% of the country populations in the region are younger than 30 years.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that local nationals constitute such a small part of the overall society, in many ways, there are several challenges to their employment. The vast majority of them are employed in government jobs or in semigovernmental organizations (which are subject to private sector laws but fully owned, directly or indirectly, by the government.)</p>
<p>“Emiratization”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0886368713485040">3</xref></sup> or “nationalization,” “saudization,”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0886368713485040">4</xref></sup> “omanization”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0886368713485040">5</xref></sup> and other such terms refer to the process by which the local governments are pushing for more Nationals to work in the private sector.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0886368713485040">6</xref></sup> Mostly, this happens through the institution of more or less strictly enforced target quotas of locals within the total workforce of the private companies. But there are quite a number of obstacles<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0886368713485040">7</xref></sup> that even with the best of intentions (although that is not always the case), private companies encounter when they try to recruit nationals in the GCC:</p>
<list id="list1-0886368713485040" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>The first and most visible one is the fact that contrary to what happens in the rest of the world, pay for government jobs<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0886368713485040">8</xref></sup> in the GCC is significantly higher than pay in the private sector. It’s often 2 to 3 times higher, especially for entry-level positions. That factor alone significantly reduces the attractiveness of the private sector for the nationals.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Next, there are cultural factors linked to the quality, or lack thereof, of the vast majority of the local education systems.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0886368713485040">9</xref></sup> For instance, in the UAE, about 15% of young males are high school dropouts.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0886368713485040">10</xref></sup></p></list-item>
<list-item><p>A high percentage of nationals do not speak adequate English and lack the skills<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0886368713485040">11</xref></sup> to fully participate in the working life of the private sector. Since workforces are often characterized by a multitude of nationalities, English is therefore required (contrary to the daily life in many governmental departments).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Females represent the vast majority of university students in the GCC, yet they are underrepresented in the workplace. This is a large untapped talent pool,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0886368713485040">12</xref></sup> which continues to hinder the growth of the region.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The GCC countries are very recent nations, and the younger workers often lack role models in the family since their parents or grandparents do not or have not worked in the private sector. Steering young workers toward jobs in private companies therefore requires educating entire families.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Also, there are productivity considerations. The private sector requires longer working hours and has higher performance expectations than in the government. There is also, usually, less vacation time and fewer public holidays. Furthermore, in some of the GCC countries, nationals will not consider working in certain professions that are deemed “unworthy.” This includes, for example, mechanics, waitressing, retail jobs and so on, although there are some nationals working as taxi drivers in Bahrain (all taxi drivers in Oman are locals as this is a protected job).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>At the same time, GCC nationals tend to expect very frequent promotions and increase in responsibilities, not necessarily based on realistic expectations of individual performance, availability of jobs and/or time needed to learn and acquire the needed maturity for certain positions. The career expectations are often based primarily on their nationality.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Finally, there is sometimes a level of ambiguity<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0886368713485040">13</xref></sup> shared by some local nationals, who are reluctant to accept the idea that expats are essential to fill all the jobs needed to sustain the economic growth of their country. They may harbor some resentment over the perceived erosion of their traditional values and lifestyle.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>For these reasons, it is not always easy for private companies to hire nationals. A few years ago, for example, after a career fair, a company received resumes from 1,000 UAE nationals. This was a UAE-owned, very well-respected, rapidly growing private company that offered many career opportunities. However, in the end only 3 accepted a job offer.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0886368713485040">
<title>Cash Compensation Packages</title>
<p>Everyone is hired on a local contract, whether he or she is a local national or an expatriate. And everyone, including the nationals, has the same kind of package.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0886368713485040">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0886368713485040">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>Base salary, depending on the grade of the employee, represents 47% to 60% of the overall package. Allowances, which usually represent 22% to 37% of the package, are guaranteed and paid to everyone. Annual variable pay typically represents 10% of the total package, including executives. Long-term incentives are virtually nonexistent, representing on average less than 1% of the total pay of executives. Benefits complete the picture and usually account for around 8% of the total. (These numbers are based on Mercer’s global online training.)</p>
<p>Thus, there are considerable differences from the typical European or U.S. compensation package, which typically offer no allowances for local contract workers, higher short-term variable pay, eligibility for long-term incentives and higher benefits (at least in Europe).</p>
<p>Allowances generally cover housing, transportation and utilities. They are mostly paid in cash, with the possible exception of housing, which may also be provided in the form of a company-provided accommodation (this is common in the airline and hospitality industries or for laborers) or company-paid rental contracts. In recent years, there has been a movement toward the introduction of a single allowance covering living expenses, although the majority of companies still provide and monitor multiple allowances. Education and annual flight tickets are also provided for the employees and their families and are considered either compensation or benefits depending on how they are paid (as an allowance or as a reimbursement of expenses—with or without cap).</p>
<p>In the UAE, local nationals are eligible for all allowances, as well as to some legally mandated allowances (children and social allowances). They are also eligible for a cash equivalent of the annual airfare even though they do not have to fly home every 1 or 2 years.</p>
<p>There is a strong sense of social hierarchy reflected in salaries and allowances, with different (read: usually higher) payments for UAE nationals compared with expats in the same grade. In some cases, employers maintain different salary scales based on nationality, similar to a caste system. This latter practice is becoming less common, however.</p>
<p>Except for U.S. citizens and green card holders, compensation packages are currently tax-free in the GCC, and the overall pay is significantly higher than in the home country, while living costs covering many items, such as cars, gas, food or house personnel (maid, driver), are comparatively low. Restaurant or prepared food and wine (except in Kuwait and Saudi where alcohol is banned) and quality housing, on the other hand, are relatively expensive.</p>
<p>All of this makes it important to remember that when an employee is transferred to one of the GCC countries, there is no need to equalize or apply a COLA (coca-colanization) to their package. Benchmarking to local pay practices is the best policy.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0886368713485040">
<title>Benefits</title>
<p>Nationals receive a pension<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0886368713485040">16</xref></sup> and free social security. The pension schemes would be considered extremely generous in the Western world, with the maximum defined benefit based on a very limited numbers of years of contributions (15-20 years) and younger retirement ages. The pension is usually funded by a combination of employee, employer and government contributions. GCC nationals have their pension contributions transferred to their national system<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0886368713485040">17</xref></sup> even when they are employed in other GCC states.</p>
<p>Expats typically get an End of Service (EOS) payment<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0886368713485040">18</xref></sup> of around 1 month of basic pay per year of service, with a typical cap of 2 years of basic pay. The EOS is funded through employer contributions and is meant to be a form of financial fund for retirement even though the amounts are much more limited than traditional Western government or private pension plans.</p>
<p>All employees may get medical cover (though it is not legally mandated everywhere and therefore not always provided), life insurance, sometimes disability and, rarely, private retirement/long-term savings opportunities.</p>
<p>For expats coming from the Western world, there is only token protection in the event of job loss compared with most home countries; labor laws provide minimum protection. Workers can expect only 1 month’s notice and at the end of which, if there is no new work contract, they have to leave the country. Trade unions are illegal in most GCC countries. Cultural norms are also very different, for example, there is no concept of accepting defaulted payments, and bounced checks mean a prison sentence.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0886368713485040">
<title>Variable Pay</title>
<p>Target annual incentive awards are lower than in Europe or the United States. Maximum payouts or stretch payouts are also lower than in Europe and the United States.</p>
<p>This is mostly due to cultural reasons related to the application or interpretation of performance management. There is a general reluctance to initiate a rigorous assessment of individual performance because of the importance of saving face in the local culture. As a result, bonus payouts often are based on an even distribution of a pool of money or take the form of profit-sharing types of schemes (e.g., similar to <italic>intéressement</italic> in France). However, the practice of pay for performance is growing in the region.</p>
<p>There are also very few long-term incentive plans (LTIPs), although this is a recent trend in the financial services industry. This is due primarily to international governance practices, especially in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait because these financial markets are a bit more sophisticated. There are two main reasons for the low numbers of LTIPs outside of multinationals:</p>
<list id="list2-0886368713485040" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Foreigners usually cannot own stock/equity in the GCC markets.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The market is dominated by government-owned companies, which means there are no shares to distribute. The rest of the large private companies are mostly family owned. Typically, this kind of organization does not like diluting its decision-making power.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0886368713485040">19</xref></sup> Their top management often comprises family members.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>As a result, LTIPs tend to be distributed in cash in the region.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0886368713485040">
<title>Living and Working in the Region</title>
<p>As an employer, there are a number of things to be aware when sending an employee to work in the GCC or setting up a branch there.</p>
<p>The first thing to remember is that these are Muslim countries. Some of the GCC states, for example, the UAE and Bahrain, are more open to the ways of the West, whereas other countries like Kuwait and Saudi Arabia fully ban alcohol and pork and exercise strict censorship of TV programs. In all of them, however, Islam-compliant rules apply and, in particular, mean the following:</p>
<list id="list3-0886368713485040" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>No visa for the girlfriend of an employee or for a same-sex partner (cohabitation relationships outside of wedding are not allowed, and homosexuality is illegal)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>No visas for the children of a single mother (children of a widow can get a visa, as well as those of a divorced mother)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Though not impossible, a woman may not be able to sponsor her husband (i.e., to obtain a residence visa) if he is unemployed as it is considered normal that the male should be the main if not only breadwinner. The minimum income necessary for a female to be eligible to sponsor her husband is more than 3 times higher than the minimum income required of a male to sponsor his wife and children.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The holy month of Ramadan has a massive impact on the rhythm of business, with the working hours officially reduced during the month. It is impossible to eat, drink or smoke in public (restaurants are closed during the day).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Male–female interactions are more formal than in the West, and there is less social mixing in the local society between men and women if they are not closely related or married.</p></list-item>
</list>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0886368713485040">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The GCC is an interesting region to live and work. Its economic growth originated in its oil reserves, but each of the member states is making efforts to diversify the economy and develop something unique.</p>
<p>As a Western expat, I have always felt welcome and safe in the area (caveat: I have never been to Saudi Arabia due to its restrictions on female travel). I strongly believe there is a place for everyone if expats believe in growing and developing the skills of the local talent. Finally, from an HR standpoint, one can notice the following:</p>
<list id="list4-0886368713485040" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>The market is eager for value-added, innovative solutions even if most don’t understand what these solutions could be or entail.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>There is a need for intensive education to gain acceptance for modern HR practices, especially in small, local companies and government entities.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The region has a need for more effective compensation, benefit and performance management practices in these growing economies.</p>

<title>Author Biography</title>
<p><bold>Sandrine Bardot</bold> has spent the past 18 years supporting compensation and benefits for multinationals such as France Telecom, Philips, Microsoft and Apple, focusing on the Europe, Middle East and Africa. She has been an expat for about half her career. Her previous role was leading Compensation and Benefits for a regional GCC conglomerate, based in Dubai and covering 17,000 employees in 14 countries. After establishing Performance &amp; Reward as a prominent function within the Human Capital department at Mubadala in Abu Dhabi, she set up her consultancy in Dubai. She now provides C&amp;B and Performance Management education, advice and consulting in innovative formats across the GCC. Three times a week, Sandrine authors a blog, Compensation Insider, in which she shares her thoughts on compensation, benefits, emiratization, global mobility, performance management, corporate governance and any other topic she wishes to cover. The link that follows provides further information on how the Reward and HR functions can support emiratization and nationalization in the GCC (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://compensationinsider.com/emiratisation-101/">http://compensationinsider.com/emiratisation-101/</ext-link>).</p>
