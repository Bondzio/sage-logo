<p>63.4001 AHRAM, Ariel I. — <bold>Concepts and measurement in multimethod research</bold>. <italic>Political Research Quarterly</italic> 66(2), June 2013: 280–291.</p>
<p>This article argues that concept misformation and conceptual stretching undermine efforts to combine qualitative and quantitative methods in multimethod research (MMR). Two related problems result from the mismatch of qualitatively and quantitatively construed concepts. Mechanism muddling occurs when differences in the connotation of qualitatively and quantitatively construed concepts embed different causal properties into conceptual definitions. Conceptual slippage occurs when qualitatively and quantitatively construed concepts use incompatible nominal, ordinal, or radial scales. Instead of gaining leverage from the synthesis of large- and small-N analysis, these problems can push MMR in two diametrically opposed directions, emphasizing one methodological facet at the cost of the other.

<p>The author studies how political parity between men and women has been adopted in some of the main democratic systems, common-law models and continental law models, with special attention to the US, the UK, Belgium, France, Italy, Sweden, Norway and Denmark. Women's presence in Parliaments is examined, the principal reasons for it, and the constitutional debates concerning it. The conclusion is that the political parties has been the main factor of change, and also of same backward steps. [R]</p>

<p>Before 1950, IR was a thoroughly interdisciplinary field. Geographers played a key role in the early development of IR, although they are now little known within the discipline that they helped to found. This article explores the pioneering work of three geographers in IR — Isaiah Bowman, Halford J. Mackinder and Derwent Whittlesey — and sets out to reclaim a lost chapter in the history of IR that questions the tendency to reduce IR to a conflict between realism and idealism. [R]</p>
<p>63.4004 AUCHTER, Jessica — <bold>Border monuments: memory, counter-memory, and (b)ordering practices along the US-Mexico border</bold>. <italic>Review of International Studies</italic> 39(2), Apr. 2013: 291–311.</p>
<p>This article explores the ordering mechanisms of statecraft through an examination of how the dead bodies of undocumented migrants pose a resistance to these mechanisms. I first lay out my conception of statecraft and the bordering practices involved in this specific context, then address the memorialization of undocumented immigrants who lost their lives crossing the border. The article [considers] anonymous desert gravesites and small desert cemeteries haunted by the specters of immigration. It explores the contestation surrounding memorialization of death through the monument, the narratives of anonymity surrounding the memorialization of undocumented immigrants, and the counter-memory discourses that emerge in an effort to rewrite the meaning of these migrant deaths. These counter-memorial discourses posit desert border monuments as a threat to statecraft because they cannot be situated within the (b)ordering mechanisms of the state. [R, abr.]</p>
<p>63.4005 BAEKGAARD, Martin; JENSEN, Carsten — <bold>Mass media and party divergence in multiparty systems</bold>. <italic>Scandinavian Political Studies</italic> 36(2), June 2013: 137–152.</p>
<p>Do the mass media affect the dispersion of the policy positions of political parties? This article argues that the mass media polarize parties’ policy positions because vote-seeking strategies are more viable if party policy positions are clearly communicated to the electorate and because a vote-seeking strategy corresponds with parties taking a distinct policy position away from the median. Hence, the main hypothesis is that party policy position dispersion is larger with more mass media penetration. In order to test this argument, a novel dataset on party positions and mass media penetration in 267 Danish municipalities in 2004 is utilized and a new measure of the dispersion of policy positions in multiparty systems is constructed. The analysis corroborates the article's main hypothesis. [R]</p>

<p>A number of societal and institutional factors enhance the development of a vibrant civil society, such as a country's socio-economic traditions and societal structure, political institutions, or foreign influence. But the question of which one of these factors contributes most to a vibrant civil society still remains unanswered. Using ordinary least-square techniques, this article statistically tests the competing factors with a larg e<italic>-N</italic> design that includes 42 countries. Our dependent variable is the new Civil Society Index, composed of a structural and a value dimension of civil society. In order to examine the causal relationship, we reassess our findings by conducting two case studies on Chile and Russia. The case studies corroborate the causal direction from the quality of political institutions to a stronger civil society. [R, abr.]</p>
<p>63.4007 BARANY, Zoltan — <bold>Armies and revolutions</bold>. <italic>Journal of Democracy</italic> 24(2), Apr. 2013: 62–76.</p>
<p>We know that a revolution's success largely depends on the regular army's response to it. But how will the military react to an uprising? The author argues that it is quite possible to make a highly educated guess, if not an outright prediction, about the generals’ response to a revolution if one knows enough about their army, the state it is supposed to serve, the society in which it exists, and the external environment that affects its actions. His essay gives analysts the tools — in the form of questions that they must ask and answer — that will enable them to provide the most informed assessment possible regarding the army's likely response to a revolution and thus, ultimately, the probable fate of the revolution itself.

<p>63.4008 BARRLING, Katarina — <bold>Exploring the inner life of the party: a framework for analysing elite party culture</bold>. <italic>Scandinavian Political Studies</italic> 36(2), June 2013: 177–199.</p>
<p>This article presents a framework for analyzing party-organizational culture, with a special focus on the elite level. The framework is based on an interpretation of M. Douglas's Grid/Group model, and is empirically supported by an extensive study of the seven party groups in the Swedish parliament. The model identifies two fundamental cultural dimensions: the level of submission by individual group members to the group as a collectivity; and the principle that dictates the distribution of status and prestige within the party (a distribution here correlating with views on knowledge). The study shows that the parties distribute themselves on the cultural map in ways that do not coincide in any straightforward way with other well-known variables of party politics, such as ideology, origin or size.

<p>63.4009 BAUMGARTNER, Frank R. — <bold>Ideas and policy change</bold>. <italic>Governance</italic> 26(2), Apr. 2013: 239–258.</p>
<p>P. Hall's article [“Policy paradigms, social learning and the state,” <italic>Comparative Politics</italic> 25(3), Apr. 1993: 275–296; <italic>Abstr</italic>. 43.3845] came at the same time as a parallel body of literature was developing. I review some literature on policy communities, ideas, and the nature of policy-change before exploring the statistical distribution of budget changes at three levels of aggregation. The similarity of these results suggests that a single process may be at work rather than different processes for first-, second-, and third-order change, as Hall's original formulation has it. As Hall suggests, these processes typically generate only marginal adjustments but occasionally create fundamental change. The degree of discredit to the status quo may be an important unexplored variable in explaining the ability of policy reformers to enact marginal, substantial, or fundamental policy changes. This article shows the similarities of Hall's approach with others that would appear to be starkly contrasting. [R, abr.] [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 63.4016]</p>
<p>63.4010 BELCHIOR, Ana Maria; FREIRE, André — <bold>Is party type relevant to an explanation of policy congruence? Catchall versus ideological parties in the Portuguese case</bold>. <italic>International Political Science Review</italic> 34(3), June 2013: 273–288. [Résumé en français]</p>
<p>The article tests the importance of party type (catch-all versus ideological) for an explanation of levels of intra-party congruence, with a control using the main congruence-assessment methods. The article focuses on the Portuguese party system and makes use of a set of 19 policy issues across two dimensions: socio-economic left-right and libertarian-authoritarian (plus left-right self-placement), which introduces additional controls of the assessment of party-type relevance. As far as we know, such an in-depth analysis of party-type congruence has not been done before. Findings support the notion that Portuguese catch-all parties tend to display higher levels of MP-voter congruence than ideological parties, but the type of policy issue is also relevant: levels of congruence diverge across parties depending on the issue at stake.

<p>63.4011 BERGMAN, Matthew E.; SHUGART, Matthew S.; WATT, Kevin A. — <bold>Patterns of intraparty competition in open-list &amp; SNTV systems</bold>. <italic>Electoral Studies</italic> 32(2), June 2013: 321–333.</p>
<p>Two electoral systems that use “nontransferable preference votes” are commonly used: single nontransferable vote (SNTV) and open-list proportional representation (OLPR). Both systems promote intraparty competition by vote-seeking candidates, but differ on the extent to which the incentives of individual candidates and collective seat-maximizing parties are aligned, or not. We develop “logical models” of expected vote-shares of parties’ first and last winners, and test (and confirm) these models using “symmetric regression” on an original data-set drawn from over 2000 party-district observations in nine countries. The analysis brings us closer to an understanding of the relatively neglected “intraparty dimension” of representation, and allows us to offer some modest suggestions for improving systems of nontransferable preference votes.

<p>63.4012 BERMAN, Sheri — <bold>Ideational theorizing in the social sciences since “Policy paradigms, social learning, and the state”</bold>. <italic>Governance</italic> 26(2), Apr. 2013: 217–237.</p>
<p>In the years since P. Hall's seminal article “Policy paradigms, social learning and the state” [<italic>Comparative Politics</italic> 25(3), Apr. 1993: 275–296; <italic>Abstr</italic>. 43.3845] appeared, the ideational research agenda has expanded enormously, to the point where it now includes everyone from constructivists to rational choice theorists. This article assesses what we have learned about the role of ideas in political life since “Policy paradigms” appeared, analyzes how well social scientists have taken up the challenges and questions “Policy paradigms” put forward, and discusses the strengths and weaknesses of current ideational scholarship. The article concludes that ideational scholars must come up with clearer, more easily agreed-upon definitions of ideational variables, more extensive study of the processes through which ideas become institutionalized and thus able to affect political outcomes over time, and more careful investigations of the ways in which ideas shape or form both actors’ motivations and contexts.

<p>63.4013 BIFULCO, Lavinia — <bold>Citizen participation, agency and voice</bold>. <italic>European Journal of Social Theory</italic> 16(2), May 2013: 174–187.</p>
<p>Citizen participation, by now one of the main topics on the institutional agenda in many European countries, involves different fields of public action, mostly on a local level: social inclusion, urban renewal, development, the environment, health/social services, etc. It still remains, however, vague as a concept with a great variety of actors, procedures and powers involved in its practices. In this scenario, the article asks: what powers and what freedoms are involved in participation? How are they constructed and increased? The article argues how voice is relevant for understanding the many stories of participation, referring to the classic concept of voice formulated by A. Hirschman and the elaborations offered by A. Sen and A. Appadurai in their dialogue over capabilities and capacities. [R]</p>

<p>Research undertaken on student feedback has pointed to the difficulties that students have in understanding written feedback. However, little attention has been given to understanding student views on verbal feedback. This article reports on the findings of verbal feedback practices among 114 History, Politics and IR students obtained from a questionnaire survey. These findings were supported by five in-depth semi-structured interviews. The findings show variance in student views with regard to different aspects of verbal feedback. The research outlines a number of suggestions that assist in developing verbal feedback opportunities further. It is argued that “feedback-dialogues” provide a mechanism for improving student understanding of feedback. [R]</p>
<p>63.4015 BLOEMRAAD, Irene — <bold>Accessing the corridors of power: puzzles and pathways to understanding minority representation</bold>. <italic>West European Politics</italic> 36(3), 2013: 652–670.</p>
<p>Three major constraints hinder cross-national comparisons: a lack of data on the immigrant origins of political candidates and elected representatives, incomplete public data on the immigrant origins of national populations or electorates, and cross-national differences in the definition of the minority population. This article addresses these methodological difficulties and the conceptual challenges of studying minority representation. Using public data for a number of West European countries and three “Anglo-settler” immigration countries, it elaborates an index to evaluate representational equity and to compare women's and minorities’ presence in national legislatures. The index reveals the limits of a “national models” or simple “electoral rules” framework. Future research should focus on dynamics of group mobilization, ideological contexts and the recruitment practices of political parties. [R] [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 63.4288]</p>
<p>63.4016 BLYTH, Mark — <bold>Paradigms and paradox: the politics of economic ideas in two moments of crisis</bold>. <italic>Governance</italic> 26(2), Apr. 2013: 197–215.</p>
<p>This article argues that there is a paradox at the heart of P. A. Hall's “Policy paradigms, social learning and the state” [<italic>Comparative Politics</italic> 25(3), Apr. 1993: 275–296; <italic>Abstr</italic>. 43.3845] framework stemming from the desire to see both state and society as generative of social learning while employing two different logics to explain how such learning takes place: what I term the “Bayesian” and “constructivist” versions of the policy paradigms causal story. This creates a paradox as both logics cannot be simultaneously true. However, it is a generative paradox insofar as the power of the policy paradigms framework emerges, in part, from this attempt to straddle these distinct positions, producing an argument that is greater than the sum of its parts. In the second part of the article, I discuss the recent global financial crisis, an area where we should see third-order change, but we do no not. That we do not strengthens the case for the constructivist causal story.

<p>We examine respondents’ normative beliefs about the importance of various measures of “good citizenship,” and their relationship to three modes of political engagement (activism, party membership and voting). We find assigning higher importance to paying taxes/obeying the law is negatively linked to all forms of participation, whereas the opposite is true for norms about the importance of voting and being active in associations. Greater emphasis on norms about understanding others and shopping politically is positively associated with political activism but not with more institutional forms of participation. The relationship between norms and participation differs somewhat across nations, with the most differences between Eastern European respondents and those from Western European and Western non-European respondents.

<p>The article examines the main differences and debates among scholars who have dealt with path dependence, analyzing how the topic was initially addressed by historical economic theory and the changes that were introduced once it was incorporated into the debate within political science. In trying to unravel how history matters, important differences arise between scholars in the definition of explanatory mechanisms, in the importance accorded to contingency and in the specification of the types of sequences of events that could be considered as path-dependent.

<p>63.4019 BUSEMEYER, Marius R.; FRANZMANN, Simon T.; GARRITZMANN, Julian L. — <bold>Who owns education? Cleavage structures in the partisan competition over educational expansion</bold>. <italic>West European Politics</italic> 36(3), 2013: 521–546.</p>
<p>The literature on the partisan foundations of education policies leads to ambiguous expectations with regard to the predominant cleavage structures in party competition on this topic. There is disagreement as to whether leftist or rightist parties are responsible for increasing spending on education, while others claim that educational expansion has become a consensual topic. This paper analyzes the cleavage structure of party competition over the topic of educational expansion, relying on data from the Comparative Manifesto Project. It identifies political parties as “issue-owners” and “issue-ignorers,” respectively, and finds considerable variation with regard to cleavage structures of party competition between countries and across time. One tentative conclusion is that policy legacies play an important role in shaping cleavage structures. [R]</p>

<p>Over the past decade a substantial literature has emerged on the concept of political forgiveness and the process of restorative justice. This article argues that importing an idea of forgiveness into political affairs is a mistake. It is not necessary for the promotion of peace and security, and it is has been construed in a way that leans heavily toward Christian conceptions of forgiveness, as is evident in the influence of Desmond Tutu. The article also examines the influence of Hegelian recognition theory in current discussions of the political benefits of forgiveness, and reviews the case of postwar German-Jewish relations, which conformed more closely to traditional Jewish thinking on forgiveness than to the Christian-Hegelian (multicultural) model.

<p>This article introduces the global Pro-Government Militias Database (PGMD). Despite the devastating record of some pro-government groups, there has been little research on why these forces form, under what conditions they are most likely to act, and how they affect the risk of internal conflict, repression, and state fragility. From events in the former Yugoslavia, Iraq, Sudan, or Syria and the countries of the Arab Spring, we know that pro-government militias operate in a variety of contexts. They are often linked with extreme violence and disregard for the laws of war. Yet research, notably quantitative research, lags behind events. We give an overview of the PGMD, a new global dataset that identifies pro-government militias from 1981 to 2007. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>The link between cyberspace and national security is often presented as an unquestionable and uncontested “truth”. However, there is nothing natural or given about this link: It had to be forged, argued, and accepted in the (security) political process. This article explores the constitutive effects of different threat representations in the broader cyber-security discourse. The focus is not solely on discursive practices by “visible” elite actors, but also on how a variety of less visible actors inside and outside of government shape a reservoir of acceptable threat representations that influence everyday practices of cyber-security. Such an approach allows for a more nuanced understanding of the diverse ways in which cyber-security is presented as a national security issue and of the consequences of particular representations.

<p>In [“Candidate genes and political behavior,” <italic>ibid</italic>., 106(1), 2012: 1–34; <italic>Abstr</italic>. 62.2846], we challenged the findings of [J.H. Fowler and C.T. Dawes, “Two genes predict [US] voter turnout,” <italic>Journal of Politics</italic>, 70(3), 2008: 579–594; <italic>Abstr</italic>. 59.1564] (FD) that two genes predict voter turnout as part of a more general critique of “genopolitics”. FD now acknowledge that their finding of a “significant” direct association between MAOA and voting was incorrect, but claim to have replicated their finding of an “indirect” association between 5HTT, self-reported church attendance, and self-reported voting. We show that this finding is likely driven by population stratification and omitted variable bias. We then explain why, from the standpoints of genetics, neuroscience, and evolutionary biology, genopolitics is a fundamentally misguided undertaking; we also respond to FD's charges [about] some of our previous statements.

<p>Recent assaults on foreign-funded civil society groups in Egypt and Russia reflect a worrisome trend: Since 2002, twenty countries have updated their laws to restrict foreign funding to NGOs. Under what conditions do governments set these restrictions in place? Using original data from nearly 100 countries and case studies of regime behavior in East Africa and the former Soviet Union, we find that vulnerable governments restrict foreign support to civil society when they feel vulnerable to domestic challenges. Yet, worries about international retaliation can restrain such behavior if governments believe that clamping down will cost them more than it is worth. [R]</p>

<p>Most utopias are linked by their commitment to a form of enhanced sociability, or more communal form of living, sometimes associated with ideals of friendship, while their dystopian counterparts are substantively connected by the predominance of fear, and the destruction of “society,” as a polar opposite of friendship. These definitions imply a spectrum of both utopian and dystopian plausibility: where enhanced sociability has been maintained for some period, “utopia” has existed, and where the opposite has occurred, as in totalitarianism, “dystopia” can also be used to describe a real state of affairs. Providing a “realistic” concept of both terms in relation to each other, however, raises some contentious issues about whether, for instance, dystopias are created intentionally, or whether dystopia ideologies as such exist.

<p>Despite continuing demographic expansion and anxieties about a range of socio-ecological problems — from the stresses of high-density urban living to climate change, water, energy and food insecurity and loss of biodiversity — there is currently scant consideration of the benefits of population stabilization or decline. Indeed, the problematization of population numbers is widely disavowed or regarded with profound suspicion. Why have we become so reluctant to ask whether we are too many or to countenance policies that might discourage further growth? I identify five discourses — population-shaming, population-skepticism, population-declinism, population-decomposing and population-fatalism — that foreclose public debate and subject them to critical analysis. I end by eliciting signs of a hesitant revival of the population question alongside the enduring potency of silencing discourses. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>This article studies the situation of French IR, both inside French academia and in the global discipline of IR, on the basis of the answers obtained by the fourth TRIP (Teaching, Research, and International Policy) survey to which 3,466 IR scholars from 20 different countries — [including] 101 French IR scholars — participated in September 2011. The answers provided to questions concerning the place of IR in French academia, the so-called French school of IR, multidisciplinarity, French inscription in the global discipline, the link between theory and practice and the effect of language, show an ambiguous picture: there are clear indications that a French IR is emerging, even though some indicators show that this emergence remains partial.

<p>The article seeks to understand the concept of global civil society, through a dialogue between constructivism in International Relations and M. Foucault. The first section is dedicated to discussing about global civil society as a space of agent-structure interaction. The second section treats the concept as a heterogeneous set of non-state agents of global scope. The third section fuses the two parts of the definition. Two defining dimensions of global civil society are proposed: (1) a political space; (2) as a set of agents with specific characteristics. The contemporary context is marked by a huge complexity, so that an approach that precludes binary oppositions, and naturalized and reified ontological boundaries, becomes urgent able to interpret in more adequately social and political relations.

<p>63.4029 COX, Robert Henry; BÉLAND, Daniel — <bold>Valence, policy ideas, and the rise of sustainability</bold>. <italic>Governance</italic> 26(2), Apr. 2013: 307–328.</p>
<p>This article introduces to policy studies the concept of valence, which we define as the emotional quality of an idea that makes it more or less attractive. We argue that valence explains why some ideas are more successful than others, sometimes gaining paradigmatic status. A policy idea is attractive when its valence matches the mood of a target population. Skilled policy entrepreneurs use ideas with high valence to frame policy issues and generate support for their policy proposals. The usefulness of the concept of valence is illustrated with the case of sustainability, an idea that has expanded from the realm of environmental policy to dominate discussions in such diverse policy areas as pension reform, public finance, labor markets, and energy security.

<p>The greater peacefulness of jointly democratic pairs of states is an important finding in research on the causes of war. Here, we outline a set of criteria for evaluating critiques of such robust empirical associations and apply them to two recent articles. M. Mousseau [<italic>Abstr</italic>. 63.4094] claims that contract-intensive economies, as proxied by a measure of life insurance expenditure, account for the democratic peace. However, his research suffers from various problems of analysis and interpretation. We estimate 144 specifications that build from Mousseau's models and control for life insurance expenditures, finding substantial, robust support for the democratic peace. E. Gartzke and A. Weisiger [<italic>Abstr</italic>. 63.4049] claim that the importance of the democratic peace has declined as the proportion of democracies in the international system has increased; but their tests are misspecified and do not address the issue they raise. When these problems are corrected, we find that the peacefulness of democratic pairs has actually increased as the proportion of democracies grew after 1816. [R]</p>

<p>This paper discusses the relationship between authority-production and experience through a consideration of the emergence of certain figures as authorities on particular matters as a result of extraordinary experiences that they have undergone. It argues that analysis of such figures of experiential authority can help us to identify “objectivities”: foundational tenets upon which their authority is based and to which it ultimately refers. With reference to Harry Patch, a veteran of the First World War and Doreen Lawrence, the mother of Stephen Lawrence, who was murdered in a racially motivated attack at a bus stop, I contend that the authority carried by these figures testifies to certain socially produced objectivities which elicit an affective response, an embodied demand that they are listened to.

<p>It is generally acknowledged that we should distinguish representation as such from that which is represented. The referent designates the latter, understood as the thing in itself to which a representation refers. Yet, authors such as M. Saward or F. Ankersmit argue that representation has a constitutive nature; that representation not only reflects reality, but actively creates reality in the sense that it brings about new collective identities. As such, a conceptual tension arises between the notion of the referent and the constitutive nature of representation. I elaborate upon this tension by focusing on Saward's work. To what extent is the referent reconcilable with the constitutive nature of representation? And in what way will the answer to this question affect our conception of politics in general and political representation in particular? [R]</p>

<p>Oil and other natural resources are linked to many undesirable outcomes, such as civil war, autocracy and lack of economic development. Using a state-centered framework for revenue-extraction, we identify why oil should also be linked to another undesirable effect: repression. We argue that repression is less costly where states do not rely on their citizenry for generating revenue, so that these states are more likely than others to use indiscriminate violations of personal integrity rights as a policy tool. We test this argument using a cross-national database with a variety of indicators of oil and fuel rents and personal integrity violations. Across all specifications and different indicators, we find a substantive and significant relationship between a state relying on oil and the violation of personal integrity rights. [R]</p>

Reanalysis of the Fowler and Dawes data by Charney and English, based on four critiques of candidate gene studies, led to the conclusion that neither polymorphism is related to variations in turnout. We conduct an independent test using an original dataset containing 5-HTT data and two separate participation variables: self-reported participation and actual voting records. Our results confirm the original conclusions on 5-HTT, but also support several of the critiques. [R, abr.] [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 63.4044]</p>

<p>In this short response piece, I use the distinction, following C.

The piece takes up J.-L.

Arguing that the concept of the event plays to the heart of our questioning of politics, I spotlight the disruptive and unpredictable space at the cusp of the (as yet) inconceivable threshold of conscious awareness which points towards the space of politics attuned to the molecular beat of habit, affect and plasticity.

<p>This article unravels the perceived dichotomy between universal human and women's rights and apparently misogynist cultural claims and practices. It focuses on the “universal” side of the dichotomy. Recent feminist work has suggested the transformation of both the status and structure of universals. The culture side of the perceived dichotomy is briefly considered and it is suggested that cultural claims often function much like universalist claims, only on a smaller scale, and that the same conditions apply to their invocation in any specific concrete situation that should apply in the case of Western universals. The theoretical considerations are throughout demonstrated using mostly South African examples.

<p>This article examines sending-state compliance with arms embargoes. Arms embargoes are one of the most frequently used types of economic sanctions but they are perceived as one of the least effective. One major problem with arms embargoes, many argue, is sending states’ failure to implement them. Yet studies tend to focus on cases of arms embargo violations, not compliance in the context of arms export practice more broadly. Using a series of new arms embargo variables, I conduct a statistical analysis of the relationship between arms embargoes and small and major conventional arms-transfers from 1981 to 2004. Contrary to popular expectations, I find that arms embargoes on average restrain sending-states’ arms exports. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>This article focuses on a specific political ethos of current developed societies, [which] we call “self-service democracy”. The ethos essentially springs from the technologies, policies, structures and ideas promoting the “individualization trend” in the provision of services as opposed to the allegedly passivizing system of the classical welfare state of the 1970s and the early 1980s. We review the conceptual history of self-service, its current core features, and the forms it has assumed in the political regimes of post-war Western societies. The focus has moved from the services provided by the state to the activities and responsibility of individual citizens and organizations. The article investigates the political implications of this new emphasis on individualized, self-service-centered governance processes for democracy, and democratic participation and representation in particular.

<p>Growing attention is given in IR theory and diplomatic circles to the ambivalent role of religion in world politics.

The most promising approach is the one that concentrates on the transnational projection of religions, connecting it to the way religions address global issues to influence international actors.

<p>We develop a theoretical model to analyze the role of judicial review in preventing tyrannies of the majority. The model identifies conditions under which the court's optimal role may be to allow tyranny of the majority — and the tyrannized minority will be better off as a result. This implication hinges on the timing of two events: lifting a veil of ignorance with respect to who gains and who loses from the policy subject to judicial review, and the revelation of new information (modeled as a random shock) that affects the level of the payoffs generated by that policy. We explain how the model applies to three controversial rulings (<italic>Serrano v. Priest, Kelo v. City of New London, In re Marriage Cases</italic>). [R, abr.]</p>

<p>This paper presents a conceptual framework that makes a distinction between the requirements for the identity-formation and those for recognition. That is done by addressing the N. Fraser vs. A. Honneth debate on how recognition and justice are at stake for “exploited” or “dominated” groups struggling for a fairer distribution of wealth and for better recognition. This debate shows the limits of a theory of recognition for the dominated groups whose identity has been weakened as a result of historical events in which they were targeted for cultural assimilation. We identify an area of though that allows us to consider identity (re)construction of these groups by relying on the case of the Acadians and that of the Aboriginal people. [R]</p>

In that article we showed that variants of the genes 5HTT and MAOA were significantly associated with voter turnout in a sample of 2,300 subjects from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health. Here, we address the critique first by conducting a replication study using an independent sample of 9,300 subjects. This study replicates the gene-environment interaction of the 5HTT gene variant with church attendance, but not the association with MAOA. We then focus on the general argument of the critique, showing that many of its characterizations of the literature in genetics and in political science are misleading or incorrect. We illustrate the ways in which genopolitics has already made a lasting contribution to the field of political science and offer guidelines for future studies in genopolitics.

<p>Electoral institutions should systematically affect the propensity of a country to rely and spend on distributive measures. Employing national data on state aid expenditure and a number of measures across EU countries, the article provides evidence that legislators elected in higher magnitude districts spend less. More interestingly, it shows the interlocking policy effects of electoral institutions. Where high district magnitude is combined with ballot control, party-based voting and pooling, these rules conjunctly dampen politicians’ incentives to cultivate a personal vote and lead to lower spending on, and use of, distributive measures. Where high district magnitude is not combined with these rules, results are inconclusive. With one exception though, if leaders do not have control over the ballot rank, higher magnitude increases reliance on distributive measures. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>Although Latin American political science has become professionalized since the 1980s, many scholars still emigrate for study and employment. Argentines most numerously seek academic careers abroad, while Brazil has many more domestic doctorates and returns home after doctoral studies abroad. Uruguayans emigrate in proportionally high numbers and tend to settle in Latin American countries, while the number of Chileans and Paraguayans abroad is minimal. These contrasting patterns are explained by reference to factors such as the availability of high-quality doctoral courses, financing for postgraduate studies, and the absorptive capacity of national academic markets. Paradoxically, the size and performance of the diasporas may increase rather than reduce the visibility and impact of national political science communities. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>Many of the pioneers of understanding the distinctive dynamics of new digital media platforms — social media and collaborative production — are quite optimistic about the potential for the internet to dramatically increase the quality of democratic governance. On the other hand, some political scientists who have examined actual patterns of political activity and expression on digital platforms come away skeptical that digital platforms will bring equality or inclusion to democratic politics. We develop six models of how digital technologies might affect democratic politics: the empowered public sphere, displacement of traditional organizations by new digitally self-organized groups, digitally direct democracy, truth-based advocacy, constituent mobilization, and crowd-sourced social monitoring. We argue that the first three revolutionary and transformative models are less likely to occur than the second three models. [R, abr.] [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 63.4131]</p>

<p>Perhaps the simplest explanation for where fault lines lie in a political process involves the presence of an “other”. Difference divides and similarity unites. These similarities and differences can in turn orient and propagate conflict. Yet, similarity and difference are also dynamic, evolving in response to changing population characteristics or a new reference point. We offer a simple explanation for interstate conflict in which the salience of similarity or difference varies with the prevalence or capabilities of groups. We apply our argument in the context of the democratic peace. When democracies are scarce or weak, and autocracies plentiful and powerful, democracies face a common threat. As the democratic community strengthens, however, the threat from autocracies declines and differences among democracies appear more salient. Our findings contrast with standard expectations about how democratization shapes world affairs. [R] [See also <italic>Abstr</italic>. 63.4030, 4117]</p>

It supports the view, firmly established over the past 15 years and unrecognized by only one of the books reviewed, that the first massive decline in violent mortality occurred with the emergence of the state-Leviathan. Hobbes was right, and Rousseau was wrong, about the great violence of the human state of nature. The rise of the state-Leviathan greatly reduced in-group violent mortality by establishing internal peace. Less recognized, it also decreased out-group war fatalities. Although state wars appear large in absolute terms, large states actually meant lower mobilization rates and reduced exposure of the civilian population to war. [R, abr.]</p>

We then examine the obligations related to social and economic rights that courts in Colombia, India, South Africa, Indonesia, and elsewhere have imposed on states and private parties in areas such as conflict and internal displacement, the right to food, the right to clean air, and constitutional spending requirements.

<p>I provide an answer to the question why birth parents have a moral right to keep and raise their biological babies. Such a right is important because, in its absence, fairness towards adequate prospective parents who are involuntarily childless may demand a “babies redistribution;” moreover, in societies with entrenched histories of injustice there could be reasons of fairness in favor of baby shuffling amongst all recent parents. But, by the time of birth, the birth parents will have already shouldered various burdens in order to bring children into existence, and are likely to have formed an intimate relationship with the future baby. Denying birth parents the right to keep their baby would be unfair to them and would destroy valuable parent-baby relationships. [A]</p>

<p>This article considers the connections between political intolerance and general support for civil liberties. Most generally, I discover that different measures seem to be measuring somewhat different constructs, and that researchers therefore should not assume that different aspects of tolerance and support for civil liberties are interchangeable. These findings have important substantive implications for democratic theory: general support for civil liberties seems to be a policy preference legitimately contested within democratic politics, whereas political intolerance is a form of exceptionalism in which the political freedoms of particular groups and ideologies are targeted.

<p>63.4055 GLANVILLE, Luke — <bold>The myth of “traditional” sovereignty</bold>. <italic>International Studies Quarterly</italic> 57(1), March 2013: 79–90.</p>
<p>The conventional story of sovereignty told in IR tells us that there is a “traditional” or “Westphalian” meaning of sovereignty that has prevailed since the 17th c. and that accords states the right to govern themselves free from outside interference. In recent years, this meaning has been challenged by notions of conditional and responsible sovereignty. This article argues that the supposed “traditional” meaning of sovereignty is not as foundational and timeless as is often assumed. Rather than a right of non-intervention, it was the right to wage (just) war that was first conceived by political theorists to be the external corollary of the internal supremacy of the sovereign. This article examines the initial absence and then the gradual emergence of the “traditional” meaning of sovereignty, firmly established [only] in the 20th c. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>Materials that can sustain an explosive fission chain reaction are essential for all types of nuclear explosives, from first-generation fission weapons to advanced thermonuclear weapons. The most common of these fissile materials are highly enriched uranium (HEU) and plutonium of almost any isotopic composition. The five nuclear weapon states party to the 1968 Non-Proliferation Treaty — China, France, Russia, the UK, and the US — have produced both HEU and plutonium. India, Israel, and North Korea have produced mainly plutonium, and Pakistan mainly HEU for weapons. All states with a civilian nuclear industry have some capability to produce fissile materials. It is therefore necessary to consider details of stocks of HEU and separated plutonium, including in weapons, and details of the current capacity to produce these materials.</p>

<p>Both political philosophy and political science sprang from closely entwined concerns about democracy and matters of social and political justice, and today both must still confront their practical as well as cognitive relationship to their subject matter. L. Wittgenstein's vision of philosophy is in effect a vision of social inquiry. His work, when viewed from this perspective, prompts us to reconsider the logical status of various modes of political inquiry: how can these practices, descriptively and normatively, do justice to their subject matter? How can they deal with such foundational issues as the nature of social phenomena, the concepts of representation and interpretation, the problem of knowledge of other minds and what is involved in making explanatory and evaluative judgments about the objects of inquiry?

<p>The study of regionalism is often characterized as too fragmented, plagued by disagreements over such fundamental matters as its ontological and epistemological premises, which also hinder efforts at substantive comparison of regionalization processes. This article argues that to overcome these problems, what is required is a more rigorous incorporation of such studies within relevant work in state theory and political geography. The key insight is that regionalism should not be studied separately from the state, as these are interrelated phenomena. State-making and regionalization are both manifestations of contested political projects aimed at shaping the territorial, institutional, and/or functional scope of political rule. The article also distills the lines of a mechanismic methodology for comparative regionalism. The framework's utility is then demonstrated through a comparison of regional governance in Asia and Europe. [R, abr.]</p>

Arguing for a relational and dynamic understanding of trust, empathy, and dialogue, the article identifies limitations within IR and contributes to an emergent interdisciplinary research agenda. the contested and unresolved negotiations between Iran and the West over Iran's nuclear program which is framed by the parties as a dilemma of trust, serves to illustrate some of the obstacles to exercising empathy and, at the same time, the need to engage in reflexive dialogue in order to build trust and transform adversarial relationships.

<p>This paper examines some of the similarities between finance and security from a global governance perspective. We argue that finance and security share a number of similar properties in terms of prevailing arrangements at the level of global governance, and also a number of problems which we conceptualize as problems of governance capacity. Such similarities, we argue, are not unique to these domains but actually tell us something about the character of global governance as a whole. In so doing, we argue that the evolution in thinking about governance challenges and the institutional solutions required to meet them further underscores an already pernicious dynamic at work in global governance.

<p>A spatial model of coalition-formation is used together with data from Dutch elections and theoretical instances to study different procedures of coalition-formation. The model shows that procedure plays an important role in reaching a coalition agreement and that political parties do not necessarily benefit from being a first-mover. Moreover, it is shown that a decrease in a party's flexibility can be (dis)advantageous in coalition negotiations. Furthermore, certain power-sharing tactics appear not always to lead to an agreement that is in a party's advantage. The main message is that the procedure of forming a coalition plays a more important role than is usually acknowledged in literature and practice. [R]</p>

<p>Following the collapse of long-lived dictatorships in Tunisia and Egypt in early 2011, many analysts have turned their attention to China to identify possible stirrings of revolution. Of course, whereas efforts spiraled into revolutionary outcomes in the Middle East and North Africa, the Chinese Jasmine Revolution stimulated little domestic interest and failed to materialize into a popular movement. Beginning with the cases of Egypt and Tunisia, this article critically examines recent literature identifying the causes of the 2011 Arab Spring revolutions to develop several hypotheses on the sources of regime vulnerability in these countries and considers their applicability in explaining the exceptional resilience of singleparty rule in China.

<p>Official and publicly accessible data on arms-transfers is important for assessing states’ arms export and arms procurement policies. However, publishing data on arms sales and acquisitions is a sensitive issue for nearly all states. It is therefore necessary to discuss recent developments in official international, regional and national reporting mechanisms that aim, in whole or in part, to increase the quality and quantity of publicly available information on international arms transfers. This includes the UN Register of Conventional Arms (UNROCA) as well as national and regional reports on arms exports.</p>

<p>Previous scholarship has found robust connections between winning an election and democratic system support. Building on this connection, our analysis theorizes an additional dimension of competitiveness existing in executive elections. We hypothesize a polarizing effect in close elections: that individuals feel the most satisfied after winning by a narrow margin, while losers will be most dissatisfied. Using survey data from eighteen national elections across eight countries, our findings support half of this expectation. Winner satisfaction with democratic systems is highest in close elections and erodes as margin increases. Losers’ reported satisfaction is not affected by margin: those who lose by half a percent are indistinguishable in levels of system support from those who lose in landslides. [R]</p>
<p>63.4067 JACKSON, Susan T. — <bold>The military services industry</bold>. <italic>SIPRI Yearbook</italic> 2012: 230–238.</p>
<p>Of the twenty military services companies in the Top 100 for 2010, sixteen are based in the US, with total military services sales of $47 billion. A further three are based in the UK ($6.6 billion), and one is based in Kuwait ($1.3 billion). While the composition of the military services companies has been largely stable, there have been some notable changes since 2002. In order to understand where and how some of the core aspects of military technical and operational support activities have shifted to the private sector, four sub-sectors need to be examined: military aircraft MRO; systems support for unmanned aerial systems (UASs); logistics support during the Iraq War and for UN peace operations; and training for stability and UN peace operations.</p>

<p>Social market philosophy provides neither a useful analytical framework for understanding modern capitalism, nor the policy tools to address our present economic and social predicament. The concept of “market failure,” with its underlying assumption of market equilibrium, does not capture the systemically adverse outcomes of collective market forces. A more sophisticated understanding of capitalist economies, and the societies in which they exist, would recognize that the market economy is a dynamic but not self-regulating system. It is embedded in, and impacts, four other economies — of the natural environment, of family and care, of voluntary association, and of the public sector — which operate under different motivations and allocative principles. The role of government is central, to balance the values created by different kinds of institutions and to constrain the dynamic impacts of market forces.

<p>The attempt to think community today is necessarily marked by the legacy of communal belonging understood as a sharing of identity and the mobilization of totalizing figures, a legacy which, according to Jean-Luc Nancy, is irrevocably tainted by the experience of German National Socialist community. Nancy's analysis of the “nothing” or absent essence of community understood ontologically as “being-with” poses the challenge of how we may come to think and produce community outside of any totalizing logic of shared identity and in the absence of transcendent figures of authority. Elaborating further on Nancy's thinking of ecotechnicity, this response argues that the key problem facing the Immanent Authority project is that of the techniques or modes by which the “nothing” of community may be realized.

<p>One of the many ways in which politicians seek to respond to economic austerity pressure is to cut or even completely remove public policies introduced in better times. Yet, despite many advances in policy research, relatively little is known about why, when, how and with what effects politicians engage in policy-dismantling. This article [reviews] the existing literatures, [to] stimulate a renewed focus on policy-dismantling. It identifies a number of pertinent analytical dimensions (namely the origin of political preferences, prevailing opportunity structures, dismantling strategies, and effects/outcomes/impacts) and explores how they can be brought together to provide new insights into the comparative politics of policy-dismantling. Finally, claims are made in relation to what policy-dismantling research can offer to the understanding of both policy dynamics and politics more generally. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>Economic convergence of the large emerging economies (Brazil, China and India) on the incumbent industrialized economic powers has produced divergent predictions: rising powers are viewed as challengers of existing global governance or nascent supporters of the status quo. The preferences of rising powers, as revealed in global economic negotiations and international security regimes, indicate that they are moderate reformers that seek greater influence within existing forums and also attempt to safeguard their policy-making autonomy. Even if their preferences change, the translation of growing economic weight into usable capabilities is not automatic. Domestic political constraints often make the mobilization of capabilities difficult in international bargaining. Strategies of collective action, whether South-South or regional, have not yet produced a consistent increase in bargaining power at the global level.

<p>Aggression is a fundamental component of human behavior, yet is mostly absent from scholarship on mass political behavior. This study proposes and tests a theory of state violence attitudes in which citizens develop preferences from aggressive personality traits. In an original nationally-representative survey, trait aggression strongly predicts support for violent state policies, as does its subcomponent trait anger, rivaling the power of partisanship. More provocatively, the well-documented gender gap in state violence attitudes replicated here is not attributable to sex differences in aggressive personality. This work builds on recent advances in political personality research and highlights the important role of aggression in political behavior. [R]</p>

<p>A number of recent articles have found that two types of factors encourage politicians to liberalize their capital accounts: strong macroeconomic fundamentals and political pressure from proponents of open capital markets. However, these conclusions need to be re-evaluated because the most commonly used measure of capital account openness, M.D. Chinn and H. Ito's Kaopen index [<italic>Capital Account Liberalization, Institutions and Financial Development: Cross Country Evidence</italic>, Cambridge, 2002], suffers from systematic measurement error. We modify the Chinn-Ito variable and replicate two studies [S.M. Brooks and M.J.

<p>This article addresses how the work of the French philosopher J.-L. Nancy might inform our understanding of “social authority;” an authority generated in everyday practices. It argues that the “governmentality” approach, while drawing out the forms of power that fill the sphere of community-oriented politics, does not recognize the important role played by the loss of community. The article thus sets out how Nancy's work, in re-framing this “loss” as the constantly occurring fragmentation of the community, allows for a productive and augmentative approach to authority, highlighting its contingent production in moments of creativity and contestation. A final section sets out how, in light of these considerations, such a “social authority” may be seen as essential to a democratic politics. [R] [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 63.4287]</p>

<p>If the all-affected principle is regarded as a valid basis for assigning participatory entitlements to individuals, how should those entitlements be distributed in a world were jurisdictional boundaries between states matter only to some extent in determining patterns of affectedness? The solution to this conundrum is called “fuzzy citizenship,” and consists in an approach to the democratization of the global order that does not place direct constraints on what states can or should do but changes the set of people to whom they owe participatory entitlements. The legislature of each state should grant voting power to representatives elected by all non-residents in proportion to the share of world income under the control of the state. [A]</p>

<p>This article examines the legal and normative debates about the Occupy Toronto movement in order to illuminate the issues raised by Occupy Wall Street. It challenges the view that the occupation of parks and plazas was an illegitimate privatization of public space. In both New York City and Toronto, the courts relied on a sovereignist theory of the public to justify removing the protesters and disbanding the encampments. The alternative is what I call the populist model of the public, a term which describes the political mobilization of the people outside the institutional structures of the state. I suggest the appropriation of space was the most visible aspect of a broader call for collective control of the common wealth of society. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>Our concern is with war losses and post-war recovery leading to convergence with pre-war performance. To test this proposition, we choose the most severe international and civil wars after 1920. We find that all belligerents recover or overtake demographic losses incurred in war. Economic assessments differ. The most-developed belligerents recover like a “phoenix” from immense destruction in one generation. For less-developed societies, the outcomes are mixed. The overlapping generation growth model accounts for such differences in recovery rates based on pre-war performance challenging arguments from Solow's neoclassical growth perspective. Our results imply that foreign aid is incidental to the post-war convergence for the most-developed societies, can prompt recovery for the less-developed societies, and is not effective — unless it is massive and sustained — for the least-developed societies.

<p>This article tests the linkage between institutional configuration and social trust, highlighting the role of the welfare states in coordinating interests among different labor market actors. It initially builds a theoretical framework distinguishing training-supplemented welfare regimes from transfer-based welfare regimes. Evidence from descriptive and multivariate analyses of World Values Survey based on 17 advanced industrial democracies supports my argument that public investment in skill-provision prevalent in training-supplemented welfare states leads to higher accumulation of social trust, whereas passive social transfers result in lower social trust. Especially, high investment in public skill-provision leads to a decreased gap in social trust between employers and low-skilled workers, as well as among different occupational groups.

<p>Does democracy motivate terrorists to engage in hostage-taking acts because of how easy negotiating with a democratic government is? Or does democracy impose ‘audience costs’ on the government leaders, driving them never to negotiate with hostage-taking terrorists following the long-held principle of no negotiation? This article argues that hostage-taking terrorists are more inclined to target democratic governments because of the greater value given to human life and personal freedom in democracies. Additionally the helplessness of held hostages is more freely exposed by the media in democracies, which leads to the audience focusing on the hostages themselves rather than on the interests of the nation. This in turns compels decision-makers to concede, especially near election time. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>How have the discourses of “trade-oriented food security” and “food sovereignty” contributed to a politics of international agri-food policy? Discourse is understood as the meanings given to phenomena (both social and physical) and the practices associated with those meanings. Consequently, metaphors are regarded as powerful sense-making constructs. In their classic forms, these two discourses constitute seemingly irreconcilable paradigms: one representing a hegemonic assertion of neoliberal economic rationalism, the other an oppositional and populist social movement. Analysis of public-facing discourse reveals distinctive meanings and metaphors concerning the role of trade in food security and in the conceptualization of nature (particularly in reference to agricultural biotechnology) along with elements of co-construction.

<p>This paper [examines] the conjunction antiwar protest and casualty-aversion by offering a conceptual development of the role of military recruitment in affecting casualty sensitivity-incited antiwar mobilization. Scholars have shown that sensitivity to losses is affected by variables clustered together as “the politics of war,” such as sense of threat, mission success, number of casualties, and elite consensus, which can be mediated by collective actors. I argue that the mode of military recruitment mediates collective actors’ ability to leverage the politics of war to challenge dominant discourse and influence war policy, owing to the cumulative impact of four recruitment-related variables: republicanism, social power, the favoring of “voice,” and bounded discourse. All shape the movement's framing and resources in a way that affects mobilization. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>The standard model of political party density emphasizing the interaction of social cleavages and district magnitude (M) is incomplete in accounting for number of parties in cases of high values of M in an arbitrary way. We explore an alternative model for such cases emphasizing the slack in the issue agenda available to parties with which to construct viable identities or niches they can employ to mobilize cognitively-limited voters. The model is tested with time-series data and event-history analysis on the sizes of the public policy agenda and the political party system in the Netherlands, an extreme case of large district magnitude given its single national district.

<p>Recycling is an increasingly important tool in global and national efforts for sustainability. Yet, particularly in the US, there remains disconnect between those who view recycling as a necessity and those who see it as a waste: many conservatives do not support recycling activities, while many liberals do. However, recycling can be framed in language that draws support from both conservatives and liberals. Data from a survey sample of 429 individuals show that conservative frames of recycling are supported by both conservatives and liberals, whereas liberal frames are supported only by liberals. Similarly “duty-based” citizenship frames are supported by both duty-based and engaged citizens, while “engaged” citizenship frames are supported mainly by engaged citizens. The implications for researchers, educators, administrators, and others involved in recycling are detailed. [R]</p>

<p>Why do democracies survive or break down? We argue that structural variables such as the level of development and inequalities have not shaped prospects for democratic survival in Latin America. Nor, contrary to findings in some of the literature, has economic performance affected the survival of competitive regimes. Instead, we focus on the regional political environment and on actors’ normative preferences about democracy and dictatorship and their policy radicalism or moderation. We argue that (1) a higher level of development did not increase the likelihood of democratic survival in Latin America over this long time; (2) if actors have a normative preference for democracy, it is more likely to survive; and (3) policy moderation facilitates democratic survival.

<p>We study the formation of government policy in democracies when turnout depends on party activists and campaign spending — parties’ “political capital”. The functional importance of political capital determines equilibrium rent-seeking in government. If activists and donors are better than the ordinary voter at distinguishing between good governments and lucky governments, then the more potent political capital is the less the extent of rent-seeking. This situation also rules out finite limits on election spending, though a zero limit could be the optimum if donors and activists are close enough substitutes in the work they do for the party. The one policy that is never optimal is a finite limit on local spending. [R]</p>

<p>The rise of new economic powers [allows] us to consider whether and how the place of non-state actors might evolve, particularly where emerging market firms are concerned, as they are the most obvious manifestation of the shift in economic power away from the developed West and Japan. The article suggests, however, that firms from rising powers have little incentive to define their policy preferences in opposition to established powers. They can conduct political activity across a range of avenues, from multilateral institutions to regulatory bodies overseeing technical aspects of business operations. [Thus], they do not need to frame their policy demands solely in terms of balancing against western economic dominance. The economic growth of emerging markets has given NGOs an opportunity to work with multinationals in the provision of public goods. [R, abr.] [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 63.4099]</p>

<p>Ex-combatant reintegration programs are buttressed by a number of problematic assumptions about ex-combatants themselves; namely, that ex-combatants should not receive long-term support because such assistance would amplify the threat they pose to security and exacerbate community resentment towards them. The article uses data collected from Liberia to demonstrate that such thinking stigmatizes ex-combatants and works against the objective of reintegration: it disrupts integration into the everyday social, economic, and political life of the post-conflict state and aims instead to render ex-combatants separate from communities. Integration will remain elusive unless assumptions about ex-combatants as program beneficiaries are challenged. [R]</p>

<p>Recent studies show that the democratic peace correlation is not significant once the potentially confounding variable that can cause both democracy and peace, contract-intensive economy, is considered; this pattern holds in analyses of wars, fatal militarized interstate conflicts [M. Mousseau, “The social market roots of democratic peace,” <italic>International Security</italic> 33(4), Spring 2009: 52–86, <italic>Abstr</italic>. 59.6234], and interstate crises [M.

<p>This paper asks whether the internet's heavy reliance on non-hierarchical, networked forms of governance is compatible with growing concerns about cyber-security from traditional state actors. Networked governance is defined as a semi-permanent, voluntary negotiation system that allows interdependent actors to opt for collaboration or unilateral action in the absence of an overarching authority. Two case studies — internet routing security and the response to a large-scale botnet known as Conficker — show the prevalence of networked governance on the internet and provide insight into its strengths and limitations.

<p>Markets are powerful tools for reform in both the public and private realms.

<p>I explain the contribution that this article makes to the existing literature and clarify my theses. There have been some contemporary defenses of corporal punishment, but I have not come across a work in which the most serious objections from degradingness have been adequately discussed. I flesh out and articulate those objections, discuss the concerns that lie behind them, and offer responses to them. I make a thorough case for the claim that the corporal punishment of criminals is not necessarily degrading. Of course, this is only a portion of the work that would have to be done in order to show that corporal punishment is morally permissible. I confine myself here to the issue of degradingness.

<p>The economics and elections connection has been heavily investigated. The first comparative, survey-based research on economic voting, by M. S. Lewis-Beck, found serious effects. Subsequently, other comparative scholars have explored this terrain. These impressive efforts arrive at opposing conclusions about the importance of economic voting. We carry out another major examination, with an eye to reconciling these differences. A carefully specified model of vote-choice is estimated on a balanced survey pool (N &gt; 40,000) from 10 Western European nations. Special pains are taken with issues of economic measurement, estimation, and endogeneity. The strong result speaks to the functioning of government accountability in advanced democracies.

<p>This issue analyzes the negotiation of power transition in the international system today. This introductory article provides the theoretical frame that guided all the contributors, and serves as the collective starting point. The framework highlights the importance of studying the relations between the key actors: the rising powers, the established powers, small and marginalized states, private actors, and, finally, international organizations and other mechanisms of global governance. The article facilitates analysis of the relations between these actors; it offers the lens of negotiation analysis that focuses specifically on the variables of negotiation strategy, coalitions and framing. It suggests potential implications of this collective study: [e.g.,] new insights into the motivations of the key players, their ability and willingness to assume the responsibilities of international leadership, and how their visions of global order [interact].

<p>Over the last decade, Western government agencies and international organizations have increasingly turned their attention to the issue of state “fragility” and “failure” in developing countries that are confronted with war, violence and extreme poverty. This article argues that the concepts of fragile and failed states are confusing, inherently superficial and unstable policy-oriented labels. First, it elaborates five critical ideas concerning the scientific dimension of this literature. Second, it interprets the analytical framework of fragile/failed states as a reactivation of developmentalist theories, primarily driven by a Western conception of the polity. Third, it encourages the rejection of the state-centric approach to security and development in fragile contexts, and advocates combining interest in government institutions with a multidimensional, context-based and historically grounded approach to society-wide vulnerabilities.

<p>This paper develops a critical reading of Hakim's <italic>Erotic Capital</italic> [<italic>The Power of Attraction in the Boardroom and the Bedroom</italic>, New York, 2011]. The book calls social scientists to pay more attention to an underrated kind of capital, which should however be worth as much attention as economic, social and cultural capital. If Hakim invites to consider the body in a sociological way, her approach can be challenged. Is erotic capital fully distinct from cultural capital? Was sociology so blind to these stakes? Beyond the book's discussion, the paper questions the current trend to endlessly multiply “capitals” in all social spaces and interactions. It pleads for clearer theoretical distinctions between (1) four basic kinds of capitals, (2) their variations and “states,” (3) their combinations into a huge range of locally efficient but “molecular” capitals.

<p>M. Walzer has emerged as a pivotal figure in just war theory's modern, secular rebirth within the IR discipline. His theory argues the language of just war theory provides an effective means for us to engage with the moral reality of war. Drawing upon the work of J. Derrida, this article investigates the construction of Walzer's moral language and its ethical implications. It first focuses on Walzer's moral language; its structure, inconsistencies, and theological underpinnings. [It then] addresses how Walzer employs this language to justify the sacrifice of combatants in defense of non-combatants. I argue that Walzer's theory is inconsistent in itself, and that the sacrifices initiated by this language constitute the unjustified sacrifice of just war theory's own ethical principles.

<p>Many political theorists today appeal to, or assume the existence of, a political culture in which the public values of Western liberal democracies are embedded — a political culture that is necessary to render their ideas plausible and their proposals feasible. This article contrasts this approach with the more ambitious arguments advanced by J. Habermas in his original account of discourse ethics — a moral theory to which, he supposed, all human beings were demonstrably and ineluctably bound by the communicative constitution of collective life. I argue that Habermas's analysis can be enlisted in defense of a weaker claim: that principled commitment to discussion is not always necessary for genuine deliberative engagement to occur. As a result, there may be hope for democratic deliberation in contexts where a liberal democratic political culture is lacking. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>Although the subprime crisis regenerated interest in and stimulated debate about how to study the politics of global finance, it has not sparked the development of new approaches to IPE, which remains firmly rooted in actor-centered models. We develop an alternative network-based approach that shifts the analytical focus to the relations between actors. We first depict the contemporary global financial system as a network, with a particular focus on its hierarchical structure. We then explore key characteristics of this global financial network, including how the hierarchic network structure shapes the dynamics of financial contagion and the source and persistence of power. Throughout, we strive to relate existing research to our network approach in order to highlight exactly where this approach accommodates, where it extends, and where it challenges existing knowledge generated by actor-centered models.

<p>This article offers an institutional approach to accountability in representative democracies. Theorizing accountability comprises both settled polities with well-entrenched institutions and unsettled polities with weak or contested institutions, and it is argued that agency theory and formal principal-agent models giving priority to compliance and control usually make assumptions that are unlikely to apply to the latter type of polity. An institutional approach challenges principal-agent assumptions regarding what accountability means and implies, what is involved in demanding, rendering, assessing and responding to accounts and assigning accountability, and how accountability institutions work and change. Accountability is related to fundamental issues in democratic politics and the paper treats distributions of information, normative standards of assessment, authority and power relations as endogenous to democratic politics.

<p>63.4106 ORENSTEIN, Mitchell A. — <bold>Pension privatization: evolution of a paradigm</bold>. <italic>Governance</italic> 26(2), Apr. 2013: 259–281.</p>
<p>From 1981 to 2004, a paradigm-shift occurred in pension systems worldwide as more than 30 countries fully or partially replaced their state-administered pay-as-you-go pension systems with ones based on individual, private savings accounts. Yet in 2005, pension privatization abruptly stopped. After the 2008 crisis, several countries that had privatized their pension systems scaled back or even canceled individual accounts. Is the new pension paradigm dead? And if so, why? This article shows that fiscal and ideational factors caused a temporary halt to pension-privatization worldwide and induced transnational pension policy networks to find new ways to respond to perceived failures. Adjustments to the new pension paradigm, such as emphasizing minimum pensions, will enable pension privatization to continue in years ahead, albeit in a revised form.

More of a problem is that of finding stable and agreed rules of recognition for particular forms and formulae of authority in modern, complex political societies.

<p>Trying to untangle the puzzle of why economic sanctions imposed on authoritarian regimes usually fail to bring about political change leads to several key questions. How do leaders of targeted authoritarian states manage to stay in power and resist a policy change despite sanctions? Why does the economic deprivation caused by sanctions not lead to the popular mobilization that would be necessary to force authoritarian leaders to yield to sender states’ demands? In order to address these questions, it is necessary to explore how economic sanctions affected the political economy and the state-society relationship in Iraq between 1990 and 2003. The case of Libya under sanctions in the 1990s then provides comparative leverage. The Iraqi and Libyan examples allow for a discussion of Iran today.

<p>This paper helps resolve the ongoing debate concerning whether the democratic peace is limited to the Cold War period. Some critics have attributed the democratic peace to a set of common interests among democracies that uniquely existed during the Cold War. I test this proposition, using a new measure of Cold War preferences to test if the effect of joint democracy is rendered statistically insignificant either during or after the Cold War as critics contend. I also test, as some democratic peace proponents have suggested, whether the pacifying effect of democracy is strengthened in the post-Cold War era. Evidence from period-specific logit analyses suggests that joint democracy promotes peace independently of Cold War security interests. Indeed, the democratic peace exists in the post-Cold War era.

<p>The purpose of the article is to undertake a critical analysis of the democratic peace approach laid out in J. Oneal and B.

This study offers a theoretical framework to explain a supposed international “fact” and attempts to incorporate and control some variables of the main approach it seeks to challenge — structural realism. The article argues that J. Oneal and B. Russett fail in their two main attempts. The causal mechanism identified by them does not withstand the understanding, derived from C. Clausewitz's theory of war as an integral political phenomenon. This criticism applies also to other prominent works on democratic peace, which share the same assumptions. The authors are incapable of identifying and controlling the “realist” variables as planned, which makes them vulnerable to epiphe-nomenalist criticism. [R]</p>

<p>Social cognition has evolved to make sense of small, intimate social groups, but in complex mass societies, comparable vivid social cues are scarcer. Extant research on political attitudes and behavior has emphasized media and interpersonal networks as key sources of cues. Extending a classical argument, we provide evidence for the importance of an alternative and internal source: imagination. With a focus on social welfare, we collected survey data from two very different democracies, the US and Denmark, and conducted several studies using explicit, implicit, and behavioral measures. By analyzing the effects of individual differences in imagination, we demonstrate that political cognition relies on vivid, mental simulations that engage evolved social and emotional decision-making mechanisms. It is in the mind's eye that vividness and engagement are added to people's sense of mass politics. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>We argue that the ambivalent status of world politics is due to the understanding of its central concept — the world — in terms of totality or “the whole”. Drawing on A. Badiou's set-theoretical ontology, this article demonstrates that such a concept is logically inconsistent, which leads the discourse on world politics to a perpetual oscillation between the presupposition of a universal totality and the unmasking of its impossibility. We then proceed to the particularistic concept of the world as a limited totality with no pretense to universality, as developed in Heidegger's phenomenological ontology and Badiou's objective phenomenology. This approach provides us with a pathway to the third concept of the world as the void, in which a plurality of positive worlds coexist and which is their ontological condition of possibility.

<p>E. Gartzke and A. Weisiger [<italic>Abstr</italic>. 63.4049] emphasize the pacifying impact of regime similarity. But the logic of their argument makes it seem unlikely that shared autocracy and democracy have equal pacifying impacts, because autocracies are so much more diverse. Regime similarity is in any case a problematic control variable. Since joint democracy and regime similarity are related by definition, any confounding impact regime similarity appears to have is produced in part by conceptual overlap rather than by a causal connection. Mousseau claims [<italic>Abstr</italic>. 63.4094] that contract intensity confounds the relationship between democracy and peace, but to the extent that democracy makes contract intensity more likely, contract intensity cannot be a confounding variable. Neither of these articles creates serious doubts about the pacifying impact of shared democracy. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>This article focuses on the link between the representation of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people in national legislatures and the existence of equality laws focused on sexual orientation. It addresses three interrelated questions: how many “out” LGBT legislators have served in national parliaments, what explains the cross-national variation in their legislative presence, and what is the relationship between the presence of gay legislators and the enactment of laws that treat gay and straight citizens equally? There is an established literature arguing that the representation of women and ethnic minorities “descriptively” in national legislatures improves the realization of their policy preferences and the position of the group within the society as a whole. This article draws on that literature and extends the analysis to LGBT communities. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>This article suggests some ways to revisit the intellectual contribution of a pillar of American political sociology. Already critical early in his career [of] Parsonian functionalism, then dominating American sociology, Tilly (1929–2008) devoted his active life to the elaboration of an intrinsically historical political sociology, aware of the complexity of its object. We consider this sociology from three angles: we recall the criticisms that it faced since the 1970s, outline most of its empirical applications, and evaluate its ontological foundations. [R]</p>

<p>Women's political representation exhibits substantial cross-national variation. While mechanisms shaping these variations are well understood for Western democracies, there is little consensus on how these same factors operate in less developed countries. Effects of two political institutions — electoral systems and gender quotas — are tested across 168 countries from 1992 to 2010. Findings indicate that key causal factors interact with a country's socio-economic development, shifting their importance and possibly even direction at various development thresholds. Generalizing broadly across countries, therefore, does not adequately represent the effects of these political institutions. Rather, different institutional changes are advised to increase women's presence in national governments. [R]</p>

<p>A number of scholars point out that presupposing a lack of agency on the side of post-colonial subject is yet another way of silencing him/her. But how can his/her “true” voice be recognized without at the same time disguising existing domination? One possibility is the development of a different theoretical framework that challenges the taken-for-granted assumption on which the dilemma is based: the existence of the subject and its conscious voice. I use G. Deleuze's theory of the various expressions and struggles of life. Analyzing Monsanto's introduction of genetically modified cotton into India in 2002, I suggest that the multinational company (Monsanto) should not be regarded as yet another neo-colonial oppressor: it is a war machine that unleashes flows enabling nomadic life assemblages to counter-attack.

I refer extensively to the examples of the election of [US President B.] Obama, second-wave feminism's transformation of women's relation to work, and a neo-Nazi's turn to tolerance; but this is not an article about these recent historical or current events. Rather these cases are of a kind — they are instances of what we take, common-sensibly and with little doubt, to be progressive. It is in this spirit that I refer to them. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>This essay examines contemporary Western thinking on humility. Compared to other virtues, little has been written about humility in the past century. This has led scholars to dub it a forgotten virtue. Recently, a renewed interest in humility can be found among scholars working in various academic disciplines. These scholars disagree, however, about the meaning and implications of humility for contemporary life. I intervene in this disagreement through a comparative approach and bring the ancient Eastern tradition of Confucianism to bear on the current Western resurgence of interest in humility as a civic value. I argue that humility is a crucial political virtue that fortifies us and helps us resist disillusionment. Humility, therefore, should neither be reduced to a vestige of traditional Christianity nor viewed as a watered down notion of modesty. [R] [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 63.4020]</p>

<p>This article introduces reasonable force as ontological to the performance of late-modern police power.

The article tracks the development of reasonable force in late-modern policing through to its emergence as a vanguard strategy of post-Cold War global governance. Police power has transformed traditional sovereign power relations to incorporate governmental power. It finds policing power to be an expansive reforming force that exhibits a dynamic capacity to provide relational coherence to multi-layered policing constellations from the local to the global.

<p>When do ethnic cleavages increase the risk of conflict? Under what conditions is a strong common identity likely to emerge, thereby reducing that risk? How are patterns of social identification shaped by conflict? We draw on empirical results regarding the nature and determinants of group identification to develop a simple model that addresses these questions. The model highlights the possibility of vicious and virtuous cycles where conflict and identification patterns reinforce each other. It also shows how processes of ethnic identification amplify the importance of political institutions and traces the effects of national status and perceived differences across ethnic groups. Finally, we demonstrate how a small but sufficiently potent group of ethnic radicals can derail a peaceful equilibrium, leading to the polarization of the entire population. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>This article conceptualizes congruence of the vote in three different ways that make it possible to assess the contribution of three competing theoretical approaches in explaining variation in dissimilarity between vote-shares across space and time. These approaches are second-order election theory, regional authority and territorial cleavages. The hypotheses are tested against a data-set containing the results of more than 4,000 regional and national elections held in 360 regions in 18 countries. It appears that the depth of territorial cleavages explains variation across space, but to understand change over time one needs to consider institutional authority and second-order election effects.

<p>Why do states ratify international treaties? While previous research has emphasized domestic political factors, we focus on power politics in situations in which powerful states disagree on the merits of a treaty. We argue that states supporting the status quo should discourage third parties from ratifying the treaty, whereas challenger states should entice them to do so. Based on this theory, we expect third parties’ ratification decisions to be influenced by their dependence on the conflicting states. To test the theory, we use data on the conflict between the US and the EU over the regulation of trade in genetically modified organisms. The EU created a new treaty, the Cartagena Protocol, to enhance biosafety regulation and propagate the “precautionary principle” over the “sound science principle” defended by the US. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>The transformational impact of information technologies changes the dominant meanings of the identity and interests of global actors. These transformations cannot be ascertained through technology's impact upon the capabilities of actors as understood in traditional accounts of power. The concept of meta-power explains the new meanings, which come about in global politics from an increasing number of perspectives and interactions facilitated through information exchanges and learning. Especially when information technologies diffuse or decentralize relations across global actors, we would expect that increased interactions among them would allow new meaning formation to increase. Individual and social identities are no longer singular or linearly consistent through time, and global politics reveal multiple meanings for the issues and actors in question. Illustrative examples are provided for individual-level identity-formation and for the implications for global politics in networked environments.

<p>There is a growing interest in empirically exploring the biological underpinnings of political attitudes and behavior. Heritability studies are a primary vehicle, and data-sets rich in political phenotypes are becoming broadly accessible. A bottleneck exists, however, in exploiting these opportunities because they involve a statistical re-tooling for political scientists and require a conceptual shift that has substantial implications for the field's traditional theoretical models. We show this methodological bottleneck is easily navigable; it is the lesser-discussed shift in theoretical assumptions poses the larger problem to integrating biological elements into the study of political attitudes and behavior. To address these issues we provide a detailed introduction to a regression-based method for analyzing genetic influence on political attitudes and behaviors that will be methodologically intuitive to political scientists with even minimum quantitative training.

<p>We discuss the usefulness and meaning of empirical models of economic voting that rely on measures of individual economic perceptions. A long-standing critique of the use of [such] perceptions data suggests that variation in perceptions must reflect noise or error because there can be only one “real” state of the national economy applicable to all respondents in any national survey. We show, however, that this critique is based on a misunderstanding about (1) the theoretical concepts called for by the leading theories of economic voting (and that we should be trying to measure), (2) the nature of the economy that individuals can actually observe (it is a distribution of possible states, not a point) and, consequently, (3) the interpretation of correlations between individual economic perceptions and electoral support.

<p>This article has two fundamental aims. The first is to evaluate how political regimes, and most notably the democratic character of some states, have been incorporated in debates on IR theory. It evokes the traditional narrative of disciplinary evolution, with a specific focus on the systemic-positivist American tradition. The idea is to offer a critical reading of how theoretical strands of International Relations face this “democratic” element, as well as its peculiarities and implications for the debate at large. In this sense, the “political regime” variable loses explanatory power as the “third-image” approaches reach the center of the disciplinary debate. The second aim is to suggest that considering democracy as a relevant political variable in relations between states is not incompatible with systemic approaches to international politics, especially when looking at the concept of identity in Wendtian constructivism. Cleavages such as democracy versus autocracy may enhance the explanatory power of theories when facing current phenomena. [R]</p>

<p>Through a discussion of the 2008 mortgage crisis and its similarities to the Great Depression of the 1930s and the Great Recession of 2007–2009, I argue that the very notions of economic “crisis” and “recovery” are politically and ideologically constructed, and that conditions of vulnerability, often simply taken for granted as part of the normal social landscape when they affect marginalized populations, become regarded as crises when they affect dominant groups. By calling attention to these features of economic “crisis,” I demonstrate the relevance of scholarship on race, class, gender, and intersectionality to the understanding of fundamental questions of contemporary political economy not often viewed from this perspective.

<p>The classic International Relations works virtually ignore the issue of sport. Most studies on the relationship between sport and international relations have been produced by scholars of sport or historians of international relations, usually without a explicit theoretical framework, using descriptive approaches and empirical and normative proposals at best. Only recently has this “negligence” of sport by IR specialists, even among those authors that take in consideration relevant cultural factors in their analyses, begun to wane. This article examines critically the main recent issues relating to the ties between sport and international relations, their implications and the prospects for future research on the subject.

<p>This paper starts out from a puzzle. During the past thirty years, incomes have grown more unequal, a small group at the top has captured a much greater share of resources and poverty has increased. Despite this, most people are markedly less likely to want government to redistribute income or tackle poverty and are less sympathetic towards those without jobs. The greater insecurity of many people's lives in the current crisis renders the issue more perplexing. This paper describes trends in inequality, poverty and unemployment; presents new data on attitudes, media discussion and political platforms; discusses theoretical approaches from social psychologists, political scientists, sociologists and other commentators; and considers how a more generous welfare state might be pursued.

<p>This issue on “immigrant protest” has emerged in response to the rise in the visibility of immigrant protests, and it contributes to the growing body of scholarship on migrant resistance movements and to consider the implications of these struggles for critical understandings of citizenship. This introduction maps some of the central issues and themes emerging from the contributions to this issue, exploring the tensions between integrationist and autonomous approaches and theories of migrant activism and resistance and between migrant and activist strategies of invisibility and visibility. By bringing immigrant protests to the heart of debates about citizenship, we hope to further extend discussions about the limits and the possibilities of citizenship as the material and conceptual horizon of critical social analysis and political participation and practice today.

<p>I investigate the extent to which ISI Web of Science indexing contributes to the impact of an academic paper. I analyze the results of a natural experiment consisting in the accidental exclusion from the index of an entire issue of a political science journal. The statistical tests indicate a significant effect of ISI indexing on the number of citations received by individual papers. ISI indexing does not simply provide an objective measure of academic impact, but it also affects academic impact itself. This fact provides evidence that, despite the increasing competition from other providers such as Scopus or Google Scholar, ISI indexing still has a considerable amount of market power. [R]</p>

<p>This article considers how gender conflicts and cultural rights conflicts affect family-law reform. UN Women maintains that women experience harms including violence because of legal pluralism, i.e., multiple family-law codes. The article explores if federal territorial pluralism involves similar dangers. Since women's citizenship depends on equality, security and autonomy in family relations, the question is whether federal governments can regulate legal pluralism and enact reforms required under international law. Although in some federations, unregulated territorial pluralism harms women, some federal governments regulate legal pluralism effectively and reform family law codes. State capacity, political will, and manageable diversity all contribute to positive outcomes. [R] [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 63.4036]</p>

<p>I address the question of how Chinese scholars participate in scientific knowledge production by appropriating Western IR theories, primarily by examining interactions between North American theories that claim universality and China-specific IR efforts. Drawing on post-Mao era publications and books, I discuss how increasingly independent Chinese IR scholars are portraying their country's rising status in international politics and identifying China's national interests, while still emphasizing socialist concepts such as anti-hegemonism. The result is a form of Chinese IR scholarship that combines Western IR language with a worldview that emphasizes a modern China within the context of traditional socialist foreign policy norms.

<p>This article approaches of strategic thinking help to make modern war a social practice considered both technically feasible and, at the same time, legitimate for soldiers. It uses of two closely related theoretical fields, pragmatic sociology (the work of scholars such as Luc Boltanski, Nicolas Dodier and Francis Chateauraynaud), and the sociology of science (mostly the work of Bruno Latour). On the one hand, the sociology of scientific knowledge has developed a productive questioning of the construction of scientific facts that is particularly relevant to the present research. On the other hand, pragmatic sociology generates a compatible framework able to describe collective actions. The combination of both approaches allows the description of the formation of a strategic expertise regime that supports the technical legitimacy of the use of military force. Together, the sociology of scientific knowledge and pragmatic sociology bring a particularly relevant perspective to research pertaining to war. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>This article argues that: prestige is an enduring and protean feature of political behavior, compatible with and a potential confluence for diverse approaches and interpretations; if not overlooking it, IR tends to treat prestige as subordinate to material and strategic goals, or as an ideational construct for which instrumental aspects are extraneous; prestige resides in the background of many analyses, neither repudiated nor explored; prestige is distinct but not isolated from power: material, social or imagined; and empirical bases to support these claims can be drawn on from almost every age and culture.
