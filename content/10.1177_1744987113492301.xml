<p>On behalf of the Secretary of State for Health in England, the Department of Health commissioned an independent review of palliative care services for children and young people which reported in 2007. The review acknowledged the need to standardise the provision of out of hours palliative care services for this patient group and their families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1744987113492301">Craft and Killen, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>In the absence of national standards on the provision of out of hours palliative care services for children in England, the researchers who authored this paper were part of a research team that investigated the experiences of the community nurse, GP and allied health professionals (physiotherapist and occupational therapist) involved in the care of a child with cancer receiving palliative care at home. In this paper, they report on one aspect of this study, the experiences of paediatric nurses who provided out of hours home-care. They analysed the interview data following a grounded theory approach and used social worlds theory as a theoretical framework when interpreting their data.</p>
<p>The authors reported that the nurses’ experiences were influenced by three main factors. The first was that the absence of national standards led nurses to provide care in services that were not formally recognised; the second that inter-professional working was regarded as less than optimal; and the third that nurses’ social worlds impacted on their experience.</p>
<p>The authors described the nurses as working on a ‘voluntary’ basis when they were providing care in a service that was not formally recognised within the system. They suggest that a justification for working in this sub-optimal way is that it might enable the frontline staff to collect data that they could use to persuade decision-makers to formalise their service.</p>
<p>This scenario highlights a paradox in the health care system, that has been noted elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1744987113492301">McMahon, 2008</xref>). Health care professionals seek to develop sustainable service innovations and improvements and there is a strong policy push for innovation and improvement to deliver person-centred patient care. However, service managers are often caught between a rock and a hard place when faced with competing (and sometimes contradictory) policy-driven demands and, often, even stronger pressure to make efficiency savings. The ‘good’ manager is expected to ‘manage’ these tensions, support frontline innovation and improvement <italic>and</italic> demonstrate efficiency savings. Meanwhile, in the absence of alchemists, our less than perfect health service managers have to make difficult and (inevitably) unpopular decisions. This can result in patients’ needs being left unmet. Consequently, nurses (and other frontline staff), like those associated with this study, feel pressurised into, potentially, putting themselves at risk by providing care in services that are not formally recognised by the system. Alternatively, they risk being perceived by their peers as uncaring if they decline to participate in a voluntary scheme like the one described in the paper.</p>
<p>In the new health policy landscape in England, there is an even greater risk of variation in service provision across the nation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1744987113492301">NHS England, 2013</xref>). NHS managers, and commissioning managers in particular, will require to have, at the very least, insight into, and at best experience of providing frontline services; possess strong research and analytical skills to interpret data and evidence; and demonstrate well-honed listening skills and significant political acumen. Perhaps above all, they will need very broad shoulders and the ability to demonstrate sound, evidence informed decision making.</p>
