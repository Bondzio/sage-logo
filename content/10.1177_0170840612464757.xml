<abstract>
<p>Existing literature on employee selection contains an abundance of knowledge of how selection should take place but almost nothing about how it occurs in practice. This paper presents an ethnomethodological-discourse analytical real-time study of how selection decisions are made in situ. The main findings suggest that selection decision making is characterized by ongoing practical deliberation involving four interrelated discursive processes: assembling versions of the candidates; establishing the versions of the candidates as factual; reaching selection decisions; and using selection tools as sensemaking devices. In addition, this paper identifies two basic forms of selection decision making: one characterized by initial agreement and one characterized by initial disagreement. In each basic form of decision making, selectors reason through the four discursive processes in a methodical, situated and practical manner in order to construct local versions of the candidates and make ‘reasonable’ selection decisions.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>By choosing the right employees, organizations improve their abilities to realize strategic objectives and manage future challenges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0170840612464757">Barber, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0170840612464757">Compton, Morrissey, &amp; Nankervis, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0170840612464757">Gatewood, Feild, &amp; Barrick, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0170840612464757">Sears, 2003</xref>). Although employee selection is considered key for organizations, existing research has usually paid little attention to how selection decision making takes place in real-life situations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0170840612464757">Collinson, Knights, &amp; Collinson, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0170840612464757">Highhouse, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0170840612464757">Iles &amp; Salaman, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-0170840612464757">Zysberg &amp; Nevo, 2004</xref>). Instead, it has focused on developing and testing tools intended to improve selection and make it more efficient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0170840612464757">Hollway, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0170840612464757">Iles &amp; Salaman, 1995</xref>). As a result, there is considerable knowledge about selection tools and prescriptions for using them, but limited knowledge about how selection decisions are made. Without the latter, it is difficult to assess how selection tools and procedures will improve employee selection processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0170840612464757">Anderson, Herriot, &amp; Hodgkinson, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0170840612464757">Dipboye, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0170840612464757">Ryan &amp; Tippins, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0170840612464757">Rynes, Colbert, &amp; Brown, 2002</xref>). In this paper, we analyse eight real-time selection decision meetings in two IT businesses in order to explore how the selection decisions occur in practice.</p>

<title>Dominant Approaches to Selection Decision Making</title>
<p>Two main approaches dominate research on employee selection: the psychometric and the social process approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0170840612464757">Herriot, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0170840612464757">Hollway, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0170840612464757">Iles, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0170840612464757">Iles &amp; Salaman, 1995</xref>). The <italic>psychometric approach</italic> assumes that every job consists of a number of discrete tasks, that individuals possess stable attributes and that job and person can be measured independently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0170840612464757">McCourt, 1999</xref>). It aims to develop and test selection tools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0170840612464757">Herriot &amp; Anderson, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0170840612464757">Iles, 1999</xref>) that enable selectors to identify, step by step, the candidate whose attributes objectively best match the job and organizational requirements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0170840612464757">Kristof-Brown, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0170840612464757">Ramsay &amp; Scholarios, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0170840612464757">Sandberg, 2000</xref>). In this regard, testing the validity and reliability of selection tools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0170840612464757">Sackett &amp; Lievens, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0170840612464757">Schmidt &amp; Hunter, 1998</xref>) becomes a core issue.</p>
<p>Although not opposed to testing, the <italic>social process approach</italic> claims that selection tools that do not have a high proven validity and reliability can be judged favourably due to their usability in establishing a psychological contract between candidate and organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0170840612464757">Anderson, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0170840612464757">de Wolff, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0170840612464757">Herriot, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0170840612464757">Lockyer &amp; Scholarios, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0170840612464757">Schuler, 1993</xref>). Instead of treating interpersonal dynamics as interfering elements, the social process approach puts these dynamics at the forefront and explores the relationship between individual and organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0170840612464757">Herriot, 1993</xref>).</p>
<p>Although they have different research foci, the two dominant approaches converge in important ways. First, both take the individual, i.e. selector and candidate, as the unit of analysis and largely disregard the social context in which selection takes place (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0170840612464757">Hollway, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0170840612464757">Ramsay &amp; Scholarios, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0170840612464757">Venn, 1984</xref>). Second, both emphasize the interaction or fit between person-job and person-organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0170840612464757">Kristof-Brown, 2000</xref>) at the expense of intra-organizational processes, which means that they only provide a ‘partial account’ of selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0170840612464757">Ramsay &amp; Scholarios, 1999</xref>, p. 64). Third, and most importantly, by conceptualizing selection decision making as a series of steps, they do not attend to decision making per se. As a result, little is known about how selection decision making actually takes place.</p>
<p>Although some studies focus more directly on selection decision making, they mainly investigate individuals’ decisional processes (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0170840612464757">Herriot &amp; Rothwell, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0170840612464757">Herriot &amp; Wingrove, 1984</xref>). A few experimentally designed studies have been conducted (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0170840612464757">Graves &amp; Karren, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0170840612464757">Highhouse &amp; Bottrill, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0170840612464757">Hough &amp; Oswald, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0170840612464757">Kristof-Brown, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0170840612464757">Slaughter, Bagger, &amp; Li, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0170840612464757">Slaughter, Sinar, &amp; Highhouse, 1999</xref>), but they have either used self-report techniques or simulated decision making processes and thus paid little attention to decision making ‘in real life situations with real life candidates’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-0170840612464757">Zysberg &amp; Nevo, 2004</xref>, p. 118).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0170840612464757">Silverman and Jones (1976)</xref> probably go closest to investigating how selection decisions are made in situ in their study of employment interviews, group selection activities and selectors’ post-interview discussions of the candidates. They found that selectors made their decisions early on in the interviews and thereafter worked to confirm and justify the rationality of those decisions. However, they did not study ‘how’ in the sense that they analysed decision making as it occurs. Indeed, they claim that it would require direct access to selectors’ thoughts during the unfolding interview. As this is impossible, the researcher is left with methods that capture nothing but ex post facto rationalizations of a known outcome. In this study, we contest this claim and argue that it is possible to investigate <italic>how</italic> selectors accomplish selection decision making as it occurs by studying w<italic>hat discursive processes and considerations selectors are engaged in when making decisions about whether a candidate should be offered a job.</italic></p>

<title>An Ethnomethodological-Discourse Analytical Approach to Selection Decision Making</title>
<p>We adopted a combined ethnomethodological-discourse analytical approach to investigate how selectors accomplish decision making in practice. Ethnomethodology conceptualizes sensemaking as an intersubjective rather than individual process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0170840612464757">Gephart, Topal, &amp; Zhang, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0170840612464757">Llewellyn &amp; Spence, 2009</xref>). As Gephart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0170840612464757">1993</xref>, p. 1470) notes, a key assumption is that ‘sensemaking occurs and can be studied in the discourses of social members – the intersubjective social world – rather than simply occurring in their minds’. In a similar way, we argue that by studying the discourses of actual selection decision meetings, it is possible to describe how selectors collectively make sense of and make decisions about candidates (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0170840612464757">Alby &amp; Zucchermaglio, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0170840612464757">Boden, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0170840612464757">Gephart, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0170840612464757">Huisman, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0170840612464757">Potter, 1996</xref>). Below we give an overview of the central features and concepts of ethnomethodology and discourse analysis and then discuss how we have combined them.</p>
<sec id="section4-0170840612464757">
<title>Ethnomethodology</title>
<p>Ethnomethodology focuses on the everyday commonsense knowledge and interpretive practices actors rely upon in producing and maintaining social reality. Its fundamental question is how do people collectively and methodically create and sustain a sense of social reality as objectively ‘there’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0170840612464757">Garfinkel, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0170840612464757">Heritage, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0170840612464757">Leiter, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0170840612464757">Rawls, 2008</xref>)? <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0170840612464757">Garfinkel (1967)</xref> proposes <italic>the documentary method of interpretation</italic> as core to exploring this question. It highlights that actors treat ‘successive presented appearances’ of people, action and activities as pointing to a presumed underlying pattern, while simultaneously also using ‘what is known’ to further interpret ‘what is seen’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0170840612464757">Heritage, 1984</xref>, pp. 84–97). However, the documentary method is far from algorithmic. Instead, the actors’ understandings of what is going on are at any given stage ‘provisional, “loose” and subject to revision’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0170840612464757">Heritage, 1987</xref>, p. 238). Indeed, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0170840612464757">Garfinkel (1967)</xref> emphasized that the production of social reality is an ongoing accomplishment. First, the <italic>indexical</italic> or context-bound property of talk, objects and events means that actors must continuously assemble a context for interpretation in order to define their meaning in particular circumstances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0170840612464757">Leiter, 1980</xref>, pp. 107–38; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0170840612464757">Heritage, 1984</xref>, pp. 142–57). In most situations, this unending openness of talk is unproblematic since actors trust one another to ‘fill in’ and competently make sense of what each is saying. However, in situations where ‘actors are called upon to make evident, or defend, the clarity, precision, exhaustiveness, consistency, reproducibility, objectivity, disinterestedness – i.e. the rationality – of their descriptions, explanations and accounts’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0170840612464757">Heritage, 1984</xref>, p. 157), they will try to erase contextual attachments and minimize the need for interpretation. Second, the <italic>reflexive</italic> property of social phenomena means that accounts reveal certain features of settings but, since the accounts are indexical, the settings also provide the specific sense of the accounts; they constitute each other reflexively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0170840612464757">Leiter, 1980</xref>, pp. 138–148).</p>
<p>Ethnomethodologists criticize the stance usually taken in decision making literature where rules possess ‘stable operational meanings invariant to the exigencies of actual situations of use’, are ‘distinct from the practical interests, perspective, and interpretive practices of the rule user’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-0170840612464757">Zimmerman, 1970</xref>, p. 223) and produce action in a rather straightforward fashion. Instead, they emphasize the need to investigate the reasoning involved in the application of rules in concrete situations of decision making, such as under what circumstances actors conclude that a rule is applicable, how actors elaborate the sense of a rule and what actors see as an instance of applying a rule.</p>
<p>Ethnomethodological studies have in a wide range of different contexts highlighted two central aspects of how decisions are made in practice (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0170840612464757">Alby &amp; Zucchermaglio, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0170840612464757">Bittner, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0170840612464757">Cicourel, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0170840612464757">Huisman, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0170840612464757">Leiter, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0170840612464757">Potter &amp; Hepburn, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0170840612464757">Suchman, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0170840612464757">Sudnow, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0170840612464757">Wieder, 1970</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0170840612464757">1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-0170840612464757">Zimmerman, 1970</xref>). First, since rules are indexical, decision making involves taking the practical circumstances into consideration and providing ad hoc grounds for why and how a rule is or is not applicable. The particular sense of a rule is thus specific to the situation in which it is employed and since every context consists of new particulars, rules are always applied ‘for another first time’. Second, actors use rules as interpretive schemes to make sense of the circumstances in which they find themselves as circumstances of a certain kind, and of their relationships to others as relationships of a certain kind. These interpretive schemes are thus used to identify ‘what has occurred’ and reflexively produce practical reality, and thereby also used to evaluate the range of future actions that may be taken. Taken together, these two aspects mean that ‘“action” and “context” are mutually elaborative and mutually determinative elements in a simultaneous equation that the actors are continually solving and re-solving to determine the nature of the events in which they are placed’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0170840612464757">Heritage, 1987</xref>, p. 242).</p>

<title>Discourse analysis</title>
<p>Although we share ethnomethodology’s analytic interests and use key ethnomethodological concepts to drive our data interpretation, we follow a methodology that builds on discourse analysis rather than conversation analysis, which is commonly used in ethnomethodologically oriented studies. Conversation analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0170840612464757">Atkinson, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0170840612464757">Atkinson &amp; Heritage, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0170840612464757">Heritage, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0170840612464757">Maynard &amp; Clayman, 1991</xref>) focuses primarily on the turn-by-turn sequential organization of spoken interaction in order to investigate what conversational methods people use and how they use them ‘for producing orderly social interaction’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0170840612464757">Silverman, 2011</xref>, p. 286). In contrast, discourse analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0170840612464757">Potter, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0170840612464757">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0170840612464757">Potter &amp; Wetherell, 1987</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0170840612464757">1994</xref>) focuses on discourse as ‘“situated” language use in the contexts in which it takes place’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0170840612464757">Jørgensen &amp; Phillips, 2002</xref>, p. 118) in order to examine how versions of ‘reality’ are ‘produced, dealt with and made relevant by participants in and through interaction’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0170840612464757">Hepburn &amp; Wiggins, 2005</xref>, p. 595). In other words, discourse analysis implies an interest not only in constitutive interactional activity but also in the ‘constitutive and constituted <italic>whats</italic> of everyday life’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0170840612464757">Gubrium &amp; Holstein, 2000</xref>, p. 493). However, the exact nature of the similarities and differences between the two, and their relative merits, are subject to recurrent discussion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0170840612464757">Billig, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0170840612464757">Hepburn &amp; Potter, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0170840612464757">Schegloff, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0170840612464757">Silverman, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0170840612464757">Wetherell, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-0170840612464757">Wooffitt, 2005</xref>). While conversation analysis has been criticized, both from within and from without, for having an ‘unduly restricted perspective’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0170840612464757">Atkinson, 1988</xref>, p. 441), discourse analysis has been criticized for imposing analysts’ own terms and concerns and thereby reifying discourse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0170840612464757">Schegloff, 1997</xref>). Our reason for opting for discourse analysis in investigating selection decision making is that it provides a broader analytic focus, in the sense that it is not confined to sequential organization but extends to rhetorical organization, allows a wider analysis of function and takes a more interpretive stance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0170840612464757">Billig, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0170840612464757">Potter, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-0170840612464757">Wooffitt, 2005</xref>).</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section7-0170840612464757">
<title>Design and data collection</title>
<p>We conducted an in-depth real-time study of the selection of IT professionals (systems developers, business developers and strategy consultants) in two medium-sized IT businesses, herein called IT Consultant and IT Bank. IT Consultant was the Swedish subsidiary of a global technology consulting group, while IT Bank supplied all IT solutions to its group. In both organizations, job applications were examined first by HR specialists who short-listed promising candidates. The chosen candidates were then interviewed once, twice or three times by selectors (HR specialists, managers and colleagues). IT Consultant used case interviews where candidates presented prepared solutions to cases. References were taken and, in some instances, a personality test administered.</p>
<p>In addition to interviews with four HR specialists to obtain background information, the study comprised real-time observations of eight selection decision meetings, four in each organization, all held directly after the employment interviews and lasting about 15 minutes. Selectors dealt with the candidates one by one, in each meeting deciding whether a specific candidate should be offered a job. Seven of the candidates were native Swedes and one was a Greek immigrant. They were between 30 and 55 years old and all held university degrees. Six of the candidates were men and two were women.</p>
<p>The decision meetings were audio-recorded and transcribed according to the conventions in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0170840612464757">Wetherell and Potter (1992)</xref> (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0170840612464757">Table 1</xref>). The analysis was built from original transcripts in Swedish, from which extracts were translated for dissemination purposes.</p>

<title>Analysing data</title>
<p>Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0170840612464757">Boden (1994)</xref>, we make a distinction between ‘decisions’ and ‘decision making’. Decisions are often, as in our data, the focal point of organizational meetings. If decisions are defined as outcomes, however, they may not actually be produced in the meetings at all and, even if they are, objectively identifying them may be difficult. Decision making, on the other hand, is a more ‘observable feature’ of organizational settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0170840612464757">Boden, 1994</xref>, p. 84). Here, we view decision making as an incremental and interactional process that ‘can be located in the fine laminations of actions and reactions that build, from one moment to another, into the organization’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0170840612464757">Boden, 1994</xref>, p. 22) and we view selection decisions as selectors’ claims that decisions have been reached. In line with their view of assessment as part of decision making, selectors also made various claims during meetings about ‘what the candidates are like’ in terms of who they are and what they can do.</p>
<p>In the analysis we focused on how the selectors, through different procedures, intersubjectively produced versions of the candidates and selection decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0170840612464757">Potter, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0170840612464757">Potter &amp; Hepburn, 2008</xref>). We began by looking for instances where selectors made decision claims and found, in each case, that the selectors ostensibly agreed on a decision before the meeting was concluded. We initially contrasted hiring against non-hiring meetings, but did not find that differences in the decision outcome led to meaningful differences with respect to how the selectors made sense of and made decisions about candidates. However, when we focused on decision making rather than the decision itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0170840612464757">Boden, 1994</xref>), we found that some meetings were characterized by considerably more disagreement than others. In some, the selectors discussed only one version of the candidate and only one selection decision, whereas in others they constructed different versions of the same candidate and/or propagated different decisions about the same candidate. The meetings were consequently grouped into two categories: initial agreement (three meetings in IT Bank and one in IT Consultant) and initial disagreement (one meeting in IT Bank and three in IT Consultant).</p>
<p>In the next phase, we approached the categories one by one and looked for patterns in the material. Discourse analytical studies typically look for three types of pattern when investigating how versions are constructed and dealt with by participants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0170840612464757">Potter, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-0170840612464757">Wood &amp; Kroger, 2000</xref>). The first is <italic>variability</italic> in and between participants’ accounts and formulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0170840612464757">Hepburn &amp; Potter, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0170840612464757">Potter, 2011</xref>). This involves searching for variation in content and structure, for example ‘differences in descriptions of objects and events, stylistic shifts, and the choice of different words’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0170840612464757">Potter, 2004</xref>, p. 616). Analysis of variability is key since it is essentially an analysis of what is being done in a particular piece of discourse. The second is <italic>rhetorical organization</italic> which involves attending to how one version relates to other actual or potential versions of the same phenomenon, in particular, how they are organized to be persuasive and undermine alternatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0170840612464757">Billig, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0170840612464757">Potter, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0170840612464757">Potter &amp; Edwards, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0170840612464757">Potter &amp; Wetherell, 1994</xref>). Finally, <italic>fact construction</italic> focuses attention on how versions are made to seem factual and independent of the speaker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0170840612464757">Edwards, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0170840612464757">Edwards &amp; Potter, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0170840612464757">Potter, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>By looking for variability, rhetorical organization and fact construction, we tracked the emergence of versions of the candidates throughout the meetings. We explored how selectors built versions by making claims about the candidate, and how various claims led to the emergence of what selectors understood as a coherent whole or as different versions. We also considered how selectors substantiated their claims and how these substantiations created a sense of facticity of versions. Finally, we explored how agreement was ostensibly reached and, relatedly, how decision claims were made.</p>
<p>In this manner, we derived from the data four interrelated <italic>discursive processes</italic> through which selectors collectively make sense of and make decisions about candidates in decision meetings: assembling versions of the candidates, i.e. how selectors constituted the candidates by describing their attributes; establishing versions of the candidates as factual, i.e. how selectors substantiated their claims about the candidates by constructing facts from information about the candidates; reaching selection decisions, i.e. how selectors made decision claims; and using selection tools as sensemaking devices, i.e. how selectors used selection tools as interpretive schemes. We found that these discursive processes, which operate in parallel rather than sequentially, play out differently depending on the basic meeting form: initial agreement or initial disagreement.</p>

<title>Displaying data</title>
<p>The analysis was performed on all eight decision making meetings, but due to space consideration we display and discuss four meetings in the current text (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0170840612464757">Table 2</xref>). Since the analysis focuses on how the decision making process takes place, these particular meetings were chosen to achieve representativeness with regard to the organization in which they were conducted as well as the form of decision making. Although including all eight meetings would have given the reader a fuller understanding of the data, we believe the four included here provide representative examples of the analytic themes we wish to discuss in the paper.</p>

<title>Results: How Candidates are Selected for Jobs</title>
<p>In this section we describe the results of our analysis in three emerging steps. First, we present an interpretation of four decision meetings one by one. In this precursory step we describe how each meeting evolved and explore claims selectors made about candidates and decisions. Building on this we next derive and discuss four discursive processes involved in selection decision making. Finally, we integrate the analysis by conceptualizing selection decision making in situ as ongoing practical deliberation.</p>

<p>Gustav (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0170840612464757">Data Display 1</xref>) is currently working in the IT consultancy industry and has applied for a systems developer position at IT Bank.

<p>Invited to begin, Ludvig describes what he ‘thinks’ about Gustav. He claims that Gustav is ‘very good’ and that he has a number of positive attributes: he keeps a ‘pretty low profile’, has a ‘nice’ but ‘a bit reserved’ manner and is ‘quite secure in what he does’ (lines 4–8). The only seemingly negative attribute he mentions is that Gustav is ‘not particularly adaptable’. However, Ludvig explains that this means that Gustav ‘doesn’t want to throw himself into the unknown’, and his lack of adaptability is not seen as a disadvantage but rather as a reason for him to leave the more volatile consultancy business. At the end of line 8, Ludvig initiates a discussion about how he and Cecilia conducted the interview. This discussion is concluded at the beginning of line 26, where Gustav’s lack of experience in the specific programming area is used to explain why they couldn’t challenge him. Instead, Ludvig uses two other information pieces, Gustav’s ‘overall experience’ and the references, as evidence to support his positive interpretation.</p>
<p>Next Ludvig focuses on Gustav’s personality profile, which he has drawn on the whiteboard (line 26). As the selectors have not yet received the test results it is a presumed profile, which is recognized as deviant and gives rise to laughter (lines 28–33). Nonetheless, Ludvig says that the profile explains ‘everything’ (line 28). In line 33, Cecilia confirms that her interpretation of Gustav is positive as well.</p>
<p>In lines 39–40, the selectors state a decision to make Gustav an offer and then voice further claims about his attributes. His lack of assertiveness is de-emphasized by pointing to his willingness ‘to learn’ and improve ‘within a small niche’ (lines 41–4). The presumed profile is used (lines 45–9) to explain why Gustav is not comfortable taking the role of project manager: he is ‘in-between on creativity’ and ‘very low on the social’. It also puts these seemingly negative attributes into perspective: they are part of his profile, a profile which more importantly includes positive attributes such as a ‘capacity and will to deliver’ and ‘a pretty strong engine’. As Ludvig concludes, Gustav is ‘good at what he does’.</p>
<p>In the last extract, the selectors discuss several divergences from ‘normal’ interview behaviour: that Gustav did not sell himself (lines 63–4) and that he wasn’t dressed up or nervous (lines 65–8). Ludvig explains these divergences by pointing out that Gustav’s question is if he ‘buys’ IT Bank rather than whether they ‘buy’ him (lines 64, 69).</p>

<p>The selectors elaborate their version of Evert, claiming that he is ‘incoherent’ (line 9), ‘rambling’ and ‘very vague’ (line 10) and ‘confused’ (line 11). He is also portrayed as misreading the interview situation, in that he does not understand that he is expected to know what he wants (line 16) and to talk about himself and what he is good at (line 18), as well as what he has worked with previously (line 20).</p>
<p>The selectors use a number of different information sources as evidence to support their interpretation. Cecilia mentions the telephone call in which she booked the interview (line 15) as well as his unstructured application (lines 15, 20). Later, the interview is used as evidence. Ellen says that the first ‘signal’ was when Evert said that he wasn’t allowed to implement his ideas (line 63) and the second was when he said that the reason for this was that his boss seemed to be having personal problems (line 64). With her ironic comment ‘not that he knew, but still’ (line 64), Cecilia casts doubt on the validity of Evert’s description of his work situation. Cecilia and Ellen also agree that even if Evert’s description is correct, ‘that’s not something you say’ during an interview (lines 67–8).</p>

<p>After initial discussions about the financial situation at Jonas’s employer, the participants invite Oscar to be the first to have a say about Jonas (line 23). Oskar says that he ‘kind of thinks’ that Jonas is a generalist. He isn’t a candidate who makes Oskar feel ‘yes, there you have it’, but it is difficult to know what that means (line 34). Either Jonas can handle any type of task, or he isn’t good at anything and won’t fit in anywhere (line 23). As the meeting proceeds, the selectors continue to probe into who Jonas is. Nils asks if he is good at creating structure (lines 45–9) and Camilla asks how he handles conflicts (lines 74–9). Eventually Nils and Sophia summarize the unanswered questions (lines 84–6).</p>
<p>A first step to resolving the ambiguity is taken when the selectors discuss Jonas’s salary request (lines 116–27). It provides a context for their interpretation: <italic>if</italic> they make him an offer, he has to live up to resultant high expectations and they do not think he will be able to do so (lines 118–25). A second step is taken when the selectors compare Jonas to another candidate – the ‘perfect’ Mats (lines 157–8) – who could have been sent ‘right in to customers’, but Oskar doesn’t ‘see that’ with Jonas. The comparison opens for the claim that Jonas is ‘definitely’ a generalist (line 162) and the decision to turn him down (line 163).</p>

<p>An initial show of hands indicates that only Martin is in favour of making Henry an offer, so Martin is the ‘odd man out’ (line 16). He acknowledges that Henry gave a ‘bad’ and ‘clumsy’ impression (line 17). He claims that although Henry hasn’t worked as a consultant (line 24), he does have ‘valuable’ knowledge and the potential to ‘learn how to become’ one (line 28). The other selectors, however, jointly propagate a version of Henry as someone who ‘hardly’ has the potential to learn (line 29). This version is elaborated when Henry is described as a ‘controller’ who ‘doesn’t think about where we’re heading’ (line 49). Martin defends him, arguing that that’s because he has another role today and that he didn’t present himself favourably (line 50). Rather than accepting this as mitigating circumstances, the others see it as evidence that Henry is unsuited for consulting work, since it involves direct interaction with clients (lines 51–3).</p>
<p>Along the same lines, all but Martin claim that Henry is too ‘vague’, providing support from Henry’s presentation (lines 58–63). Martin, now irritated, interrupts and again remarks that Henry is a former IT manager (line 64), but the argument falls on deaf ears (lines 65–7). Martin tries once again to support his interpretation by pointing out that Henry has ‘specific knowledge’ and was ‘extremely nervous’ (line 74) and that he improved when he ‘relaxed a bit’ (line 79). However, the meaning of his nervousness is also contested; rather than bringing their interpretation closer to Martin’s, it makes them all the more convinced that Henry is unsuited (lines 75–82). Finally, Martin consents to the ‘no offer’ decision (line 86–9).</p>

<sec id="section17-0170840612464757">
<title>Assembling versions of the candidates</title>
<p>A key concern for the selectors is to assess the candidates and assemble versions of ‘what they are like’ in the sense of who they are and what they can do. In the meetings characterized by <italic>initial agreement</italic> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0170840612464757">DD 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0170840612464757">2</xref>), the selectors typically assemble versions of the candidate in a smooth manner. They do so by choosing to discuss certain attributes of the candidates. They describe Gustav as secure, reserved, willing to learn and capable of delivering (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0170840612464757">DD 1</xref>) and Evert as incoherent, rambling and vague (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0170840612464757">DD 2</xref>). In choosing to discuss these attributes and not others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0170840612464757">Garfinkel, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0170840612464757">Heritage, 1984</xref>, pp. 150–1), the selectors assemble specific versions of Gustav and Evert and thereby constitute them as persons with certain attributes. Gustav is interpreted as being good at what he does and Evert as one of the worst candidates.</p>
<p>Although the attributes are descriptive, they lend themselves to several meanings and selectors establish their specific sense when they use them in concrete selection situations to describe specific candidates. For example, the sense of Evert’s incoherency (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0170840612464757">DD 2</xref>, line 9) is elaborated as Cecilia successively describes him as having no clear direction, no clear intention, floating around and losing his thread. Their inherent indexicality is most clearly recognizable when the attributes and the version do not match at first glance. For example, Gustav is ‘not particularly adaptable’ but in context this seemingly negative attribute means that he is secure (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0170840612464757">DD 1</xref>, line 8). Likewise, his lack of assertiveness is contrasted to his willingness to focus on one area. Assertiveness has been decisive in <italic>other</italic> cases; in <italic>this</italic> case, it is more important that he ‘wants to learn’ (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0170840612464757">DD 1</xref>, lines 41–4).</p>
<p>In describing the candidates’ attributes and giving them local meaning, the selectors are relying on the first of the two parts that make up the documentary method of interpretation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0170840612464757">Garfinkel, 1967</xref>, p. 78). When describing Gustav as keeping a low profile and being secure in what he does (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0170840612464757">DD 1</xref>, lines 1–8), the selectors begin to establish an underlying pattern of Gustav as someone who is good at what he does. When describing Evert as incoherent and vague (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0170840612464757">DD 2</xref>, lines 7–20), the selectors confirm a presumed version of Evert as unfocused. Once a version of the candidate is ‘known’, the selectors use it to interpret other attributes that are brought to light, which is the second part of the interpretation process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0170840612464757">Garfinkel, 1967</xref>, p. 78). In <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0170840612464757">DD 1</xref>, the selectors use their version of Gustav as a strong candidate to explain his divergences from ‘normal’ interview behaviour (lines 63–9). In <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0170840612464757">DD 2</xref>, the selectors use their version of Evert as unfocused to explain why there was no structured CV (line 20). In this manner, the selectors discursively build an overall picture from separate parts and, at the same time, interpret separate parts in the light of the overall picture.</p>
<p>In meetings characterized by <italic>initial disagreement</italic> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0170840612464757">DD 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-0170840612464757">4</xref>) selectors experience instead some difficulty in establishing the candidates’ attributes. The selectors in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0170840612464757">DD 3</xref> make repeated attempts to reach a conclusive interpretation of Jonas’s attributes and establish an underlying pattern of who he is. Not until line 162 is a definitive claim made. In <xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-0170840612464757">DD 4</xref>, the meaning of the fact that Henry is a former IT manager remains contested until Martin gives in (line 83). This ambiguity causes selectors to get ‘snared’ in the interpretation process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0170840612464757">Heritage, 1984</xref>, pp. 84–97) and employ ad hoc practices to resolve the situation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0170840612464757">Wieder, 1970</xref>), as further explored below (see Reaching selection decisions).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-0170840612464757">
<title>Establishing the versions of the candidates as factual</title>
<p>Closely intertwined with the process of assembling versions of the candidates is one of establishing these versions as factual. This is key, since the selectors, as professionals, are concerned to show that their assessments are based on facts and that they are well-informed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0170840612464757">Heritage, 1984</xref>, p. 158).</p>
<p>In order to establish the assembled versions as factual rather than as one of many possible versions, the selectors mobilize evidence by continually referring to various information sources. In the meetings characterized by <italic>initial agreement</italic>, selectors are able to mobilize supporting evidence in a coherent manner from the start of the meetings. In <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0170840612464757">DD 1</xref>, the version of Gustav as ‘good at what he does’ is supported when Ludvig mobilizes Gustav’s personality profile as evidence that he has a ‘capacity and will to deliver’ and ‘a pretty strong engine’ (lines 46–7). Similarly, Gustav’s dress and relaxed behaviour during the interview are used to indicate that he is a strong candidate when Ludvig states that ‘he didn’t have to try to impress us’ (line 69). In <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0170840612464757">DD 2</xref>, the version of Evert as incoherent, evasive and socially maladaptive is made factual through references to telephone contact (line 15), the application (lines 15, 20) as well as graphic descriptions of what Evert said and did during the interview. For example, Cecilia refers in a rather theatrical manner to her first impressions of Evert that were clear ‘from the moment [she] opened the door’ (lines 7–9).</p>
<p>When mobilizing evidence in this manner, the selectors establish their versions of the candidates as factual by rooting them in an external reality evident to any observer and thereby ostensibly reducing the need for interpretation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0170840612464757">Heritage, 1984</xref>, pp. 157–8). Moreover, their way of mobilizing evidence contributes to this effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0170840612464757">Billig, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0170840612464757">Edwards, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0170840612464757">Potter, 1996</xref>). For example, Cecilia’s comment ‘His boss had’ (line 62) works as a starting shot for a description that the selectors then take turns delivering. The repetition of ‘that’s not something you say’ (lines 67–8) strengthens the sense of joint description.</p>
<p>Selectors in meetings characterized by <italic>initial disagreement</italic> also attempt to strengthen their versions’ facticity, but they are unable to mobilize evidence that unambiguously points to one version. Each piece of evidence mobilized by the selectors in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0170840612464757">DD 3</xref>, e.g. that Jonas’s assertions in the interview were generally held (lines 25–34), leaves them with unanswered questions about what type of person Jonas is. Nothing they say is ‘go’ or ‘no go’ (line 84). In <xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-0170840612464757">DD 4</xref>, the selectors agree that Henry’s performance during the interview was poor (lines 17–24). Despite this, Martin attempts to produce evidence that supports his version of Henry as employable: he has ‘valuable’, ‘specific’ knowledge (lines 28 and 74), his role has been that of IT manager (lines 24 and 64), he was ‘extremely nervous’ (line 74), and he improved as the interview progressed (lines 28 and 79). However, the other selectors use each of these pieces of evidence to support their version of Henry as unsuited. The selectors in these meetings are thus initially unsuccessful in eliminating the need for interpretation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-0170840612464757">
<title>Reaching selection decisions</title>
<p>Although assembling versions of the candidates and establishing them as factual are essential in the decision making process, the formal purpose of the meetings is to reach selection decisions. In the meetings characterized by <italic>initial agreement</italic>, the first two processes are closely intertwined with the third. Through the documentary method of interpretation, the candidate is interpreted on the basis of certain information at the same time as the interpretation highlights the specific information in question as essential to understanding the candidate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0170840612464757">Leiter, 1974</xref>). Hence, the version of the candidate reflexively constitutes the candidate as a person with certain definitive attributes. The selectors do not treat their version of Gustav as good at what he does (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0170840612464757">DD 1</xref>), or their version of Evert as the worst candidate (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0170840612464757">DD 2</xref>), as one of many possible versions. These versions are, for the moment and in the local situation, true pictures of what type of people they are. This does not mean that there are no question marks regarding the candidate’s attributes or the mobilized evidence (e.g. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0170840612464757">DD 1</xref>, lines 43 and 68; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0170840612464757">DD 2</xref>, line 20), but that the selectors are able to resolve them in such a way as to sustain the established versions. ‘Knowing’ whom Gustav and Evert are, the selectors ‘see’ obvious selection decisions and easily make decision claims (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0170840612464757">DD 1</xref>, lines 39–40; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0170840612464757">DD 2</xref>, line 15).</p>
<p>In the meetings characterized by <italic>initial disagreement</italic>, the versions of the candidates are considerably less clear-cut. Jonas (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0170840612464757">DD 3</xref>) can either handle any type of task, or isn’t good at anything. As former IT manager Henry (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-0170840612464757">DD 4</xref>) either has valuable knowledge or is entirely unsuitable. ‘Confronted with having to make a choice’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0170840612464757">Wieder, 1970</xref>, p. 129), the selectors employ ad hoc practices to resolve the situation in a way that makes it possible for them to reach decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0170840612464757">Garfinkel, 1967</xref>, pp. 76–103; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-0170840612464757">Zimmerman, 1970</xref>). In <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0170840612464757">DD 3</xref>, Jonas’s salary request and the comparison with Mats reconstruct the situation and open the way for the ‘no offer’ decision. Once reached, the decision enables the selectors to interpret Jonas’s attributes in a particular way and, thus, assemble a specific version of Jonas as unemployable (lines 158–63). Simultaneously the attributes become ‘proof’ that the right decision has been made. In <xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-0170840612464757">DD 4</xref>, the selectors instead reach a decision by ignoring that they interpret Henry differently. Although the selectors’ discussions could go on endlessly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0170840612464757">Garfinkel, 1967</xref>, pp. 24–31), their task is not to agree on a fully detailed candidate description, whatever the cost. Martin may not be convinced that the others’ version is more correct than his own is but he ‘agrees to disagree’, as a result of which they are able to put an end to discussions and reach the ‘no offer’ decision (lines 83–9). By reconstructing the situation, ignoring critical aspects or other such practices, the selectors are thus able to avoid difficulties and move the decision making process forward, even in the face of ambiguity, while also sustaining a sense of intelligibility.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section20-0170840612464757">
<title>Using selection tools as sensemaking devices</title>
<p>As discussed above, the selectors in all the meetings continually refer to selection tools they have used, primarily the employment interview but also others such as selection criteria and personality tests. <italic>How</italic> these selection tools are used in decision making merits attention due to the central role they are assigned in the dominant approaches to employee selection.</p>
<p>In <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0170840612464757">DD 1</xref>, Gustav’s presumed personality profile is used as an explanatory resource several times during the meeting (lines 45–9, 63–4). Since the selectors do not have access to the test results yet, the personality test cannot be said to provide an objective description of Gustav, nor can it be used as grounds for decision making in any formal sense. However, the distinction between the ‘real’ and the ‘presumed’, although noted (lines 26–30), is uninteresting to the selectors in their continued discussions. Regardless of whether the profile is objective and real or not, it functions as a sensemaking device that helps the selectors establish a version of Gustav as someone who is ‘good at what he does’ and reach their decision to make him an offer.</p>
<p>In a similar way, the case interview is central in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0170840612464757">DD 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-0170840612464757">4</xref>. Referring to Jonas’s presentation, the selectors make sense of Jonas as a fairly skilled consultant (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0170840612464757">DD 3</xref>, lines 45, 74, 79, 86). The candidate’s ability to take a consultative role is said to be the most important selection criterion in IT Consultant, yet in view of doubts raised regarding more internally oriented skills (lines 45 and 76) a suggestion to make him an offer is never brought up. In <xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-0170840612464757">DD 4</xref>, Martin instead considers making Henry an offer (line 28) although they all agree that his case presentation was poor (lines 17–24).</p>
<p>Using personality profiles, case interviews and other selection tools as sensemaking devices helps selectors reconstitute the unfolding selection process by moulding myriad impressions of the candidates into successively more specific versions. This reduces ambiguity and lays a foundation for the next action, be it making a certain decision or explaining the reasons for making a certain decision. As is particularly clear in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0170840612464757">DD 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-0170840612464757">4</xref>, these actions are not determined by the selection tools, as presumed by dominant approaches to selection (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0170840612464757">Anastasi &amp; Urbina, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0170840612464757">Compton et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0170840612464757">Gatewood et al., 2010</xref>) where tools are seen as a set of rules that dictate the production of action. Instead, the rules are used as interpretive schemes that identify ‘what has occurred’, and establish a range of possible next actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0170840612464757">Heritage, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0170840612464757">Leiter, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0170840612464757">Wieder, 1974</xref>). Regardless of the results the tools show, selectors are thus always facing a choice. They can comply with the rules, adjust them or even disregard them, depending on how they interpret the particular situation in which they find themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0170840612464757">Boden, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0170840612464757">Leiter, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-0170840612464757">Zimmerman, 1970</xref>). Hence, the selectors orient towards, rather than strictly follow, the rules that the selection tools represent.</p>

<title>Practical deliberation: Selection decision making as it occurs in situ</title>
<p>We propose ‘practical deliberation’ as an overarching conceptualization of how selection decision making takes place in situ. The selectors’ practical deliberations centre around two discursive constructs: the versions of the candidates and the selection decisions. The selectors use the documentary method to put together ‘what the candidate is like’ by describing the candidate’s attributes and giving these attributes local meaning. However, they also interpret new attributes in terms of the presupposed versions, actively evaluating whether the versions fit with what they already ‘know’. The versions may thus, at any given moment, be subject to revision. Practical deliberation also involves grounding the versions in an external reality by mobilizing evidence in the form of information obtained from different sources. The versions constructed in this manner are not general but local pictures of the candidates, created specifically for the purpose of making selection decisions. Often, the selection decisions are based on these local versions but sometimes the versions are based on the decisions made. In fact, our analysis provides no general rule about which is produced first, the version or the decision.</p>
<p>Making the version of the candidate and the decision meaningfully consistent with each other is a central feature of practical deliberation. The selectors’ work of fitting together versions and decisions ties into how they orient toward different temporal dimensions of sensemaking processes: the past, the present and the future (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0170840612464757">Boden, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0170840612464757">Emirbayer &amp; Mische, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0170840612464757">Gephart et al., 2010</xref>). The present is the site of ‘practical decision making in face to face, everyday life contexts’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0170840612464757">Gephart et al., 2010</xref>, p. 280) in which actors, on the one hand, retrospectively orient towards the past and what has happened and, on the other, prospectively orient towards the future and possible trajectories of action. As Heritage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0170840612464757">1983</xref>, pp. 119–120) points out, future trajectories are highly influenced by standards of accountability that ‘constrain the range of actions which an actor may be prepared to undertake’. Together, this ‘chordal triad’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0170840612464757">Emirbayer &amp; Mische, 1998</xref>, p. 972) of temporal dimensions indicates that actors are ‘constantly and reflexively tying past to future through present orientations’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0170840612464757">Boden, 1994</xref>, p. 48).</p>
<p>The retrospective-prospective orientation means that the selectors <italic>simultaneously</italic> consider the version of the candidate and the selection decision in the light of available standards of accountability. In assembling a certain version of the candidate, the selectors rehearse a certain selection decision. Knowing that they are responsible for the decisions they make and that they may be asked to account for them, they fit their version with the meaningfully consistent decision. Likewise, in making a certain selection decision, the selectors rehearse a certain version of the candidate; they fit their decision with the meaningfully consistent version. In the meetings characterized by initial agreement, achieving this fit is a smooth process that does not require many rehearsals. In the meetings characterized by initial disagreement, however, there is more work involved in the sense that the revisions of the versions and decisions are more substantial.</p>
<p>In sum, practical deliberation conceptualizes the selectors’ <italic>situated</italic> work of simultaneously orienting toward the version of the candidate and the selection decision, all while both are being constructed during the decision meetings. The selectors reason in a <italic>methodical</italic> manner: they use selection tools to interpret the candidates, discuss the candidates’ attributes and establish what they mean and how important they are in relation to other attributes; they mobilize information that supports their versions as factual; they try the versions and decisions to make sure they fit together.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In this study we have investigated <italic>how</italic> selection decision making takes place in practice by adopting a combined ethnomethodological-discourse analytical approach and pursuing the question: <italic>what discursive processes and considerations are selectors engaged in when making decisions about whether a candidate should be offered a job</italic>? The results show that selection decision making in situ takes two basic forms, one characterized by initial agreement and one by initial disagreement, and that each form is defined by ongoing practical deliberation among selectors. The deliberation involves four interrelated discursive processes: assembling versions of the candidates; establishing the versions of the candidates as factual; reaching selection decisions; and using selection tools as sensemaking devices.</p>
<p>These findings make several contributions. First, and most important, the results challenge the dominant psychometric and social process approaches to selection and several of their underlying assumptions in significant ways. Both approaches conceptualize selection decision making as a step-by-step process that produces the optimal decision. In contrast, the results from this study suggest that selection decision making is defined by ongoing practical deliberation in which selectors interactively make sense of and make decisions about candidates and orient towards making their constructions of the candidates and the selection decisions meaningfully consistent with each other. Importantly, this practical deliberation varies depending on whether the selection decision is characterized by initial agreement or initial disagreement.</p>
<p>Moreover, the results challenge the essentialist assumption that candidates possess intrinsic attributes, which are uncovered through the selection process. Instead, selectors actively construct local versions of the candidates that for all practical purposes make the candidates into individuals with certain definite attributes. That is, selectors interpret candidates on the basis of certain information and, at the same time, their interpretations reflexively highlight this specific information as essential to understanding the candidates. We therefore argue that it is more meaningful to speak of how information about candidates is mobilized and made relevant than how it is collected and analysed.</p>
<p>The results also challenge the assumption that selection tools can be used to identify and objectively measure candidates’ attributes and, based on that, decide which of the candidates best match the job requirements. Instead of functioning as objective measurement instruments, selection tools are used as sensemaking devices to make sense of, and produce factual versions of, the candidates. Consequently, we argue that selection tools should also be developed and evaluated in terms of the extent to which they facilitate sensemaking processes, rather than their capacity to provide objective descriptions of candidates.</p>
<p>Furthermore, by focusing on selection tools and the steps leading up to decision making, rather than decision making per se, the dominant approaches have in many ways taken out the selectors from selection decision making. Our study illustrates how decision making is achieved through interaction and how understanding the intersubjective sensemaking processes of selectors is essential for understanding how decision making is accomplished, as it unfolds moment by moment. Hence, the results not only challenge existing theories of employee selection but also go beyond them by ‘putting people back in’, that is, by recognizing and taking seriously ‘the practical activities of real people engaged in concrete situations of social action’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0170840612464757">Boden, 1994</xref>, p. 10).</p>
<p>Second, previous interpretive studies have maintained that selection decision making is primarily retrospective (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0170840612464757">Salaman &amp; Thompson, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0170840612464757">Silverman &amp; Jones, 1976</xref>) in the sense that selection decisions made on certain grounds are justified ex post facto on other grounds. Although our results confirm a retrospective orientation, they also reveal a prospective orientation implicated in selection decisions. Since selectors always find themselves in the practical circumstances of an ongoing now, retrospective and prospective orientations will, in a process of ‘continual reevaluation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0170840612464757">Emirbayer &amp; Mische, 1998</xref>, p. 989), be reviewed as the circumstances change. Regardless of their basic form, the unfolding selection meetings show that there was room for selectors to challenge and indeed revise both the version of the candidate and the selection decision. When the context changes, so does the interpretation. Hence, what occurs during selection meetings is not only retrospective rewriting of history but also prospective forming of the future. We argue that there is an openness regarding selection decision meetings that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0170840612464757">Silverman and Jones (1976)</xref>, with their focus on the outcome, did not account for.</p>
<p>Third, the combined ethnomethodogical-discourse analytical approach offers an investigative framework that can be used to explore in situ not only selection decision making but also other human resource management (HRM) practices such as performance appraisal and competence assessment. Real-time studies of interactional detail contribute to knowledge of how HRM practices are accomplished in ordinary settings and may thus reduce the disturbing discrepancy between what academic research claims is efficient and what is regarded as efficient and valued by practitioners (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0170840612464757">Anderson et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0170840612464757">Ryan &amp; Tippins, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0170840612464757">Rynes et al., 2002</xref>). In this sense the study also contributes more broadly to the growing field of critical HRM research (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0170840612464757">Legge, 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0170840612464757">1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0170840612464757">Steyaert &amp; Janssens, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0170840612464757">Townley, 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0170840612464757">1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0170840612464757">Watson, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0170840612464757">2010</xref>) and its call for more non-prescriptive studies of HRM in organizations. In particular, real-time studies are likely to enable researchers to better ‘grasp the logic of practice’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0170840612464757">Sandberg &amp; Tsoukas, 2011</xref>) underlying various HRM practices in organizations and, thus, contribute to the development of theories more relevant to HRM practice. More generally, the combined ethnomethodological-discourse analytical approach and its findings also contribute to recent calls within organization studies for more ethnomethodologically informed research of real-time occurrences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0170840612464757">Llewellyn &amp; Hindmarsh, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0170840612464757">Samra-Fredericks &amp; Bargiela-Chiappini, 2008</xref>).</p>

<title>Implications for research on employee selection</title>
<p>The result that selection decision making is accomplished through selectors’ ongoing practical deliberation, rather than in a step-wise manner, has some major implications for employee selection research. One of the most significant concerns the point of departure for studying selection decision making in practice. Instead of using individual candidates and their attributes together with a focus on fit between candidate and job/organization, or the selection outcome as the unit of analysis, as proposed by existing approaches, the ethnomethodological-discourse analytical approach and its results suggest taking the <italic>discourse</italic> of actual selection decision making processes as the point of departure. The results show that such a shift enables us to generate significantly more detailed descriptions of what processes are actually involved and how selection tools are actually used in selection decision making as it occurs in situ. Such descriptions are likely to be crucial for being able to develop and evaluate procedures and tools that enable practitioners to improve selection decisions in organizations.</p>

<sec id="section24-0170840612464757">
<title>Some suggestions for future research</title>
<p>The study also points to several areas for further research. One is to explore in more detail how the two decision making forms (initial agreement and initial disagreement) lead to different trajectories of action. Another is to investigate further how different selection tools are used as sensemaking devices in selection decision making. Yet another is to examine the particular power and politics games that are likely to go on in selection decision meetings. For example, some selection committee members may try to dominate the process in various ways. While we, in this study, primarily focused on selection decision making in its local context, it is also necessary to investigate how the broader organizational context may shape the actual selection process.</p>
