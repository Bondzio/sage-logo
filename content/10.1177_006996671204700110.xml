<p>Asha Sarangi’s edited anthology, <italic>Language and Politics in India</italic>, is a timely compilation of key essays on the subject, given that language questions continue to represent forces of inequality thrown up by history, culture, ideology and political economy, all of which are keenly manifest in the ongoing re-organisation of states. Currently, as Sarangi lists it, newspapers and periodicals are published in 97 languages; primary education is conducted in 67 languages; the National Literacy Mission imparts literacy in 80 languages; All India Radio broadcasts in 104 languages; while 22 languages are used at the level of state administration.</p>
<p>Governance and the relationship of the centre with the states are critically tied to the question of language and re-visiting the roots of these tensions is certainly worthy for a contemporary context. Compared to the 1881 Census that recorded 237 languages, the Linguistic Survey of India conducted over 20 years till 1923, identified 179 languages and 544 dialects in India. By 1991, we were down to 114 languages and much of this is due to the disputes on defining the category ‘mother tongue’ since the Census of 1951 (p. 16). This enumeration of languages is very significant for purposes of governance and Sudipta Kaviraj reminds us that since people’s identity was conferred by the language they spoke, this has consequently posed some pointed challenges to the idea of national unity.</p>
<p>As to how language questions have been central to political agendas, arguments in the volume are variably represented by Joseph Schwartzberg, who underlines the re-organisation of states in 1956, while Kaviraj states it through the ‘argument of democracy’ and the administrative convenience offered by vernacular intelligibility that led Nehru to concede to a linguistic settlement of states (pp. 340–43). An earlier history of the Constituent Assembly debates on the issue of official languages and the status of English can be found in Granville Austin’s essays, which are also usefully included in this compilation (pp. 41–92). Unlike Schwartzberg’s commendation of the role of linguistic states in preventing India’s balkanisation, Kaviraj stresses the contradiction between the two common senses of the vernaculars and English. This point is underscored by Sumathi Ramaswamy’s contribution that in 1956, the setting up of the Sanskrit Commission was a blatant attempt to nationalise the Indian past by including Sanskrit in the Eighth Schedule, even though languages with more speakers such as Awadhi, Tulu and Mizo still await their turn. Kaviraj emphasises the continued legacy of this tension on the functioning of the Indian state. He argues that the challenge of accommodating minoritarian demands, whether through the demands for statehood or distinction in Language Schedules, continues as a dominant pressure on India’s democracy.</p>
<p>Even the seemingly simple definition of Hindi shows up as an unstable one with the recent demand for Bhojpuri’s inclusion as an addition separate from Hindi. The People of India (POI) project counted 700 languages belonging to four dominant families. Out of 325 languages used for social communication in Indian households, about 44 per cent spoke Hindi as a mother tongue. However, in her essay in this volume, Anvita Abbi points out that there are 47 dialects included within the fold of Hindi (p. 303). She elaborates that in 1951, Hindi speakers were estimated at 42 per cent (and included 46 dialects) and in 1961, the census reflected Hindi speakers at 30 per cent. With such nuanced delineations, Hindi’s status seems even more tenuous, further reducing its eligibility as a majority tongue. Elaborating on the cultural wars around dialect, Warikoo and Sontag, in separate essays, also address the issue of Urdu as embodying the contest over language as a marker of cultural and religious differences. David Lelyveld too cites the choice of national language as critical to forging identity. In his landmark work on Indian broadcasting history, Lelyveld notes how ‘Akashvani Hindi’ deliberately sanctioned a use of Hindustani, that purged traces of a more dominant Urdu vocabulary found in ‘filmi Hindi’ (p. 352).</p>
<p>The divide between the elite and the popular prompts D.L. Sheth to liken the use of modern day English to the latter day use of Sanskrit by the elite. He elaborates on the conflict between the metropolitan and vernacular, and situates language politics in the wider debate on social change and democratisation. Arguing for a fundamental re-thinking on our official language policy, Sheth boldly states, ‘Making knowledge of English a blanket requirement for entry into higher education is not a sustainable policy’ (p. 294). Since there is substantial debate on this point, it would have been nice to see Sheth’s argument contrasted with Dalit scholarship, especially on the question of English as a means of escape from mainstream oppression. Other ways in which languages face severe threats come from choices of a script, the feasibility of mainstreaming and issues of co-optation which particularly mark tribal languages (recorded in the census as those spoken by less than 10,000 people). Sarangi also notes the precarious position of the marginal tongue, as in the case of 34 languages that have speakers exceeding 100,000—Awadhi, Bhojpuri, Bundelkhandi, Chhattisgarhi, Dhundhari, Garhwali, Harauti, Haryanvi, Kangri, Kumauni, Maghai, Maithili, Mewari, Pahari and Rajasthani.</p>
<p>To those familiar with the key points of debate on the language question, it might seem that some contributors seem to repeat arguments already well rehearsed elsewhere. Ideas on nationalism and language have become so axiomatic in studies on modernity, that the real points of interest are often the surprises thrown up by the ground realities of India’s linguistic diversity. The POI project identified 4635 communities that actually refute any easy correspondences between linguistic and cultural communities, and often clash with established theses on modernity and identity. Asha Sarangi’s anthology goes a long way in further displaying these contradictions and is an excellent survey of the state of language and politics in contemporary India. Such a volume is much needed in a time when demands for separate statehood and anxieties over cultural nationalism remain as intense as they ever were.</p>
