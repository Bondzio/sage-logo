<abstract>
<p>In this study I explored the perceptions and responses of Jewish Israeli social workers to the health inequalities facing their Arab clients. Findings drawn from face-to-face, in-depth interviews with 26 Jewish Israeli social workers employed in the health field show that they were highly aware of the health inequalities. Although they uniformly insisted that there was no discrimination in the hospitals where they were employed, they observed extensive structural and individual discrimination outside the hospital and linguistic and sociocultural impediments to health equality within it. The discrimination provoked feelings of anger and moral outrage, guilt, and shame. Both the discrimination and the linguistic and sociocultural impediments filled them with frustration and led them, both individually and in concert with colleagues, to try to alleviate, circumvent, correct, or compensate for the impediments. Suggestions are made for practice and further research.</p>

<p>Health inequality is a worldwide phenomenon. There are very few countries in which persons with money and education do not have better access to health care than those who lack these resources. There are also few in which such persons do not fare better on most indices of health—including but not only infant mortality, mortality from disease, life expectancy, congenital defects, chronic illnesses (e.g., diabetes), and mental illness—than the poorer and less-educated members of the society (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1049732312470214">Barr, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1049732312470214">Dunn, Veenstra, &amp; Ross, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1049732312470214">Idler &amp; Benyamini, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1049732312470214">Lantz et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1049732312470214">Mackenbach et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1049732312470214">Stone &amp; Balderrama, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>In recent years, several scholars have called for social workers to play a role in reducing inequality in health both within and between countries (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1049732312470214">Gehlert, Mininger, Sohmer, &amp; Berg, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1049732312470214">McLeod &amp; Bywaters, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1049732312470214">Nadkarni, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1049732312470214">Payne, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1049732312470214">Snowden &amp; Yamada, 2005</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049732312470214">Bywaters (2009)</xref>, the most prolific of them, has contended that because health inequalities are caused largely by social factors, recognizing and tackling them is a major challenge for social work. He and others have argued that social workers’ training and skills—in viewing persons holistically, identifying the role of psychosocial factors in creating inequality, establishing good working relationships with service users, mediating between individuals and organizations, and working with persons of different economic strata, social positions, and cultures—render them uniquely equipped for this task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1049732312470214">Drakeford &amp; Gregory, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1049732312470214">Furman et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1049732312470214">Gorin, 2000</xref>). It has been claimed that these skills can be put to use in affecting change both in the health system and in the way that persons use it, which would result in greater access and equality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1049732312470214">Social Policy and Social Work Subject Centre, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Judging by the scanty research available, physicians show little inclination to deal with health inequalities. Studies carried out in England, the United States, and Israel revealed that they lack the skills, training, and time to evaluate sociocultural risks to their patients’ health and have limited awareness of the impact their patients’ psychosocial problems might have on their health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1049732312470214">Eisenthal, Stoeckle, &amp; Ehrlich, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1049732312470214">Franks, Williams, Zwanziger, Mooney, &amp; Sorbero, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1049732312470214">Monnickendam &amp; Monnickendam, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1049732312470214">Monnickendam, Monnickendam, Katz, &amp; Katan, 2007</xref>). The studies have also shown that most physicians consider the economic, social, linguistic, and cultural impediments to their patients’ health and receipt of optimal health care to be beyond their responsibility. In contrast, the social aspects of their service users’ lives are the very core of social workers’ responsibilities. Moreover, a small number of studies have suggested that social work intervention can foster greater health equality. For example, a study carried out in six health centers in England found that social workers’ adaptations of health services to the needs and beliefs of diverse cultural groups improved service use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1049732312470214">Rankin, Backett-Milburn, &amp; Platt, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Whereas suggestions abound as to the role that social workers might play in reducing health inequality, little if any study has been carried out on social workers themselves. How aware are they of health inequalities? What are their attitudes toward them? What, if anything, do they do when they encounter them in their day-to-day work? This study begins to answer these questions by examining Israeli social workers’ awareness of and responses to health inequalities between Arabs and Jews in Israel.</p>
<sec id="section1-1049732312470214">
<title>Health Care and Health Inequality in Israel</title>
<p>Israel has an excellent system of universal health care. According to the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1049732312470214">National Health Law of 1994</xref>, every Israeli, regardless of income—and regardless of whether they want to or not—must be insured by one of the country’s four health maintenance organizations—sick funds, as they are termed. The insurance is paid to the National Insurance Institute (Israel’s equivalent of Social Security), which channels the payments to the sick funds. Insurance fees are income adjusted (although there is a cap above which no fees are paid), and no one goes without insurance. When persons are unemployed or earn below a certain amount, the insurance is paid by the National Health Institute. The sick funds, for their part, are obliged to provide a government-mandated minimum “basket of services” for all, and are not permitted to turn away applicants, whatever their health history or current health status, or to expel members whose health care they find too expensive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1049732312470214">National Health Insurance Law, 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>Although the ideal behind this arrangement is accessible health care for all, there are, in fact, many barriers to equality in health in Israel. There are fees for visits to specialists and medical tests and procedures, and copayments for prescription medicines. Most of the fees and copayments are relatively low (by American standards), and are affordable by persons in the middle-income range. Nonetheless, for some they are prohibitive, and persons in the lower-income strata sometimes forego needed medical tests, care, and medication. For many of them, too, the high cost of dental care, which does not come under the national health insurance program, puts this out of range. Moreover, although better-off Israelis can afford to purchase complementary health insurance, which entitles them to services that are not available in the standard “health basket,” poorer Israelis cannot.</p>
<p>Another barrier has to do with geography. As in other developed countries, the bulk of the health care facilities and health care professionals are concentrated in the larger population centers. Whereas primary care clinics are situated in or near most communities in Israel, the health services are concentrated in the center of the country, where the country’s three main cities, Tel Aviv, Jerusalem, and Haifa, are located. There is an excellent teaching hospital in Beer Sheba, about an hour and a half’s drive south of Tel Aviv; another large hospital in Eilat, at the country’s southern tip; and some smaller hospitals in the north. Even so, the peripheral areas of the country have fewer doctors, hospital beds, pediatric intensive care, and complex nursing care services per 1,000 persons than the central region. Moreover these areas suffer from a shortage of facilities for surgery, emergency medical care, maternity, and dialysis (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1049732312470214">Epstein, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1049732312470214">Epstein &amp; Horev, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1049732312470214">Horev, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>A third barrier is linguistic and cultural. Israel is a country of immigrants. Whereas younger immigrants soon learn Hebrew, many older Russian and Ethiopian immigrants do not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1049732312470214">King &amp; Efrati, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1049732312470214">Malul &amp; Rosenboim, 2010</xref>). Doctors in Israel, as elsewhere, often lack cultural knowledge and understanding of the obstacles to equal care that patients from certain groups face (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1049732312470214">Monnickendam et al., 2007</xref>). This is less true of Russians, because there are many Russian doctors and nurses in Israel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1049732312470214">Remennick, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1049732312470214">Remennick &amp; Shtarkshall, 1997</xref>), but applies strongly to Ethiopians (King &amp; Efrati).</p>
<p>In recent years, efforts have been made to reduce the inequalities in health care in the country. The Ministry of Health has enacted regulations reducing economic barriers to access. Furthermore, the country’s various health funds have introduced programs to reduce differences in rates of various health problems and in the quality and accessibility of care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1049732312470214">Balicer et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1049732312470214">Epstein, Goldwag, Isma’il, Greenstein, &amp; Rosen, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1049732312470214">Wilf-Miron, Shem-Tov, Lewenhoff, Porath, &amp; Kokia, 2010</xref>). Although these programs have shown some effectiveness, their impact remains limited.</p>
<p>Health inequality between Arabs and Jews in Israel has been well documented. Life expectancy of Arabs is considerably lower than that of Jews, whereas age-adjusted mortality from heart disease, infectious diseases, and diabetes is considerably higher (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1049732312470214">Epstein, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1049732312470214">Epstein &amp; Horev, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1049732312470214">Horev, 2008</xref>). To some extent, these inequalities are part of the general picture of health inequality in Israel—not very different from that between Jews of different socioeconomic strata and living in different parts of the country—and anchored in the same economic and geographic causes. Unemployment rates among Arabs are higher than those among Jews, other than the ultra-Orthodox Jews (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1049732312470214">Elnekave &amp; Gross, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1049732312470214">Lewin &amp; Stier, 2001</xref>). Wages tend to be lower and family sizes larger. Most of Israel’s Arab citizens live in the north and south of the country—in “the periphery”—where medical facilities, services, and personnel are in short supply. Whatever the reasons, though, the point is that health inequality between Arabs and Jews is greater than that among Jews.</p>
<p>A large-scale study of health inequality in Israel conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1049732312470214">Epstein and Horev (2007)</xref>, under the auspices of the Israel National Institute for Health Policy and Health Services Research, found that the health inequality between Jews and Arabs, as indicated by various indices, has been growing. The authors attributed the growing disparity to several factors. These include there being fewer doctors and a shortage of specialists serving the Arab population; Arabs having less knowledge of the available fee exemptions and less complementary health insurance than Jews; and a range of linguistic and cultural impediments that Arabs share with various immigrant groups in Israel.</p>
<p>The present study might be seen as a response to calls by scholars for more study of the role of social workers in improving equality in health (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1049732312470214">Blyth, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049732312470214">Bywaters, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1049732312470214">McLeod &amp; Bywaters, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1049732312470214">Nadkarni, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1049732312470214">Payne, 2006</xref>). Our specific aim was to explore the subjective experiences of Jewish social workers who worked with Arab clients in medical frameworks. In Israel social workers are employed in hospitals and ambulatory clinics for the precise purpose of handling certain social aspects of patient care. Their tasks include, among others, helping patients with psychological and social problems related to their illness; seeing to it that suitable provisions are made for patients’ release to their homes or to institutional facilities; helping patients apply for benefits and services to which they are entitled (such as reduced taxes and levies and, in some cases, a home carer); and liaising between patients and community facilities and services. In addition, in some situations, social workers might be included on diagnostic teams.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section3-1049732312470214">
<title>Research Participants</title>
<p>This study was part of a larger qualitative study of the interaction between Israeli social workers and Arab clients in different types of social services (e.g., welfare, probation, general and rehabilitation hospitals and clinics), in agencies of different sizes, and in different parts of the country. For that study, face-to-face, in-depth interviews were conducted with 50 social workers in 2006–2007. For the present study, 20 interviews with social workers employed in the field of health were analyzed to ascertain the workers’ perceptions of and attitudes toward health inequality between Jews and Arabs. Fifteen of the social workers were employed in a large rehabilitation hospital in the center of Israel. As the only hospital of its kind in Israel, with specialized facilities and staff for rehabilitation following a variety of traumas and surgeries, it serves patients from all over the country. Five participants worked in two hospitals and one hospital ambulatory clinic in the north and south of the country, whose catchment areas included cities, towns, rural communities, and Arab villages. All four facilities saw both Arab and Jewish patients.</p>
<p>All of the participants were women, ranging in age from 28 to 58 years (mean = 39.6 years). They had between 3 and 26 years of professional experience (mean = 18.4 years). After permission to recruit study participants was obtained from the heads of selected facilities, all of the social workers in the facility were invited to participate in the study. Participation was entirely voluntary. All but two of the 22 social workers employed at the rehabilitation hospital participated. Of the social workers employed in the other three facilities, only those with extensive experience with Arab clients participated.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1049732312470214">
<title>Data Collection</title>
<p>After approval of the University Ethics Committee was obtained, data were collected in face-to-face, in-depth interviews. I deemed that such interviews were the most suitable method of data collection for the study in view of the limited knowledge hitherto available on the subject. In-depth interviews allow study participants the latitude to respond and create knowledge unconstrained by researcher assumptions, which are inherent in more structured approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1049732312470214">Patton, 1990</xref>). They also enable respondents to freely elaborate on their thoughts, perceptions, experiences, and so forth, in their own words (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1049732312470214">Tutty, Rottery, &amp; Grinnell, 1997</xref>). I opened all of the interviews with a statement indicating that the study was to explore the meeting between Jews and Arabs in social work in all its dimensions, and asking the participants to relate their personal experiences of their encounters both in the past and present. I encouraged the participants to speak freely, with respect to any topic and in any order they wished. I made efforts to remain aware of the possibility of inhibitions and social desirability responses stemming from political correctness, wariness of criticizing the agency or service, and other sources. I tape-recorded all interviews and had them transcribed.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1049732312470214">
<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>A phenomenological approach was employed because it enables examination of how human beings construct and give meaning to concrete social situations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1049732312470214">Giorgi, 1997</xref>). Two coders (myself and another researcher) separately performed cross-case thematic content analysis in three stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1049732312470214">Berg, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1049732312470214">Corbin &amp; Strauss, 2008</xref>; Giorgi). In the first stage, we used open coding of the interview transcripts to identify units of meaning and statements that illustrated them. Following our separate analyses, we compared our findings and discussed them until we reached complete agreement on all the units of meaning and illustrating statements. In the second stage, we applied axial coding (Corbin &amp; Strauss) to group the meaning units into themes. In the third stage, integration, we looked for interrelations among the themes. This enabled us to organize them in two broad categories: the Jewish social workers’ perceptions of and responses to the health inequalities faced by their Arab clients.</p>

<sec id="section6-1049732312470214">
<title>Findings</title>
<sec id="section7-1049732312470214">
<title>Perceptions of Health Inequality</title>
<p>All of the social workers interviewed stated unequivocally that there was no discrimination against Arabs in the hospitals where they worked or in Israeli hospitals in general. They repeatedly said that in both policy and practice, Arabs are patients like all others; the same procedures apply to Arabs as to Jews; and the doctors, nurses, and social workers view all patients as entitled to the same care and respect. Wards are not segregated and, although most of the medical staff are Jewish, there are Arab doctors and nurses as well.</p>
<p>At the same time, most of the social workers interviewed pointed to health inequality stemming from factors outside the hospital. As one put it, with consternation and distress that were typical of many of the respondents, “I can’t give equal service to the Arab population. . . . I can’t offer them what I’m able to give Jewish clients—not because of me, but because of what happens on the outside.” The social workers identified two main sources of health inequality. The most frequently mentioned—and the most upsetting—was intentional discrimination. The other consisted of linguistic and sociocultural barriers to heath equality.</p>
<sec id="section8-1049732312470214">
<title>Discrimination</title>
<p>The social workers identified two types of discrimination that undermined health equality for Arabs: systemic discrimination and discrimination by individuals and organizations. The systemic discrimination, as the participants described it without using this term, consisted of pervasive, long-term, and deeply entrenched discrimination by government bodies that resulted in poor living conditions, inadequate public services, and insufficient health care facilities and services in Arab communities. Of these, only insufficient health services in Arab communities was within the domain of the health services themselves. In particular, the social workers emphasized the lack of recuperation and rehabilitation facilities, and of psychotherapy and occupational therapy services in Arab communities.</p>
<p>The health-related poor living conditions they mentioned were lack of sewage and defective housing. Repeatedly observing that many Arabs live in “substandard conditions,” they told of Arab villages not connected to the sewage system and of Arab homes that were not fully constructed, lacked indoor toilets and showers, and/or were accessible only by stairs. Those who spoke of these conditions noted the health hazards inherent in the poor sanitation facilities (sewage, showers) in Arab communities and homes. Several told of Arab clients who could not get into their homes or to their second-story bedrooms because they could no longer manage the stairs because of their health condition. In speaking of these health-related deficiencies in living conditions as indicative of discrimination, the social workers conveyed a measure of awareness, shared by many Jewish Israelis, that the deficiencies stemmed in large measure from legal restrictions and bureaucratic obstacles to building in Arab communities anchored in government policy.</p>
<p>With respect to public services, the social workers noted that Arabs received less welfare assistance than Jews; that poor public transportation to and from Arab villages made reaching clinics and health services located outside these villages difficult, time consuming, and costly; and that there were fewer daycare centers for children with medical problems in Arab communities than in Jewish ones. Some of the social workers emphasized the discrimination they saw by comparing the health resources available to Arabs to those available to deprived sectors of the Jewish population. They pointed out that fewer resources were available to help Arabs after they were discharged from hospital than to help Jews who were poor and who lived outside the center of Israel or in small rural communities. They also pointed out that Russian and Ethiopian immigrants received more assistance from the local authorities where they lived than Arabs did from their local authorities. These unsolicited comparisons suggest that the social workers understood that the health-related deprivations of their Arab clients did not stem solely from their poor economic status or their residence in the periphery, but were the product of government policy that allocated fewer resources to Arabs than to Jews.</p>
<p>The social workers mentioned two individual, nongovernmental sources of discrimination that impaired health equality. One was the reputed reluctance of a large, nation-wide voluntary organization that lends medical devices (e.g., crutches, wheelchairs) to lend these devices to Arabs. The other was the refusal of persons who rented rooms near a hospital in the center of the country to rent to Arabs. This made it much more difficult for Arab than for Jewish parents who had a child in long-term hospitalization to be there for him or her.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1049732312470214">
<title>Linguistic and sociocultural barriers</title>
<p>All but one of the social workers interviewed said that either language or sociocultural barriers or both impaired the hospital’s ability to provide equal care. Some social workers said that insufficient command of Hebrew, the language of most of the doctors, by some Arab patients led them and their colleagues to view Arabs as a population at risk. Some reported that the language barrier reduced the contact they themselves could have with some of the Arab patients. The problem was especially acute, they said, with elderly women patients, because most Arab men of all ages and younger Arab women speak Hebrew fluently. The social workers also indicated, with some frustration, that speaking through an interpreter, as is done in such cases, did not entirely remove the barrier and introduced distortions. “There’s someone there in the middle who distorts things,” one participant put it.</p>
<p>The sociocultural impediment they observed was the reluctance of some Arab patients to talk with an Arab social worker. Despite the language difficulties, several respondents said, more than a few Arab patients felt more comfortable talking to a Jewish social worker than to an Arab one. This was especially so among Arab women and concerning intimate or female matters:
<disp-quote>
<p>Sometimes I ask whether they’d feel more comfortable with an Arabic-speaking social worker. Only one woman said yes. Sometimes I kind of sense that, on the contrary, some of them may feel more comfortable talking to me. I’m referring to women who feel that in matters relating to the body. . . . They can tell me. . . . Sometimes they say it’s something they’ve never told anyone.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Few Jews, the respondent added, ever told her that they were telling her something that they’d never disclosed to anyone else.</p>
<p>The preference among Arabs in Israel for Jewish social workers has been documented in other studies. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1049732312470214">Savaya (1998)</xref> identified the same preference among Arabs at a family clinic in the mixed Arab–Jewish area of Jaffa, Tel Aviv. It derives from the interdiction in Arab society against exposing problems and negative events to persons outside the family and the desire of the Arab clients to preserve their privacy in the community. Talking with a Jewish social worker enables them to bypass this interdiction and to avoid the stigma attached to receiving health services. The option of speaking to a Jewish social worker might improve health equality by enabling Arabs to discuss health issues and accept health services without fear or shame. With this, the preference for a Jewish social worker means that some Arab patients deprive themselves of access to social workers who share their language and culture. Because health is affected not only by physical factors, but also by emotional ones, such self-deprivation might undermine the health equality of Arabs in Israel.</p>

<title>Responses to the Perceived Inequalities</title>
<p>The participants spoke of their responses both to the discrimination they saw and to the linguistic and sociocultural impediments to health equality.</p>
<sec id="section11-1049732312470214">
<title>Responses to the discrimination</title>
<p>Virtually all of the social workers expressed considerable discomfort in the face of the discrimination that impeded health equality. For example, the above-quoted social worker’s statement that she could not give equal service to the Arab population “not because of me, but because of what happens on the outside” conveys considerable consternation and frustration, which were typical of the respondents. The social worker who told of the refusal to rent rooms to Arabs went on to say, “I felt that I had to apologize,” suggesting by this feelings of guilt and shame.</p>
<p>The other prevalent feelings were anger and outrage at the “substandard living conditions” of some of the Arab patients and at the comparative lack of public resources available to them. The overall sense was that there was a terrible injustice which had to be corrected or compensated for and, more personally, that they themselves had to do more for their Arab clients, and to fight for them:
<disp-quote>
<p>They don’t have resources, economic resources or community resources. So there’s a need to do more for them. . . . There’s so much deprivation that they [the Arabs] don’t even have the minimum that they could get. It makes me really angry. . . . If you have to be a disabled person, then you should be a Jewish disabled person and you shouldn’t be an Arab. I feel that efforts should be made to correct things. There should be more equality, some compensation.</p>
<p>I feel a real need to give something to them . . . to fight for them . . . to try and organize help for them, because I know they’re in real trouble.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Some social workers reported going out of their way for Arab patients or taking specific actions to reduce the gap between the out-of-hospital care available to them and that available to Jewish Israelis. Most of the actions they took were on the individual level, to help their own Arab clients:
<disp-quote>
<p>When I have to contact organizations like [a large, well-known nongovernmental organization], I always squirm in my chair. . . . I don’t know if they work with Arabs. . . . I call them and check it out in advance to make sure they won’t be turned away. . . . I take on the responsibility of serving as an intermediary between the [Arab] community and organizations.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Less commonly, several social workers organized actions on behalf of the principle of nondiscrimination rather than on behalf of a specific person:
<disp-quote>
<p>We used to be in intensive contact with the hostel across the street. On weekends when they had vacant rooms, we’d send families there so that they could spend the Sabbath with their children without having to travel. . . . But then the discrimination started. One day we suddenly found out that they changed their policy and won’t let Arabs sleep there. It’s really maddening . . . really unpleasant. . . . So what has happened is that we’ve stopped referring families there; not only Arab families: all families.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Two key motives emerged from the social workers’ accounts. Most of the workers were moved by a combination of sympathy and moral outrage to try to correct or compensate for the structural discrimination:
<disp-quote>
<p>I had this Bedouin client. . . . He was such a nice guy and I’m so angry with the state for the way they’ve neglected the Bedouin population. . . . So especially in this client’s case I can really feel anger at the authorities who didn’t give him anything and didn’t care about him. . . . That’s why I really went out of my way to arrange all kinds of things for him, where I might not have done as much for other people.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The other motive was the workers’ belief that this was their job, that they had to do it properly, and that the only way they could do it properly was to fight for their Arab clients:
<disp-quote>
<p>A young [Arab] woman was hospitalized. After a short time they said okay, she had to be discharged, and I fought for her. How can they discharge her? . . . The place she lives isn’t a place where she’ll be able to get the treatment she needs. . . . If she were a girl living in the central region she would be able to get treatment. In this case I felt that it would really be discrimination if they discharged her, because she won’t have any opportunity for rehabilitation outside the hospital. . . . I feel that I’m doing my job, that I [am] giving of myself to everyone. . . . But maybe because it’s an Arab girl I fought harder. I needed to fight to keep her here a little longer.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1049732312470214">
<title>Responses to the linguistic and sociocultural barriers</title>
<p>As they did in response to the discrimination they saw, the social workers also made efforts to overcome the linguistic and sociocultural impediments to equal care. Essentially, they acted as liaisons. Most of the concrete, day-to-day efforts were probably directed to overcoming the language barriers. The social worker who said that she and her colleagues regarded Arab patients as “a population at risk” because not all of them know Hebrew went on to say, “So we have to check whether they understand the medical instructions.” Their efforts in the cultural realm were made both vis-à-vis themselves and vis-à-vis the doctors. With respect to themselves, they made efforts to understand and empathize with the position of Arab patients in Israel:
<disp-quote>
<p>When I meet an Arab patient . . . I think they must be asking themselves, “Will she give me all of the services I’m entitled to? Will she give preference to others? To me? Will she fight for me? Do I have to behave better so as to get what I need?” . . . Maybe the Arabs feel threatened here. They’re a minority, even though an awful lot of Arabs come to this specific department.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>For most of the social workers, awareness of their Arab clients’ health inequality developed gradually. Several stated explicitly that “at one time I wasn’t so aware of their deprivation.” One described overcoming her initial prejudice and ignorance:
<disp-quote>
<p>It took me time to realize that they’re a special population that requires a different approach. . . . Maybe I was a bit judgmental and critical of them. . . . Maybe I was evaluating them according to our norms and saying to myself, “Why do they behave like that or do things like that?” . . . It took me time to understand who the Arab population is.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In general, the process of learning and adaptation occurred as the social workers interacted with Arab patients and tried to meet their needs. For some social workers it was facilitated by contact with Arab colleagues who spoke of the Arabs’ hardships and deprivations:
<disp-quote>
<p>I can see the injustices now, which I wasn’t able to before Arabs [social workers] began working in the department. The Arab social workers are all different from one another, but they manage to convey what they [Arab patients] experience and go through. . . . The way they convey it, I can connect with and see the client not only as someone from the Arab sector, but as a person in this terrible situation.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The Arab social workers were apparently better able to articulate the impediments faced by Arab patients than the patients themselves. The Jewish social workers might have been better able to grasp and accept information from their Arab colleagues, with whom they shared a common professional identity, than from their Arab patients.</p>
<p>Vis-à-vis the doctors, some of the social workers made efforts to intercede on patients’ behalf. The following account by a social worker who was a member of a diagnostic team at a child development clinic indicates her efforts both to view matters from the perspective of the Arab clients and to convey that perspective to the doctors on the team:
<disp-quote>
<p>I try hard to get into the cultural way of thinking. I make an effort not to be ethnocentric and say, “They’re not like me, and what they’re doing is wrong.” I’m thinking about the last family I worked with. . . . When they met with the doctors, the doctors had a certain perspective of the situation. But when I met with the family I had a different perspective. The way I saw it was, “Wait. Let’s try to see this in terms of their culture.” There was one doctor who was an intern and another who was a specialist. They came out of the meeting with the assessment that the boy has no boundaries, he’s wild . . . he has some kind of attention deficit problem. And then there was the boy’s father. They got an unpleasant impression of him. They said that he just wants to brag about who he is and what he does. He claims that his family is really something . . . a kind of pretentiousness. Then I met with them. . . . My impression was that the father was trying to prove that “we’re okay, we’re educated.” I think it’s the encounter with Jewish culture as well as the encounter with this institute, which is a diagnostic institute that examines whether this family is okay. . . . So I went back to the doctors, and I told them that they might look at what happened at their meeting in other ways.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>As this statement suggests, the social worker was able and eager to bring a sociocultural perspective to the diagnosis. Although such a perspective might not be relevant to many medical situations, it was in the case described. In fact, social workers in Israel are often part of teams dealing with child development problems. This is because even though many of these problems (including the attention deficit disorder that the doctors suspected) have neurophysiological roots, their manifestations are affected by parental behaviors and other environmental factors, and changing these are often included in the treatment along with medication.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The findings show that the Jewish social workers interviewed were highly aware of the health inequalities between Jews and Arabs in Israel. Although they uniformly insisted that there was no discrimination in the hospitals where they were employed, they observed extensive structural impediments to health equality outside the hospital and linguistic and sociocultural impediments within it. Many of the identified impediments to health equality between Jews and Arabs were much the same as the impediments to health equality among all segments of Israel’s population, as identified by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1049732312470214">Epstein and Horev (2007)</xref>.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1049732312470214">Epstein and Horev (2007)</xref> similarly noted financial, linguistic, and cultural impediments and differences in service users’ knowledge both of matters affecting their health and of their rights within the health care system. Epstein and Horev also observed that doctors often lack cultural knowledge and understanding of the obstacles to equal care that patients from certain groups face. With this, the social workers also observed specific impediments to health equality, from substandard living conditions to both structural and individual discrimination, facing Arabs. These observations, along with the observation that the impediments to health equality facing Arabs are greater than those encountered by other deprived groups in Israel, suggests that they are well aware of the specificity and acuteness of the impediments to health equality for Arabs.</p>
<p>Whether or not the social workers interviewed reported all of the sources and manifestations of health inequality to Arabs in Israel is not known. What is known is that they expressed not what they read in professional articles or heard in lectures, but what they saw when they met with Arab patients and encountered difficulties in providing them with the services that it was their job to provide to all clients. These services included, among others, seeing to it that patients had the resources and conditions they needed for optimal recovery when they left the hospital and helping them to deal with the emotional, family, and social problems arising from their medical condition or the medical condition of a child or spouse. The experiential source of their awareness would account for them having spoken entirely about inequality of access, and not at all about inequality in health itself. This also explains the gradual development of awareness, and with it the development of sympathy, that most of the social workers recounted.</p>
<p>It is of note that not a single one of the social workers justified the inequality as an outcome, legitimate or not, of the longstanding political strife between Jews and Arabs in the Middle East. Whatever hostility toward the Arabs in Israel they might have absorbed from the environment in the country (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1049732312470214">Bar-Tal &amp; Teichman, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1049732312470214">Baum, 2010</xref>) found no expression in their interviews. The social workers responded strongly to both the structural and the sociocultural impediments to health equality for Arabs. The discrimination they saw, whether structural (e.g., lack of sewage, defective housing) or personal (e.g., the guest house that would not rent to Arabs, the private organization that might not lend Arabs equipment), provoked feelings of anger and moral outrage, guilt, and shame. Both the discrimination and the linguistic and sociocultural impediments they identified filled them with frustration and led them, both individually and in concert with colleagues, to try to alleviate, circumvent, correct, or compensate for the impediments.</p>
<p>Their responses seem to have been anchored in both their professional and personal identities. Professionally, the discrimination faced by their Arab clients is highly dissonant with the values of social work and with the training that social workers receive. The Code of Ethics for Social Workers in Israel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1049732312470214">Israeli Association of Social Workers, 1995</xref>) stipulates that social workers “must not ignore any manifestation of discrimination based on race, color, national origin, religion, . . . or any other discrimination; and must not cooperate with such discrimination” (§1.3). It also specifies that social workers must act to ensure that every person has access to necessary resources, services, and opportunities (§1.2), to expand the choices and opportunities available to individuals, with special attention to disadvantaged persons (§1.3), and to encourage respectful behavior toward the diverse cultures in Israeli society (Part I, §2 and §3). Similar provisions are found in the American <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1049732312470214">National Association of Social Workers (1996)</xref> and the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1049732312470214">International Federation of Social Workers and International Association of Schools of Social Work (2004)</xref>. As evident from some of the quotations in the findings section, the social workers’ inability to do very much about the violation of these principles vis-à-vis their Arab clients made them feel bad about themselves as professionals.</p>
<p>On a personal level, as members of Israel’s Jewish majority, at least some of the social workers might have shared a sense of collective guilt for the official and unofficial discrimination meted out to Israel’s Arab citizens. Theorists of collective guilt maintain that this emotion might lead to “protective” or “preventive” behaviors when the individual comes into contact with persons from the wronged group and, along with moral outrage, feels sympathy or empathy for them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1049732312470214">Iyer, Wayne Leach, &amp; Crosby, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1049732312470214">Powell, Branscombe, &amp; Schmitt, 2005</xref>), as was apparently the case in this study. The two sets of driving motives fit <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1049732312470214">Oyserman’s (2009)</xref> description of identity-based motivation, characterized by the readiness to engage in identity-congruent action and to use identity-congruent mindsets in making sense of the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1049732312470214">Oyserman, Sorensen, Reber, Chen, &amp; Sannum, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>This study had several limitations. As noted above, it was conducted as part of a larger study of interactions between Jewish Israeli social workers and Arab clients. Neither the sampling nor the interview questions focused on health inequality. Thus, not only was the sample small, as is the case with most interview-based studies; it was also skewed and did not attain saturation. Most of the interviews from which the findings were culled were with social workers in a single hospital in the center of Israel. It should be noted, however, that because the hospital is one of its kind in Israel, Arabs from all over Israel are treated there. Moreover, the participants there, as well as the six from the north or south of the country were “information rich” informants in that they had all worked with Arab clients for years. With respect to the interview questions, a more detailed picture might have been obtained by pointed questions. For example, such questions might have examined the social workers’ development of awareness in greater detail. In contrast, the freely related experiences have the advantage of spontaneity and authenticity.</p>
<p>Another limitation is that Arab clients were not queried. This is because the purpose was to learn about the perceptions and responses of the social workers of the dominant Jewish majority to the health inequality of the discriminated-against Arab minority. The omission, however, means that we cannot know how well the social workers’ insistence that there was no discrimination in their hospitals and clinics accords with the feelings and experiences of the Arab clients. Examination of this question is also called for.</p>
<p>Despite its limitations, the study has value as one of the first on the subject of social workers’ perceptions of and responses to health inequality. It also has numerous practical implications. Most essentially, the findings of the social workers’ awareness of the health inequalities facing Arabs and their emotional and instrumental responses to them provide grounds for the claim, advocated in the literature, that social workers can and should be mobilized to help promote health equality of Israel’s Arab citizens. In addition, they suggest that within the hospital or clinic, social workers’ sensitivity to cultural differences, which was observed in the social workers’ statements, provides a basis for making the health services accessible to the Arab population not only by translating but, more broadly, by interpreting the behavior of patients to medical staff and the behavior of medical staff to Arab patients.</p>
<p>Further study is urged. Systematic studies are needed using more representative samples of social workers’ perceptions of and responses to heath inequality among diverse population groups both in Israel and elsewhere. Studies to learn more about the motives and dynamics that drive social workers to try to overcome the obstacles to equal health care for their clients could also be useful. So would studies considering how the mostly individual efforts noted in this study can be mobilized and organized into agency- or profession-wide endeavors to reduce the impediments to health equality. Finally, study of health inequality from the perspective of the clients should contribute to a fuller understanding of this subject.</p>
