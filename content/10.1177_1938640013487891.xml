<abstract>
<p>Hammertoe digital deformity correction is a very controversial topic among foot and ankle surgeons. Hammertoes are characterized by an extension deformity at the metatarsophalangeal joint (MTPJ) and flexion deformity at the proximal interphalangeal joint (PIPJ). Current treatment options are often guided by the patient’s discomfort as well as the reducibility of the affected digit. Kirschner wires (K-wires) have long been considered the gold standard for hammertoe digital repair. Although K-wires are simplistic to use as fixation, they carry inherit risks such as pin tract infections, migration, and breakage. This has lead to multiple intramedullary hammertoe devices including the PROTOE intramedullary device. This paper will discuss the usage and benefits the PROTOE has to offer over the conventional K - wire.</p>

<p>Hammertoe digital deformity is characterized by an extension deformity at the metatarsophalangeal joint (MTPJ) and flexion deformity at the proximal interphalangeal joint (PIPJ).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1938640013487891">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1938640013487891">2</xref></sup> Digital deformity typically is associated with pain in the forefoot, difficultly fitting shoes, and unacceptable cosmetic appearance for the affected patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1938640013487891">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1938640013487891">3</xref></sup> Loss of purchase of the digit overloads the MTP joint as well as the surrounding digits, ultimately changing the gait pattern.</p>
<p>Treatment options are often guided by the patient’s discomfort as well as the reducibility of the affected digit. Conservative management of a fixed hammertoe includes shoe gear modification with a high and wide toe box, toe sleeves, foam cushioning device, orthotics, or offloading pads such as a metatarsal bar. However, if conservative management fails to alleviate symptoms, then surgical correction is warranted.</p>
<p>Kirschner wires (K-wires) have long been considered the gold standard for hammertoe digital repair. K-wires were initially introduced to orthopaedics in 1909 by Martin Kirschner using surgical-grade stainless steel for fixation of fractures. Taylor was the first surgeon to introduce K-wires for fixation of hammertoe repairs in 1940.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1938640013487891">4</xref></sup> Today, the most commonly used sizes for K-wire fixation in the foot and ankle are 0.9 mm (0.035 inch) to 1.6 mm (0.062 inch). Introduction of K-wire fixation for hammertoe correction was initially popularized to help prevent flail toe, which is the most common complication secondary to excessive bone resection and destabilization of the digit.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1938640013487891">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although K-wires are simplistic to use as fixation, they carry inherit risks such as pin tract infections, migration, and breakage.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1938640013487891">3</xref></sup> Zingas et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1938640013487891">5</xref></sup> noted a 2.5% failure rate when the 1.1 mm (0.045 inch) K-wire was used for fixation of the lesser digit hammertoe deformity. Reece et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1938640013487891">6</xref></sup> reported as much as 18% pin tract infections in digital arthrodesis fixed by K-wires. The average incidence of nonunion following proximal interphangeal (PIP) joint arthrodesis fixed by intramedullary K-wire was about 20%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1938640013487891">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>Patient satisfaction with percutaneous wire fixation is often quite low. There is often a big concern by our patients about externally protruding K-wires and the risk of accidental “trauma” within their home. There is considerable anxiety over the removal of the K-wire in the office as well.</p>
<p>In recent years, there has been a move away from the percutaneous K-wire to other forms of fixation for digital correction in foot surgery. This has been spearheaded by the desire by surgeon and patient alike to avoid the risks and pain of percutaneous fixation and offer long-term internal stabilization of the corrected deformity.</p>
<p>The PROTOE (Wright Medical Technologies, Arlington, TN) device is one of the latest implants released to the market for the management of hammertoes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1938640013487891">Figure 1</xref>). As an intramedullary implant, the risk of digital infection is low. The PROTOE is a stainless steel single-piece hammertoe implant. The implant design used a proximal threaded section that is screwed into place within the medullary canal of the proximal phalanx. The distal serrated flanges are then impacted into the base of the middle phalanx. There are currently 10 unique implants available. Five variable sized implants (2.0, 2.4, 2.8, 3.2, 4.0 mm) come with a 0° or 10° angulation. The angulation gives the surgeon the ability to position the digit in both a mechanically and cosmetically appropriate position during the procedure. The 2.8 mm implant has been designed with a shorted proximal segment (9 mm) for use in the fifth toe. The 2.0 mm implant carries a 13 mm proximal thread, whereas the larger implants have a 16 mm thread.</p>

<p>The surgical approach for hammertoe correction is based on the surgeons’ preferred approach. We prefer the transverse elliptical incision over the PIP joint. This allows a skin plasty to be performed of redundant tissue at the PIP joint and also hides the surgical scar within the tension lines above the joint (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1938640013487891">Figure 2</xref>). A Duvries condylectomy is performed on the head of the proximal phalanx with a saggital saw. Removal of the cartilage of the base of the middle phalanx is then performed with a rongeur or available planar. The proximal phalanx is K-wire pre-drilled with the included wire. K-wire pre-drilling several small holes in the base of the middle phalanx centrally will allow the broach to be inserted in a much easier centered fashion. The base of the middle phalanx is then broached. We often broach with one size smaller than the intended implant. Implantation of the hardware is then performed under standard protocol. The proximal aspect of the implant is screwed into the proximal phalanx. Once the implant is full seated, make sure, if using an angled implant, that the implant is rotated in the proper orientation. Gentle longitudinal traction is then placed on the digit and the digit is impacted onto the serrated fins. Manual axial compression firmly seats the device into the medullary canal of the middle phalanx. Fluoroscopic exam is used to ensure adequate seating of the implant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1938640013487891">Figure 3</xref>). Soft tissue closure with absorbable suture in the dorsal capsule and extensor complex will add to digital stability.</p>

<p>Several advantages have been realized using the PROTOE device versus K-wire fixation. First, the absence of exposed hardware has led to significantly decreased anxiety and improved patient satisfaction with the procedure. Second, we have also noted less chronic swelling of the surgical digit. Last, since the implant is retained and not removed, we have seen far less recurrence of the hammertoe deformity or other mal-alignments.</p>

<p>A review of our past 253 hammertoe corrections revealed 63 PROTOE intramedullary implant and 190 in the K-wire fixation group. Routine follow-up was performed 2 weeks postoperative, 4 weeks, 8 weeks, 16 weeks, and 32 weeks with radiographs. Thirty-seven digits in the K-wire group and 14 digits in the PROTOE group were noted to have postoperative complications. Complications were defined as either malunion (7 patients K-wire, 4 patients PROTOE) or superficial infection (4 patients K-wire, 0 patients PROTOE). Each of the complications was graded according to severity to the digit. Low level did not require any intervention and spontaneously resolved, medium level required office care and resolved, and major required a return trip to the operating room. Three of the superficial infections were treated with an outpatient course of oral antibiotics, whereas the remaining patients resolved symptoms without treatment. None of the noted complications required subsequent operations.</p>
<p>The PROTOE hammertoe intramedullary device is an alternative to the traditional K-wire approach for surgical correction of digital deformity.</p>
<p>The PROTOE intramedullary device is a multipurpose option for the management of hammertoe digit correction. The PROTOE implant is available in numerous lengths and diameters, offering versatility for any and all deformities of the lesser digits. As a completely buried implant, the risk of infection is decreased, the anxiety of K-wire removal is eliminated, and retained correction increases the patients’ overall satisfaction rate.</p>
