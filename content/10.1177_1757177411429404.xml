<title>Introduction</title>
<p>From its foundation in 1970 as the Infection Control Nurses Association (ICNA), the Infection Prevention Society (IPS) has developed into a professional society with close to 2000 members and an annual turnover of more than £1,000,000. The society is run by elected and appointed trustees and directors who form the Board and use their talents and expertise to support and advance the professional interests of members. The past seven years have seen the society change its name, widen its membership and consolidate its position as a society for all practitioners who work or have a major interest in preventing and controlling infection. This metamorphosis has not happened by chance and has taken care and planning by those who have led the society during recent years. In 2009 the IPS Board recognised the need to set a strategic direction for the society that would serve as a blueprint for the future.</p>
<p>The Society’s <italic>raison d’être</italic> is to advance the practice of infection prevention through education. In 2009 the journey to develop a strategy began with an IPS member survey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1757177411429404">Storr, 2010</xref>). This ensured that our first steps were informed by the perceived needs and aspirations of the membership. The information generated by the survey acted as a catalyst for action resulting in the IPS Board committing to undertake a strategic review of the society including its vision, mission and aims and create a strategy to take the society forward over the period of the next five years. This paper describes the process of developing our strategy and how it will be turned into action (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1757177411429404">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<title>What is strategy and why is it so important?</title>
<p>Originally a military term, strategy describes and details the plan of battle and is used in politics, business and non-government organisations to describe the ‘big ideas’ and how those ideas will be enacted. Definitions of strategy are abundant in the literature and focus largely on content, or formulation, and to a lesser extent, process, or implementation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1757177411429404">Pfeffer and Sutton, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>In the world of business, strategies are created to ensure that organisations achieve their objectives and survive in turbulent operating environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1757177411429404">Certo and Peter, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1757177411429404">Goodstein and Nolan, 1993</xref>). However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1757177411429404">Ansoff and MacDonnel (1990)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1757177411429404">Goold et al (1994)</xref> suggest that few companies possess a corporate strategy that is clear, convincing and powerful, and that organisations have insufficient information about themselves and their environment to undertake effective strategic planning.</p>
<p>Strategy has also been described as being concerned with matching the activities of an organisation to both the environment in which it operates and its resource capabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1757177411429404">Johnson et al, 2007</xref>). This is widely referred to as ‘strategic fit’ and is of particular relevance to an organisation such as IPS, which has charitable status and an operational structure that is reliant on members who have relevant expertise within the society volunteering to manage its different spheres of activity. There was a clear acknowledgement at the start of this process for the need to target the allocation and use of the society’s limited resources and to strengthen this by developing a clear strategic focus and a set of strategic objectives to guide decision-making.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1757177411429404">Bryson (2004)</xref> states that strategy formulation can be either a top down or bottom up process and organisations that are best at strategic planning are those that combine the two into an effective strategic planning system. The process we describe here adopted a combined approach. The purpose of strategic planning has been summarised by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1757177411429404">Smith (1995)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1757177411429404">Simmerson (2011)</xref> in <xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="boxed-text1-1757177411429404">Box 1</xref></p>

<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1757177411429404">Johnson et al (2007)</xref> further emphasise the importance of identifying clear priorities and articulating the tasks that must be undertaken for success. What emerges from the literature is that the process of developing a strategy adds value by enhancing communication in the organisation by ‘enriching’ people’s common understanding of objectives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1757177411429404">Mintzberg, 2000</xref>). The opportunity to add value and engage members of the IPS in the strategy development became a guiding principle for the IPS Board.</p>
<p>It is important to acknowledge the limitations in applying industrial strategy development models to the not-for-profit and non-government sectors. Within the charity sector, for example, it has been argued that there is less of a drive to be innovative and adaptable, with some questioning the need to function strategically, when the mission is social rather than financial, and resources are limited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1757177411429404">Morris et al, 2007</xref>). However, the IPS Board decided that using a collaborative rather than a paternalistic approach to strategy development and planning would yield benefits beyond the process itself and was therefore a worthwhile investment. Consequently a ‘Blue Sky’ workshop was planned and 42 members contributed to the initial development of the strategy in February 2010.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1757177411429404">
<title>The creative process of strategy development – the Walt Disney Model</title>
<p>The aim of the workshop was to consider where IPS needed to be in the future rather than what it needed to do to get there. Our intention was to come away from the workshop with ideas and questions that would be used to help us start to plan. To achieve this a decision was taken to use an external consultant to facilitate the workshop to ensure that we did not get trapped in traditional and comfortable lines of thought that might mean we missed opportunities to think differently. The external consultant had a strong track record of success in leadership and change management, and had previously undertaken workshops for the society at the annual conference and branch professional development days.</p>
<p>The scene was set by briefly considering the success of the IPS to date. This highlighted the recent expansion of the membership, the emergence of IPS from the ICNA, the support the society provides to its members and a perception of its increased profile and influence as evidenced for example by its successful annual conference. There was a consensus that IPS was becoming more businesslike, expanding its research and education agenda and better responding to changes in the environment and changes in the microbial challenge.</p>
<p>Our first task was to consider whether the IPS was an effective organisation and where our current focus of activity lay. Using a ‘target model’ the facilitator explained that effective organisations pay attention to all of the following:</p>
<list id="list2-1757177411429404" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Ecology – Explicit values, beliefs and core mission are explicit and understood.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>State – The appropriate structures and people are in place to achieve the mission.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Rapport - Effective internal and external communication channels and rapport with your members and other stakeholders.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Outcome – a clear output, product or endpoint.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Task – The jobs or actions that need to be undertaken to produce the outcome.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>He went on to say that many organisations concentrate on outcome and task, and forget about the rest. It was important for us to consider how much of ‘the rest’ was part of the way the organisation thought, felt and behaved. In the critical discussion among the delegates concerning the vision and values of the society, it was clear that there was no firm consensus on the vision at that time.</p>
<p>Our next task was to consider the external environment that the society operated in and how politically ‘savvy’ we were and whether that was where we wanted to be in the future. This process was guided by using <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1757177411429404">Baddeley and James’s (1987)</xref> four-part model of political behaviour. The model combines the attributes of political awareness and the skills required to turn awareness into success, and uses the analogy of animal stereotypes to illustrate the four types of behaviour. The politically unaware organisation is depicted as either the donkey, inept and unaware, or the sheep, innocent followers. Politically aware organisations are depicted as the fox, highly aware, cunning and unscrupulous, and the owl, wise innovators.</p>
<p>From a delegate’s perspective the main focus of the workshop took an innovative and non-conventional approach by introducing the use of the Disney Model of strategic planning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1757177411429404">Dilts, 1994</xref>). Dilts’s analysis of ‘strategies of genius’ proposes that Disney’s approach has the key features of neuro-linguistic programming (NLP). He describes NLP as ‘a multi-dimensional process that involves the development of behavioral competence and flexibility, but also involves strategic thinking and an understanding of the mental and cognitive processes behind behavior’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1757177411429404">Dilts, 1994</xref>, p. xix). In his analysis Dilts suggests that Disney’s genius lay largely in his ability to explore phenomena from different perceptual positions. The perceptual positions are The Dreamer, The Realist and The Spoiler (or critic) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1757177411429404">Figure 2</xref>) and arose from a comment by an animator who worked with Disney and recounted that ‘there were three different Walt’s … you never knew which one was coming to your meeting’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1757177411429404">Dilts, 1994</xref>, p. 163).</p>

</fig>
<p>At the workshop three groups were tasked with assuming the role of ‘The Dreamer. This role was to identify what the society could be in the future, with an emphasis on limitless possibilities. Groups were not allowed to discuss or rationalise the dream and the dreams were to be described in pictures rather than words.</p>
<p>In the next stage the same groups were asked to choose ‘one dream’ and consider what needed to occur to make the dream happen (‘The Realist’). No criticism was allowed but realistic judgement of whether the dream was already close to realisation, was too ambitious or was achievable and sufficiently aspirational to chase and develop into a concrete plan.</p>
<p>In the final stage each member in the group assumed the role of ‘The Spoiler’ or critic and was instructed to ask the question ‘Can this work?’. With the critic hat on, the groups searched for mistakes and weak points in the initial ideas. Groups were instructed to be hyper-sceptical and pull the dreams apart. The exercise continued, passing through each step until the critic was silenced</p>
<p>It was from this process that an array of creative ideas were generated, considered, critiqued, refined and sometimes rejected. Those that withstood ‘The Spoiler’ resulted in the prioritisation of three high-level dreams that provided the foundation for developing the draft vision, mission, aims and objectives of the society. This is summarised in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1757177411429404">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<title>Crafting and refining the vision, mission and aims</title>
<p>The outputs of the Disney workshop were a collection of realisable dreams that, with some additional work were thought to provide the foundations of a vision, mission and set of strategic aims for the society. A sub-group of IPS board synthesised the outputs of the workshop during the summer of 2010. A first draft of the IPS strategic aims and objectives together with a vision and mission were agreed. In an effort to create the rapport required for an effective organisation and to ensure that the drafts were in tune with the wider membership, a second and third round of consultations were planned.</p>
<p>In crafting the society’s vision statement, the sub-group initially worked with the three words inform, promote and sustain, which had been coined in 2008 as a strap-line for the annual conference, to capture the power generated by the words. A vision statement ‘answers the big question - WHY are you doing what you are doing’ and creates context and direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1757177411429404">Gottleib, 2007</xref>). Our aim was for the vision statement to resonate with the widest possible range of practitioners, decision makers, policy makers and service users. Six iterations of a vision emerged and the IPS Board were tasked with ranking these in order of priority. There was a groundswell of support for the vision that <italic>IPS exists to inform, promote and sustain expert practice in infection prevention to keep people safe</italic>. The period of iteration that followed resulted in the final version:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p><italic>‘Our vision is that no person is harmed by a preventable infection.’</italic></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The next task was to develop a mission statement that transforms the vision into practice and provides the context around which strategic aims can be constructed. The initial mission statement also went though a series of iterations with the final version being:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p><italic>‘The Infection Prevention Society will inform, promote and sustain expert infection prevention policy and practice in the pursuit of patient or service user and staff safety wherever care is delivered.’</italic></p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1757177411429404">
<title>Inform, promote, sustain</title>
<p>The sub-group were united in the view that the three words inform, promote and sustain encapsulate the society bringing with it a synergy and focus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1757177411429404">Figure 4</xref>). Clustering the strategic aims around inform, promote and sustain provides strong internal and external consistency and reinforces the values of the society. Following a careful review of the outputs of the strategy workshop and using these three critical words, the IPS’s aims are to:</p>

<title>Evolution of the strategy</title>
<p>Draft objectives were developed for each aim and incorporated the outputs of the Disney workshop. These Vision, Mission, Aims and Objectives were opened up for scrutiny and comment at Infection Prevention 2010, the society’s annual conference. An ideas tree provided a space where members, delegates and exhibitors from the corporate sector could post comments, feedback and amendments on the drafts.</p>
<p>At the simplest level delegates were invited to show their agreement (or not) with the draft strategic objectives by placing a green or red coloured sticker on a chart. Approval rating averaged 98% across all of the draft objectives with a maximum of 100% and a minimum approval of 95%. Over 70 comments were received using the Decision Tree approach and each comment was considered by the board and strategy sub-group with a view to identifying and acting on strong, relevant and recurring themes. A number of the comments and suggestions have already been addressed and incorporated into the society’s core business, such as those relating to the IPS Competences, the brand refreshment exercise, expansion of stakeholder engagement and the need to influence the emerging infection prevention and control agenda, particularly with regards to the commissioning of services.</p>
<graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="10.1177_1757177411429404-img1.tif"/>
<p>Echoing an output of the Disney workshop, one of the most commonly repeated suggestions related to the need for national policies to prevent time consuming ‘reinvention of the wheel’. It was also clear that IPS was being urged to become more influential at the national policy level in each of the countries it serves. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1757177411429404">Table 2</xref> highlights the evolution of the strategic objectives before and after the ‘Decision Tree’ feedback exercise at conference 2010.</p>

<p>The third phase of consultation and feedback took place during the first quarter of 2011 when the final draft of the strategy was circulated electronically to all the members of the society and a second all-member survey was issued. The survey items were informed by the draft strategy and a number of the questions explored members’ perceptions on strategy implementation. Members indicated that the most important practical tools that assist in the implementation of the IPS strategy at branch level were: an agenda focused on the strategy objectives, a working action plan and a branch annual report that focused on describing the activity undertaken towards the achievement of IPS strategy objectives.</p>
<p>A strategy finalisation workshop completed the development process in May 2011 where a diverse group of over 60 members systematically scrutinised and performed a reality check on the strategic objectives. The extensive engagement of IPS members in developing and agreeing the vision, mission and strategic aims for the society means that members have a real stake in realising and achieving the outcomes that have been set.</p>

<title>Making it work: the role of all IPS members</title>
<p>Evidence suggests that strategy development is relatively straightforward but that strategy execution is complex and failure of organisations to meet their strategic aims is common (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1757177411429404">Zook and Allen, 2010</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1757177411429404">Pfeffer and Sutton (2006)</xref> illustrate the likely root cause of strategy execution failure through a simple exercise. A Google search of the word ‘strategy’ results in nearly 400 million hits. A search of the word ‘implementation’ yields less than half that number (170 million). The focus of interest and attention is weighted far more towards developing plans than implementing them.</p>
<p>The IPS strategy was launched during Infection Prevention 2011. An innovative, visible and interactive ‘strategy wall’ (photograph) was positioned in a central high-traffic location within the conference exhibition and the President was the first signatory on the wall, committing to make the strategy work. This provided a powerful symbol to delegates, who were encouraged to make their own commitment to the strategy by signing the wall. Throughout the course of the three day event over 100 delegates, including overseas and corporate members, signed the strategy wall a cross section of which were interviewed and filmed, the film being made into a short four minute advocacy video <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6vdCz_nAXE">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6vdCz_nAXE</ext-link>.</p>

<p>The launch was the first step in operationalising the IPS strategy as a precursor to a series of communication and awareness raising activities. Although the development process described here has used active as well as passive approaches in the pursuit of member engagement, there remains a potentially large number of members with low awareness of the strategy and how it can enable the society to achieve its vision, mission and aims. To address this, in addition to centrally driven communication from the IPS Board, action will be encouraged at every level of IPS. Individual members, members of standing committees, branches and special interest groups, the IPS board and corporate members will be urged to consider this new strategy, its aims and objectives and ask the question, ‘How does this relate to me, and what action do I/we need to take in order that the vision becomes a reality?’ The board is developing a Strategy Implementation Briefing Pack that will be made available to every member.</p>
<p>The pack explains what the IPS strategy means for everyone in the society and provides guidance in relation to the roles and responsibilities of the different members and groups. It presents a cohesive and purposeful approach to undertaking IPS activities and communications during the first year of implementation and includes checklists, template action plans, presentations and model letters to senior managers within organisations, summarising the role and value of IPS and presenting a vision that others might buy in to. In addition there will be model letters to Chief Executive Officers and the chairs and presidents of professional societies and organisations announcing the strategy and proposing how we might work together as well as to policy makers and regulators. The pack will also highlight the plan to increasingly use social media to engage with members on the process of strategy implementation.</p>
<p>The strategic objectives will form the backbone of business plans and annual programmes of work against which the society will be measured. Over time, the intention is that the IPS strategy will become embedded into the vocabulary of all members, bringing it alive and uniting every member in the pursuit of a common vision (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1757177411429404">Figure 5</xref>).</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The process of developing a new strategy for IPS has required a significant time investment by members from all areas of the society. As well as the intended gains that have emerged as a result of the process, there have been innumerable spin-off benefits as a direct result of the society looking at itself afresh through a strategic lens. These additional benefits have not been the focus of this paper, but have included a board review of the society’s organisational structure and governance including the day-to-day function of its sub-groups and this has already yielded positive outcomes and efficiencies.</p>
<p>This society, with its burgeoning membership, is acutely aware of the pitfalls of developing strategy without addressing the complexity and challenges associated with turning it into a reality. From this moment forward, through both the processes of development and execution, IPS will be a stronger society better placed than ever before to make a reality of its vision of a future where patient harm due to healthcare associated infections is eradicated. Your participation in the transition of this strategy from a series of laudable intentions to a collective and individual set of actions is <bold>absolutely crucial</bold> to achieve the social and individual benefits the Society envisages. We eagerly anticipate your support and look forward to working alongside you in making the strategy a reality.</p>
